This is the first of these "8 movies to die" collections I've seen and certainly does not make me want to see the rest ... although I have heard that at least some of them are decent. I do not know, it was not terrible, but it did not do much for me. Your basic dysfunctional family cannibis in the suburb type, my mom and dad died, the family sold the farm and moved to San Francisco (?) Where they continued to bring homeless homeless food whenever possible. The best part of this was Goth sister inflamed, who of course invites a school friend who never leaves. Anyway, of course we have a slaughterhouse in the basement and so on, and so on. This family is something like Sawyer's white bread version, they're ugly and they do bad things, but they're not souls. I have seen a lot of comments from people who liked it and I think I do not know what I missed, but it seemed very mediocre and I would not really recommend it to anyone. 4 out of 10.
