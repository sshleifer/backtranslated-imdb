This movie was a real disappointment for me. I've been a fan of Gram Parsons for a long time, and when I found out I was making a movie about him I was really out, I shot the VHS when he came out, and he was sorry for what I saw, the movie he was referring to his life, it was about his death. I thought it was going to be a Grammy Life and Music family, but they had to make a movie about his death. I'm tired of hearing about his death in books and movies, I wanted a movie about his life, not about his infamous death. I was very disappointed. I wish people to look at their lives, more than death. The only good thing about this movie was the soundtrack. This movie is a disappointment for any Gram Parsons fan.
