What made the initial fun of Killer Tomatoes was that it was made by people who did not have a budget and who were just lost for a few days ... It was something with a budget, but it was not as fun. John Astin from Adams' fame is actually an effort to be comedic, but he is backed by actors blades, cheap special effects and gags unfunny. Dr. Gangrene (Astin) escapes from a French prison and decides to place a contender on the throne of France ... Her hero, his French girlfriend and Gizmo's "Fuzzy tomato" decide to stop it ... <br /> <br /> Remember the direct nonsense of the video ...
