The beginning of this movie is great, with great sound and pleasant humor, but once the movie turns into animation, it quickly loses its appeal. One of the reasons why it was so, for me at least, was that the colors in much of the animation are too silent, with too little contrast. It does not look good, at least on the VHS. From time to time it breaks and looks great, but not often. The characters also come and go too fast. For example, I would love to have seen more about Moby Dick. When the movie begins to shoot, however, it resumes with the dragon's entrance and then the movie ends strongly. <br /> <br /> In general, not only memorable enough or capable of competing with the great animated films of the past decades.
