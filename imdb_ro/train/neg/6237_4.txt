The statistics in this movie were well researched. There is no doubt! Al Gore certainly presents his case very well and it is no wonder that this film received the praise it received. Al Gore is certainly a pretty big actor. It sounds so worried. But the actions speak louder than the words! Throughout this film, there are political noises and references to his political career sprinkled throughout the film. Jimmy Carter, unlike Al Gore, is an integrity man who not only talks about speech but also walks on foot. When Carter thought we had to conserve energy, he refused the thermostat in the White House and warmed himself by pulling a sweater. Al Gore tells us that we need to conserve energy and pretend that we create global warming while traveling on its own private plane. How much energy does its jet use and how much pollution does its jet create? How much energy does it need to heat Gore's pool behind his house? It would be nice if we could conserve electricity by using smaller appliances and making a point to stop anything that is not being used. But if we did, the electricity company would react to a 50% reduction in energy, calling it a "50% revenue loss" and recovering losses by raising rates by 50%. So, "just stopping" would not be a very good idea. This movie is a closed call to allow Big Goivernment to take control of everyone, in the name of saving the planet earth, that is.
