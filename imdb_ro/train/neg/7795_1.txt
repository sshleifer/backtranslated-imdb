First of all, I'm not a fan of the whole thing "eating meat in disgusting ways" the genre of the movie, but I'm a bad afficionado movie, so my neighbor next door said he had the worst movie ever. This one. So we start pursuing it. First - is recorded on a non-video tripod! Secondly, the thin white doctor's voice is called by a big black man! Thirdly, none of the dialogues make sense. Fourthly, zombie scenes, though unconvincing and crammed with poor makeup and tomato paste, make me believe that the director (and my neighbor near the door) need psychological help. It's fun for about 5 minutes, but it's getting old fast. It's as amateur as if you were showing a fine high school video ... with zombies. A note for anyone involved in this movie - I want 20 minutes of my life to spend watching it before falling asleep back.
