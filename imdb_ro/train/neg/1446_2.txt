The film is an extra-long story of a classic novel that fails to capture the original spirit of adventure. Patrick Swayze, the most horrific American, is interpreted as the British hero Allan Quatermain, despite the obvious of his nationality. The film continues to "Hollywood" story by changing both the plot and the characters fit more comfortably into the accepted matrix. The film manages to be predictable throughout the world, even for those unfamiliar with the story, and is affected by some extremely bad and disappointing battle sequences. On the whole, a terrible addition to the already rather bad film based on King Soloman and Allan Quatermain's legend.
