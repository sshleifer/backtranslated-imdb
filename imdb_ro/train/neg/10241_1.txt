This is an incomprehensible, horribly small, budget bust. I have no vocabulary to say how terrible, turgid, boring, confusing, and simply strange, this effort is (Hey what do you know I do ...) In a post-Apocalyptic America, some guys are meet on a beach, and slaughter and chaos - it was so incomprehensible that I could not make the head or the tail of anything. <br /> <br /> Really, as it was taken by Lampoon National, I'm totally confronted: it's really terrible. <br /> <br /> And not so bad, it's a good way of worship. <br /> <br /> It's terrible, awful, terrible, awful. Sincere. If you still do not believe me, follow it with all your intent to love, then come back here and tell me what you think. Even gerbils on acid could not hope to understand this. <br /> <br /> Avoid or even destroy better ...
