Warning: Avoid this terrible, superproduced movie ... if you have seen that you will be disappointed with the SOOOOOOOOO. Pam and Denise are grandparents now what are they doing? SO trying so hard to be young innocent and sexy, not just working AT ALL. Pam and Denise behave so horribly in this movie. Plus the script is absolutely atrocious, I can not believe that someone can come up with such strange ideas. With the development of the cinema industry, movie lovers are not as easily satisfied as those in the last century. I bet that filming from the last century will hate that too. Stay away from him. I think I'm looking at "White Chicks" in 2004 is much better than that ... make no mistake at the time, I thought it was the worst movie I've ever seen.
