This tranche of the Masters of Horror was terrible. Apparently, Mr. Carpenter has to learn one thing or two about dialogue and decent and plausible dialogue. There were times when I literally called on TV to make something happen. Perhaps he thinks he has built up suspense, but Carpenter has to recover this overdone back, his simplified musical score (or his son) and move the action a little. How many times did the girl say, "Oh, no, I can not have this baby!" and "Oh, does not come here"? Carpenter picks up much better movie items (Assault on Precinct 13 and The Thing) and throws them here as if we should recognize and appreciate his commercial style. What is missing here is real suspense and energy. It's like sleepwalking through the filming process. <br /> <br /> For better Carpenter movies, stick to the classic tried and true - thing, Halloween, and they live. For more horror episodes, check out my personal favorites: Family, Jenifer, and Dreams in the Witch House.
