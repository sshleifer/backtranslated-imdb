From time to time, in Indian cinemas, there comes a movie like Sholay, which changes how the audience perceives a good film. And day only once in a while (hopefully) we have a RGV ki Aag that breaks all standards and creates one's own. A so low standard that it can never be broken. Ram Gopal Varma manages to take a melting pot of talent and create a kind of dish so ugly and can smell it from a distance. To get a classic like Sholay and assassinate, it's absolutely unforgivable and I can not believe he almost called RGV ki Sholay. Although Sholay had a lot of folk elements in the film, the film managed to build on his plot only by defining the characters so distinctive that they lived forever. What Aag does is to take these characters and mess them up so badly, he'll need a contest to choose the worst. The element of realism is totally lacking and what the film ends by providing is a bunch of "actors" parading along in a less and seemingly unrelated plot of events. A star for this movie is a ridiculous waste of votes. his time for RGV to wake up to the reality of his failure and evoke another "different" plot that can be classified under the cinema.
