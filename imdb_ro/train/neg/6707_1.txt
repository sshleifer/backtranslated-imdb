Please look at me. Please. Please. This is the worst movie I've ever had the misfortune to follow. I consider the film an insult to my brain as well as the back that I suffered from me and I saw this movie. I have yet to see what damage caused my vision and my ability to complete the sentences. What a load of rubbish! And do not make me start with acting ... Someone please help me forget! "Weird science" - come back! Everything is forgiven ... I'm "proud" to give this movie the first 1 here at IMDb ... And I voted for hundreds of movies ... Many of them c ** p but this is so bad I can not not even to believe. Someone actually came up with the idea and thought it worthwhile to become a movie? Has anyone actually read the script and decided to produce the movie? Has anyone read the script and made an audition for him? Has anyone seen the movie and decided not to put it on a shelf to gather dust for eternity? * These * are the questions I want answers to. Not the philosophical question about the tree in the forest and well, you know ...
