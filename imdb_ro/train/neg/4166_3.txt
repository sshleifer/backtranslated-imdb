The complete loss of time .... This movie is not comedy, it's not drama, it's not romantic ... not even teenage !!! The story ... should be an overturned one ... but it's so disappointing! When the movie has a turn-over, I expect turn-over to make the movie even better (exp "Fight Club"), but this turn-over makes the movie even worse. When I look at adolescent comedy, and not I do not want to do this very often, I'm waiting for unpleasant jokes and a bustle of nudity ... Jokes are too bad and there is no nudity ... You only have one ... very good I look I have to admit ... girl, and that's it ! And he completely dressed the whole movie! Action is bad ... like the soap series ... Do not waste your time! There are pornstars with a better story and an act! (I'm sorry for my bad English)
