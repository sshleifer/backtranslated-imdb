I am a sucker for good love, but it does not qualify as good or romantic. I had a dark plot before the credits were over. With such a poor dialogue, plotting and character development, I suggest you invest half an hour elsewhere. I had to hurry and rent Serendipity for the third time to give me the wonderful taste of my mouth.
