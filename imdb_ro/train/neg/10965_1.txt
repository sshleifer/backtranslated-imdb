Actually, I watch this movie when I write this. . . If the following comments "demonstrate my lack of development as a true artistic film producer," then be so. . . <br /> <br /> . . I thought (I still think about how I look right now) like this movie. . . to say it easy, is very, very overestimated. Again, very. It looks like a really bad film student, made by a person with resources beyond extremely limited resources. . . and who did not pay too much attention to the details. I do not want to go any further and watch all the different ways that this missing film finds, but. . . good . . . I do not realize (I remember, I fully admit that perhaps I'm this idiot - not the film producer - because I did not get this "imaginative piece of genius"). . . I hired this for a whim because the reviews were very, very remarkable. . . <br /> <br /> Sheesh. . .
