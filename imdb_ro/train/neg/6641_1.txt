I've seen this movie twice. I can not believe Pintilie made a fantastic movie. I'm also a film and theater director and I know what I'm talking about. It is no longer Romania, but I see events happen at the same time as the September 11 incident. No story, no plot, nothing. No conclusion, no message, nothing profound, nothing hidden. Only empty pictures. What most Romanians do not know, this film is for French viewers, not for us. They really believe it is reality in Romania. Also for teenagers. Pintilie should stop making movies. I do not know if we can name a movie, maybe a horror :) And we wonder why we have such a picture in Europe. This was a reality, but it is not. A good friend of mine in the Brithish embassy said: "You have no idea what long the Romanians from Ceausescu came from."
