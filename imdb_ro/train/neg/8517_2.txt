Veronica Mars' biggest mystery is not one that he had to fight on the screen. Rather, the mystery is the reason why this disappointment of perennial ratings is still in the air. This week he scored a verdict for Veronica Mars: he scored 146 of 146 shows in the Big Six (soon to be Big 5). Yes, you read correctly. Veronica Mars was beaten by every show of the defunct WB and every show on UPN. He has been beaten by all Fox shows and, of course, all the shows on ABC, CBS and NBC. Now, hip hop hypers will say, but that was a re-run. But everything on television that week was pretty much a re-run! I doubt why CW would choose this disappointment of proven ratings as one of the few shows she has saved from the UPN. Obviously, something happens behind the scenes. The favors are changed and influenced. <br /> <br /> We are so sorry we are so cynical, but what else is there? The "Veronica Mars has potential" line is clearly dead now that she has two years to settle and failed to do so. Perhaps it is the influence of Joel Silver and his influence, but honestly, I am at a loss of why one would choose to spend the influence on a bad show that no audience watches. A great mystery and a very unexpected debut for CW.
