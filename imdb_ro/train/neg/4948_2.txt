I have always been excited about vintage dramas, a form of art in which the BBC excelled in the past. This presentation of "Byron" was unbelievable. Incredibly bad! The script was terrible, the inanimate act and all the unbearable characters. Apparently, Byron was "bad and dangerous to know," and set the hearts of ladies all-a-flutter. Not in this production. Here, he appeared as a blooming shabby instead of a women's fire hero and the Greek struggle for independence. Byron is said to have stood up. This portrait of man was just plain everywhere. I looked at the two-and-a-half-hour waiting for something sparking alive. He is not a fool, not even a light. It was an absolute, if not boredom, from start to finish. Since no one will ever do the Avon Bard better, I think Byron's poetry is overwhelmed, and my mind should be thrown out on the back burner, and this dramatization of her life should benefit from the same treatment. I think the BBC has lost its nous with this
