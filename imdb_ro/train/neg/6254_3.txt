A friend of mine was in distribution as an FEDS agent (a non-speaking party, as I remember). He brought it to the DVD to see it. It was "exciting," but very felt like an amateur movie. An amateur movie, well done, though. Very boring and badly written. It was probably fun to get involved and get involved, but it certainly does not deserve any broad release. Maybe in Omaha she might enjoy it, but this California girl was bored and honest with shame for my friend's involvement. If this movie made or made other movies, you should try having a really interesting story line and good actors. I'm sure it was an excellent learning tool for them. I wish them luck in the future and I hope they can improve their shooting.
