There is nothing spectacularly offensive about this movie, it's just boring. It's a typical rom-com, with an end you can see coming before seeing as much as a trailer. The crucial difference lies in the fact that classical Roma deal with their stories with spirit and lack of pretense. This movie has no claim, but it does not make sense of movement, you feel you could get up and leave at any time. The production of the film also has a debut film done fifteen years ago. I would recommend watching a classic movie, such as When Harry met Sally instead of this superficial imitation. Another big problem ... no chemistry. If you're accustomed to seeing Michael looking all cute like Vaughn in the Alias, you'll be seriously disappointed with how they made him look here.
