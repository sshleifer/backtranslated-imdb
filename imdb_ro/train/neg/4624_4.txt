This beautifully filmed and scripted episode has been disabled for two reasons. 1) Perhaps it was the morality of the 1950s, but no man who remained alone on an asteroid for years would react with such hysterical negativity to the gift of a female android. 2) She was not an android, but a woman, the beautiful Jean Marsh. The popularity of the sex doll industry over the coming decades could have followed their origins back in this episode if they did it properly. In fact, upgrading sex bots are in news as they talk. <br /> <br /> Robots were not new to movies or television when this episode was made so that they could at least act as one. Her flesh would then add a scary element. Instead, it becomes a little love story about two people on a distant star. The Twilight Zone always stretches imagination and credulity. Normally, nobody cared about them. But this episode seemed to be hampered by a Calvinist morality, avoiding what masturbating with a car or lack of carelessness meant.
