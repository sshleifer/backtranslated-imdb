This film has a very difficult premise, even by the standards of this genre. We are pleased to accept not only that a recorded recording can bring a dead dead back to life, but that the records also contain hidden messages targeting SPECIFIC to a child, when the singer had no connection with the boy when he was alive and of course a way to know in the hands of which the recording would be. Anyway, the movie is fun for a while, but eventually supreme supreme holiness and futility. If they were really trying to create a new Freddy-like fear icon, they were far away: the villain here has no personality, no motivation, no variety. (* 1/2)
