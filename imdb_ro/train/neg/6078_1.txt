I rarely commented on movies, but I read the other comments and I can not believe there are people who applaud this celluloid garbage. I know there are some people who have their own agenda, but they leave them for merit; the bad action, the bad blow and the story felt the director did it as he walked along. I will not focus on the sexual aspect of the film involving young children, because filmmakers clearly knew what they wanted and what their audience wanted. All I can say is that it's a terrible movie, the content is poor and offensive, the production is amateur and I'm glad they could not make a movie like this from a legal point of view
