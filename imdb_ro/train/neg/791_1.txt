Imagine the scene where a lot of screenwriters sit around a table and say: "Let a black woman approach a public audience (and black) on the street and ask him if he is black, then leave" . The other writers fall to laugh hysterically until someone suggests they repeat it in each episode. More laughter. Now if you think the premise is fun and the show contains many such situations, you will enjoy this show. For the rest, use your cartridge and find something more fun, such as painting dry paint. Those who have written brilliant reports about this show should either go out or be forced to watch television shows that are really funny. Another example of humor in the show, a girl tries to get out of pay at a supermarket checkout trying to hypnotize the cashier. Marginal funny for the first time, but why do we always repeat it in different shows with different cashiers? I could give other examples, but they could be treated as spoilers, telling why this comedy is not funny at all.
