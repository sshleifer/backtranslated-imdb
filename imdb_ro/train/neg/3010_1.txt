holy sh * t this was terrible god. I stayed in the theater for an hour and ten minutes, and I thought I would take my eyes off the Oedipus Rex Mansion. Dear God. this film deserves no credit more than anything made by a middle school movie buddy. save your money, this movie can not offer you anything. if you do not enjoy the sides and sleep in the cinemas. you know, h3ll, bring your girlfriend and do your interesting things. you will be the only one anyway. F @ ck this slide show. <br /> <br /> I will be warned. I recommend you do not look at this. <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm pretty good. <br /> <br /> enjoy this day? <br /> <br /> I am. <br /> <br /> This commentary was a hundred times more fun than pretending to watch the movie everyday. that's sad.
