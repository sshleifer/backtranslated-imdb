I could not wait to receive the DVD after I heard so much about the movie. What a disappointment! It has become one of the most confusing movies I've ever seen. So many characters have been introduced, some of them similar to others, that it has become impossible to follow the story line. I could not understand how George Clooney received a film award because he was not involved too much, at least in the first half of the film. My wife and I gave up after about an hour of misery and I stopped the DVD. He might have thought of a quick repeat to see if the end was better, but after so much confusion he decided that the chances of improvement were thin. A colleague told me that much of the movie "comes together" in the last minute or less. I'm glad I did not lose another hour, waiting. I gave the DVD the next day.
