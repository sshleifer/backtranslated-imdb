The film is based on a novel of the 1950s authentic journalist Colin McInnes wrote a set of three "Romanian Romanian" "Absolute Beginners", "City of Spades" and "Mr. Love and Justice". I read all three. The first two are excellent. Last perhaps an experiment that did not come out. But McInnes's work is highly appreciated; and rightly so. This music is the nightmare of the last novel of the novel - to see that the fruits of his mind were transformed into a one-dimensional excuse of a film that says that captures the spirit of London in 1950 and does nothing of the sort. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Colin McInnes was not alive to witness.
