As for cinema, this movie was good enough for the mid-1950s. There were several times that the light was too warm, but the fires were generally in the frame and remained in the fire. The actress was above average for a poor budget, but the direction was horrific. Several scenes were drawn too much in an attempt to have suspense, and the effects were non-existent. Attack of the pond skull should have been completely eliminated from the final cut, and every attempt to bring life to the skull was evident through the sticks and strings. I also could not believe that the budget did not allow them to supply the house so that they continued to refer to those who were traveling and that all things in stock should be soon. Honestly ... it would have been more fun if it were a worse movie. It was not bad enough to be a "good-bye" movie, but it was not good enough to be "good" either. Get the MST3K ... it's more fun.
