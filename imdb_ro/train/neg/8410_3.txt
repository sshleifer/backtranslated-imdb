This movie is a flash and not a soul. The actors have put a lot of passions in numbers, but these numbers did not connect to the movie and felt like independent music videos. And no effort has been made to make the numbers ring like it's happening right in front of you, every one sounds like it comes from a workshop, essentially suing all the life in the songs. Outside the scene, the performances were all boring and unfulfilled, especially Hudson, who essentially plays the same black, "strong" woman (stubborn and selfish) that I saw before. There was absolutely no depth of her character, nor of the other female leaders. Although I think the movie wants to believe that Hudson's character is facing weight because of his weight, it's even his own refusal to do what's best for the team that's landing in trouble making the end of the totally irrelevant movie. The Hudson Academy Award is a joke, there was no justification. When she sang, she made emotion (although it was often mistaken, but that was the writer / director's fault), but when she acted, she did nothing to highlight a character already subscribed. Eddie Murphy's character is the only one with a bow, and he did a good job, but he's still not Oscar worthy. The only actor who actually brought something to the film was Danny Glover, who took a small, relatively insignificant character and did something real of it. There is nothing here to sink your teeth, no drama or heart, or even laugh. Placing musical numbers was so serious that sometimes the film almost seemed to have fun with the musicians instead of being one; the number Hudson is struggling with the other girls is so long if it was more to be able to pass for a Guy guy. The film has no idea what it is and I felt insulted in the last few minutes. It's a big waste of time and it's really the worst movie I've seen in '06, and nothing in the last year was really starboard for the first time.
