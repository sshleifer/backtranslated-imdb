Since the Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon has come along, many have been discussed about a revival of the Hong Kong film industry. You do not think so. People who are now making films in HK give a new meaning to the word crass. Running 2 is a perfect example. Ekin Cheng is drawing lots here, but he spends most of the movie just laughing idiot and flipping a coin. He returns the currency again and again and again. Why? Who knows? Sean Lau plays a policeman following him after the big boy. But once again: who knows why? There is a beautiful actress in the female management who manages a kind of company and has to pay a ransom or something like that, but it seems she would rather be in a spa or shopping center than in front of a room . Nothing makes sense. There is no action. There is no sex. There is no comedy. Everything is a name: Ekin Cheng. And you know what? Who cares?
