Where to start? How about the erroneous synopsis: "X-Men Origins: Wolverine tells the story of Wolverine's violent and romantic epic past, its complex relationship with Victor Creed, and the Weapon X bitter program." <br /> <br /> His relationship with Creed is so glossy that it's hard to understand how it's connected We're thrown from a point in the opening scene that shows them like kids on the run, to an assortment of war scenes that they fought throughout their long life and, ultimately, to the present, where they are part of a hardcore governmental assassin team. There is nothing to show their relationship as brothers at all.Nothing is set up to believe it is authentic or even loving. <br /> <br /> The romantic element of the movie between Silverfox and Wolverine has been forced and steep.We are thrown into a story so fast that it's over before it's over, and can block one eye. Having introduced the character, SILVERFOX killed about fifteen minutes later. We've been wondering why we ought to care about that. Who was she anyway? For an essential element of this avenged story, romance is surprisingly unexplored. It was rushed in simply because it was necessary. Oddly enough, when Wolverine finds that his love is dead, he leaves it in the forest to rot while he's going to find Sabertooth. Being romantic that he is this was the character for him yet needed to serve the plot in pulling from a very predictable surprise. Regarding the X weapons program, let's just say that after the painful crippling procedure Wolverine is in operation. Eventually he gets to the house of a convenient, old, yet overwhelming couple. Surprisingly, Ma and Pa Kent are not alarmed when they find an empty man in the barn. No wonder what fate awaits them? In previous films and comic books, the main reason why Wolverine's amnesia partly affected him that he was said to have been badly vicious and cold blood. Knowing this was the case ... did he really want to remember such horrors or keep them hidden and continue his more positive lifestyle today to fight the world's villains with his colleagues? <br /> <br /> As suggested in X2: X-Men United, when Stryker renounces some of his secrets, it is said that Wolverine would be disturbed if he knew about the bad work they had done together . This movie sets the team pretty well, but they do not do much of anything. No disturbing violence, no relentless action, but only harasses some locals in foreign countries for ten or fifteen minutes on the screen. <br /> <br /> It seems that Wolverine was not a bad man at all under Stryker. Instead, he constantly tries to put a leash on his brother, Sabertooth, who, as a consequence, was the violent agent we all believed Wolverine. Eventually he just leaves it all together. No duality conflict here at all. <br /> <br /> Idiot REMOVING this character conflict of good and evil DULLED the huge story. They could also have given him rubber claws. There were a lot of other errors in this movie that contradicted the X-Men trilogy, including the introduction of one of the worst Deus Ex Machinas that ever hit a script. <br /> <br /> Magic bullets to clear the memory. <br /> <br /> Indeed, these are the only things to bring down Wolverine. However, this was forgotten when the agent after the agent was sent to bring him down with bullets and bombs that certainly would not work with him at all. Another problem with this movie is that he tried to focus on Wolverine while throwing a ton of other mutants who had done nothing at all. Interesting characters were simple dressing and doing nothing for the story. Most have been in the movie for 5-10 minutes max and yet you are finding yourself wishing to see more of them and less Wolverine. Fred Dukes (Blob version, but not the comic version) can fist launched a rocket rocket with little to no physical injury to him at all, but a simple headbutt from Noggin Metal Wolverines is enough to dare him? The Cyclops optical beams (which instead of being compulsive force are now closer to the lasers) can burn through buildings, but when fired directly at Sabertooth, he simply breaks it into the ground without ever damaging his clothes. Does Satan Adamantium cover anyone? Gambit (defying gravity), instead of using his signature cards, is transformed into a kind of crazy acrobat. In a poorly scaled scene, he is beaten in a state of unconsciousness by Wolverine ... then quite amazing a few minutes later he is on a roof that goes to Wolverine. How he regained consciousness, ran a few blocks, climbed into a building, then ran back to Wolverine and Sabertooth in the midst of a scratch match is a mystery to be explained. Some have apologized for the weakness of the film, claiming it was made of a comic strip, and should therefore be weak in character and hard on the flash. The idea that this movie is a comic strip is thin and superficial because it is incorrect. The source material of the comic book, Wolverine's real origin ... is a story that deserves to bring on the screen. It does not cover the past with sugar and does not treat the reader as CGI bastards. It's a well-done story and, though revisited and readjust over time, began with WEAPON X by Barry Windsor-Smith. A much more intense and exciting story. This FOX movie should be seriously forgotten. <br /> <br /> Whoever has the magic weapon? <br /> <br /> 4/10
