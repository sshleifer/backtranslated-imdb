1999 will descend into history as the year when the film critic leads the audience misleadingly. First they sent us to EYE AWARENESS. Then they improved the BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and now MAGNOLIA, which is by far the worst film of the year. What is it about? Who knows this. It is full of self-indulgence and badly charged. I always enjoyed staying and looking at credits, but when this was over I could not get out of the cinema pretty quickly. Most of the audience that participated in the show I was, felt almost the same way. Data controversy with each other as well as with foreigners. It's a nasty and ugly movie that will make you feel ugly and ugly.
