Attractive attractions for "Order" make it look like a decent horror mystery / thriller, but what we get is a plot that has the potential to be excellent, all thrown together to form a bunch of garbage. <br /> <br /> First, the entire movie is made up of terrible dialogue and terrible special effects of God. The actor was not why he was proud, but Keath Ledger (I think I wrote this right) saved the movie in this category. For God's sake: DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!
