I'm sorry, I had great hopes for this movie. Unfortunately, it was too long, too thin and too weak to keep my attention. When I realized the whole movie was really about an older guy who revived his dream, I felt cheated. Of course it could have been a device that would bring us into something deeper, more significant. So do not buy a big drink or run into the rest room. My children do not enjoy that either. Well.
