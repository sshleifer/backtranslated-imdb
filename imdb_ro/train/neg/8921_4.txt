The premise of an African-American female gentleman in the modern and tangled city was inspired, but nothing else in this movie is. Here, Ms. Scrooge is a poor banker who takes advantage of employees and customers in the poor and black neighborhood where she lives. There is no doubt about the good intentions of the people involved. Part of the problem is that the roots of the story do not translate well into the urban environment of this movie, and the script fails to make the update. Also, the constant message of sharing and dedication is repeated so endlessly, the audience becomes tired of it long before the film reaches its familiar end. This is a message movie that does not know when to quit. In the lead role, talented Cicely Tyson offers extremely comfortable performance, and sometimes the lines are hard to understand. The novel, Charles Dickens, has been adapted so many times, is a struggle to adapt it in a way that makes it fresh and relevant, despite its very relevant message.
