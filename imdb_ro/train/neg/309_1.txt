Hello. I'm Paul Raddick, a WTAF panic attack, Channel 29 in Philadelphia. Let me tell you about this terrible film that contributed to Adam Sandler's film career, but it was digitized after a short period of time. Go overboard is an aspiring comedian played by Sandler who gets a job on a cruise ship and fails ... or so I thought. Sandler meets kids that resemble Part 1 and Rebound World History. The children had to be hired, but in fact they were executed by Sawtooth, the worst cannibal the world has ever known. Adam Sandler did bad in Going Overboard, but he did better in Big Daddy, Billy Madison and Jen Leone's 50 First Dates. Man, Drew Barrymore was a hot chicken. Spanglish is hot red, Going Overboard is not Dooley squat! The end of the file.
