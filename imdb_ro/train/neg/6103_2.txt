Frankly, I am surprised by the positive votes that this film has received. The film just shoots along its 81-minute life, and the audience has to suffer all the way. In fact, there are some positive moments in this movie; Charlie Spradling offers decent performance. She has a rather pathetic dialogue and treats her pretty well. Scott Valentine (Merrideth's friend in family relationships), on the other hand, is a cute watch. I think the climax of his performance assists the guy who puts her on the beach wearing tiger chums ... give me a break. Also, Valentine gives us a bad and pathetic portrait of a one-day vampire (to see a more convincing broadcast of the vampire who suffers, see Denice Duff in "Bloodstorm: Subspecies 4"). The film moves so slowly and is just dotted with Charlie Spradling's dance scenes and, to be honest. This movie can be honestly recommended only to the dead heavy fans of Charlie Spradling (who are, and we still had a hard time watching!).
