I'm a nice guy and I like to think of myself as a kind of tolerance. And I suppose I mean I'm trying to consider a movie in the context of the genre in which she lives. If nothing else saves me from the feeling that I should say very ugly things about people or movies that I do not like to do. The plot of this was obvious, production is very low and sets, umm, simplistic. The actor grew from time to time in "good for a high school play". My feeling was that it was filmed someday - please tell me it was. Worst of all, sex, while reasonably quite banal, was hampered, at least in my "sound-over" copy, which was not consistent with the action (climax and cries while lying on a bed wandering a bra). There was certainly no "edge" to it - nothing special or exciting, with surprisingly rapid cuts. My vote is a "1" then, with the following summary statement: It would have been better if the club stripping stripping material had been extended and the rest of the film was condensed.
