Tony Scott has never been a very good director, but every film he made after "Crimson Tide" seems to bring him one step closer to being the worst thing unthinkable today (Michael Bay may fall into the same category, stupid, delusional episodes have fun at a certain perverse level). And, as with other Hollywood biopsies ("De-Lovely" and "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"), chronicling the lives of pretentious wizards, overrated or simply by a core of a society that thrives succulently Behind the scene details, "Domino" is a movie that begins with a small potential, and lines that infinitesimal amount before the mark of sixty minutes. With an already extended 128-minute running time, the movie feels twice as much, and spending time with characters with this obnoxious superficial and forgetful (as opposed to the superior attraction rules, Scott's attempts to iron the process ironically through Domino, the feeling of self-conscious-rich-girl just draws attention to the cluelessness of the film) becomes an act that only masochists can find pleasing. The story? (Keira Knightley, in a ersatz-badass superficial performance as if she looks gorgeous) is sick of the superficial lifestyle of the rich and famous Los Angeles and admits bounty hunters Mickey Rourke and Edgar Ramirez to learn a trade more interesting; along the way, there are double-crosses, fireworks, media attention (courtesy of Christopher Walken, calling in his sleazebag brand), and in love with romance. Scott cuts the film together in segments that rarely last for more than a few seconds, turning the film into a neon nightmare that is very unpleasant to watch - if Scott had the opportunity to outline a picture or somehow distort it, he will; but all the stylistic overload of this type of haircut overwhelms what little plot, characterization and suspense has the movie (let's say nothing to him, ehm, the value of "entertainment"). Most of the characters are either scornful or stereotypical, often both (notice the unbearable segment of a few minutes when an African American introduces a new list of racial categories on "Jerry Springer") and I woke up wishing you get the end "queues" from the currency of our protagonist. "Domino" is a total and endless garbage - no matter what interest Scott wanted to inspire in his audience, it is lost in a sea of ​​pre-tensioning neon that causes migraines a few minutes in.
