Oh my dear! Rarely has a horror movie bored with me, or made me laugh as much as this one. After a lively beginning, with an intriguing concern, he descends into no more than a weak blow, with supernatural and sexual assumptions. Usually the excellent Alice Krige is scattered in this case, and the overturning of the plot is ridiculous. It only bothers you if you are really desperate. Rating: 3/10.
