John Carradine, John Irlanda and Faith Domergue, who, as players, saw better days in better movies, gathered for this Grade G horror movie about life imitating art in a mysterious mansion. last two decades of his career, he appeared in a theory, it was better to continue to work no matter what you did to get these salaries. With that magnificent sonorous voice, Carradine always had a great demand for horror images and man did not discriminate at least in what he had come up with. Play the role of a caregiver of an old Gothic mansion that filmmaker John Ireland rented for the latest film's slasher film. He even has a cemetery, but a missing occupant. Faith Domergue is the Irish star, and Carole Wells is the young one. In the last twenty minutes, most of the towers are dead, not already dead. The script is so incoherent that I'm still trying to figure it out. I will not waste any gray matter on it.
