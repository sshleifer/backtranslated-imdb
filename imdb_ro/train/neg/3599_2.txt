Umi .. I was quite surprised that someone actually gave this movie great notes. Lori copes ... Tori Spelling is not a great actress .. and this film just proves her "talents". The story of the film was poor ... I bet the enemy who came up with this concept was a perverse. If there's a good thing about this movie, I'd say Tommy Chong's daughter, just because she's his daughter ... and then there's that male-run Soap-Opera-ish who has a decent look makes it somewhat attractive, but stops helping his dramatic skills. Why IMDb requires at least 10 lines? How many ways can you simply say "This movie sucks"?
