The previous comment made me write this. It is said that the Muslims are blond and the Serbs are dark (because our blood is mixed). This comment only says that this opinion can be made by racist. Look, the race is nothing. I'm color blind. I look like Pierce Brosnan but I'm not Irish. So, I could add that I am not 100% Serbian, that I have blood in my blood of an Austrian and Croat in me, but what is the point. Are I dark, half a race? Anyone who uses racial prejudices with so bad intentions as Lantos (producer and director is racist for me.) Karadzic, Izetbegovich, Milosevic, Tudjman are all monsters and blame them for destroying my life, my family, my country, Yugoslavia. I am proud of being a Serb and proud of my cousins, Austrians, Croats, Muslims, Hungarians, Arabs (yes, I am from Serbia and I have a multiethnic family). shows the suffering of the Serbs or Croats in Sarayevo, the terrible terror of street gangs, Muslim extremism. I add, I kneel and pray for all the innocent sisters and the Muslim, Catholic or Orthodox brothers killed in this war. Helps Lantos fill his pockets with more enemies, all right!
