Normally, I'm a pretty generous critic, but for this movie I have to say it was incredibly bad. I am amazed at how many positive reviews seem to be. There were some wonderful photos, but it's too bad they were wasted on this sink of a movie. Perhaps it would have worked if "Daggers" was just an action action and not a love story, but unfortunately the movie is built around an empty triangle of love. There is no chemistry between any of the couples, whatever exists between Me and her men seems to be more lust than love, and for the most part the dialogue is stupid. This may be just a translation problem, but the frequent use of the word flirt reminded me in particular of the eighth grade, not the head over the heels, together forever, meritous - for love; I also felt that I was beaten up with the metaphor of the wind. The public is given very little about the characters they really care about, and therefore a very low emotional investment in the film as a whole. I wanted a remote to advance forward, I was slumped into my chair ready to snore, but especially I cringed a lot. <br /> <br /> ******* spoiler ***** <br /> <br /> Now the icing on the cake. Or rather, adding insult to injury. The end was really one of the most horrible and ridiculous I've ever seen. Boys struggle with the deer, screaming and shouting at each other. Oh, and then it starts snowing. Randomly. Oh, and then Mei (dagger in the heart) suddenly emerges from the weeds. Then he throws a dagger that seems to take about 5 minutes to reach his destination, even slowing down the midscreen to hit a small drop of blood. Wow, cool. Well, then Mei dies in the end, I think he threw the dagger that was put in his chest and blew to death. Jin sings, sighs, keeps his body close, the screen becomes empty. Me and the people around me chicculate me. It's not a good sign. Amazingly visual, but ultimately a failure.
