I just saw this movie on a local TV station ("Big Chuck and Little John" from TV8 in Cleveland, Ohio). I've never heard of this movie and I've decided to see it. I know he has no treasure that may even come to help me describe how bad this movie really is. The scenario is terrible. The action, except one of the two exceptions, is useless, because there is nothing in this material that deserves a real effort. It looks like a bunch of small ideas left from different writing sessions, where they are thrown into a blender. It's not just funny. The "parody" aspect is tense at best. Some references are almost outdated (even at release). No wonder I never heard of it, it's really bad, worse than any live night Saturday, MAD TV or even the color In Living put on the worst days. If you watch it on TV, it's an excellent example of not making a movie. Whatever you do, do not lose a center. Adam
