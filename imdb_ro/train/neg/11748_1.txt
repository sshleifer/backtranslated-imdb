This movie must be one of the worst I've ever seen on DVD! The story line might have clicked if the film had more financiers and writers who would cut the nonsense and sick scenes that I greatly warn parents about ... But the story line is like a weak cannon. If there was such a thing as a road to the film maker - it would have been out of it. He reminded me of many of the fast movies that were released in the 1960s, writing and filming. <br /> <br /> The only sensible character in the whole movie was the bartender and the beaver. The rest of the film could easily have been made by children in the gymnasium. I give this movie a rating of 1 because it is really terrible and left my whole family with a feeling of being deceived. My advice - Do not look!
