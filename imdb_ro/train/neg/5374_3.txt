CRIMES RIVERS is one of the most scattered, all over, the misery I've ever seen coming from France. There is nothing worse than a French production that tries to take out Hollywood movies and the CR is a perfect example of such a horror / action / amateur film. I almost stopped halfway, because I knew it would mean nothing but the French boys trying to show up. The movie starts with promising, like a kind of expansive horror movie, but it quickly changes genres, from horror to action, to x file type, to make me a friend, that finally CR is all and none of them . It's so full of clich√©s that at one point I thought it was all a comedy. The painful dialogue and those silent pauses, with discoloration and fading at the right moments of exposure, made me stir up. I thought only Hollywood movies were using this noise technique. The scene of pursuit, with Vincent Cassel running after the murderer, is so over-straightened and overcome that it's almost a thing of beauty. The climax of the mountain, with the bad revelation about the killer (s) with Cassel and Reno playing "friends" like Nolte and Murphy in 48 HRS, derailed completely what little credibility he had until then. It's hard to believe that director CRIMSON RIVERS has also directed GOTHIKA, who, though having problems, is not even close to the terribleness of this overwhelmed and confused film.
