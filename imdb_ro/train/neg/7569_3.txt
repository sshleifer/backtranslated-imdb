It matches the certainty of Axis and Allies playing espionage across North Africa and the rest of the world. It's not the best of the movies, but certainly not the worst of the previously described budget films in the War Classics compilation. <br /> <br /> Duncan "Cisco Kid" Renaldo was actually really good in one of his first feature films. I really liked the performance of Harry Parke (credited as Parkyarkarkus). Why he never got older roles is beyond me. He played the perfect role of friend / partner and saved the movie ... imho. As has been said, this movie is part of a Superbox-Mart budget package called War Classics. Eight films for eight dollars, including other movies that have never heard of films that have decent stars trying to pay bills. This scenario is ... well, not so hot. Editing and cinema is ... worse. If you can bypass all these things and want to see the future of Cisco Kid and a great partner who, unfortunately, has not really achieved its potential, you can certainly lift it! Otherwise, there are other WW2 movies to watch. <br /> <br /> -Thunderossa.
