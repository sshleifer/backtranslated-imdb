This film can be judged from three points of view: as history, as a profile of Amin, as a fictional thriller. <br /> <br /> It fails as history, mentions the passing of the blow that cast Obote, expulsion of the Asians, and has the Entebbe hi-jack background, but not in a coherent timeframe. <br /> <br /> As a profile of Amin, it could have been interesting because Forest Whitaker is incredibly good, and if it was a better movie, he would get an Oscar. (He obtained - which proves that the Oscar voters do not watch the movies they vote for). It ignores the relevant historical episodes in the novel that observed Amen and Ugandan history from the medical point of view. It tells instead the fictitious story of the Scottish doctor and his love life from the point of view of Amen. But the story said it was the only incident that Amin probably was innocent. <br /> <br /> Like a fictional thriller, there is no plot to keep it together. The beginning is tilted - it requires kinematic liberties with the novel, but sets the story. The character of the doctor is well defined, but becomes lost in the second half of the film that suffers as a result. Why does the doctor decide to stay in Kampala is explained stupidly - seduced power? Why he gets friends with no one is not strange. The character of the boyfriend in the novel was lost because the Scottish has the adventure instead of the black doctor - a ridiculous enthusiasm that does not seem to be even credible, but allows the filmmakers to show Amin's ferocity close to hand. The man called "Horse" at the end is wasteful. Finally, in 1971, Uganda headed to the left, not quite, the license plates were three letters and two or three numbers - and where are the Equator tines? <br /> <br /> In short - if you have never heard of Amin, you might want to spend two hours watching this movie to appreciate Forest Whitaker's action, but the last hour will make you confused. If you know Uganda or you read the book - you do not see the movie - it will just depress you. And if you want to know why the doctor was so bad, it was not.
