This is Western action. James Steart leads a star in the scenic northwest, shot in splendor. The decor and the costumes are great. There are actions and adventures. Stewart plays a rich eagle man who struggles with a shuddering government in the old Nostwest. The main disadvantage is the stereotypical cynic that Hollywood always turns into a hero. Even when this movie was made, the cynic was the stereotype hero, and Stewart's portrait really has some rescue graces. He is good with his two partners, which gives him an extra dimension of credibility and fidelity. However, he is so piggy about anyone else, it's hard to take care of him or accept it. It looks very much like western spaghetti characters (cut not so badly). However, minor characters are pretty nice. Walter Brennan, Royal Dano, Harry Morgan and others do that.
