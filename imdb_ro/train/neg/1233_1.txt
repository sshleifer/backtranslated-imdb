Oh God. the idea that this movie is a thriller is an absolute joke to me. besides the fact that it seems to be written by a 5 year old child. plot, acting and even the props and filming of this film were all beyond shame. Usually, I'm not critical about any movie, because each person has his own style. But this movie was probably the worst movie I saw in 2008. I can honestly believe this movie is unknown and I think it should stay that way because movies like these make the thriller a joke . /> <br /> I advise anyone who is a fan of thriller movies, or even simply movies to stay away from it.
