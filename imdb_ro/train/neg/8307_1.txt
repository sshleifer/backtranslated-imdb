This show is unbelievable in this. . . what it represents and what it focuses and. . . words can not describe how insane the ET is. They will report everything. If a celebrity is even indirectly indirectly connected to the story, the ET will report about it. If a poop dog in Tom Cruise's yard will report on it. If a celebrity dies. . . they will talk about it for weeks to the point where envy public that celebrity. If a celebrity is judged. . . ET will report it for MONDAYS at the end. There is no end to what this show will look like, and no time to dictate how long they will focus on a story. Is it even legitimate to report? The reports are so annoying, embarrassing, with embarrassing voices and ends with a useless pause to convey a sense of importance. I can not watch this show without questioning the existence of humanity. ET is a major reason for avoiding pre-night performances in general. I regret that IMDb can only allow a minimum rating of 1 star and not zero or even negative. For this show deserves -10 Stars.
