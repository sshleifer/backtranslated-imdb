This is a review of the movie "Freddy Mercury The Stunned Story," Chicago Theater Int. Film Festival, 2007 A most aesthetic biographical documentary, uninspired and the most exhausting I've ever seen. If the movie I saw in a movie was originally launched on television, I would have asked manufacturers and distributors not to fool the audience by paying with fake promise of documentary cinematic documentary. Even as a documentary made for television, sentimental piano solos accompanying interviewees who face flower arrangements in hotel halls and the pompous, pseudo-literary story sounded more than an infamous sleepwalking. The only redeeming aspects of this "Freddy Mercury Story" - or, uhm, was "The Stupid Story of Princess Diana" are Freddy Mercury's and Queen's concerts, original video and television recordings. Interviews with interviews with irrelevant eyewitnesses such as "He was a free spirit" (indeed ... I thought Freddy Mercury was a companion ...), undermines Freddy's testimonies of Brian May or Montserrat Caballe, and affectional light in Mercury's complex life and character. And ... what happens to the boarding school segments like Harry Potter? How was the first girl interview ("... now working in a travel agency") and members of the Freddy school band contribute to what I really want to know about Mercury? Important milestones of his personal life, his sexuality, style and artistic growth, the queen, the band remain unexplored. These directors do not pose a single provocative question nor engage in the independent or visionary research of their subject, instead offering a boring coin of polite and clean reviews about an enigmatic and brilliant rock legend that does not deserve to remind you of this biography of the Channel History that your grandparents can do on a Sunday night.
