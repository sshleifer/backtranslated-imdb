Where was her criticism of both democratic and republican administrations? After all, he served for 17+ years in a governing body, where his influence was indefinite. Oh, I forgot about the 8 years of being second in the leadership of the most powerful nation on earth. The film is happy to show pictures of a young Senator Gore who asks why a NASA scientist has been forced to change a conclusion in his scientific work but fails to ask Clinton / Gore's complicity in global warming. Probably too close to an election year, or maybe it would affect Hillary's chances in '08. Anyway, he would be a political coward and a party man at the bitter end. He does not offer any criticism of consumerism, no criticism of capitalism, no way to be the history of industrial development that has led us so far. Lastly, this movie was much more about Mr. Gore himself than about any real problems our environment is facing. Mr. Gore, if you really want to make a campaign movie - shorten it and tell her what it really is.
