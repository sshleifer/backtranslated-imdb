This show is just annoying! I'm sorry for the actors to try to be funny (especially Bob Saget), the piece of laughter tries to hide the sad jokes and the song "Awwww" comes in the most unnecessary moments. Dramatic children are no exception, especially Olsen twins. Also, this show is the cliché city. If you should look at the word "cliché", read the "Full House". Each story line has a "lesson of life" that needs to be learned at the end. A sappy speech does everything better and even has the ability to make the most bratty child have a sudden achievement of GASP goodness too bad, this would not be possible in real life. I do not know how anyone could watch this show without taking care of character behavior or racing. I find myself shouting on TV saying, "NONE IS FUNNY / SAD / CUT" If life were like that, the world would fall apart.
