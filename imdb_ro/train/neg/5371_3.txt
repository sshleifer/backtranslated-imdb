This movie was a disappointment. After the very slow, very intense (and quite harsh) start, the movie starts to lose it. Too much plot leaves too little time to explain, and coming out of the theater I was wondering what it was about. The characters remain superficial, the story is not at all convincing, most of it is a matter of déja vù without any hints of parody and there are some very brown parts ... Like the young policeman has to make a body. Of course it's night And it rains And it's gotta make it alone ... yawn! Or the manifestation of evil being "Nazis" plus "genetic manipulation" ... Wow, that's really original. There are some nice bits, though, like the fistfight scene, mountain views and some gags (running), but (though Reno and Vincent Cassel do what they can), this is definitely not worth it. (3 out of 10)
