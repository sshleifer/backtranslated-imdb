This film was made by a bunch of white boys who went to school together. Well, there is nothing wrong with that, except that it was made by a bunch of white boys who went to school together. 90% of the cast are white men of the same age. It's almost like seeing a bunch of boys at the camp of the boys who turned the room themselves. The film has no plot. Simply repeat the same blood bath action after a blood bath. There are some fun and comic bits. But they do not redeem flat monotony. Cartoon graphical scenes are used to cover things that obviously go beyond their budget or resources to do, and they did not do that well. All that can not be done with the white boys running on the beach covered with blood is made with cheap animation. I went to see this movie after I saw the trailer, which makes it look like a Tarrentino piece. Trailer scenes are just as good as they are. The rest of it repeats the same sort of trivial and novel comedy. It works sometimes, but it becomes boring after the same things come to you all the time. It's more like a series of Satuday Night Live scenes than a movie. It's kind of a comedy that hit her there. I can see where the story idea is interesting. But in this post-apocalyptic film America is the same as Medevil England. In fact, Wheatlry says the story ideas came from that time. He intends to make part 2. I think he thinks he's Tarrentino or can do a parody thing. At the opening in LA, Wheatley said he would bring back almost the same cast in the second. He was asked if he could consider a more diverse distribution in the next one, to which he responded, well, sure.
