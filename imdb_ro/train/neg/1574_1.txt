There is no story! The land is hopeless! A movie based on a car with a blocked accelerator without brakes and an automatic transmission lever can not be good! I would have stopped this car within a minute, whether I was in a car or in a police car, constantly following it. I'm sorry for the actors who needed to get along with such a poor scenario. Some scenes where a similarity to the action has been dramatized and how far you can actually get. In addition, there were a lot of bumps, for example, the hood of the escaping machine, which was launched at 100 mph. In the beginning, he just squeezed over the windshield, as he did, but then, afterwards, exploded. The car was later in the movie noticed with the hood on .... This movie was nothing but annoying, stay away from it!
