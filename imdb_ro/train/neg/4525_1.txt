Some beautiful landscapes, but the story itself - where a self-proclaimed egiptologist (Lesley-Anne Down) visits Egypt and, during the arrival of Egyptian things, in the most non-Egyptological ways (for example, flash photography in graves, manipulation the old parchment, etc.) reveals a war on the black chest and, in a way (within two days, no less!) becomes the epicenter of the war, it is more embarrassed than any enigma that the Sphinx ever put it. Down is simply terrifying while the visiting British school (that knows absolutely nothing about the culture of Egypt and even less about antiquities is the writers' mistake, certainly, but it is annoying because everything comes out of its own fault) and the other distributors , including Sir John Gielgud and Frank Langella, appear to be totally confusing as I am. In short, not what you would expect from Schaffner (Planet of the Apes, Patton) and co. It's worth watching for a courageous scene in which Down runs against all male scholars, accusing her of failing as an academician for her, while bathing under the easiest light in Hollywood may gather. At first, he spends the next hour of the movie, shouting and harassing and running into the arms of any guy he can find. Wow, talks about your performance irony! * Note for Egyptologists who should: take a year or two of Arabic in Grade School. It will really help you in the long term ...
