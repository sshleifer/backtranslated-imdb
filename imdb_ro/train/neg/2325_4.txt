the first scanners did not turn out to be a great movie, but at least it was original. There is no novelty about it. The actor is worse, in my opinion, the story is slower and nothing special. such as dialog.and special effects are no better than in the original.This film is inferior to the one in all ways. The only thing different about him is that he is loud and chaotic at times. do not make a good movie. If they did something better with the story and made it interesting, this could have been a decent film. And in fact, she could not get through with it without passing through her quickly. to me, this is a forgotten movie, and not much more. However, there are worse movies. It's in a generous mood, I'll give Scanners 2 a 4/10.
