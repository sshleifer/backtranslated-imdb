"Washington Square" is a flat, shabby adaptation of the short novel by Henry James. Indeed, the novel is very good, but far from James's masterpiece. Moreover, his simple and eventual story seems inappropriate to make it in a movie (though William Wyler, with The Heiress, gave in 1949 a beautiful version of the novel). <br /> <br /> However, the film completely betrays the spirit of this great American writer's work. In the novel, heroine Catherine is shy, not very attractive and somewhat clumsy, but she is still a smart and intelligent young woman and not as naive as she seems. Her attack on her father is worthy and respectful, with no morbid parts in her. Almost three quarters of the film, Catherine (Jennifer Jason Leigh) just seems to be mentally retarded, poor. In the last quarter, she suddenly (and incredibly) becomes intelligent, aware of her dignity as a woman and all this. Director Agnieszka Holland added two vulgar scenes to the story. First, when the nervous child, Catherine, has trouble with her vesicle. The second scene, when we see in the background a kind of brothel in the open, with prostitutes taking their customers behind the tents and so on. Nothing could be more contrary to Henry James's artistic spirit and ideals. It is notorious that the writer was extremely decent and even dismissed for the standards of the Victorian era. I advise anyone to find any crap anywhere in thousands of pages of James's huge literary production. I was very annoyed by these two scenes. Yes, I know a director needs a reasonable freedom in adapting a Roman screen. But if a director ignores or misunderstands the art of an author (here, Henry James), I do not see how to use his work to make a bad movie. The Act is right for the film: poor and flat, despite the talent of Albert Finney and Maggie Smith. "Washington Square" is definitely an unrecommended movie.
