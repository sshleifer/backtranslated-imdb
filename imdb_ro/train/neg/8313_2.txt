I watched this on a whim because it was available and I heard that the Thumb movies were funny. It was not. Most of the jokes were based on the "Geranium" physics and Kate Winslet. I think it is truly pathetic for Thumbtanic creators to lean so low that they make robbery to a respected actress just because she (the forbidden sky) does not commit suicide in the model of ideal modern beauty. <br /> <br /> My favorite part was the line that resembles: "Hey, I have a great idea to swim on this improvised cork that nobody else sees!" Thirty seconds of fun in a 26-minute film does not value.
