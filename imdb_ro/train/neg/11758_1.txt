I saw this movie with low expectations and was not disappointed. It's so bad that it's really funny in a very dignified way. Gael is absolutely terrible, I mean he just can not act, period. You should give up now because the action is not clearly his work. His co-stars are the same caliber, I'm sure my 5-year-old cousin could do a better job than anybody! The director should be ashamed to put his name on something so ridiculous. Somehow I do not think an Oscar is on the books for this guy. I never wrote a comment on IMDb, but this movie was so bad I felt compelled to do that. If you have the chance to see this movie, do not 0/10 if there was a 0
