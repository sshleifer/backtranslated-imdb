This is a very unpleasant film if it's made of glass. I tried it because she plays Richard Dreyfus and Jeff Goldblum, two good actors, and because the plot line - a mob leader is about to be released from a mental institution - sounded promising. The film is charged as a comedy, sorta. What we have is an endless series of photographs - you should forgive the hat - of people in the light and elegant interiors, if to some extent surrealist, they shoot one another - in the head, in the stomach, on the knees, in the heart, the anatomy is avoided, it seems) while expressing a vague and cryptic dialogue, of which some are obviously supposed to be humorous in some kind of postmodern way. Goldblum's entire film dialogue fits a 3x5 card and carries a single facial expression - a sardonic smile - all the way through. Ellen Barkin and Gregory Hines are doing everything they can. Burt Reynolds makes a cameo. Rob Reiner and Joey Bishop, but we've lost some of them (a good move on their part). Everything is cold, sterile, mechanical and reckless; a boy, I suspect, in the style of "Pulp Fiction", "Fargo" and "Natural Born Killers". If you liked those, you probably like that.
