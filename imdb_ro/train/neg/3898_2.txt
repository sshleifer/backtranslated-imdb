I'm really sorry, I know Fa√übinder is still named one of Germany's greatest post-war directors and most of his films are considered master-pieces, but when I see "Lili Marleen" today, in 2004 I wonder what it happens to everyone and this movie! The act is simply terrible - Hanna Schygulla smiles like an idiot! - the changes between the Nazi glamor and the battlefields are ridiculous, the whole movie seems as if it were done in a two-day mansion. It probably was just like that and many people seem to take this for "real art," but for me this movie is simply bad and cheap. Compare this to Viscontis "La Caduta degli Dei" and tell me again that "Lili Marleen" is a good movie ...
