This is a well-informed news film at PBS Frontline. The problem is that Frontline has already done this piece and managed to bring L. Paul Bremer to tell his story about the story. More worrying is that director of the film, Charles Ferguson, a former think tank, was a warlord until the occupation went south. What does he think will happen? <br /> <br /> The Polish invasion really went too well until it was disturbed by those Nazi pessimists. And that's what this movie feels - an excuse for occupation, rather than a deconstruction of the act of war itself. <br /> <br /> Ferguson seems to suggest that the war could have been better executed - as if any war could be better.
