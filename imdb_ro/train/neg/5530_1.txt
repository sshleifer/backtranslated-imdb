Of the many problems with this film, the most serious is continuity; and re-editing the VHS for a college cable channel many years ago, I tried to figure out what went wrong. What seems to have happened is that they actually built a much longer film and then cut it down for standard theatrical viewing. As? to fill all the holes in the plot as we have had, it would take another three hours of narration and character development - especially given that the movie we have is just so slow and it's just as good seriously. <br /> <br /> It was amazing; what could Halperins try to accomplish here? Their previous film, "White Zombie," was a successful, low-budget attempt to duplicate world films at the beginning of Universal Studies (The Mummy, Dracula, etc.) and was, therefore, quite close to the zombie mythology which North American folk folks know about. Zombie rebellion, on the contrary, seems to have been intended as a certain allegory for modern war policy. This not only explains the opening, but also the change of Dean Jagger's character into a megalomaniac but also explains why the zombies do not do much in the movie, besides being around, looking scary and waiting for order - I'm just allegorical soldiers, no cannibals from somewhere, we all came to love and entertain in zombie movies. I am equal to anyone in my dislike of modern war and its politics - but I think a movie should be fun first and only later, perhaps, education. And surely a movie about the zombies should be about zombies. Really one of the most bizarre films in Hollywood history, but not one that I can recommend, even for historical value.
