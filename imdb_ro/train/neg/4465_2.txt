After the overvalued success of Amenabar and Balaguero, Spanish horror films spread as a disease in the increasingly sad world of horror films. The result is also in films like El segundo nombre, a TV-like production, badly written, but driven and even worse. I have not read Ramsey Campbell's book, but I'm sure the author of the dolls who ate my mother did not have much in common with this terrible production. Avoid it at all costs, unless you are looking for a quiet, sleepy night in a new cinema. 2/10
