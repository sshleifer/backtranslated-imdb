Crack! What terrible and terrible Spanish thriller! We had it for four years, and finally we started it last night. I watched about an hour before I go to bed. I was pretty intrigued by everything. We finished last night and I could not believe where I stopped last night. Literally, I stopped the second before the movie went completely down. As I said, I was pretty intrigued and curious about the place where this mystery was going, but stopped it even when Simon gets the package in the bar. I took it when I open the package to reveal a laser gun and then play a "threatening" laser tag game. Wow! Then the big revelation is that everything is a terrorist plot of role-playing players. Whew! You can say that the Spanish industry was certainly behind director Mateo Gil (co-writer of Amenabar's two big hits). There is an excellent score and a great photo. But this scenario seems stupid. How someone stood in the last 40 minutes with a straight face is beyond me.
