First of all, I would like to add that I myself am a historian, so what I'm looking for in a film based on historical events is that it is actually based on historical facts. But this is not the case here. Of course the movie is fun and yet the fact that it is not based entirely on real facts is more than annoying. Hitler was not anti-Semitic in his youth, he even worked for the Jews before the World War. However, during the World War, he formed his views on the Jews. His education in this film is also inaccurate that Hitler, like a child, was not a worried boy. He had a more or less normal education. Nothing is mentioned about his lost brothers and other important pieces that add to the puzzle that is Hitler. Robert Carlyle is a great actor but does not really fit into Hitler's role. Hitler was not as impossible and unstable as he was portrayed here. In his younger years he was a charismatic person who "manipulated" people with his charm. His unstable behavior and outburst of anger began at the turning point of the war. I would like to see a film about Hitler's life that is based on real historical facts and not on accusations. I really hate when people straighten a finger blaming for example Hitler and others and telling inaccurate stories just to paint their image as a pure evil. It's much better to tell the story exactly as it was so that everyone could learn how it was! Those behind this film would have had to do some research before doing so. Because it seems they did not even know what really happened. Hitler was not even shot in the revolutionary march in Munch, his shoulder was pulled from the base. It gives you more to see a good documentary than to see this.
