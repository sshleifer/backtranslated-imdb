It can only be described as dreadful. It's bad to start and then you get worse. When you start, you have to really watch it because it's impossible to think it can get worse - but do not worry because it's happening. Another bad script written for a dagger director for descendants without the talent of stars in the past. It is difficult to determine if the scenario is worse than the one that acts or if the direction is worse than both. As for the hero - well, he is scouring everyone, including a scene in which he beats the daylight hard by swing open the closet door and break it against the window with it. And in another scene he is thrown through a window and collapses 20 feet on the concrete - not even blinking - then he gets up immediately and gets stuck in the wicked. This is a really ridiculous movie. Lucky it cost me only $ 1 to hire her.
