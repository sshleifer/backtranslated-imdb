This movie is more deceptive than ever, using an actor depicted as Walken to play in this piece of junk made her seem to have nothing better to do than to play a boring role like this one! And the fact that the movie should have been about a witch and that you really do not see this until the end of the movie, but in the meanwhile you have to sit and watch this boring movie as he gets or tries to get the meaning of point and you have to go through this entire track of boring actors and actresses thinking all the time how you switched from another movie and decided this and how you tical just the money just doing all the time of useless sitting there. I prefer to see cartoons for kindness. Leave him alone, please!
