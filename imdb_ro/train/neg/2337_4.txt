I do not know what this is about ... This is a bad movie ... it did not do me anything, the only scene of descendancy is the place where everyone meets at the party and plays a beautiful song, cinematic films that make you move ... this was the best part of the movie ... Otherwise this movie does not have everything to sue the spectator in There is no story, there is nothing to think about as some say, there is no cohesion between different stories ... it was rather an attempt to play Anderson's "Magnolia", which was brilliant, but it's not blatant ... Okay, it's easy and easy to watch, but that's also a movieclips. Maybe first write a story before making a movie ... 4/10 One of the worst Belgian films I've ever seen
