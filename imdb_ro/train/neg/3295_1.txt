... then you should not watch this movie. They completely destroyed the premise of the show. In the movie, Duke boys are idiots, Daisy is a bastard, Roscoe is sinister, Boss Hogg is capable, Uncle Jessie is a killer ... only Cooter and Flash are true original characters. At least Enos is a little close. At one point, they open the doors to enter General Lee - Nuff said. The original show may not have been a great TV, but it was fun and the characters made sense. This movie is like Dumb & Dumber meets simple life.
