Droni, ethnic reels, bad synthesizing tubes, singing children. The world's most pathetic "world music" imaginable. This is a tourist and crazy movie. What really kills the incoherent sequences. India, Egypt, South America, Africa etc. There are no transitions, no visual explanation of why we are suddenly ten thousand miles away without ideas expressed in images. Just a bunch of pictures of third-world people with "baskets on the head," as another commentator said. Going along endlessly, as if it had a profound meaning. If these boys wanted to make a third world music video, all they had to do was lie a few hundred kilometers south of where the best parts of Koya and the film were shot in Mexico. That would have been a better framework for "transforming life." But no. What they have decided was a tourist itinerary that covered half of the globe and filming blows with a clogged mind. The only thing we can recommend to this film is that it does not suck long enough like Naqoyqatsi. <br /> <br /> RastJ
