The nomenclature of the most pathetic piece in cinematic history is not an easy task, the candidates being so abundant, but Nemesis 2 has been my personal favorite ever since I saw him. It was so funny that I had to rent it again the next day and again I laughed so hard that I literally rolled over the floor. (This is usually the case when I see Monty Python's "Scott Antarctica".) Throughout the movie, an overwhelming sense of what-heck means the viewer firmly. I'm completely upset that this lewd movie has ever reached the production stage. It should be a sequel, but it has nothing to do with the first film. The hero has the same name, but this time "Alex" is female, though it took us half in the movie to stop guessing, with all the muscles and barbarous nomadism! it's really no plot, it's just a long track of watching, it's just that slow and it does not make sense to tell a chase scene that makes the sound more exciting than it really is. There is almost no dialogue to be as good about its quality, and then the movie suddenly barely approaches a blatant action scene with a lot of gas explosions without really explaining what it was about. Fortunately, it's never boring, because there's something foolish and fake to happen at all times! Horrific movies are usually just boring, but Nemesis 2 is such a perfect blend of excessive gravity and the exact unintentional that it's really fun. Rent this movie or buy yourself, you will not be disappointed!
