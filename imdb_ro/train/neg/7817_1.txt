at first I was happy to know about a new superman movie, although that would be great, but it was not. It's a bad copy of Richard Donner's work, Lex is again a villain who does nothing else, even played by Kevin Spice. The evil plan is the same from Donner's first film just a forced one. the script is predictable and simple (all things found by Luthor in a museum or an old lady). The story is wrong, it must be Kevin Smith Script and it might be better. <br /> <br /> I only hope a sequel without Brian Singer and a new talent director to do something new and not a copy. <br /> <br /> All of you are reading later
