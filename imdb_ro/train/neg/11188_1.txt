This is really the worst movie I've ever seen. Ever. Period. In fact, we paid Â£ 3.50 to watch this smoldering film. An incredibly dull, bad, acute, often incoherent and too many scenario, which seems to have no relevance to the general movie (such as when Heath Ledger's priest's partner is attached to a wall of a ghost. What was the point in that scene? Answer a postcard please ...) I should have received a medal because you stuck to this movie because it's time to overtake it. I would rather like a strong blow to the groin than to stay back through this movie. This should be thrown into the bottom of IMDb 100. I hope my vote of 1/10 will help her.
