The time spent watching this movie was lost. I do not like fictional science. I do not reject any kind in itself, because good work can be done in any kind. This movie, however, is not a good thing. I can not blame visual (when it does not involve foreign makeup), and the special effects are impressive. The story was not out-and-out-bAD for a comic book trekkish. But fx images were obviously where all decision makers interest / attention / money went. The direction alternated between slow and confused (one was not at all sure who did what and with whom and with whom at least a crucial conjunction). The "actor" was, indeed, very bad indeed. There was no basis for most of the line readings, apart from a hint: "That was on the page and the director told me I should be upset / sad / scared / anything. Okay, so he was a pilot in The SF series is an excuse for a correct confusion in areas that should be considered essential for a dramatic environment. Am I am amazed that the pilot sold the series or that the money is also in the hands of the technicians?
