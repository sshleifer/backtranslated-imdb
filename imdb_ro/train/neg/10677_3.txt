I rented End Game without hearing about it, but I like the political thrillers, so I thought I was gonna kick it. After doing some research on the film, I found that it was originally intended to be released in the theater, but was instead on DVD. After seeing her, I think "no wonder." The film is shocking in its inexperience. The plot and the characters are perfunctorial. I realized it was marked halfway, but the end was a curved ball. I have to say that I did not expect it to end as it did, but that's not a point in its favor. The more predictable end would have been preferable to one that is so bad. Perhaps movie makers saw how predictable the movie was, and so they decided to make a twist - even one that made the film even worse. I want $ 5.98 and 107 minutes back.
