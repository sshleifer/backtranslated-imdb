<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> <br /> <br /> <br /> This was an entry feature, co-invoiced with THE VELVET VAMPIRE. A Spanish-Italian co-production where a number of women in a village are killed at the same time, a local contender called Yanos Dalmar is seen on the trip, traveling with his dog "mananos" behind him. <br /> <br /> People already suspect that he is the one behind everyone and wants the castle to be burned. The killing first began during Count Yanos's older brother, Count Igor Dalmar was burned and killed horribly in a laboratory accident. Then a woman Ivanna (Erna Schuer) whom Igor hired before his death to assist him in his experiments shows. Yanos agrees to hire her instead of his brother and together she's looking for the deadly cell regeneration formulas. Yanos wants to bring Igor's life back to life. But, of course, Igor is still alive (though burned horribly), watching and killing women in the village. We see his caramel look appearing at different points in the movie, so we know he's still alive, making everything look a little too obvious. Igor encounters another end of fire when he enters a battle with Yanos on Ivanna, with burning candles falling in the same bed that Igor gave him, still meeting a final final. and looks pretty granular and bad. In addition to a scraper, other accessories are not included. Although it has a beautiful, creepy and good atmosphere in Spain, it is considered to be quite boring and predictable, with no emotion or mystery, anyway. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10.
