A group of us who watched this movie are really disgusted. We were willing to forgive the fact that our favorite character Jo was not on (it's not like the writers / producers do anything about it). The script was weak, the script was sub-par. What really bothered us: 1. When the two boys realized that they met Natalie, they just left them to reconcile with that stupid (and eventually degrading) contest - but only because they were macho guys, not because they wanted Natalie. 2. Despite being unable to choose between the two guys before the meeting, Natalie suddenly decides he loves one of the boys and is ready to marry him? (and there was no prediction that he was really a better guy, it is as if the writers had overturned a coin and then spit at a convenient moment of the film). 3. Blair makes a point to talk about how she does not want children, and then suddenly when her husband says she wants to have children, she is happy to agree with him.
