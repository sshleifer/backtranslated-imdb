I was delighted to hear that someone made a documentary about what it would be like to be Puerto Rican. When I heard it was Rosie Perez, I wondered ... he might know what it would be like Puerto Rican. As far as I knew ... he was a Nuyorican. Well, anyway, I was anxious with my popcorn to look. I realized 10 minutes that my initial restraint was right. Rosie Perez has little knowledge of how to be Puerto Rican. This "documentary" is rather a first hand, a very personal account of what it means to be a Nuyorican ... and all that involves that. She (like most of the Nuyoricans I know) has a feeling of broken, partial and sometimes twisted history. (How could they not live here?) Yes, they are all proud. How it should be! But many things do not know REAL cultures, history and the political environment or language for the most part. Everything became very obvious by participating in the Vieques issue. Regardless of the fact that I personally take this matter ... even though I know why the hell is the fight. She gets arrested for something she knew a little about her and she just attended because she was a "Puerto Rican cause". I really do not understand how he is not ashamed to admit it. For those of you who are not Puerto Rican, please see this as a partial account of the woman's journey of self-discovery and acceptance. Do not take this as a gospel ... many of them are not true. Please consider the source. Rosie is an actress; not a historian. This film is not and should not be, for other Nuyoricans, the basis for informing them. Instead, just a step towards finding more information, learning and debating reality. Not only that that comes from the eyes of this woman.
