I'll be honest. The only reason I've watched it on TV is that it's at the bottom of IMDb 100. And now I wonder if an hour and a half of my life really deserves another "control" on the same list. Van Damme is Luc Deveraux, who is in a huge battle with the universal soldiers after the main computer has pulled a "HAL" to defend himself. And yes, after all the mandatory explosions, shooting and pursuit, he is the last one standing. In combination with a terrible adventure and a bit of boring set-up make sure it's the place in the infamous list is just. Just for idiots like me who want to look at this complete list. 2/10.
