"American Nightmare" is officially linked, in my opinion, with "It's Baby!" for the best movie of all time. Seven friends (who resemble the K-Mart version of "Friends") gather in a cafe to listen to American Nightmare, a pirate radio show. It's hosted by a bearded guy. This is the most interesting aspect of his show. Chandler, Monica, Joey, and ... Wait, Wayne, Jessie, and the rest of a naughty band that gets it all reveals the biggest fears of the bearded DJ. An unknown, a crazy nurse / serial killer hears ... Crazy Nurse then continues to torture Ross and Rachel and ... wait, I'm sorry again ... by making my fears come to life. These fears include such stunning as "voodoo" and being lowered by old ladies with prostheses. Really. This movie was, in a word, rotten. Nurse Nurse's killing syndrome is motivated, there is nothing to make the viewer "jump", ending blows and - again - voodoo? If you have absolutely no respect for your loved ones, rent "American Nightmare" with them. If you care about your loved ones - even a little - go to your local Blockbuster, rent all the copies of American Nightmare and hide them in the freezer.
