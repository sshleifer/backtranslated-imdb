This was the worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen many bad movies. First of all, I'm from Kansas, this movie has no truth in it. Like they took the name of BTK and did the rest. On top of that, it seems that someone was like getting only $ 20 dollars here take it and make a movie and oh do not worry about BTK research, just leave something. seriously dookie no one should ever see this movie. Slaughter cattle attacks and their victims to eat stuff and describe the slaughter of animals BTK did not do either of these, but the movie does this because God's love never sees this terrible movie. The ones made for television are much better and more accurate
