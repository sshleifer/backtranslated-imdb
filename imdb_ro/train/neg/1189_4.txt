The sound effect of the "spectacular" echo of the show made me sleep. A very reassuring show. I think he might have slept in the places where there was danger or danger. I also heard they were shot in Tarpon Springs, Florida. I would assume that Lloyd Bridges has never stayed there. I only remember the re-show and, although it was never interesting, we would make our own underwater episodes in the lake at our grandmother's house ... imagining the sounds that generated a rumble and telling adventures in our head. I thought "Flipper" has a better submarine action. Of course, he had the advantage of being in his natural environment.
