In an attempt to bring back the genre of teenage that was taken by spoofs like Scary Movie and Shriek if you know what I did last Friday on 13, Valentine fails. Why were people like Halloween? Because it was original, new, and surpassed everything ever done. Why did they like Scream? Because at least it made sense. Valentine is just a silly stupid thing that has no gore that's all. The land is so similar to Halloween and Urban Legend, it's not funny. And when the killer comes to the screen, you know who he is, it's just sssssssssssooooooooooooo predictable. The genre of teen slasher is DEAD Get over it! <br /> <br /> 0 of 10
