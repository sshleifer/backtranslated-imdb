Or "Marlowe at sea". Still an old film with a superior smell with Bogey. Very talky, too. Bogey has the same character as Marlow's movies; always in control of a situation, never nervous - no matter how dangerous a situation, she calls women "weak" and "ladies" and other nonsense, she is the only "real man," that is, the man alpha in the film man being the Gestapo head - is just a fat alpha male) and - of course - any appealing woman who is heading can not resist his charm and wants his penis within hours of the initial introduction. Personal features are here. Bogey is supposed to be the same cynical about reform as in "Casablanca" and, of course, often refuses money or other valuable items when offered - but how does he fit with the tough cynic in him? He is not, so he can not be cynical; Hawks wanted this in both ways: a character who is both the "cold lonely cynic" and a well-wise humanitarian. I do not think ... Bacall does her non-chilling "cold cake" routine for the first time and there is a lot of exchanges between them and Bogey, which are not very interesting, the so-called "sexual innuendo"; these dialogues sound stupid by current standards. "Put your lips and whistle ...". A bunch of nonsense ... She was 19 years old when she was made, but looks much older and is much less attractive than the female stars of the day. Her bony face, with its sharp features, is nowhere near radiating the feminine beauty of a Havilland, the sweetness of a Myrna Loy, not to mention the love of Irene Dunne. Bacall was better suited to playing vampires, not femme-fatales. (In real life she looks a lot like her face: a Hollywood slut.) There is a scene where Bacall tears in tears; very inappropriate for her character. There are two or three bad musical numbers - but my quick button was ready.
