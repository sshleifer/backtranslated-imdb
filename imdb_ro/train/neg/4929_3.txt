Spoilerii of this review are provided as a public service, because the only way to enjoy costume melodrama is to know that our protagonist, Barbara Skelton, is raped and shot in the end. And not a moment too soon. I would have shot the screen myself, but I was afraid I hit James Mason. The original novel in 1943 called "Life and death Skelton Wicked Lady" (I think people n was written by a woman, a British marine arm, which was either cloudy or cynical or both. Her heroine is devastatingly beautiful, and the author seems to believe that if you beauty, nothing else matters. But other things matter, like that immediate response and one of Mrs. Barbara when one comes in its path is murder. he killed three men in five attempts. A femme fatally serious, has a case of dissocial personality disorder that should have landed either in Bedlam or in Newgate. Lockwood interprets her as a narcissistic vamp, wearing so much makeup that I I thought as a Joan Rivers restoration period (or during restoration Joan Rivers, ha!). However, Lady B. is irresistible for all three main male characters - Michael Rennie, James Mason and Griffith Jo who works well, just like Patricia Roc. Of course, all three fans realize soon who is a slut psychotic Barbara, but the plot keeps them in orbit until one of them threw down - accidentally, in what it means to be either irony or only desserts. Given the dramatic death scene, a boom that raises the room through the windows and into the sky, I suppose we're meant let's fucking dead. But hers is the first body we do not care about.
