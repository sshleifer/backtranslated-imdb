How could 4 out of 16 previous voters give this movie a 10? How could more than half of the previous voters give it 7 or more? Who is voting here? I can assume that I am primarily children - very young children. The fact is that this is a bad movie in every respect. The story is bad; action is hard to think even as acting; the characters are not personal; and the dialogue is terrible. I saw this rainy afternoon on the Sci-Fi channel. In the sad event that is ever retransmitted, I suggest you read a book in return.
