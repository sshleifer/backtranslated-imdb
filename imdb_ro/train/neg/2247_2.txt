Kris Kristofferson, at his drugged peak in the mid-1970s, is barely able to sneak up on screen with La Streisand's humongos ego and discount shop feminism. None of the characters is really sympathetic; I was glad when Kristofferson's Ferrari crossed the hill and collapsed. If you want to see a good movie about rock and roll, try _The Buddy Holly Story_ (just about a year and a half after this game).
