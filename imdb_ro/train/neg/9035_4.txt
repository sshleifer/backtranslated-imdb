Being born in the 1960s, I grew up on "The Movies of the Week" television in the early 1970s and I loved the frightening films that were featured in the past, including "Crowhaven Farm," "Bad Ronald," "Satan's School for Girls, "Kolchak Night Stalker", etc., but this is just bad. It is obvious that the writer is trying to take advantage of Manson's horrific crimes a few years earlier. The film calls Dennis Weaver, the famed "McCloud" and "Duel," as a father who takes his family to a beach. The family encounters some hippies who, for some reason, decide to terrorize the family. The reason for this is never explained, and Weaver's pacifist position is hard to swallow. For God's sake, call the police, fuck her or something like that, just do not sit there and drink. The actor is pretty lame, the story is unbelievable, etc. Susan Dey looks cute in a bikini, but that's about it. Ignore this if it ever plays on TV.
