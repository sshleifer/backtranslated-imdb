This is a decent effort, but the guy who wrote the script seems to be a bit in the dark about what exactly makes a cold zombie movie. No, there are CGI bugs and software companies. In fact, I'm not sure if it was a software company - I saw it without subtitles, so I had to guess what I'm talking about. Anyway, my point was - instead of wasting your time by animating some bugs, why not throw more zombies and more actions. Two-thirds of the 20 minutes consist of news bulletins, bugs, some guys shouting about something. And to make things worse (more boring), most of the deaths appear on the screen. I realize they are too frequent for budget-free movies, but then there were some very impressive effects (well, some kind of) that left me wondering why the director (or screenwriter, any) chose to focus on how the epidemic started - it's a short one, no one will take care anyway.
