I begin to be 700 Clubs from time to time and agree only with some of the statements made - they are one of many believers considered liberal by most Christians and conservatives by most non-Christians. Vote my mind, and usually not rep. or dem. - I do not think 700 clubs tell people what to believe, but they represent many older Christians who grew up in very conservative environments. I think many people misunderstand what is said in 700 clubs. it makes me cry to hear the name that sounds in any direction. I think 700 club people even love Jesus, but they are so busy trying to make people vote conservatively for forgetting to show love to certain people and to promote peace as Jesus. Please do not judge Jesus on the basis of ignorant individuals who believe in Him and not just as ignorant of our comments on them. Why are people so accustomed to each other?
