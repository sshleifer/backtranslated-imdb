I think it would have been a better movie if Cajunele were portrayed in a more credible light. My family is from the South East of Louisiana and live in southeast Texas (about 20 miles from Lake Charles). I never heard the people I grew up around the talks like these people did. Crayons were portrayed as red. Most Cavities I know are well-educated and proud people, and they do not sound at all educated when they talk as they did. Generally, it was an OK movie with a great landscape and music. I understand that the writers were from Lake Charles and have knowledge of the area, but for the love of all things, Cajun, I ask the actors to study the language, live among the people you portray, and understand how long they are before they try to behave like them. In my opinion, when the actors make you think I am that person, it's a much more enjoyable movie!
