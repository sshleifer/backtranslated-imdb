I'm following this on the Sci-Fi channel right now. It's so horrible I can not see it again! I'm a Videographer and this movie makes me sad. I feel sorry for someone associated with this movie. Some of the camera work is good. Most are very controversial. There are some decent actors in the movie. Too bad they're surrounded by what must have been the director's relatives. This is the only way he could have been qualified to be in a movie! The music was a bit better than the actor. If you come to watch this, I hope it is because there was absolutely no other option! Continuing sequel (yes sequel) ... I think I will jump in! Jason
