Sarah Silverman is really the comedy "flavor of the moon" right now. Does it really deserve all the hype? Yes and no. She is fun sometimes, sometimes hilarious (so her standup routine is actually pretty interesting, though not always funny). Once, you feel cheated by the media because you have another interpreter. She is one of those really cute comedians, especially men, who say they dig their intelligence and intelligence. But if you have them rotated, most men will admit they just want to sleep with her and that's why they watch her. She remembered why many men gathered at Margaret Cho and Janeane Garofalo, although none of them are really "hot" in terms of popularity. Sarah does not drink or smoke (at least cigs), so she should be hot when she's 60, so her fans (especially the male) can enjoy. Regarding this show, it is very much like her comedy. When it works, it's hilarious. When it does not happen, it's full of tedium and very, very boring. The AIDS episode here is the best. It's constantly funny and has a very good satire in it. Brian Poeshn's character has an unhealthy Tab obsession in one episode and is hilarious to see him in a Tab shirt. But they never really go anywhere and eventually welcome. The character of Sarah in the series is quite annoying, the gay couple (Brian Poeshn and another guy) seems to be hindered and never does anything for the show as a whole, and the players who support him (including Sarah's sister, Laura, who does not look like a thing like that) I'm OK. When jokes hit, they are bright. When they do not, they are terrible and I mean a lot. There's also an obsession with coprophilia here (aka poop jokes), which seems to have replaced real intelligence and intelligence in today's comedy. So, should you watch this show? If you have a passion for Sarah, go to him. You can look at her and pretend to be yours. In terms of its performance, it varies from zero to zero.
