To describe this film as garbage is unfair. At least garbage rooting can be an absorbed hobby. This movie was neither absorbed nor fun. Kevin Bacon can act gorgeously given the chance, so no doubt he had an IRS bill to settle when he agreed with this direction scenario. The story of the crazy scientist "Hollow Man" was told earlier, it was said better and it was said without resorting to so many ridiculously expensive special effects. Most of these special effects seem to be built around transparent anatomic dolls of men, women and dogs that you could buy in the early seventies. In the UK, they were marketed under the name of "The Transparent Man (/ Woman / Dog)", which may be where they got the title for this film. Intelligent special effects, terrible scenario, nonexistent plot. <br /> <br />
