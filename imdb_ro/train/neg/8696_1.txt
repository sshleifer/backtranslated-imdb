I'm Anthony Park, Glenn Park is my father. First of all, I want to say that the story behind this film and the creation of the Amber Warning System is a good one. However, the movie itself was bad and the acting was terrible. The big problem I had with the film was the second half with Nichole Timmons and father Glenn Park. The events around that part of the story were not entirely correct. My father suffered from psychological disorders at that time, and he took Nichole without any intention of harming her at all. She loved her as a daughter and was under her mind to save her from the kind of evil or negligence she probably thought would come from her mother who did not pay too much attention to the three extra years that my father take care of herself and finally raise her so that her mother can move. The film described my father in a manner that would hurt her in a form or shape. The funny thing is that Nichole spent many nights, sometimes consecutively, at my father's place, while Sharon would work or do whatever he did. The reason why my father was originally considered to be violent was because he had objects that could be designed as weapons in his truck. My father was an afforestation. The items considered to be weapons were landscaping tools they kept in their truck all the time for work. My recommendation is to take this film with a grain of salt, it's a good story and based on real events, yet the details of the movie (at least the part of Nichole Timmons - Glenn Park) are largely inaccurate and describe the director's failure to discover the truth in saying the story. The funny thing is that if the director had interviewed any of Sharon's friends who knew the situation, he would have said exactly what I posted here.
