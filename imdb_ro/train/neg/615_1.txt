I have to say that I usually like the horror films I have never seen ... yet it was just pathetic for my upset taste. I'm used to the vulgar, stomach ... but this movie was blade. The act was horrible (yet horn (it was not a bullet) they were nice). And the sequel, Slayer Slayer was even worse! Yes, probably when it first came out, there was a huge story about it and people liked it. But when movies like Emily Rose's Ring and Exorcist come out, movies like these make movies like Scarecrow look childish. If you want a movie to pass only time, choose it! The special effects are notebooks. But seeing it was a low-budget movie, I can see where it will come. This will remind you of the movie "Children of Corn". Independent rock movies ... most of the time. So if you want to see a scarecrow who kills people with corncobs, or further, two scarecrows going to him, then these movies would be for you.
