I've read here Wonder Woman Writer's Posts for this TV movie. It should be emphasized that at the time the film was made, she did not wear the traditional outfit. The producers were, in fact, at the WW writer's conception of the early seventies. As for the movie itself, I have to agree with many of the other posters here. Snoozefest! I was a kid when he first appeared on ABC in 1974, so I was in the right age to appreciate a movie about a comic book hero. However, I was so "thickened" by the plot, I stopped looking at it three quarters in the film. Of course, I was not at the right age to appreciate Cathy Lee! :-)
