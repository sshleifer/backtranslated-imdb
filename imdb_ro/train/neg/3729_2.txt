First of all, I saw this movie when I was 7 years old at a Scholl Christian I attended. Needless to say I was scared from my mind. Not because it was scary, but because the content. Mon ... I was 7. Anyway, the cinema was bad enough and the acting was cheesy. It's very bad, since I was only 7 years old and I remember that. The only thing that haunts me is that the terrible song "I wish we were all ready" where the choir ends with "you were left behind". I would not suggest to see that. I'm probably going to do it just for nostalgic reasons. Plus, I'm sure the remake is much better. The best part of this film, however, must be when everyone "disappears"; the vacant cars collapse, the lawnmowers run on their own ... quite hilarious.
