Well, I'm blowing a Woody Allen movie that I left after half an hour (I'm aware of the moral fragility of commenting on a movie I've seen less than half, but I hope you'll understand Why). Basically, it was very early that we were going to patronize the screen with: a scenario exposing its core as if it were bullets; a cast that tries all to be characters from Hannah and her Sisters (except Chloe Sevigny) and they were dared to do that; and a camera that sat near, just because there was nothing to be filmed, but the chat and the actor who delivered it. Drama? No one; is partly pre-narrated, but the action does nothing to develop a dramatic situation. Maybe I left too early in this case, but until then I decided against another half-hour - clone Allen-Allen. Does the script have funny moments? I went almost entirely to the back of the Will Ferrell fragments in the trailer (trailer-hanging again, huh!) ?? but there is not too little a rhythm that allows them to fly non-shodly as well. Worse than that there is fluidity. Saying that this wood film makes a forest look like a jelly: the opening coffee talk is the most abused case-by-point. The only thing that should be done by numbers is the review of the pot? 2/10.
