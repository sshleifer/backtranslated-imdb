I saw "Shiner" on DVD. As I watched him, I thought, "This is a very bad porn porn without porn." I also thought, "Anyone who wrote this has some real problems." Then I watched that director / writer Carlson explain his process as a special feature. Yes, it was very special. The film's emphasis is on two alcoholic losers who hit each other to get down. I'm marginally attractive. There is front and full nudity. These factors probably contribute to the fact that the movie is not seen at all. The most disturbing element of the film is homosexual beating and subsequent pursuit of the homosexual gay of the same victim, who tries intimately to take revenge precisely against his attackers, the two drunken losers. Not only is the subject treated absurdly and technically poor, but the act is terribly bad. Then there is the boxer-stalker theme. This is really crazy, not just absurd. This tired boxer is traumatized in some way by the persistent attention of a mother-to-mother who works at the parking lot in the gym. That's LA, think about it. The boxer is so traumatized that he returns to the stalker's house, cries in front of him and excites himself in the process. Well, all I can say is why would it be a boxer who is in the heart of an exhibitionist to be so traumatized by the attention of a stalker? It simply does not make sense. And, I'm afraid, some psycho-dynamics actually make sense if you take the time to read about them. However, evil scriptures rarely make sense. The publisher / writer seems to have thought that this film is a considerable minority within the homosexual community. Maybe it would be fair, I suppose. We may never know, since this minority would be so dysfunctional that it could not be organized enough to ever reach a gay obscure film festival or a DVD store, the only places where he could find this turkey. Thank you for this.
