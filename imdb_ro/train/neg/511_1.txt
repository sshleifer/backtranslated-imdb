I was one of the few extras in this big bomb. I just happened to be in the right place for work safety for racing scenes from A.I.R. as it was known at that time. Thanks for the goodwill of my scene in the first few minutes of the movie and I do not have to stand up altogether. It was more than a big party than a movie, but hey, the salary was good. The attention to details was not a strong point for him, but who would know. The funny thing was to see the cars on the track at very slow speed and then in the accelerated movie to what was approaching normal speed. A lot of scenes have been changed while they were filmed, I suppose it should shave cost and time. But everyone had such a good time that he cared!
