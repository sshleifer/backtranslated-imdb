I think we found the most misogynist film ever: Darklight. Lilith was Adam's first wife, and she was considered imperfect and was banished from Eden's garden because she thought she was equal to Adam and refused to obey him. See, I took these words straight from the script. Then the movie continues, and although she is the heroine of the film, the only time she becomes acceptable is when she does what people tell her to do! She finishes the film under the control of The Faith - a group of all men! Other than the fact that the scenario was predictable and FX were terrible. In addition to the obvious hatred of females, which is usually more subtle in the modern movie, there was nothing original about Darklight.
