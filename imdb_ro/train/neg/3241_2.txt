This movie had a potential, but what makes it so bad is Lindsay Crouse's act. I've never seen it before in anything else and maybe there are some Cro's fans out there as she does in something else, but her performance in this movie is bad. Her delivery is robotic. When he gave his lines, he seemed to try to make sure he had straight lines and simply read the list from his head. So her voice has a very low inflection. I can not believe that someone bad in acting was given a leading role in a movie. She needs to know someone in the biz. Now I do not like being that way about her, but the comment has to be "so long," and her performance is what happens more than anything else. However, I liked it if the story went, so I continued to watch it. The first part of the script has a good movie. But the end was disappointing. Perhaps if it were better, I would have liked it.
