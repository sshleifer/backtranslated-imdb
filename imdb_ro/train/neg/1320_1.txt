This movie was exactly what I expected to be when I first read the casting. Probably I could write a more interesting plot, it's a shame they left him to a pack of Howler's Monkeys. Alberto Tomba was certainly a good skier, but he has to thank God (and us) for not having to rely on his actor's skills to earn his living. He can not play, can not talk, nor can he travel very well on the continent without his skis ... Michelle Hunziker is a beautiful blond girl and that's all. Of course, she was not chosen for her astonishing power in dramatic roles, but probably for her beautiful feet. However, I have to admit that she might be Tomba's theater teacher, because she's even a worse actor than her, and that's funny, especially since it's not Italian. I laughed all the time, watching this movie. It seemed so ridiculous and meaningless to me that it actually made me laugh, loud, very loud.
