The bad movie safe. It's such a ridiculous fantasy with a lot of weak special effects, a lot of fast scenes (for example, the airport) and a real unpleasant time. (Charles Dance) is terrible as the bad guy and is much better in (the hero of last action). (Eddie Murphy) makes a non-comic joke, and I heard that this sink has already succeeded, great success of time ?? !! Will I never understand why or how? In a TV interview I heard (Eddie Murphy) himself, when he was nominated for the 2007 Oscar, he regretted it in a comic way! <br /> <br /> One of the comments said (Hey ... It's the 1980s!). Well, no friend. It's the cinematic madness that has made a lot of RAZZIE movies over the years, be it the 1980s or the 1950s! <br /> <br /> There are 2 reasons to make me write about this movie. The first is that I will never forget the fascinating bronze legs (Charlotte Lewis), especially when it was in bed before the bad boys attacked their house, wearing only a blue shirt and OH BOY, the camera shooting naked legs like it has to be. But how strange! As we watched it in the following films and it was not so beautiful again! However, the second reason is that I found the title of this movie lately on my list of the most serious 100 movies ever! Bottom line: bad movie, Greeeeeat legs.
