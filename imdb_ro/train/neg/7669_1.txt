This movie manages to be one of the most unique movies you've ever seen. However, this comes from the fact that you can not make heads or tails from this misery. There are almost a series of challenges created to determine if you are willing or not to leave the movie and give up the money you have just paid. If you do not want to feel weak, you will be sitting on this terrible movie and you will have a real sense of pity for the actors involved, they all have seen better days, but then you realize they paid a little money to do it and you will lose mercy for them, just as you've done for the movie. I can not handle this terrible movie pretty much, almost something Ed Wood would have done and in this case would certainly have been his masterpiece. To get started, you have to sit in an open dialogue that you have never heard / heard, this should take five minutes. Moreover, it is reported to suggest that the spectator can not read. Then we meet Mr. Slater and the terrible line bar gets in full swing, it's like he just operated to get lines on the film poster tag line. Soon we meet Stephen Dorff, whom I usually enjoy) and strives not to drown in this, but eventually does. Then the last insult comes, Tara Reid plays a smart role, he'll help us! Tara Reid is not a very talented actress and, in a way, she is becoming a roles in films, in my opinion, though it should stay on American pie pies. <br /> <br /> In everything you may want to see this for you when it comes out on the video, I know I have a shot at it, I mean everyone is honest here, sipping the shortcomings of others.
