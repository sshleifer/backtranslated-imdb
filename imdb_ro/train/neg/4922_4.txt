DRACULA 2000 is a horror film that has been continuously featured on Sky Movies in the UK and since it seemed to be watched about three times a week for a whole year, I have no idea how I managed to I'll lose it until it's broadcast for the first time on the television network tonight. In fact, seeing that I'm not really a fan of horror movies, the reason was probably up to my theory that this would be fake. My theory has been proven for the most part <br /> <br /> !!!!! MINOR SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> What makes DRACULA 2000 such a bad movie is the amount of bad scripts involved. For example, at the beginning of the movie, bad boys fly with Dracula's coffin from London to America (in a double-engine turbo engine!) And one of the bad guys is left alone in the dungeon where Dracula returns to life. A fight breaks out, there's a lot of noise, but the bad guys in the cabin do not hear a sound until the scenario asks. It also appears in the climax of this segment that Dracula can control the weather, but this seems to be forgotten as the movie progresses. Slight scriptures, and there also seems to be a problem with the structure where there are many character scenes that are in New Orleans mardi greasy then the characters are in a different location such as the police station in the next scene , then I am back to the greasy scene after the lack of credibility in the plot is strengthened <br /> <br /> There is something that has forced my chain - Placing products. There are countless scenes where the logo for a particular label / trader chain is in full view. I would not dare to advertise the brand of the company (except that I run a train company that is a national joke in the UK), but I had the impression that this type of advertising was against the British Broadcasting Guides and I'm surprised by the BBC this movie, if this is the case <br /> <br /> There are some positive in DRACULA 2000, such as visual, for example. This is actually a good movie with a good cast and boys were those hot vampire birds, but it's something we should expect from Hollywood in recent years - A very good movie that's really bad
