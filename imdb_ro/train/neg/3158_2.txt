It was really the worst movie I've ever seen. Michael Vartan is hot, but who is this woman? And she looks absolutely terrible throughout the movie, hair is so bad! They talked like monotone voices and there is no chemistry. The DVD's cover does not even come close to what the movie actually is. Indeed, very boring. I had to advance through some of them because it was so painful to look. Do I really want to know how I can someone on earth believe it's okay? hhaha literally like they talk and say "yes" and there is no passion. I could not say at all that they are in love. I'm sorry, but this was the saddest excuse for a movie I've ever seen.
