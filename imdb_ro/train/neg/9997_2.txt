Capt. Gallagher (Lemmon) and flight attendant Eve Clayton (Vaccaro) are a supposedly hot element in this death journey; a 747 luxury airplane covered to look like a nightclub-slash-hotel ?? there is even a blind piano player who falls in love. Karen Wallace (Grant) is the hysterical b! $ 3 & who will do anything to draw the attention of husband Martin (Christopher Lee) and later on to the other people on board. Memorable moments: Boeing 747 makes a flop in the Atlantic Ocean, Karen knocked the chops when it goes too far, and the furniture (and screaming men) that become "ball bearings" in a sinking pinball machine . /> The action and rescue sequences are relatively phenomenal, but there is not much going on between them. Hitchcock was supposed to steer this sequel, but forget why not? He would have done wonders for the original 1970s, which this sequel is partly inspired ('77, also inspired by 'The Flight of the Phoenix'). <br /> <br /> The actors Cotten and Havilland have been gathering on Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte (they do not seem to play very hard, they just bring lovers to the autumn). And she's not the actress playing Emily's comrade, who played the maid with the death stick on "What's wrong with Jane's baby?" TV actors include "Mayberry RFD" girlfriend, the daughter of the character wins a drawing contest or something like that), Gil Gerard "Buck Rogers" and Pamela Bellwood of "Dynasty." <br /> <br />
