This movie is a non-original garbage. I like romantic comedies sometimes. Watching a good one is like eating ice cream for dinner. It's not something you'll do all the time, but the experience is so enjoyable that you can ignore how foolish you are. This movie made me think how stupid I was to stay seated all the time. Everything about her screamed made cheap. In fact, it seems that they overexposed the film in certain points, it is so washed. He also boasts CGI sets and cheeses of cheese. I know you usually expect some plotting problems in a screwdriver comedy, but you usually do not care, because you laugh. This movie is so unfortunate that you actually sit there and ask yourself about the unlikely series of coincidences and completely unbelievable behavior involved. Events were placed in the movie just to move characters from one scene to another or to give exposure. Sure, so all the movies work, but you do not have to notice that it's happening. Lack of elegance. This is the term I should use. There was almost no one in the movie to be very pleasant. I did not care who got to whom, as long as they all stayed away from me and did not have to listen to them talking about it. Why does the really cool character in the movie, Paul Rudd's character, want to have something to do with Eva Longoria, an all-encompassing, condescending, controlling? Also, almost all of the characters involved consistently chose the weakest solution for any situation. Is a straight man pretending to be gay for five years only to sit (and bathe) with a woman to which he is attracted? The best moment of goodwill that they could come up is to come to a happy ending for the same schmoe where he meets Rudd's equally annoying kleptomaniac sister? Lake Bell and Eva Longoria are very attractive and appealing women. Maybe they will find something better to appear down the road.
