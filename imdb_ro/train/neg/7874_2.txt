In a way, the Time Corridors are a success story because the movie is reaching its purpose: it is seen by thousands of people. But he fails to make them laugh ... Les Visiteurs was successful because the subject was an original way to consider the journey in time: forgotten by Zemeckis Back to the future, here comes old France, the knight of the age middle and almost barbaric way of life. Pride of pride, funny due to the old words he uses, Montmirail can sometimes be disgusting, but he keeps his honor. Then comes the pursuit. No one foresaw the extraordinary success of Les Visiteurs, the first. And it's not at all useful to be a film expert to realize that Time Corridors have been made for money. The general story begins after the end of Les Visiteurs and immediately tries to justify the continuation with a paradox that would have required a second learning. Explanation: It is of no use trying to get the jewelery Jacquille has stolen; do not you remember this beautiful, bright and expensive car that she bought at the end of the first episode? Where do you think he found the money? Selling jewels ... And this is just one of the many holes Poiré tries to avoid ... and fails. Let's take a look at the characters: Montmirail does not change, it's just a bit more boring. As for Frenegonde ... there is another story: Valérie Lemercier has decided not to compromise on this sequel to avoid blocking the bourgeois role. And Muriel Robin tries to imitate her in a way I found so bad that I almost felt the pain for her. And Poiré does not realize that a distribution of humor is not enough to make a good comedy. Forget about time travel, about digital effects, focus on the story and you will see that there is plenty of space on a post stamp to write 10 times. The main interest of this film is landscapes. A movie for young people, let's say up to 13 years.
