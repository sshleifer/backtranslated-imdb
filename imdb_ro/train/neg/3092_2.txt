If movies such as Ghoulies break out of Gremlins, then Hobgoblins sink to a new level of garbage, such as Ghoulies. These little animations have a kind of program to fulfill fantasies (involving the sexual dreams of grotesque characters - oh joy), but what has to do with anything is the misfortune of anyone, except letting the director -and reward erotic perversion. They show this in circle 8 of hell, suspects one. There is no real plot - just "goblins - kill!" and poor humorous attempts and an easy attempt to awaken the viewing audience.
