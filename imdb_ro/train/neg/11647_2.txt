CRIME BOSS is directed by Alberto De Martino; a drama of Italian crime partly filmed in Hamburg, Germany. A slightly forgotten movie. Even in spite of a good succession of cars, this move seems almost inconsequential. A new Don takes over a strong mafia family and is struggling for his own life. Uncertain laws and ethics of mafia code make it harder for someone to trust, especially when playing millions of dollars. Brutality and violence increase instead. This can not be put on a shelf with actual gangsters. Only the appearance of the movie brings back memories of the American tariff. Even the popular American actor Telly Savalas can not increase the caliber of this crime drama. Antonio Sabato also plays with: Paola Tedesco, Guido Lollobrigida, Serio Tramonti and Piero Morgia.
