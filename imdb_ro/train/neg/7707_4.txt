With a title like "The Killer Tomato Attack," anyone who enters this would expect either a) a bad science fiction film, or b) a comedy that has fun with bad science films. It was supposed to be a mixture of both, with a drop of parody. Unfortunately, it collapses very soon. You do not have to take this movie seriously, I realize that, but you should think it's funny, right? I found out that only a few of the jokes or situations were funny (for example, telephone conversations, the Russian olimpic spy eating steroids, Superman walking around Lois, etc.). The "killer tomato attack" strives to be a classic cult, but it does not. A classic cult is a film so different that only a select group of people understand it (or a similar description). "Killer tomato attack" could be enjoyed by any 8-year-old man with a sense of humor, so he does not qualify as a cult movie. There is a good actress in everything: Sharon Taylor as Lois Fairchild. She is a slim, weird reporter, but she has a bold personality, she loves to survive and is a natural comedy. Unfortunately, it is badly used here. "Red Killer Attack" is not as fun as "Amazon Women on the Moon" or "Kentucky Fried Movie," but they do not have a few hilarious moments, so I'd recommend seeing it once. Avoid cutting the director, having the film producer's interruptions and some allegedly "lost" images called in a pretended African dialect (can be found in English outside the printed tape).
