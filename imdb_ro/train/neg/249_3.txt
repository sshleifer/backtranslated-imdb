He saw this movie in my English class this afternoon and was surprised at how bad this version was. Do not get me wrong, George C. Scott was great like Scrooge, but the rest of the camp is not so successful. Sometimes I could not help laughing at the stupid actors and the repeated line: "Happy Christmas to everyone!" Sometimes I almost fell asleep. The film is based on the story of Charles Dickens about a rich guy who does not think Christmas is nothing but humble. After 30 minutes, the rich guy is visited by three ghosts, which make him celebrate Christmas in the end. I do not understand how this movie, with such a bad script that must have been written in five minutes, can be so well-rated. Instead of this piece of garbage I recommend, Bill Murray Scrooged's comedy. At least that was funny ...
