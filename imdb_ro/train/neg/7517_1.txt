*** One of the ten stars *** <br /> <br /> Because if she was, she becomes a daughter. The holy Virgin Mary of God was so bad. I mean, I gave her all the reasonable accommodations, considering it was a direct movie, but it left me every step. Just like many other B movies, the basic story was decent, and the directors seemed to have a reasonable level of resources, but the execution was ridiculous. It is a shame they have attached the good name of Halloween to this fiasco. The basic premise surrounds some sleeping douche bags that house their annual Halloween haunted raiser funds house, when a book of Satanic spells looks from nowhere and throws boys brothers into a living hell. Well, this is the idea anyway, but instead most of the film is dedicated to showing these escapades of boy brother relationships, abounding in a scandalous lesbian sublot. Very little of the real story is dedicated to Halloween or the mysterious spell book. In fact, it makes me angry that the filmmakers think they could escape with such a dribbling. <br /> <br /> The film is basically about boy brother relationships. This is not what the movie is charged for. I am tempted to discover the producers and, at least, to threaten them with bodily harm. The actor is just as bad as he is, he's atrocious! The script is unintentionally funny. Cinema is simply lazy. The entire movie is amateur night. This film actually makes SyFy channel productions look like a masterpiece. The last half hour of the film felt that filmmakers realized they did not produce a soap opera and had to cast horror sequences in some way. The Wizard's Magic Book comes into play and turns everyone in the haunted house into their character dressed like. I almost feel like crying as I write this review. Wow! I mean wow! This thing was an undetectable disaster.
