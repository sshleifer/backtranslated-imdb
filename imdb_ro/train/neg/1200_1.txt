Very boring, obviously, boring exorcist, who has a red-haired Doberman - that's the magnitude of special effects in this cheap made for television. Richard Crenna is as animated as a chew toy. The dress and music of over 70 years adds to torture. You should let yourself sleep almost as quickly as "Corpse Vanishes" or "The Blue Hand". Virtually worthless. MooCow says what a weird dog is! : = 8P
