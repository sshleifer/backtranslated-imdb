Now this movie will not scare anyone, but it was interesting for two reasons - two big reasons and one smaller one - well, three reasons, is not it. The first reason why special effects are interesting. We found them quite interesting and somewhat spectacular. To see the growing hair on Marsha A. Hunt and Sybil Danning was creepy, especially when they participated in an Ã  trois menu. Interestingly, this Marsha hunt is the famous "Brown" Sugar "of the Rolling Stones song and it was an infamous nude scene from London's rock music distribution. In addition to the special effects, there were two other points to be scored in this movie, and they were repeatedly released during the closing credits. I lost the count, but I swear that Sybil Danning has shared my points in the closing credits of at least a dozen times and maybe many more. the most remarkable feature of the film.
