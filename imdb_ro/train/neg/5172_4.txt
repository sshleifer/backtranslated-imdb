This is the second movie I've seen for Horrorfest this past weekend, Gravedancers being the first. Gravedants were better. I can guess just to see that the production must have been quite limited. I'll admit that the story started to be interesting, but it finally went for me. He did not give us time to sympathize or to understand any of the characters that were only annoying. I have to mention that there was also a little casting with a 12-year-old boy as a sheriff. The only reason I stayed in the whole movie was to find out what a great secret it was, which turned out to be not that exciting. Some family backgrounds would have helped, but they did not really look like a family to start with. For me, this movie is so amateur that I could not even see it on DVD. The top four is for the initial potential the story could have. It was one to jump over horrorfest.
