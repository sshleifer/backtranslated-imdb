I saw the movie as a child when it was released in the theater and it was so bad that it became a family fantasy. If the rankings had a zero, this movie would take it. Dinosaurs were dreadful. The story was ridiculous. The actor really does not qualify for being an actor. The only reason I even remember the name of the film is that my family is still talking about how BAD really was.
