That's how you heard me. I'm a great fan of James Patterson. I have 10 books and I read the whole series about Lindsey Boxer. In my opinion, the screenwriter should be shot. <br /> <br /> What right has a movie producer made to sacrifice a great fiction work and turn it into a mockery of the mysterious genre? If I ever thought Harry Potter was bitten, then Michael O'Hara proved wrong to me. <br /> <br /> I can only pray that the next screenwriter dealing with this fabulous book will do much more justice. For Michael O'Hara and Russell Mulcahy: do not give up the day job.
