I'm a big fan of war films. Some of my favorites are Braveheart, Troy, The Last Samurai, and the Gladiator. And after I looked at the Mongol, which is absolutely wonderful and I strongly recommend it, I had great expectations from a film by Sergei Bodrov. But it was terrible, terrible, even pathetic is not a strong word in this case. The whole movie was expecting something exciting, but no, then I expected at least a big epic battle at the end, but that was a big disappointment, just random running, swinging with the swords ... There are so many good movies of war, it is not one of them.
