5 minutes of opening gave me hope. Then Meyers showed he had only a good idea for the rest of the movie. Absolutely the smallest common denominator. Painful display. A complete work. Undoubtedly written in less than a week, just like the first. Give Meyers the hook and put it in a cell with Adam Sandler and Will Farrell. And do not let him go until he has developed a decent script for something, nothing. He has it in him. These things of Austin Powers are just embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Let the Goldmember sink without trace.
