It was interesting to see how precise the writing was in the words geek buzz, but very naive in the corporate world. The Justice Department would catch many big body giants if they did that naive to win. The real corporate world is more subtle and more interesting, but equally sinister. I seriously doubt that anyone would kill someone directly; even the way is more indirect these days. In the real world, they kill people with nicotine, pollution, additives, poisoning, etc. This movie must have been developed by some geeks in the garage, I think, and the studios did not know the difference. They just wanted to take advantage of a Microsoft antitrust case in the news.
