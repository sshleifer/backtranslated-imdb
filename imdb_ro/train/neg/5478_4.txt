With nothing better to do, I decided to check the "Aztec Rex" (as it was billed) for the hell. The bad story could have played better if the effects of the dinosaurs were convincing. In fact, they looked like animations (those raw models that artists later used to end the effects of CGI, adding more details, more gentle moves, etc.) Absolutely terrible dinosaurs, which is the only reason you would probably want to stay anyway . The only redeeming factor was the wonderful Dichen Lachman as Ayacoatl. He kept my interest; if only the budget was worsened and some convincing dinosaurs could have been used. Disappointing. At least the band and the crew made a free trip to Hawaii, where the film was filmed.
