Ringmaster, Jerry Springer's pathetic excuse for losing the film that should be recycled as a toilet paper has recently destroyed my confidence in the art of the film. First, it was done. Secondly, people went to see it. Third, some people voted for the best movie they've ever seen. If a monkey could make a movie, I'm 100% sure it would be 1 billion times better. Most horror movies have their moments (even Godzilla had some cool special effects), the moment of the movie was when I left the nausea theater. The only thing that could have made this film worse would be if Jerry Springer was the star. If I want to look at the nonsense for an hour and a half, I'll go to a box. If someone does not completely despise this film, I'm sorry for you, your children and the children of your children's children; however, contrary to the beliefs of Springer, obviously do not condemn sexually sexually active children.
