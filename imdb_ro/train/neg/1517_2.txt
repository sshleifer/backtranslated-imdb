In the title I write that the story is ridiculous. I will elaborate below and tell you why, in my humble opinion, ruin this movie. Gere and Danes do their jobs, and although they are not the best works, it's pretty good. The rest of the distribution, however, does a very poor job. Remember, that's not all the guilt of the actors. The problem is that Gere and Danes are the only ones who have characters who even have the smallest room in the movie to really give a deep. All other characters have either too little space in the movie to create any depth, or character is such a cliché that it does not matter how hard the actors are trying. The director has a bit of Se7en complex, but just look at the direction, I think doing a good job. But the story. This is a kind of scenario that is bad in two ways. First, it's a bad movie scenario. Characters are superficial (except for Gere and Danes), villains are clichés, and the actions of the characters are absolutely unbelievable. Besides, writers must have an agenda in which they want to bring our opinions and ethics back for a hundred years. It's a kind of movie that says some criminals are still criminals, regardless of the fact that they paid the price that the company gave it. It is also the kind of film that says, though only between lines, that any form of sexual deviation should be punished without trial, judge or jury. And, of course, according to the film, all that is not sex in the missionary position by a married couple is a sexual deviance. So if you want to film school and you need an example of an evil script or if you write scripts yourself and want an ego incentive. See this. For anyone else, I recommend another movie.
