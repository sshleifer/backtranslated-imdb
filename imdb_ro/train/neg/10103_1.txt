This movie made me go. The title was probably the biggest idea I heard. I thought it was an independent film about a zombie outbreak and their quest to take over the US and a group of single survivors, the band together and the plan to take out zombies. DEAD WRONG! It's a psycho-policeman with a weakness in killing his female arrest that receives what comes to him when a pack of zombie women rises from the graves to get a proper revenge. As you can see, there is nothing about the nation or county involved. Where to start with the severity of this cinematic disaster that provoked our nation. First of all, zombie women look like Victoria Secret models with an open eye and a pale face. What are zombie, but mindless, intelligible and cannibal cars that can eat as a result of their first primary needs? These zombie women walk like streetwalkers and track patterns, they speak as if they were in a weak film Noir and do not act like real zombies. Surely the food and the killing are there, but where is the lack of mind and the horrible destruction? Although it is a very interesting concept and perhaps a great satirical kind of zombie, it makes fun like this and asks the question: "Why do zombies not be beautiful killing machines?" I would say that this film would be considered an evil indie film that was produced and made by garrison thieves. I would not recommend this movie to anyone who loves the genres of zombies too much, is an insult and not even frightening.
