The main flaw of the film is its unspoken scenario. She is spinning back and forth between the vases of Betty's story and the re-creation of Klaw short films. While Klaw re-creation is well done, it is not necessary to recreate them to their neighbor. Page Richards, while not an amazing actress, has a decent job in general. And sometimes he has a remarkable resemblance to Bettie. Remarkable is also a close attention to detail. The costumes and the clothing are well made, as is the established direction. The sets are generally scarce and feel at the stage, but they do not feel the era. It is sometimes surprisingly well lit, and the color palette has been clearly designed to give the overall appearance a vibrant, retro look.
