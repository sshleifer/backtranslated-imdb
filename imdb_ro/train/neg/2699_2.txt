I have not read a single IMDb commentary for this movie that mentions how the Jewish character of this film jumped up and down like a small kid, as a gun is shown in front of him by a racist skinhead, while the black character the lead of the film looked in sternness down the barrel of a gun. I do not know how anyone could perceive this as a balanced report of the university life. I agree that universities are not basics of tolerance as it should be, and the title would be appropriate if Singleton did not make such characters of cartoon. On the surface, he tries to portray the character of Ice Cube as a bad guy, causing Remy to become a racist skinhead. But who graduates at the end of the film's redeeming epilogue? It seems that the singleton to white, whether he can not empathize (I do not sympathize!) With his black colleague or just able to take the path of a racist skinhead. Many people who have been harassed by people of another race do not face extreme bigotry. Even women who have been raped will not return to lesbianism, which is more of a cult than a lifestyle. Pretty honest, what was the point?
