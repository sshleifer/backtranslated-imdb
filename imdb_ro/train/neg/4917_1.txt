**** SPOILER WARNING **** Absolutely no doubt, one of the funniest comedies created for the screen. It is impossible to take all this seriously. It would take a major novel to list all of his comedy routines. During the glory days of her program, Carol Burnett and the company, who often took off on films, cast him out in ways that were hard to imagine. Carol played Jenny, who suddenly fell ill with a slight cough and immediately the treacly music came and everyone looked around, wondering where it came from. Harvey Korman played Oliver with the locks and almost likes Ryan O'Neal. The only thing more fun than this little thing is the real movie. What a scene of death at the end. Jenny really looks dying well ... she dies for her makeup artist to come in and give her some color. And, of course, we all know how often hospitals encourage a loved one to sleep with them during the patient's final moments. The final stage with Ryan O'Neal, sitting on a snow bench that contemplates his future in the movie, is a classic instant. He had a lot to worry about. She has not recovered from that.
