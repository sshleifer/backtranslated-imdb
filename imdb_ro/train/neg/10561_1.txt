I saw this movie in its own time, when a child who did not marry not only ruined your life, but deleted your baby as a bastard. These days of "single mothers", which would seem very distant, but it was very true. And I'm not going crazy about laughing at someone who is angry. Between these two problems I have had difficulty finding this funny movie. At that moment I did not know who I was directing him or what a wonderful reputation he had. I knew who Betty Hutton was, and it just made me nervous because he was so frenetic. I liked "Bringing the child", but I think this movie is just embarrassing. I'm sure the fist at some of the church's functions was probably stuck, but I had to drink a drink after I looked at it again. The idea that a girl should be drunk to "marry" and get pregnant just added to misery. An entire city may be back in these circumstances, so the result of this movie is really the funny part. Of course, shoot me, I do not like "It's a wonderful life."
