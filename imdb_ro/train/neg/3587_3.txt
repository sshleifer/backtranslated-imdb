How can they from Joe Don Baker (like Buffard Pusser in the first sequel) to Bo Svenson (Buffard Pusser in the second sequel). Why did they do that just because Bo Svenon looks more like Buffard Pusser is yet to be changed because the first sequel was Joe Don Baker as Bufford Pusser and one of the things I wanted to see in the second sequel. I would have given a 7 out of 10 movie and would have given it a 1 in 10 if the story had nothing to do with Bufford Pusser's life but it did, and that's why I gave it to movie 3 of 10. <br /> <br /> I strongly suggest that anyone who intends to follow this cheese does not suggest or follow the first sequel.
