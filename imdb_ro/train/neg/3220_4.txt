I absolutely hate it when a movie breaks down completely after you've spent an hour in it. and that's what happened to this movie. I was intrigued by her actors and the fact that malamud wrote her story about the source. I did not go to read that story, but I can not imagine it ends like this movie. Fortunately I did not pay good money to see or rent it because my library had it. such a splendor of excellent action (the wife in particular was so perfect). but milo o'shea as a Jew? !!!! Now it was funny. I did not investigate this, but he played as the director lost the marble or died 3/4 of the way through the film. Before that moment, a story and characters evolved, there were some plot points and there was not much time left. but in the last half hour - if it was not the most deceptive, the most worthless things I've ever seen, I do not know what it is. I just hate her when your faith is so destroyed; it feels like an act of violence.
