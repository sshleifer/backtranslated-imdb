I was expecting a documentary that focused on the North Carolina tobacco industry. Instead, I saw a man breaking the fact that his great-grandfather had lost his tobacco empire to the Duke's family. And this continued and continued. If Mr McElwee's family were predominant over the Dukes, I doubt that Mr McElwee would have trouble with the number of deaths caused by tobacco-related diseases. I grew up near the area where Mr McElwee's family started to do tobacco business; I expected more than McEwee's constant concentration on his family. I learned very little about the history of tobacco in the country's economy and the ramifications of the state's economy by stricter tobacco regulation. The many references to the movie "Bright Frunze" are not in their place - And if Gary Cooper played McElwee's grandfather? Does the visionary gain an understanding of the role of tobacco in the North Carolina economy by presenting old movie clips of a fictional film? I did not.
