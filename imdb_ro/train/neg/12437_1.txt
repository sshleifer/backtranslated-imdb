"Home Alone 3" is the first of the Home Alone films that did not play Culkin as the lead and the same villain. However, the plot is very similar to the original "Home Alone" movie. Instead of two comic bastards, we get three or four of them. This movie involves some traps, but it also has a long scene with a remote car. Also, pleasant humor is consistent, but the boy and the villains fail to make an impact in this movie. (This is not a word game.) This film does not offer anything new or different from the previous movies, and there really is no warm, holiday or subplot of the other two films. It's more of a pure comedy, but it did not make me laugh that the characters did not really do it to me. I would not recommend this movie; it's pretty boring. If you are looking for a good comedy holiday family movie, then watch the original "Home Alone" movie.
