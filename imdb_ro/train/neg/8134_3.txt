A man wakes up from a nightmare about bats. He and his wife go out into the wilderness for a honeymoon picnic. She seems to hear strange noise and is disturbed by the sight of a crawler crawling on the picnic blanket. He wants to go on a cave tour that is related to some kind of work he does, but he wants to enjoy the honeymoon. She overturns. They go on the tour, but leave the group to figure out. It falls on a slope where it is disturbed by insects. He follows it. He again hears the strange noise and seems to know that a bat is approaching; he does, and he gets into his hair. He fights on it, and attacks him, biting his forehead. <br /> <br /> They get out of the cave, but when they are in a gondola at a ski resort, he starts to have crises in which he has the hallucinations or visions of bats attacking people. He gets angry when this happens. He can not drink alcohol without spitting him. His wife worries about rabies and starts treatment with Pasteur, but reacts violently to the injection. And then some people are killed. We see parts of transforming man into a batsman. Apparently it's not just in his mind. If BAT bites cause these transformations is not clear, since he already had some symptoms before the bite. <br /> <br /> While the title seems inappropriate, the end result is that the same thing happens to another person. It's not a great movie, but I liked the variety of desert, cave and ski slopes, and strange scenes. I did not think this was as bad as other people and I did not think the 1999 Lats movie was as bad as the others think (either I appreciated 5/10 ).
