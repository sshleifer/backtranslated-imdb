Oliver Hardy wakes up with a hangover and soon finds out that his uncle comes to see Ollie's new wife and child. The problem is they do not exist - Ollie seems to have done it! So it depends on him and his buddy to find a lady with a child who will agree to present himself as his family. This is not an especially unique idea, as we have seen at least some other silent pants with this exact plot. The best of them was Bobby Vernon's DO NOT KID ME. It is much better than a lot - probably many of them were due to the fact that it was done a decade later - when the comedy became a little more sophisticated and relied less on the useless slapstick. Now I'm not against physical comedy, but in some paper movies, people start shooting firearms, hitting and strangling each other, etc., with small challenges. Unfortunately, at the end of ONE MORE, exactly what they do. None of them makes sense, and it was like just exhausting story ideas. Generally, it is not exactly a milestone in entertainment. It's not enough to pay for watching if you're not an obsessive silent fan like me.
