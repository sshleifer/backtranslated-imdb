I saw 10:00. shows and I have to say that this movie was nothing special. Although I did not let the theater want my time back (as I do not actually pay for movies), I really did not find any sort of ransom qualities. There were a few lines and so I chuckle, but for the most part the film seemed to be made up of a fast-paced fanclub service for the youngest (in the older mind, because this movie is rated R), the audience male. The ventilation service seemed useless and fun. I know you all want to hear Samuel L. telling him his infamous line, but to be honest, there's a lot of hype for a very low pay. The only awful part of the film was CG, which looked very digitized and was not well related to the live action on the screen. Now I'm a reasonable person, I knew I was going to the theater that I would not see Casablanka anymore, and I'm at least grateful that this movie is an original idea and not a re-franchise. However, to be honest, if you are not part of the cult, it's probably best to spend your money elsewhere and see the movie in a second theater show in a few weeks or rent it in a few months.
