Vulpine Massacre should have been this real title. And the line of labels should have read "Guaranteed to make your children CRY!" This is a natural drama that tells of a family of wild foxes in a distant region. Beginning with the encounter and mating of two young foxes and the eventual birth of a large family and attempts to raise them. The only word is made in the narrative of a standing tree, giving a look at the animals loves and lives ... Lovely landscapes and superb animal shooting. Sounds good, right? Well, from there things go straight to hell and then start the drilling to the core ... Spoilers Below - Or it could be a warning! *** <br /> <br /> Almost the first time we find out that one of the foxes is born blind. But it seems to be pretty good, and it's a beautiful musical score to accompany him ... And then he dies ... Then we have a brothers' adventure. And then he dies ... One of his sisters wins the screen ... and then he dies ... And so it happens like a horrible movie, because one fox after another is killed by nature, in traps, just before it disappears, and even a bunch of snowmobiles! By the end of the movie, almost all foxes have been massacred. Although, rightly, death is not shown on the screen. (The least in the version I've seen). Unlike "Tarka the Otter," the deaths in this film are almost useless, and they face the sadistic ones, in the way hopes are built and then eliminated. One or two losses would have been acceptable. Finally, it's a natural movie. But not nearly the whole family. Do not go see this movie cheated by the cheerful box, thinking safe for the kids. Keep track of it with a prior knowledge that things will not work at all and that you or your children may feel very bad about how sensitive you are or are you. You can enjoy it. Or maybe not ...
