this show is one of the worst performances of ALL TIME! absolutely no original joke and always lags a year. as in 2009, they will eventually say something about Michael Vick's dogfights. all cast members are people who wanted to be on SNL but had to go to the smallest of the mad crazy television. In an hour of mad magazine jokes that are not funny to start with, told by the terrible John Stewart wants bees. if you have any problem, tell me I love to hear the opinion of the 3 people watching this show. the family man put it well. "Osama bin Laden was hiding in a place where nobody would look, the crazy television cast. There is a reason why no one is watching the show.
