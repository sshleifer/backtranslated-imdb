I like the time, I like the try, but watching a movie showing that I look at it through a bottle of coke gave me a headache. If I played computer games that were so blurry and unclear, I would upgrade to my computer. Perhaps this was the look that the director watched, but it does not hurt your eyes and you want to leave after 10 minutes. If I had not taken anyone with me to this movie, I was gone. Even if it was a series and not a movie per word, Band of Brothers did this. They made it look like pictures of the Second World War, with only a touch of granulation, but it was still a pleasure to look. Movies need real people with real sets and real locations; Use CGI when needed, not for an entire movie.
