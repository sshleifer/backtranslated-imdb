I looked at this, knowing almost nothing about it, besides the brief description I've read here. After seeing it, I will first say that the director shows a promise, but it seems amateur, then I looked at the other things that he did to see if this was his first or second film, but not , made House on Haunted Hill and Fear Dot Com. He lost the sign on both of those films and it was the same with him. The story was pretty awful, maybe someone falls in love with a girl because she's beautiful, but has a child's mind? I gave it a 3 because there were some visuals that I enjoyed from the end, but overall this movie is pretty terrible.
