I'm the guy who usually retains his opinions, but I just came back from this movie and I felt I had to express my views. Let me start by saying that I am a great fan of horror. But what does a horror film do? I really like to see even a bit of good script and character development. I know that horror films are often missing, but Prom Night did not seem to have made any effort in that department. Then we all love suspense. This on the edge of your chair has suspense with unpredictable surprises. Yes, Prom Night had nothing of it! Of course, we like a terrible killer. Prom Night has that? No, he has a cute boy with a cute knife. And when it all fails ... at least, horror has its guilty pleasure to make it like gore gore gore and the occasional nude scene! Yeah, well, when you have a horror movie rated PG-13 as Prom Night, they're leaving too. So with all these elements missing, I ask ... do this still like a horror movie? Not. I'd say more of a comedy. The people in my theater laughed more at this when I saw the "Semi-Pro", which was supposed to be a comedy (which also sucks, but that's another story!). I think I will have to give up another horror. All of the good horror movies of the day have been remodeled in trash so movie studios can earn money. The people I went with to see this did not even know it was a remake! Which made me upset! I wonder what happens when there are no remake movies anymore? Where will horror go next ???
