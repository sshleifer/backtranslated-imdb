I just rented (yes, I paid the money to see!) This movie. I DO NOT BELIEVE. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. As another commentator, Mrs. Colagrande, left out of the movies, PLEASE! Do not ever make you appear in another movie! The lady has the charms of a song. No, it's not fair to the melon, which probably has more to do. He does not know how to act; it affects a disgusted look ALL TIME (reminded me of my young sisters always disgusted in Europe). It is not charming; she is not beautiful. There is no real story. And editing! There was nothing I could see! It's pretty bad when you watch a movie and, just to go through it, press "forward" on the remote and nothing happens! I mean ... I screamed involuntarily, "Cut! Cut!" What did they think? Obviously, they thought they would make a movie together and would be paid to make love on screen! Good enough for them; pretty first business for the viewer! I think I'm gonna throw now ...
