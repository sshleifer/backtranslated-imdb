When I heard about the "Sunrise" for the first time, I took a distribution charge, I wondered why I never heard of a movie with such a large cast. Then I saw it. Now I know. For a film that encompasses the cosmic space, the sun, the vast deserts and the stretched metropolis, this is a horribly claustrophobic feature; it feels like everyone is hunkered almost together, so the camera will not have to pull too much back. And the effects, while well, are quite overwhelming; we are talking about the imminent destruction of planet Earth if a team of scientists and soldiers can not change a deadly solar flame. But besides screaming, sweating and a red glow about everything, there is no real sense of urgency. You do not understand me about distribution. What Heston, Palance, Matheson, Boyle and others do in this film, without bothering to act with any sense of the material, is the assumption of no one. It makes you wonder what other people's condemnations are not paid in Hollywood .... And all the way goes ... Well, let's just say it's tense and intriguing but it's too little too late in an effort like this . If he kept that rhythm in the whole movie, I might have heard earlier about the "Solar Crisis." Two stars. In large part, for lost opportunities and poor career moves. <br /> <br /> I wonder how Alan Smithee keeps his job doing that?
