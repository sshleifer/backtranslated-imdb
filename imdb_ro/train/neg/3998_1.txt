Can you say "All shocks, no plot?" In this movie there were so many unexplored directions. There was no history of another room than death. * WHY * was it bad? What did he do? Why the "hour" count? Then there were the unexplored things suggested; for example, I saw * a ventilated room, which he mentioned. But when he climbed up, there was no room. How about all ghosts showing "Digital," and things "got out of the way" before they hit the ground making a static noise? Hmmm ... when you put all these things together, make room 1408 look like a high-tech spook house. Except he did not. Oh ... by the way ... the electronics did not work in 1408. Well, except for the TV ... the cell phone does not have a signal, but the wireless Internet works fine. How many instances of incontinence can you possibly add? I'm sorry, but the movie was just shock after shock. Everything was done before. Reflections in the mirror. Things just on the site. Changing the paintings. Wall bleeds. "Oh, it was just a dream ... it was not." And if the room was "bad," why did our main character make us understand her daughter's death if she'd been trapped there forever? It simply did not make sense. In addition, there is no background information about the "First Book" he wrote. Only vague information about "father was a bastard" and so on. Speaking of Dad, what happened to his father? "You will be in my place." Generally, a truly HORRIBLE movie. It was a 100% adrenaline shock factor with no new or innovative effects and no doubt a back story, character development, etc. My overall impression is that the whole movie was made on "Cheap"; pretty much using a set and a few photos of the location, and was nothing but a film of the effects of recycled, cheesy, "seen-like-before" effects.
