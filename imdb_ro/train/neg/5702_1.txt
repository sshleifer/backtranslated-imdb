What a disappointment! I hated the mummy, but that was even worse! It was very tiring and unbelievable, and in a certain moment I woke up longing and yawning all the time. I can not believe people really liked this movie. The role of Nicholas Cage was not very convincing. The whole movie felt like a tour around the most sought-after buildings of America. The flow of tips and combinations that never stopped was not convincing. We turned our attention around for 30 minutes. What was supposed to be a happy night has become a total disappointment. How dear ... I think I've just seen too many movies to enjoy the national treasure.
