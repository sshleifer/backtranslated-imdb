There is no artistic value in this film to deserve any prize. Well, it does not deserve an audience either. Ironically, one of the awards is for cinema, but honestly, the camera moves are disturbing to say the least. Every frame, you feel like you get the "full picture", as if someone "cuts the view" from the edges. The story is pathetic. Well, I'll be honest, I can not bear to watch the whole movie. The part that sucked most was when we saw soldiers playing in the barracks and one of the soldiers rushed to drink liquor. These and many other similar scenes reminded me so much of Steven Seagal. Take my advice, stay away from this piece of nonsense.
