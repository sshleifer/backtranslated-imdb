A warning for potential viewers: If you're looking for an adaptation of the classic "The Most Dangerous Game" story, take a look elsewhere. The "Seven Women for Satan" is addressed only superficially to the original work, using the name Zaroff and having named personalized characters. Some of the following may be considered by some to be spoilers. Or not. <br /> <br /> Boris Zaroff is played by writer / director Michel Lemoine. While his ancestor hunted men because they were the only prey that were really provocative, Boris's victims are usually in a position where they can not defend themselves. The film returns from scene to scene with an almost total lack of clarity. The director seems to have completely ignored the pace of the break and left the viewer with a choked boring movie. Several individual scenes are a little interesting (such as a torture sequence), but as a unit, the film fails to have fun. Spectators who are more interested in an ensemble of attractive and semi-appealing actresses at different stages of stripping could find the movie they are watching. Most will probably find their time better spent watching Mentos commercials. In a side note, the DVDs included a fairly large amount of information about the history of the film. Apparently, he was forbidden for many years in his native France, which has largely destroyed the chance of large-scale distribution.
