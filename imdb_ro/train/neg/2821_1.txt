I just saw this movie once, and that was enough for me. The film has very little if there is a plot and seems to be nothing more than the continuous scenes of psycho-sadistic violence and very little of nothing else. I wanted to see this movie because she played Zoe Trilling of the second "Night of the Demons"; and I wanted to see her playing someone normal. Unfortunately, the Tobe Hooper script barely starts and does not go anywhere, while Robert Englund dominates the film and chews the landscape and plot. Zoe, I know where you are now; hiding from this movie!
