You have never seen a movie and you know that The Jerk Too is a disaster. The question is not how it's done, because if you throw money on someone and tell them to make a movie, they'll do it. The question is, "Why, why did Steve Martin be allowed to do it?" I think he needed money to fight an unpleasant process and was determined not to cost him anything. He knew the continuation would be so terrible that he would not even think that prizes were revenue. <br /> <br /> The only way that this sequel could not be an embarrassment is that Carl Gottlieb and Steve Martin have to revive the nation's favorable black family. <br /> <br /> And "dcreasy2001" (aka Mark Blankfield?): It is obvious that you have worked on this movie in a certain sad capacity and the only way you can feel better about your involvement is to be the lonely cheerleader of the sequel as a IMDb user's comment. I prayed for you to walk in satire, but, unfortunately, you were really making a spinning effort. Why not 10 stars?
