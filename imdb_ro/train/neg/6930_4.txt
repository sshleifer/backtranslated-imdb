Dr. Torture Dungeon is about a journalist who travels to an asylum to write about a new technique he uses with patients. However, the journalist soon finds out that things are not what they seem to be, and asylum is led by patients, and doctors are in cages. First of all, some parts of the movie are just boring and just make you want to fall asleep, and the interesting parts are interesting for all the wrong reasons (a guy who thinks it's a chicken, for example). I have to admit that the story is actually pretty good, but the movie is bombarding. The music of the movie is really strange and something you will hear in a crazy comedy, and yes, there is a scene involving dance chicks, which almost makes me want to close the screen. Watch this movie at your own risk! <br /> <br /> Rated for R for violence and nudity.
