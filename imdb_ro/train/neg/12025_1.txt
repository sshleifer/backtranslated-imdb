This movie was on the romantic channel and I thought it could be an 80-year-old movie that would have liked a certain level so my brother and I looked at it. The boy suffocated. The boy is getting tired of the girl - correcting, his dreaming dream * (apparently there is a difference and I am surprised to realize that it was his dream) - he was hit with it from more than 30 meters away. to show the power of dream girls), the boy ends up masking like a woman to be close to the dream-face (creative in the sense that it is a far-fetched but non-creative plan in the sense that there are probably better solutions who might think), difficult situations are taking place, a match is taking place (all this seems to take place around the late afternoon - either the location has been to some extent responsible for this strange illumination, or the actors have had to wait until they got out of their daytime work to come to the set, I suspect the latter). Very bad done, very pathetic. It's almost never funny * accidentally, so there's nothing to be redeemed. If you are not interested in seeing Chad Lowe's first days before finally taking the piece of HIV-like gay pie on "Life Goes On" or by Gail O'Grady who was on NYPD Blue and probably that he has to stare at Dennis Franz's buttocks). But these reasons are unlikely - I would say "systematic disturbance of the senses" would be a more justified goal. I'm surprised I looked at everything. I think it's a kind of thing that you find halfway around still being noticed because of a morbid, self-flagellious internal problem, and you think you can finish it so you can tell your friends and family that it really was in -a movie so horrible, beyond the chances of gaining a sympathy for the questionable state of your mental health. Can * Take * Challenge?
