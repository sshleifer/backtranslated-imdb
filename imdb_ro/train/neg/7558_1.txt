why do not you waste your time with this useless. movie. A remake that did not have to be repeated. All those who came out of the theater had the same observations. The worst movie I've ever seen. Save your time and money! Nicholas Cage walks on the hills, swims in dirty water and rolls on the hills while being attacked by bees, yet his suit was still perfectly pressed and his white shirt shining until the last scene. Although a good distribution with Ellen Bernstein and Cage, the act was as incredible as the movie itself. It's amazing how good the actors can do so bad. I do not get a copy of the script first. If you still have an interest in seeing at least the movie, expect it to appear on DVD.
