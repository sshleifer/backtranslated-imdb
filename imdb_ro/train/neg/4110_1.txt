It's just stunning in its terrible - you have to see it! Depending on your perspective, Dylan Walsh is either the savior or the problem here: because he is the only one on the screen that can actually get quiet with something like natural cadences and inflections, or ruin the movie, showing the flaws of everyone else or saving it, and a certain context for their horror. I leaned to the last - thanks to it, it works like a high comedy. He is the 7th basement in a diving basketball game, his talent does not apply in this context, and his discombination is delicious. The real betrayal is Ms. Eastwood, whose inability to speak in English is so pervasive, in fact, I googled it, waiting to find out that it was a Russian beauty that pronounced its phonetic lines without understanding their meaning . But no: it's just a talented American who will let you laugh with every line he escapes. If he knew what the line means, it must remain an open question.
