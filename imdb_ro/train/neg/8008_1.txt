For Daniel Auteuil, "Queen Margot" was much better. For Nastassja Kinski, "Paris, Texas" was much better. Chris Menge's biggest disappointment ("CrissCross" and "A World Apart" can not be compared with this) and Goran Bregovic for using a version of the same musical theme in the movie "Queen Margot" for this film. the end of the film). If it were an American pop, I would not feel surprised at all; but for a European film with several actors and independent directors, a similar common approach to child abuse without an original understanding is very simple and disappointing. Those are the bad guys kidnapping and selling the minors. Those are the poor children who hate those who sell them and expect to be saved by somebody. And finally, that great hero who kills all the bad guys and saves these poor kids from the bad guys. Each character is presented in simple black and white terms: good and evil. In addition, from the beginning I could understand how the story will end. Is this the end of the history of child sexual abuse? I think the difficult problem of child molestation and pedophilia is much more complex than the way it is presented in this very little original film. I think this movie was not disturbing but very disappointing.
