As a veteran of many pretentious French films, I thought I took the worst thing the industry offered and was able to stomach anything. But not that. Useless, tireless, violent, unpleasant, meaningless ... The film has nothing to offer and is hate and random aggression, dressed as pretentious art. Avoid at all costs.
