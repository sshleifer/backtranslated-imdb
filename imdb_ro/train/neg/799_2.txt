In some ways, the concept behind the story was a quite interesting combination of several types of typical movies in an interesting combination. However, no point in this movie was so obvious that it does not deserve to remain near fireworks. I felt like I was beaten up with the so-called mysterious explanation for the disease killing people. The writer seems to have simply lifted cliques from other films as a substitute for writing lines adapted to the real characters. The actors did not help things. There is no chemistry. I think he should have developed a kind of attraction, just for the reason that this is an essential element of these stories. However, writers have not worked hard to develop chemistry. Sure, both are attractive, but if they are attractive to each other, it seemed to be an open question. Turner's trustworthy character shows Sabato's development too fast and without any particular reason. The character of Sabato should be a discredited physician who can not play by the rules. Think of Jeff Goldblum's character in Independence Day. Typically, that character must demonstrate talent or glow. Sabato's character does not. He is Cassandra, with only the madness and all the prophetic skills of an eight magical ball. He seems to be right by chance at random. Scenes of death are funny. Each actor tried really more than a bit, to prove the mistakes he made. Symptoms looked like bad plague, like a movie from the '80s, Peter Gabriel, I think.
