Really a disgusting and disgusting film, with only a small amount of real humor. The character of the father, in particular, is vulgar in the extreme (intentionally so obviously) and portrayed in the most pathetic, deceit. My wife and I found this awful horrifying film, with absolutely no redeeming element. Frankly, I wish you'd never seen her. I think this British effort is a sick and gross embarrassment. Those who enjoyed this film have a skill that they lack in all: joy in a show of deep depravity and misery. Manufacturers should be ashamed of themselves.
