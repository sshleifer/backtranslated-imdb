Roommates Sugar and Bobby Lee are kidnapped by threatening guys while shopping someday and returning to an isolated island that the girls say patiently to the beatings they last visited when they had ten and that there is a fortune. Everything that makes a pretty much a movie that is pretty much a long retrospective of the girls' first visit to the island and the subsequent fight with a cannibalistic family. This is extremely horrifically driven by all those involved in showing that I started to feel bad for the poor Hank Worden who really deserve much better. As much as I did not like "Barracuda" (on the same DVD), I must admit that this film makes it look like Citizen Kane. Candy Eye: a pair of sinews might belong to Kirsten Baker <br /> <br /> My degree: Dark Sky DVD Extras: Vintage announcements for various drive-in drives; and "Bonnie's Baby Trailers" (Nudity Features), "Feminine Centers", "Female Part-time" (Nudity), "Psychic Killer" and "Eaten Alive." The DVD also comes with the 1978 "Barracuda"
