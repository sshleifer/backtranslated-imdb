Even the first 10 minutes of this movie were horrible. It's hard to believe that anyone other than John Cusack would have put money in it. With a series of anti-military / anti-war films already destroyed at the box office, it is almost inconceivable that a studio of any kind would like to associate with this script. At first, they looked like a kind of politically motivated derivative of Grosse Point Blank with Akroyd and Cusack (i) again. But just about 90 seconds in the movie, it becomes obvious that this is a trifle-free attempt at DR STRGGELOVE. I liked so many Cusacks that I thought we risked seeing the DVD of this movie. I have to say that I do not know if Cusack is healthy enough to really see another feature that will play it again unless someone can guarantee it. Cusack seems to be so hurtfully irretrievably hurt by George Bush and the war in Iraq that he is willing to commit suicide. Tom Cruise was never close to being so missing. Not even close.
