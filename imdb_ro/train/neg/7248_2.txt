If his law is slaughtered with a vicious gang of thieves, a young deputy is forced to escort his silent boyfriend, forced to transmit the tape rap, to Tucson for trial and ultimately to face with the real killers along the way. <br /> <br /> Decoy is a real bait sent to the video stores to get you away from better movies! It is talc, illogical, slow and, ultimately, very boring. There are some good costumes, sets and good photos, but nothing else is good about this vanity project from the writer / director / producer / star Justin Kreinbrink, who seems to have had too much money on his hands. They used to make the Vestiges like this one, which were under an hour long. Dice it about half its length and you could have something to follow.
