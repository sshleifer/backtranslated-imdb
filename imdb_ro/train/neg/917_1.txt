This movie was made with a very poor taste. The script was very bad. I feel very sad for the late Gregory Peck, who has taken over the main role of adapting film B to one of the greatest generals of history. The film was politically incorrect and unfamiliar to those who fought Japanese during the Second World War. It was a scene I almost shed, showing that Macarthur is in a bunker on Corregidor Island talking to his troops as a politician driven when a wounded Philippine soldier meets one foot. The bleeding and dead soldier manages to rise directly to the general's view and says, "Not Pope, Mother, Uncle Sam," and Macarthur tells the story that Americans "will never abandon" the Philippines. The scene ends with the soldier being refreshed by Macarthur's words and giving him a smart greeting. I mean, if there was a more condescending scene to represent the US as the great white savior of the world, please tell me because it takes the cake. She has shown that the Philippines are damsels in distress who are incapable of honor and must rely on the great Americans only for redemption. It flagrantly and deliberately overshadowed the contributions of the USAFFE (United States Armed Forces Army) members, these being Philippine volunteers who were integrated into the US Army during World War 2, who died alongside Americans battling the Japanese , who went along with the Americans on the Bataan death march and defended Corregidor Island by launching a guerilla offensive after Macarthur left for Australia with the renowned "I'll Return" speech. My late grandfather, a veteran of Philippine War 2 and the USAFFE soldier, was one of many who fought Japanese with honor and love for his home country. I think this film does not honor them and the thousands that Macarthur has invoked for intelligence preparations for his famous return to the Leyte bay.
