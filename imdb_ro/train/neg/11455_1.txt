First of all, to give you an idea about my taste in movies ... 2007 Comedies I Rejoice: Superbad, Knocked Up, Hot Fuzz, Blades of Glory Comedies 2007 Forgot: Evan Almighty, Brothers Solomon, Good Luck Chuck I should have followed my first instinct and stopped "Hot Rod" after I got to about 20 minutes. I knew this movie would not make me laugh once. The script is absolutely brutal - I have no idea how this monstrosity managed to break 6 on IMDb. Any person older than 10 who enjoys this must be a kind of mental defect. This does not come close to anything with Will Farrell, and it is clear that Andy Samberg can not wear anything more than a sketch of 5 to 10 minutes on YouTube or SNL. I do not know how they left Ian McShane and Isla Fisher to make this movie ... they must have had a favor or something else. I came to know it would be a bad movie, but I thought it would be funny at least. I did not feel so much that it impressed me. Normally we do not comment on IMDb movies, but that was so terrible, I had to warn people. This is just the fourth movie I've seen I feel compelled to vote 1/10.
