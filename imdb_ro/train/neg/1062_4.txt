Ouch! It was a bit painful to stay through. She has a nice and fun premise, but it all goes to the hell out there. Matthew Modine is almost always pedestrian and annoying and does not disappoint in this. Deborah Kara Unger and John Neville turned into a surprisingly decent show. Alan Bates and Jennifer Tilly, among others, have played much over the top. I know this is how the songs were written and it's hard to blame the actors when the script and the director make them do something. If you want scandalous characters, it's okay, but you have to have good material to make it work. He did not come here. Run away from this movie if possible.
