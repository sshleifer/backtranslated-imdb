I agree that although this Melville story might be unfathomable, it is not even a credible test. To move the story in the twentieth century, it is just an insult to the intention and nature of the original nature; you might have been able to move it to England, but it has to be an epoch. Even our stories narrator - the owner - tells him in a retrospective, coming back even further, somewhere around 1800. Towards the end of the 19th century a strange disobedient worker would have thrown away. And the twentieth century? Come on! Give me an extinct break! Even around 1800, such behavior did not work very well, given the end. And the movie's over? I do not know what it was, because I did not watch the whole travesty - I had to stop. It was like setting up "Streetcar Named Desire" in Elizabethan England.
