I wanted to read the other comments before leaving my opinion, and most definitely defines: This movie is aweful! From acting to non-realistic animation to countless errors. We hoped, in fact, that the flap had been extended by a stretch of imagination (it can not extend the flap without engines). Landing gear can only be lowered if you have electricity. This small fan that was walking was not enough to lower the landing gear. The only thing I thought was pretty strange is when they landed, the rear wheels touched and then the nose broke off, suspending the plane with both tires back in the air. How did the captain apply the left and right brakes for tires that did not touch the ground? They forgot the spoilers? Director's word: Find out all you can about airplanes before you try a "airplane" movie. I'm sorry for the technical line, but I give this movie 1/10.
