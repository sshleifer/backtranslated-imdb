What a terrible movie. Red tomatoes also had a good sign for this. do not be fooled by positive comments; It was not scary. It was not funny. He was not smart. It will not even take your attention. I lost only 2 hours of my life, watching this crap-fest. The monster generated by the computer was interesting to see the first few times. after about 15 minutes is no longer fun. the dialogue was terrible, it has to be a translation thing. another negative that was noted was the American idiot. 3 were portrayed and all lacked character, intelligence and judgment. Now I'm going to write a few lines to do this because we have to have 10. The shoppers at the video store should have been screaming for bringing this title to the counter.
