This must be one of the worst vampires ever created by men. How can such a fascinating subject turn into a totally uninspired story? Apparant not such a difficult task ... First of all, a conditio sine qua non of a vampire movie is a dark and gloomy atmosphere with a beautiful sexy touch that lacks all these things .. Too much light - spots ! My God, why in Christus / Judas was that? Every time Dracula came, he was devoured by the light (in the scenario to keep it weak for recording: only weak). There was only one scene that almost made it worth watching, near the end of the movie beautiful dance with Dracula and his new conquest). I really liked the first one, Judas's overthrow was original, but that's not good, not in any way. We hope the third one will mark the vampire signature that I like so much in other classics, such as Herzog's Nosferatu, Dracula's Coppola, or even Vampire Interview.
