Patrick Channing (Jeff Kober) is a disciple of Satan / serial killer who holds the "first power": even after he was captured by detective Russell Logan (Lou Diamond Phillips) and executed in the gas chamber, continues to kill at will. With the help of the psyche Tess Seaton (Tracy Griffith, sister Melanie G.) tries to stop Channing. This concept probably had some possibilities, I think, but ultimately "The First Power" suffers from routine scripts and filming. This is nothing I have not seen before, sometimes done better. There is nothing about this movie to distinguish it from other supernatural horror thrillers. Moreover, it is not very thrilling and certainly not scary. Phillips is a strong lust as a stereotype of a cynical policeman, and Griffith does not seem to be trying very much; the best casting member is probably Kober's characteristic, doing everything that's best to be extremely frightening. The climax is rather stupid and ends very poorly. to evaluate as an average movie of its kind, therefore: <br /> <br /> 4/10
