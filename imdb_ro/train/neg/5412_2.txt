Pyare Mohan can safely be included in the black list of one of the worst movies made by mankind. The film, one of the many movies of people with disabilities that emerged after Black's phenomenal success, makes a mockery of the fraternity with disabilities. Vivek Oberoi and Fardeen Khan are simple caricatures of people with disabilities. While Black portrayed the poleness and emotions of a disabled woman and gave us a glimpse into her world, Pyare Mohan shows that two desperado-type monkeys who have no doubt about being disabled and swallowed half of the world to protect their love interests. Anu Malik's music is fairly accurate. Vivek Oberoi, who made a promising start with Saathiya, is losing weight in the Hindi cinema. Fardeen Khan has never been an acceptable actor and deserves to be banned from the cinema industry. Amrita Rao and Esha Deol are just nice, in distress, who had nightmares in Thialnd, with no one to save them - except for the destitute. Iranian Bom, like the bastard Don Toni, is somewhat acceptable. Avoid the movie if possible.
