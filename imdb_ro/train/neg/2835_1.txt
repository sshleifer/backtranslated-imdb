Derekii seem to struggle to find Rolls for Bo after "10". I worked for a marine park in Florida Keys. One day, the scenario for "Ghosts Can not Do It" circulates among the instructors in the "fish house" where the dolphin food was prepared. There was a scene where a -dolphin - probably supposed Bo (or Bo dolphin), asking "to make eggs". Reading the script, I gave her praise - ... We did not make any part of this movie at our headquarters, although our dolphins - in "The Big Blue!" -> <br /> This must have been very close to the end of Anthony Quinn's life. I hope he had fun in this movie because he certainly did nothing for his inheritance.
