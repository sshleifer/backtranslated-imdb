The dead girl's body is found naked by all possible means of identification. When it is discovered that one leg is longer than the other, it is supposed to be the missing daughter's torso. After this trauma, the couple is separated and the mother becomes dependent on the tranquilizers and leads a miserable existence. All this changes when one day, many years later, gets a call from her daughter! With the help of a former cop and reporter, she starts on a journey to determine if her daughter is really alive. "Los Sin Nombre" is a wise plot-wise, it moves at a slow pace, and is completely unscary. The rescue grace is Emma Vilarasau, who has a remarkable job as the desperate mother. The best part of the movie is the end, but I'm not sure it's worth the rest of the movie. Beware of English subtitles about the recent release of R1 - these are not very accurate.
