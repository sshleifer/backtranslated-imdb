This is a terrible movie. What they did was a television show that was never directed to the little children and gave George Lucas treatment (that is, ruined her by calling the younger audience). The Thunderbirds television program was not exactly the most serious scenario, it was actually quite formal, but it was always nice to watch (especially when the models were thrown into the air) and the voice was not too bad. <br /> This suffers from bad casting and bad action (with the notable exceptions of Sophia Myles that Lady Penelope and Ron Cook as Parker, who seem to be the only members who have a clue as to how their characters should be played ) after this transvestite I would not leave Frakes directly traffic. The whole point of the Thunderbirds was that it was about the entire Tracy family and how they worked as a team, preventing disasters or rescuing those involved in disasters. Avoid these trash such as plague. I only gave 1 out of 10 because a zero rating is not supported.
