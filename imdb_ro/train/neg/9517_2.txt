Vincent Minelli films usually deserve your time; Meet Me in St. Louis, the bad and the beautiful. I've been waiting for this movie with great interest. But what a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Some Came Running is the scene after the scene of nowhere-fatalism. Sinatra is a sad sacrifice, coming back from war to discover disappointing family relationships, a disappointing butterfly hung on him, living in disappointing cattle, as a gallon convinces him to finish his disappointing writing project. The movie has an extremely dramatic ending, in which a disappointing character comes with Sinatra and MacClane and something disappointing happens. The sequence is intended to be filled with tension, but Minelli is not Hitchcock; he gets so distracted by beautiful colors, he does not notice the scene is a whistling clich√© and the characters are so thin and poorly developed we do not care especially that they are shot. (especially MacClane) But this is the only real cinema in the project. Otherwise, we look at the conspicuous characters surrounding the bars and living rooms that get sick of the nerves of the others for two hours. Hell is other people, it seems. There is nothing in this movie. The dilemma of soldiers returning to freedom of movement and indifference after World War II is treated with more skill in the "Best Years of our Life". And any of the two Inge products, "Splendor in the Grass" and "Picnic", covers the desperation of being caught in a dead city with much more torture.
