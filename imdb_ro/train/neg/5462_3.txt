This program bothers me! There is no humor and it is too serious to be called "fun"! It's too much for me! The characters are very stereotypical and unattractive. Parcels are redundant, and morality is always repeated. Where's the fun in it? I also feel that this has been on the BBC for too long and is being broadcast too much. Do you really have a T.V slot every 2 or 3 months when a new show ends in episodes? I think it's time for the BBC to get back some of their older performances such as: Gadget Inspector, Bananaman, Smurfs, Snorks, Moomins, Raccoons, and Count Duckula, otherwise than to make continuous contracts at these show- newer! I thought the BBC would bring back the Danger Mouse, so what's going on with that ?! 3/10
