Sean, you know I think you're absolutely the biggest actor in the world, but I can not recommend you for that. Comedy is not even your strong suit. However, it was not just your fault. Some things were too difficult to understand. Alfred Lynch did a decent job, but you have to ask where the lines came from. Again, Sean ... I'm sorry.
