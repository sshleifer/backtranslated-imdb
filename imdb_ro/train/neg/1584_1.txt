I read the man who ran from Kings' books, as I also felt Bachman for the main character John and his family. This movie could have been a lot more. Trouble? It was established during the action movie madness. I watched the movie and I was in pain all the time. I did not feel anything for the character and less for his cause. Yes, they had funny (or ridiculous) scenes, although I think they did not save the movie in my eyes. If you read the book, you can feel the climax and fire from John's heart while he finally gets avenge. I gave this film a small number. It might not have been so low if I did not read the book.
