Burt Kennedy was a very good director, but you would never have known of this misery. Not only is this movie inexpensive, it's cheap - most of the battle scenes are picked up by the "last order" star in early 1955, and the shooting, shot 32 years ago, looks more contemporary than anything in the picture. The few action scenes that were actually shot for this film are disorganized, confused and incompetent, showing just as unclear as the rest of the picture. This has the look of a bad student movie (and the budget does not seem to be more). It moves like a molasses, most of the piece is either a bacon over the head or a higher coma - though the Julia River is better off than most of the rest of the castle - and it is full of annoying historical inaccuracies. Besides, it's too long. If you want to make a boring movie, do it in an hour and so on and do not stretch it for three hours, as it does. If you want to see a good movie about Alamo, check out John Wayne's 1960s or even the 1955 movie, from which this movie stole the action scene. It's hard to believe six producers had to make such a bad movie. Move on.
