Tony Scott destroys everything that might have been interesting in Richard Kelly's fragmented, scattered, clich√© scenario. Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley) was a model that gave up and became a reward hunter. That's her story ... "kind." The problem with this trash is that there is not much of a story, and Scott's extreme graphic scene of each shot acts as a distancing mechanism that makes us indifferent to everything that's going on in Harvey's chaotic life. You just do not care about Harvey. Knightley interprets it as an ordinary, cynical madman who has done nothing to justify our respect. She hits those who do not like it and pours her clothes and inhibitions when she does, but she's not that real, and Knightly is not even convincing. The film is boring. And it's alright, and you're tied to one of the most annoying music scores I've heard for a long time. The last twenty minutes are a bad remake of Scott's "True Romance" final score, and Domino's band will meet two sets of bad guys that are - surprise! surprise! - designed to shoot him with each other at the top of the Las Vegas casino. Unfortunately, this potentially interesting conflagration is totally disordered by Scott and becomes a confusing, pretentious, useless exercise in celluloid masturbation. This is not a brave or experimental piece of art; is a failure at every level because it does not provide us with any entry points for the lives and dilemmas of its characters. Mickey Roarke looks good like a reward hunter, but disappears in the background as a "narrative" progresses. Chris Walken turns into another embarrassing cameo, and Dabney Coleman, always solid, is underutilized. Do not be fooled by this gimmick-like surface. It is a turf no matter how hard you polish it.
