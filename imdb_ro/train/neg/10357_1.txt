I really did not like this movie because it did not really bring the messages and ideas that L'Engle brought to her novel. I read the novel in our English class and loved it absolutely, I'm afraid I can not say the same thing for the movie. There were some serious differences between the novel and the adapted version and it just did not lend any credit to the imaginative genius that is Madeleine L'Engle! This is why I have given such a weak note. You do not see this movie if you are a great fan of L'Engle's lyrics because you will be very disappointed. However, if you watch the movie for entertainment purposes (or educational as it was for me) then it is a good movie!
