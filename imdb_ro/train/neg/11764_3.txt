I have to say that I was really looking forward to watching this movie and finding a new life in it that would separate it from the most boring and too much crafted Mexican movies. I have no idea why, but I trusted Sexo, Pudor y Lagrimas to inspire freshness and confidence in our nonexistent industry. Perhaps because the soundtrack (which we listened to before seeing the movie) sounded different from others, perhaps because he dared to include newer faces (except for Demian Bichir, who is always a director's favorite Mexican film) in his screenplay, with modern social behavior, perhaps because the photo I saw in the trailers was bright and realistic instead of theater. The film proved to be a major pleasure of the crowd and a major defeat. Serrano has to do with the very old "sex battle" as with "all men are the same" and "why all women ..." bla, bla, bla. Nothing new in it, not even that it uses so much common ground and cliché that it ultimately beats itself without leaving any valuable reflection on the female / masculine condition. It is full of ordinary audiences, such as the safety gangs about the clichés we have talked about before (always working always) and the print shows (it is a well-drained film in its context) .. and by cry I want to I say, literally. At first, the more impressive characters, played by Monica Dionne and Demian Bichir, prove to be more pathetic Serrano. I do not agree with Serrano, they should not have been treated in this way except to serve as puppets for the lesson to pass ... he made sure we received his message and we completely destroyed the roles that were the only one solid ground where the story could have stayed. Anyway, it's sometimes a very fun movie and you'll probably have the chance to see it (if you accept to be manipulated by it).
