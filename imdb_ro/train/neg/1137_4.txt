I tried twice to go through this movie, succeeding for the first time - and it was as if I pulled my teeth - and that they did not succeed a second time despite an excellent DVD transfer. Problem? It's simply too boring. If you manage to get to the dramatic scene of the court, which occupies most of the second half of the movie, you did it, but it's hard to get to that point. There are some interesting discussions about "Abraham Lincoln" (Henry Fonda) during the trial. The end touches when Lincoln leaves and overlaps the Memorial Statue above the screen. It's a beautiful, well-behaved story, and so ... but it lacks the spark in the first half and discourages the spectator from standing there. I guess the real Abe Lincoln was more exciting than this movie.
