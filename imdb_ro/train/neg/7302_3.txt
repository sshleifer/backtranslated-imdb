The first five minutes of this film have shown potential. After that, it went directly from something possible to some sort of illegitimate comedy. The best part is I can not stop thinking about Supertrooper because of Joey Kern. I would recommend watching this movie for learning how to make a movie. There are so many scenarios in this movie that one stops and wonders if the entire cast and crew just ceased to care at a certain time. What strikes me the most about this movie is that it has earned $ 22 million in box office and costs only $ 1.5 million. Congratulations on the Lion's Gate because he managed to get the other out.
