I stayed in this movie tonight, forcing me to stay with him, even if I did not care about a character or what happened to her, because the two leaders, Gérard Philippe and Michèle Morgan, were important movie stars of the era and he wanted to see them in "something different," which certainly was. Both gave fine performances, but with disgusting characters. Indeed, the entire film is about a small and outcast town in Mexico, inhabited by almost disagreeable characters (the doctor is, of course, the most important exception). What Michèle Morgan ever sees in Philippe to fall in love with him is never explained. It is supposed to be based on a work by Jean-Paul Sartre. All I could think was that if Sartre's work is something similar to this film, it must be a very mediocre attempt to imitate the new master of Camus Ciuma, who has dealt with a plague in North Africa. well-acting but uninteresting film.
