Well, this movie is amazingly terrible. I'm sorry for the actors involved in this project because I'm sure they did not write their lines. Sometimes they were delivered with a slight sarcasm, which made me think they did not take this movie seriously, and no one who was following that could defeat the monster. As I watched this "unknown creature," I could not believe that there was not much budget or a competent writer on the crew. But if you go look at this for a laugh you will be happy, the movie is shameless to play because I do not see how anyone could look at it and be proud of pumping it directly on the clich√© DVD wants to be thriller action / horror film fight to light.
