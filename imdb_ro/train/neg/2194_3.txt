Clear premise. Very unrealistic. What I've learned from this movie is that over speeding speed out of control to go to the weekend can not be the best idea after all. I liked how Bill conveniently goes out of the car and on the hill with no harm! Unfortunately, the same can not be said for gal. Oh, and the police never seemed to find the car or watch the wreck owner. Lots of scenes, including a simple stripe (still have nightmares in that scene). Weak assistant type and his unnecessary hand. I admit I was intrigued to see what mysterious "thing" was behind the door, but when it came, I laughed. HA HA HA !! The girl really looked sadly angry that she'd wake up again. Personally, I would really like a new body after such an aggressive experience!
