The first ten minutes of "Just Looking" dictate the direction most of this movie has. Lenny (Ryan Merriman) is a 14 year old boy who lives in New York in the 1950s. She has a burning desire to see that two people have sex. Who are the best people he has in mind? Well, his mother and his stepfather, of course! How enjoyable. Unfortunately for Lenny, he is caught before seeing something and is sent to the summer to stay with his uncle and uncle's wife. Lenny's next plan is to see his uncle and his wife have sex. However, the wife is quite pregnant and I do not sleep together at the moment. Then Lenny makes a new friend. He and his friend spend most of their time hanging around two girls. They have a small club where all they do is sit around and talk about sex. The problem is ... it is not done in an innocent, charming way back in the 1950s. I'm not a prude in any way, but I realized it was quite disturbing listening to these kids talking about masturbation, blowjob and anal sex. This kind of hard work can work in a movie like "Kids" (1995), but in this film it just seems perverted. Gretchen Mol is completely wasted here as Hedy, a former bra model that becomes the object of Lenny's carnal desires. Jason Alexander must stay as far as the director's seat. "For better or worse" (1996) it was terrible now. What a waste. 1/10
