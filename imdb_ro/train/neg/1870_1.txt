I always liked the bill because of her wonderful scenes and characters, but lately I feel it would turn into a type of emotional soap. If you look at the promotional images / posters of the bill you will now see either two officers embracing / kissing or something to do with your friends, while the promotional images of the bill a long time ago would have shown something with crime. This proves that it has changed a lot from being an absolutely amazing police drama to an average type of television soap. When I look, I feel like I look at a police version of Coronation Street or something similar. I have to say that I still like the bill because I'm interested in police work and that kind of thing, but I really miss the greatness of Bill. I want to rate it as two out of ten because I have to admit it was completely destroyed by the people who took the bill. Regarding the script and the characters that both have come down, most of the big characters have now disappeared (although some still do believe) and do not say that the newer characters are weak or otherwise, because they are definitely not , but they lack the rough look, personalities and script lines that all the old characters have had because most of the new ones are currently involved in foolish relationships and family issues. Generally, being one of today's television television programs, Bill will always be an interesting thing to watch, but, as I said, he lost much of his uniqueness (if that is the correct spelling) and would now be classified like a terrible and unreal TV soap. <br /> <br /> Recommended to watch a good laugh over the stupid police officers involved - 2/10
