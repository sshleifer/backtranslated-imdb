Medieval wisdom and downward degradation of the classic children's story not only does not have the charm of its ancestor but has no talent for so long. Mike Myers should not be ashamed of himself for his horrible performance, which is a clear cut of what Jim Carrey did, but he should give up acting together. He is so annoying that you would want to beat him out if you could jump straight into the movie. The sets are ugly and the cinema is very poor. I've seen a lot of bad movies this year, but I'm not only taking the cake, but it's undoubtedly the worst movie ever made.
