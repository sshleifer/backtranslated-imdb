I chose to see this movie because it received a good score here on IMDb. But many people have a very poor taste or someone has fixed the score. In any case it was a real disappointment. The film is just as bad and well accepted, as the title suggests. There is no reason to give a summary of the plot - but here it goes: it felt like someone had thought, "Would not it be great to make a film in which snakes were on a plane? And then snakes for some reason would go mad and start biting and stuff? "And that's it! The plot is thin and non-original. Snakes are bad CGI (but it's logical to cut corners on a movie that no one will recommend to anybody!). The actress is weak, and all people are incredibly stereo. <br /> <br /> To summarize: It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen - stay away!
