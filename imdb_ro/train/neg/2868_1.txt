This is actually an insult to the victims and their families of the BTK killer. The events in this movie are not even close to the truth. Why they could not make a movie about real events, makes no sense, because real events are more interesting than when a farce is made. Do not miss even the time to look at this for free. Low budget and a shameful description of events that should not be a joke, which is really what this movie did. If I could afford to give a movie of -10 to this movie, I would. The action was sucked in and seems to have been shot on an old VHS camera in the 1980s. Save time and money by not watching this movie.
