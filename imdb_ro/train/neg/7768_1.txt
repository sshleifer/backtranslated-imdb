This movie forgiven by God is about three unmoving millionaires who gather a bunch of people to play a deadly game and the winner receives a million dollars. First of all, the act is terrible and the movie makes no sense at all. It's not scary, it's so bad to make me laugh, that's why she won that star. The film is not violent at all, but it is quite weak and focuses mostly on the breasts of women all the time, and some of the characters are extremely annoying and whiny. In addition, the monsters in this movie are so brunchy and fake and not scary, that it makes you want to throw something on the screen. Last but not least, the end is terrible. I do not want to give it away, if you're pretty weird to see this garbage. WARNING TO ALL COSTS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!
