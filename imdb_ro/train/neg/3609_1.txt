That was the worst horror movie I've ever seen. I remember seeing it a few years ago when it first came out on the film and for a weird reason I thought I liked it. So like an idiot, I ran to buy the DVD once it was released ... what a tragic mistake! I do not even bother to go into the plot, because it's so transparent that you can see it anyway. I'm a fan of Herschell Gordon Lewis, so I'm accustomed to the effects of gore and evil, but these people take this to a completely different level. It's almost as if they deliberately try to make the worst possible human film ... if that was their purpose, they did. If they intended to make a movie that should have scared you or made you believe in any way, shape or form that it was real, then they did not succeed ... INSUIT! Avoid this movie ... read the synopsis of the plot and you've seen it!
