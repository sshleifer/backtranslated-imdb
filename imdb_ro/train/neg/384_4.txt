I do not agree too much with conspiracy theories about AIDS, but it is sociologically interesting to see the dramatized phenomenon. In the early years of the AIDS epidemic, the suffering and the paranoia of the frightened and dead have often generated such dark fantasies. This was particularly true in the radical and highly sexual political demigod in San Francisco. The city, famous for its beauty, has rarely appeared worse than in this film. A sense of darkness and decomposition penetrates every scene. While it can not be said that the act and the plot are well done, the unique cultural films and the dark atmosphere, at least in part, save the film from being a complete loss. Actually, I found the most interesting interpretation of Irit Levi, a Jewish police detective, Lesbian (?), Crud and cynic. It is interesting, though not necessarily convincing. Highlights: The use of Turandot is an effective reason, and a performance artist, Ron Athey, is a sublime silent cameo.
