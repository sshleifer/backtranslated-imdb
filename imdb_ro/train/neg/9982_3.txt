The story starts slowly and nothing funny happens for a while. All the action is finally, but you will not have to laugh because the movie is funny, but because the story is pathetic. The funniest part is when Harvey "is not Paranoia" Keitel really loses it and the judge starts a massacre. Oscars for this guy!
