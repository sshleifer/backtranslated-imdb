I honestly do not understand why this movie is so good here, or why Bakshi himself thought it was his best movie. I'm a great fan of Bakshi's previous work - especially "Heavy Traffic" and "Wizards," but Frank Wizards (1977) was the last good film he did. After that, he returned to the mainstream, starting with the Devil's Lord of the Rings, then Frank Frazetta with "heavy sword and sorcerer" for "Fire and Ice". What can I say? The story is childish, animation is the quality of TV - I insist that it is much worse than its 70-year-olds - and that "Wizards" had real imagination, quirkiness, a beautiful background art and an underground sensitivity for adults, "Fire and Ice "is designed for 14-year-old boys and has Robinson Crusoe's intellectual influence on Mars. Yeah, if you liked Gor's books, maybe you would like that. In my opinion, however, this was just another blip in the quality slide after "Wizards" from which Bakshi never recovered (although he did some decent TV stuff quite recently) 4.5 out of 10
