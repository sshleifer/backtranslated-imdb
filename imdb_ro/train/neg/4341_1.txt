It was so terrible that I turned off the DVD ... maybe halfway. She was so weak that I could not pay enough attention to tell you how far I did. Although I really wanted to think the image of the young Carlito was somewhat different, I could not buy it. I do not blame the actors because I think the script may have fallen. I've laughed a few times, but I do not think these lines were meant to be funny. It's just saving the grace is that I bought it in a set of 2 DVDs and I would have paid the price I made for the original only. This is one of those cases in which he should have let the classic stand alone.
