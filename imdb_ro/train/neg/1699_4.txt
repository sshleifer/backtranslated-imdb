I'm somewhat a fan of Lynche's work, so I was excited when I found this DVD. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. It's a series of short cartoons that try to look like an unpleasant and disgusting humor. The animation is very raw, no doubt done using Macromedia. Every cartoon has a big fat type that beats his family and generally acts like a robbery for everyone he knows. <br /> <br /> For those who are not familiar with this animation, they will probably be somewhat impressed with it. However, if you have spent much time on Newgrounds.com like me, then these cartoons will not be different from the other things you've seen before. Many of the popular Amateur artists on Newgrounds are doing a lot better than what was featured on this DVD. If Lynch has sent this work to the site, then he will mix perfectly with some of Newground's best artists. But since I saw this on DVD, instead of Newgrounds, I give it a 4/10, instead of 7/10, as I would otherwise be. These cartoons are good for the internet, but with a name like David Lynch, we've been waiting for better quality in both story and animation.
