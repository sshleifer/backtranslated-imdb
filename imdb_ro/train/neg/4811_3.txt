I watched the Canadian film of this film as "The Witching", which somehow made the way to New York State. Audio was pretty bad, had to raise it to about 7/8 just to hear and the soundtrack was often overwhelming dialogue. Orson Welles was a mumbler, worse than usual, and part of his dialogue and others passed through an echo chamber. A ghostly figure that continued to recur, distorted his voice. Some closed captions would have really helped! A group of witches or satanics (the final credits say the group was not meant to represent any real group!) They have a ritual in which they are naked and causes spontaneous abortion by stabbing a doll. The woman who had spontaneous abortion and her husband moved to a town called "Lilith," where she was offered a job at a toy factory. Despite the fact that one of the films in this movie, apparently being the "Toys Factory", we never see it and it only occasionally refers to it. On her way to Lilith, her husband becomes impatient with some of the questions that his new boss, Mr. Cato, wanted to know about their religious persuasion. He leads aggressively and causes another car to get out of the way and blow up. After the police arrive, she takes a doll that has fallen from the car, the second of most handcrafted dolls in the movie. It seems that Mr. Cato and all the inhabitants of the city are witches and that they are the ones who provoked his abortion, though he does not realize it. They want it because it has an innate talent for necromancy, which it did not really know. Some images in the movie have an impact, but generally the film does not involve too much. The film seems a bit tangled, and this is undoubtedly largely due to its re-editing and adding new images. The original version, according to the final credits, was called Necromancy - A Life for a Life. DVD magic would allow us to see both versions on a disc, but re-launching this movie is probably not a priority.
