What to say about this movie. Well, it's a bunch of good students who have some bad drugs and they turn into delinquent students selling a lot of bad drugs to people. Two of these people have adverse effects as they turn into a kind of toxic revenge, and his girlfriend throws a creature growing in the basement of the school. It's all there is and it's 84 minutes. This movie is pretty bad and should be blocked forever. Though this is not right, some people like Troma's films and can watch him if they want. Three films for me, however, are the worst movies there are there. I just looked at it from morbid curiosity.
