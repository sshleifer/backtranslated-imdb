Come on! Get over with the boys in Pakistan. Bollywood can not only make brilliant films - but it can seriously affect a generation of viewers. I'm a fan of Bollywood, huge, but anti-Pakistan, just makes me have too much fun to enjoy script, cinema, action - I'm very happy to see viewers on both sides of the border reject propaganda and there movies like Main Hoon Na that have made brilliant not only because it deserves due to the quality of its Bollywood masses - but also because it's trying to say: gives peace a chance and shows that there are congestion on both sides that are not the masses.
