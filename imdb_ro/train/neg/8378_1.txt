This movie is probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my life! Crying is ridiculous, and the whole "little man" is bad. The whole movie is unrealistic and stupid. Let's face it, it's just a "Black Comedy". This is just a useless horrible piece that should never have been done in theaters. The banknotes are not funny, and the act is terrible. Please, please save your money rather than see this piece of nonsense. I had to endure to stand by the little man for an hour and a half, who wanted to bleed my eyes. I am disgusted that he will think of it too! Who writes this stupidity? Doctors have no talent, as is the case in Hollywood? They make money on this junk!
