Wow ... no words about making this movie, I can not say too much. The cover of the local videostores would have said everything ... nothing but 6 actors / actresses lost on the Scream set and deciding to shoot a movie! budget, but were able to afford nudity and good actors! The style of the substance makes its mark here, except that most of these actor failures continue to forget that there is a plot that has to go somewhere when I read this scenario. After just four or five killings of the so-called murder killer and a confused story about a Murder Club that he thinks the actress is discontented, he's a real club he can join (only if he can cross a girl who hits the car), you want to shake your hands with the closest sharp object to never remember not being too excited about a possible movie like this. I feel sorry for those who have bought this movie and can not find anyone to get it out of their hands. Another example of what is wrong with the growing number of direct broadcasts to horror videos, with no thought to be basically about. Discard it if you bought it.
