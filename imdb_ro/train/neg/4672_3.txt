This movie has some beautiful sets, and Albert Finney does a great job as a ruthless father. The film fails because Jennifer Jason Leigh is too nervous as a daughter and does not fit for the more nuanced and mature rendition of Olivia De Havilland in The Heiress (1949). The feminist conclusion of the film also opposes the concluding conclusion of the novel, Washington Square, whose author, Henry James, has parodied wildly feminism in some of the other novels. As a fan of the old Hollywood and of a great literature, I found this film very disappointing.
