Honey, I Shrunk the Kids franchise was a huge deal and not to mention very famous. I loved the baby, I gathered the kids when I was little. It was an original story and had such an interesting plot! The sets were so stunning, and the cast seemed to enjoy the company of others. Now, dear, I blew up the baby was stupid enough, so I think they wanted to go back to the story everyone loved. In principle, Adam is a bit greener now and Mom goes on holiday to leave their spouses with their children. But when Wayne's favorite element is threatened by garbage, he wants to hold him and keep it, but he and his brother get stuck. But when their wives come back after forgetting to give some medicine to their son, they're caught in the car, leaving the kids alone in the house! The land is silly, but as I was saying, it was just a family movie that I think some might take a shot from. The original Honey, I Shrunk the Kids is the best, I think everyone can agree. The third was not so bad, I would recommend it at least to the movie Honey, I Blew Up the Kid, was at least a little more fun. <br /> <br /> 4/10
