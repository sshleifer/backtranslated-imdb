and does not help Rohmer's case that a few years later, Syberberg came and did a stunning work of great work on the same subject (with little help from Wagner). Perhaps this film did not look so pale when it came out, without the Syberberg movie comparing it, which was probably shot in an even smaller, less resourceful sound scene. In fact, I can not remember at the moment whether there is a son in Syberberg. all I know is that the German version is pure magic, while it looks like a film production documented on film for archive purposes. music ... at musique ... not even credited here on IMDb ... but someone relied on "the air of the 12th-14th centuries" or something ... is not a great help for this movie comes as Neouthentic and Cheesy, comme le frommage mon cher Rohmer is one of those French car fans who like the world's top, in general, and quite unattractive, which does not help. Syberberg's parsifal was adorable and can be seen today by German television selling a kind of special bike he invented ... I woke up thinking about what I'm watching syberberg on the video. I remember the last time I saw the movie in a theater, so bad that the experience was a 5-hour transvestite, but even then it would have had to overcome what this version offers, I'm afraid. for chutzpah, but ... this movie just needs beau-coup more bucks. does not look like a medieval manuscript, looks CHEAPO! BON MARCHE !! oh and yes, it ends very arbitrarily with Parsifal going to the church and this game of cheesy passion being interweaved ... blah!
