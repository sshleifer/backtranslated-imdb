As long as there was 3D technology (I think in the 1950s) an animation was made. I remember especially a cartoon Donald Duck with Chip and Dale in it. I do not remember the name at the moment, but the plot was that Donald was working on a circus, feeding a slippery elephant, and Chip and Dale were stealing the peanuts. This was done to watch in 3d, probably the 1960s. If you looked at meeting Robinsons in 3D in theaters, they showed this cartoon before the film and explained the details of its origin. There are probably somewhere around 100 cartoons made especially to be seen through 3d glasses. This statement was a bad move, because it is not hard to prove them wrong. Besides, this looks like a bad movie.
