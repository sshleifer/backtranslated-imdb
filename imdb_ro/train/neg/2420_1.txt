I usually comment only on the movies I like, imagining "everyone at their taste", but here I want to make an exception. The premise of this film, which seems to be lost, is that these two self-centered adults have the right right to go to Las Vegas, get drunk, get married, and suffer incalculable suffering on their child children. Even as far as cultural stopping is concerned, they have neither the courage nor the sense of responsibility to wake up the next morning and cancel what they have set in motion. After all, "love" is all that's important, is not it? Fuck the others. Whether things "work in the end" is not really the point; is actually irrelevant. The idea is that the lack of respect for others, especially if they are young, and especially if they are in a position of addiction, becomes light and thus reinforced by this film. There are far more harmless behaviors that these "parents" could have done, which would bring an army of social workers on their heads in a heartbeat.
