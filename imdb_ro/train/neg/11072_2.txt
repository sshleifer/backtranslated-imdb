He saw on TV last night. Yeah, I can hear what I'm telling you about. It may be classified as one of those stereo TV soap series. In all fairness, the story line has a subtle inclination to it, and you could say, "Well, that's not what I expected." But, as a film, it is not easy to observe a ransom. Casting, acting, camera, cars, costume, setting, script, no, nothing to congratulate. Rated R ?? That scene. Do we need her? This is a movie you can watch and then forget that you have seen it. And what was the title again?
