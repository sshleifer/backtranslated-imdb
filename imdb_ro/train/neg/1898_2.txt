Remake of H.B. Halicki, the classic seventy-year-old film, is simply horrible. Together with the Dive Point, Gone in 60 seconds is the quintessential movie tracking movie. The remake takes the original and puts it on its head. While Halicki gave us 75% tracking of the cars and 25% support drama, in GISS 2000 we get 25% of the tracking of the cars and 75% of the drama. Cage as a super man, saves his brother, kisses his face. MTV editions, tits and ass. Save your money, rent the original. At least Halicki did not live to see his child (he wrote, produced, directed and starred in the movie "74") degraded in this way.
