Attached to heaven, a band of angry naked angels (with big plastic tines) lived in a terrible forest where they feed on any unfortunate souls who should be wandering. Not long before a group of friends on a road trip falls victim to the babys blood-thirsty? An independent budget horror, made in the UK, Forest of the Damned has an interesting concern and removes it from the pan with some of the worst effects, effects and directions I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> Director Johannes Roberts shows some occasional facts behind the camera? the scenes in the dugout house are quite tense and there are some moments of "shock" with maneuverability - but for the most part, the film is amateur technique. Throw in some really terrible shows from horror icons Tom Savini and Shaun Hutson, and you have a really bad movie on your hands. Some fun can be derived from the courtesy movie, and there is plenty of feminine nudity for boys to enjoy, but most will find this a chore to stay.
