In 2004 I liked it. Then it became very bad. This suggests that children are brainless. He insults the children. Cartoon Network was great. One of the shows I liked was Hamtaro. She managed to be interesting and imaginative in approaching children's programming. Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends is like putting 20 spoonfuls of sugar into Sprite. It seems that today's television producers are only interested in making money, rather than hiring children's imagination and making money! Lately, my children are adapting to the old performances (the '60s) to find something interesting to watch. Perhaps, in the absence of originality, television should look at its past and recycle the children's programming in the past few days.
