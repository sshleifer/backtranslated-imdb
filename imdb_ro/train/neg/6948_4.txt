An interesting idea (four African American women crushed beneath the sack of society is avenging bank robbery) is ruined by the horrific direction of F. Gary Gray and a horrific scenario (by Takashi Bufford and Kate Lanier) full of unintentional moments of amusement. Instead of providing an underlined commentary on the role of urban women struggling to stay afloat in a world where people abuse and humiliate them, Gray, Bufford and Lanier prefer to beat their audience without listening to them with nobility of opera tragedy. It's the melodrama at worst. Gray has his actors sleeping on every tired line, and John Carter's lazy editing refuses to lift his weakness, choosing instead to keep his camera trapped on the confused faces of performers. And they are unhappy: although actors such as Jada Pinkett, Kimberly Elise and Vivica A. Fox have a raw talent (Regina Latifah is fourth and as an actress she is an excellent rapper) they need a safer hand than Gray to guide them and consequently appear in front of the camera. Manipulate clearly.
