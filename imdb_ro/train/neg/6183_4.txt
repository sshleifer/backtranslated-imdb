In 2005, George W. Bush began with the second period of president of the United States; North Korea has announced its possession of nuclear weapons; Pope John Paul II died after a long illness; and a movie titled "Into the Blue" appeared. The existence of this film is not as bad as other things that took place that year, but the film itself was pathetic and maybe the worst of that year. The United States have another president, there is another Pope, the new Korean nuclear weapons ... and the movie Into the Blue 2: The Reef, which is better than the original ... but it's the same thing: "Getting your fingers cut "This sequel is a very bad movie that has kept me extremely bored and uninterested. Into the Blue 2: The Reef's vision is composed of actors from the TV series that are completely lacking in any credibility and drama Greens and Alias, Laura Vandervoort (Smallville), Marsha Tomason (Lost) and Audrina Patridge (The Hills) have bare and boring performances. I liked several earlier films by director Stephen Herek (Critters and Bil and Ted's Excellent Adventure), but on this film he can not even generate the minimal level of tension, excitement or entertainment. The character in this film is not only fulfilled but also repulsive. to die. The movie in this movie is also lame and seems to have been made by a technical team that makes promotional videos for hotels in Hawaii. In Blue 2: The Reef is a terrible movie that is better than the original movie, but it's the same with nothing, as I said before. Avoid this movie at any cost.
