When "My Deja Vu, My Deja Vu" broadcast last season, I was pleased. Scrubs, I thought, do something smart and unique about the concept of the clip-show. Instead of playing back pictures, they play jokes in a self-conscious manner, and I enjoyed it very much. It seemed very regrettable to me that I was wrong. A season later, they gave up what almost all the sitcoms inevitably do, the show of clips ... and it seems to have been put together by the child of experience. Cox's race shows how lazy the publishers were to put together, because it does not appear again until "Long Long Goodbye" after 4 episodes later. I can not imagine that a wig is too much effort when it comes to maintaining the continuity of what was once a well-built sitcom. Who knows why he was scattered there seemed lazy and out of place, reminding me (to a large extent) of the episodes that had been broadcast in the last year. Three second clips locked together with background music is Extra DVD for a (very) rainy day, not a primetime television episode.
