The original was a good movie. I bought it on tape and I saw it several times. And although I know that the continuation is usually not as good as the original, I certainly did not expect such a bomb. Romanticism was flat, eyes were old, humor was not. Maybe it was not the worst movie I've seen, but it's coming.
