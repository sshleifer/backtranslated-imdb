Was there a single positive film? Critics who did not know anything about video games could see the errors made. There were no damage done with visible damage at first, being a primary example. And maybe I lost something, but it was not Super Mario Bros. 3 suppose it is a game that has not played before? Well, if that's the case, and I did not miss anything ... how did Fred Savage's character know, and even the little girl, so much about the game? We talk about things that some people do not know in the second or third game. Beyond the factual and game errors, there is the overall low quality of the movie itself. Nothing is here honestly memorable. The child was not that good at playing video games in the filming they showed. Many children I met in those days were more experienced. Above all, action and story are only mediocre in their strongest points. Characters are unfortunate and totally uninteresting, "Wizard" (the youngest child) is a very silent, completely dry clich√© of a little child who almost does not talk about a trauma. It is not that this is unrealistic, it is that he had to be thrown into the movie to start even forming a plot that exceeds even 30 minutes. Frankly, the only value found here is nostalgic. If you grew up with this movie, you would like it if it was good or not. These were children playing video games, and at the time you saw him, you probably have an obsession with the SNG. But if you did not love him as a child, there is nothing that will keep you interested and very few things that will stop you from stopping him. No sir, I did not like it.
