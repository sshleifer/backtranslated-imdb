First of all, I would like to say to all who have seen this film that the actor who has played the transvestite is one of my friends, his name is Robert Dugdale, he is a terrible actor, although he does not say much about his filmography, he it was in several tracks and musical. Currently, he lives in Terasa B.C. where I am, comes to us every week * laughs * Okay, now about the movie, I would not recommend this to anyone who has NOT seen you, because it is not a movie worth watching, the main reason I gave realizing that it's a bad movie is that it never stays in place, continues to return in the meantime, so hard to follow at certain points, and secondly, laughs * it really boring. the film does not compare.
