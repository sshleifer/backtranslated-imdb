For some reason, the TV Guide gave two and a half stars, and Faye Dunaway is in it, so it certainly looked like something to see. I, this, may be the worst movie I've ever seen. Ever. From her terrible acting (every time the little girl asks the boy about what's wrong with him, I shouted on television "I can not act!" When she asks what she needs, I cry, "I need lesson lessons! "To the incredibly bad (" Give me back my organs! ") And also Brian DePalma that ends, was still awful, I wanted to like him, Dunaway is one of the best actors and productions have been good enough, but, wowzers, this made me laugh, LAUGHING !, most of the time. she was certainly the second, the third and the fourth.
