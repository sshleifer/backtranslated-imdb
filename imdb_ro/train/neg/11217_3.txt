So my wife and I just finished, despite several threats from both of us that I stopped her. Mostly boredom was the worst part of this movie, it was just a little less enthusiastic. The act was atrocious to the point where I chuckled several times during worse scenes (for example, the lady of the church). The dead sister used paranormal means to get in touch with her living twins, although she was rather sending useful information, she was concentrating on trying to scare the hell instead, which seemed very similar to the Ring. Later, take the involved police - which I'm sure the ear bags that she discovered would have DNA over them - instead, she conceives a horrible plan to "get" the man who covered the death accidental sister. I call it a terrible plan, because it finally allows her to kill her, and the film fades into black. Bad dialogue, bad action, bad.
