Very bad action and a superficial story. Not even a decent B-Movie An event that was shocking as the people who boarded an alien ship were boring and very lazy. This is one of the most serious sci-fi I've ever seen. I saw the 5.0 stars and I decided to watch her because I like the genre, but it was so bad. Now there are very few good movies on the ALIEN topic, I think most of them have a low budget <br /> <br /> They give it 3/10
