How to get the Ace! You just made a terrible, interesting story about a necrophilic cannibal in a soft, sweet drama. Obviously, a film called Dahmer would be one of two types: Horror or documentary? There was none. There was almost no detailed deed (actually only if it had no substance) It was not really morbid or scary or did not try to be very disturbing (as if you had to try it!) What the hell was it this writer / director thinking? Here's one of the most real examples of serial killers in bad and bad shooting, fast rape in gay men bars and long flashbacks, right in the parent's home. I think Jacobson is trying to present (or invent) the "soft part" of J. Dahmer.
