I can not imagine anyone wanting to watch this movie in a million years. Not because it was one of the worst ever made (it was not), but largely because it is about 20 years old and oh-so-out of the mainstream. I was trying to figure out where I saw an actor before, and that's what happened. So yes, a child stops playing the small league because he does not like disasters, which leads to major media attention and a quick resolution of the cold war. The end. A fantasy, to be sure, but such a cockroach would make John Lennon smoke. Since terrorism has replaced communism as the "scaremongering" society, this film has no relevance, except for an inconvenient look in those times. Scenarios of writing, acting and film are similarly underdeveloped. The reason I rated it as much as I did was because I saw this movie about 50 times while I was 5-6 years old and still have a small place in my heart for it but now I realize it's not really cut mustard. So if the law of the big number is true and someone finally decides to visit this movie, realize that there are much better ways to spend your time, but much worse. (I will now refrain from a shooting of John Q.)
