This movie was like "Disney Channel after Dark". Remove the language and "we are not naughty" themes and you are left in dialogue and plotting devices that insult the intelligence of anyone who does not describe Saved by the Bell as quality television. This solemn and dirty dialogue can be thought to have been the outcome of the closure of Aaron Spelling and Joe Eszterhas in a room with an order to produce an amalgam of any evil scenario that everybody ever had a hand of creation. If that were the intention of Roger Kumble, the mission was accomplished.
