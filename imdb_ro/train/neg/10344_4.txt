It was seen this film ran off working hours on TCM. More problems with the movie were obvious from what I saw. First of all, adults did not get older when their children did for 10 years. Several parts of the film had problems of continuity, and for some reasons the actor who played the youngest son was the oldest when he was 10 years old. <br /> <br /> The copy I saw was missing about 20 minutes or so, at least a huge gap with the black screen appeared. It's too bad, because although the script has left something to be desired, Bergman & Russell did well in the film in their roles. It is a shame that the big piece is missing, but what is here is being pursued. I just wish it was all intact. Does the script have any meaning in the fact that Bergman's character is sent when the children are small but then brought back to take care of them when they are adults? Some of the time lines make no sense. There is an accident in the stock market that resembles 1929, but the children are growing to fight in the First World War. Everyone who acts by the support people in this movie is fine. I just wonder what was in the movie 20 that I could not see because it was missing.
