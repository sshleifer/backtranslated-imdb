Ah, Bait. How do I hate you? Let me count the ways. 1. Try to be funny, but you are disgusted and unhappy; every joke is predictable and awaited, and when it comes to it, it does not inspire laughter. Instead, I want to throw. 2. Try to be dramatic, but you're incredible; the woman is terribly upset, and the "bad guy" looks like Bill Gates and it's as scary as ... well, Bill Gates. (Trying to imagine that Bill Gates is trying to intimidate someone with a gun, it does not work, is it? A lawyer, maybe, but not a gun, does not fit.) As for Jamie Foxx, to provide a dramatic and sincere dialogue is ridiculous, and makes me want to throw. 3. Try to be actions, but you are boring and trained too many times. And when the action heats up, the room tripod must have been lost, because the scenes were spinning more than the Blair Witch Project, and I feel nauseous and once again I want to throw myself away. 4. Try to be a good movie, but you did not succeed, you did not succeed, you did not succeed! I prefer to go barefoot over the Sahara with a pack of beef and water without sunscreen and only Meryl Streep for the company. This hell would be more beautiful than a minute longer by looking at everyone in Bait to overcome his way through a stupid story written with Bill Gates for a bad guy and not even talking about the massive bomb that goes out in a machine that Jamie Foxx's character just led OFF CLIFF, but manages to get away ... just kill me now, or do the right thing and promise me that somehow I will never have to see a movie that it's so bad again.
