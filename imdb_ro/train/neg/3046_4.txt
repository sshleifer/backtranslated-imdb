I saw the first movie when I was 10 years old. My mother bought it at local Kmart because it was on sale for $ 5 per VHS. She thought it would be a beautiful Christmas movie for me and my brothers to look. This movie, however, scared the hell out of me. You might wonder, how could a Santa's movie scare someone? The movie film revolves around Satan, sending Pitch on the earth in an attempt to kill Santa and destroy Christmas. Correctly, Satan sends a demon from hell to kill Santa. Pitch crosses Santa on Christmas Eve, trying to catch him on the ground when the sun rises on Christmas Day, for if Santa does not bring him back home, he turns into powder. Do not get me wrong, the movie is fun and pretty fun, but the image of the demons and devils dancing in the depths of hell (which appears at the beginning of the movie) is just creepy.
