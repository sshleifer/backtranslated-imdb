I had to close this after about 15 difficult moments. I hoped it could improve, what I saw was badly acted, directed and written. <BR/> <br /> This movie should never have been released directly on DVD, <br /> <br /> The main character, who is a top bride from HELL, has a huge ice sculpture that he killed her. It was such a revolting person that I did not even feel sorry. Eve Longoria portrays her and I hope I never see her again, she can not even act. She is just annoying. Paul Rudd an actor who normally can not do any harm also was in this dud. <br /> <br /> Jason Biggs (no longer a teenager) is also present <br /> <br /> I like the comedies, but not the bad ones about stupid people. <br /> <br /> Rating: * (out of 4) 30 points (out of 100) IMDb 2 (out of 10)
