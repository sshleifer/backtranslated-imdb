I saw this movie in the city of New York. I waited a bus the next morning, so it was 2 or 3 in the morning. The rain was raining and he did not want to wait for PORT AUTHORTY. So I went across the street and saw the worst movie in my life. It was so bad that I chose to stay and see the whole movie, I have not seen anything bad since then. The year was 69 years, so call me crazy. I just stayed because I could not believe that .........
