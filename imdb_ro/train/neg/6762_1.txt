This is the kind of film that everyone involved should be ashamed of. Poor targeting, top action, and a plot that stretches for no other purpose than to show violence. I thought when I saw it for the first time that it would probably be a satire of the press and what the violence looks like, but it is not. I'm not sure what makes the movie worse. Stone Oliver has the worst director. From scenes where Woody Harrelson's face has no reason or the terrible interpretation of Robert Downey Jr as Wayne Gale, a reporter who seems to be a freshman, this film is simply a mess.
