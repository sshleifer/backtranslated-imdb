I do not understand. Obviously, the movie has a pretty good budget. He has a very good cinema. He has a beautiful nuisance, good editing, and pretty good direction. Then why did not they hire someone to make a final rewriting of the script, so they would not be so damn and because they hired such bloody actors who can not get out of a paper bag? This movie could have been good. He often looks good and feels good, but in the end, you realize the movie was not good at all. So I would say it's a good production, but a bad movie. Too bad in fact. <br /> <br /> And eel? Come one, really!
