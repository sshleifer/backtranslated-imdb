This does not match the Castle of Cagliostro. Lupine is not as funny, lucky or overactive. The landscape and the music are uninspired, and the plot is not interesting. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this one is the nudity (only in the flat version) offered by Fujiko. He helped eat boring scenes. CoC had a formidable villain and set the film for some imaginative sets. TSoTG locations are not very live or engaged. <br /> <br /> Zenigata, Goemon and Jigen do not even offer decent fun at this moment. It is as if it were just a contractual obligation through their appearance. <br /> <br /> The DVD is in full frame with Dolby Stereo sound. It has a decent amount of extras, including some trailers. But a curious thing. There is no selection of the chapter on the disc or the time code displayed on the player after you have inserted it. Although you can switch to the next scene number using the remote control.
