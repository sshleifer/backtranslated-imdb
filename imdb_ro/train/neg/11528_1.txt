Anyone who wrote the "nice" post about this must have been a friend of these guys. This is bad even for the back fighting. In fact, this is not even a wrestling backyard indeed, it is a few boys hitting each other on a trampoline. Each guy has about 45 lbs wet and there is no one ounce of entertainment in this. There are only a few bored children who even give a yard a bad name, if that is possible. If you want to see a rainbow entertainment fight, take Backyard Wrestling A Pleasure for Pain. The two big names in BYW, MDogg20 and Josh Prohibition are shown. These guys are good. They actually went from her yard and became professionally trained as "true" fighter professionals. They have become laws and have become enriched. I recommend checking the two guys. MDogg is crazy and out of the hook. So do not waste your time or money on this frightening DVD, there are "better" videos in the back yard.
