Fleet is not really a movie. It's a movie right, with wannabe actors. Without including Richard Gere, he gave excellent performance, but when only one of the actors really gives his character, and the rest of the cast only acts ... the result is pathetic, just like this movie. You see, the idea of ​​acting is to hide the fact that you act. What the hell did Claire Dains do in that ?! She is the most inappropriate actress for this character. In 99.9% of the movie, she seemed extremely out of place, out of everything! The only thing he did was ask stupid questions like "do you really think so?" And making silly faces. I was embarrassed by her acting, seriously, and I liked it ... It's the romantic movie type, I do not know who chose between all the actresses out ... LOL and seeing Avril Lavigne ?! this really made me laugh ... Anyway .. If you want to get the feeling of blowing up, this movie will do the job for you !!! I would like to vote -5 ..
