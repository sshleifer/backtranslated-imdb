... for one of the most serious Swedish films ever ... forgive me for being boring. First of all I did not see the first (I'm bored, this is my reason for watching 2 before the first), I hope the first one is better than that, it was full of weird scenes and very strange plot changes , for those who have seen this, and I think 4/10 is great (believe me so do), but it made me laugh a few times, because it was so bizarre and so bad and laughing, to the punk that came up with this idea, what's later "Det sjunde inseglet II". Sequels that do not rely on the novel or books do not turn very well into many things, and this is a perfect example of one. Okay, I'll be honest with you: I laughed a little, took a few decent jokes in him and humor of slapstick. But do not buy it, rent it. Just let another idiot do it or download it. 4/10 This movie will be remembered and the director is probably laughing out already ...
