Here's a cool, exciting little movie that strictly gives the phrase "low budget" a horrible name. Our physics teacher, who has about nine children, creates a weird serum that causes "molecular reorganization." Students are hopelessly killed by the false coincidences of submarine sandwiches and school supplies. Sounds like a resurrection of classical B movies in the 1950s, right? Nope! It's not an example of big camp fun, which is the WAY mode on the bookmark. A showcase full of charm and pockets gives us the pleasure of pleasure, opposed to the horrors that should first have 99.44% more. The best entertainment from the base of the barrel, helped by the red blood dump and the dead bodies of the students. Atrocious films like this would make GURU THE MAD MONK (1970) catastrophic, the work of a clever brilliant who has a master's degree in film production! It's an automatic "F", so rest easy!
