This is the most bleak collection of clich√©s, placed together on a straight line, with no discrete plot or no decent way of action that I have seen for a long time. The cannibalisation of Star Wars scenes, Reign of Fire, Godzilla, Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, led to a total war on the viewer's intelligence. Was this good movie? It was not a movie at all! Even if it does not go so low to be fun and get the status of cult as a comedy, the movie offers some laughter. The trick is to put scenes copied in the context of original movies. Gandalf can be funny speaking Korean, basilisk looking for a hilarious snake if we compare him to a kitten, and the evil kid can offer a lot of fun going back and forth between Sauron and Jaja-bing or whatever his name is. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: Any pleasure derived from this film is completely dependent on the state of poisoning and imagination of viewers, not the director / writer. Shame on you, Shim!
