Scary Movie 2 was a great disappointment. Simply referring to movies, such as Mission Impossible 2, does not lead to comedy. The film opens quite well with a funny scene of white people and an excellent use of James Woods and Andy Richter. The movie falls unhappily. The act is terrible. Tori Spelling looks and behaves completely out of place. The movie seems to be hacked together and is surprisingly slow. Some of the longer bands in this movie with a snail, involving joints and a Tom Cruise movie mentioned earlier, were not fun for anyone in my theater. The film, fortunately, comes to a stop at 83 minutes into a shocking end of unhappy. (I say shocking, because the end does not even try to end with humor) I do not know what else to say, except that it is a continuous continuation in a hurry to make Miramax more money on the back of stupid teenagers. Generally, a very bad movie made.
