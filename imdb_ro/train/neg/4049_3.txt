I did not like this Bill Murray when it was first released in the 1980s, so I tried to see it again to see if my disapproval for this movie was up to my movie tastes in the '80s or it was that "Stripes" is simply a bad movie. Well, the verdict is in, and "Stripes" is a bad movie. Now, "Stripes" may have been an innovative comedy in the early 1980s, and may also attract people who have gone through core courses or who are Bill Murray's fans, but it's still a bad movie. Why is it bad? Especially because "Stripes" should be a comedy, but it's not that funny. There are some laughs, but they are few and far away. Most of the film is consumed by the dramatic plot that is incredibly complicated and not very exciting. This lack of comedy is particularly noticeable if you are accustomed to more contemporary comedies, such as Anchorman, who strive to laugh in every part of the movie. Stripes still suffers from Bill Murray and Harold Lack of Ramis's ability to act. Bill Murray is a great comedian, but he was not a dramatic actor at this time of his career, and Harold Ramis plays Harold Ramis. These two are not good enough as actors to wear the dramatic arc of the film. Ultimately, most of the comedy that exists in "Stripes" revolves around Bill Murray's self-centered, intelligent-alec human-child character, so if you do not find that the funny character (as if I do not) you will not find most of what little comedy there is in the funny "Stripes" either. <br /> <br /> "Stripes" is very much a movie of his time, he did not get old and not worth watching. If you want to watch a "friend" comedy in the 80's, I would recommend "Crazy News". Like "Stripes," humor in "Crazy News" is not as fast as in contemporary comedies, but unlike Stripes, it ages much better and as a result is still being watched.
