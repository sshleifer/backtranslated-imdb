We all know that the countless boys rated the slasher genre of the 80s and often deserve nothing more than our deepest disgust. Maybe it's a bit of a hurry, but damn it, if "Slaughter High" was not terribly non-original, even for a weak blow. Quite a lot, the plot involves a child who suffered a Carrie hysterical shower in high school and returns to the dilapidated building to seek vengeance on a group of former bullies who all seemed to remember. As you would expect, they are constantly killed by a lunatic madman on April 1th through electrocution, burning, hanging and chemically modified beer. I have a series of issues with details about the scene and the settings of this movie, but taking into account the final, I feel the need to quit my complaints and say it is a waste of time. Ignore any thought to watch this movie ...
