Normally, I'm quite willing to like low-budget gonzo movies, but Darkman III is so horrible that I feel nothing but contempt for him. It looks and feels like a TV show, one at that. The sets are rare, the flat lighting, the scores and the effects are separate, and the camera is the film school 101. There is no plot to talk about, the characters are dimensional and the actors are sleepwalkers. Most of the cast shows that they should make soft porn ... In fact, the only reward I got from this misery was to see the stunning stunning Roxann Biggs-Dawson (B'Elanna from Star Trek: Voyager) without her makeup. Her skin tone is about two lighter shades than in Voyager; whether she was bleached for this role, or that she was blackened for Voyager. Very strange the same.
