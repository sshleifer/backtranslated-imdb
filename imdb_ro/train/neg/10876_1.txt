What the hell of a movie Was this? Bad acts, bad bad effects and the most serious dialogues / stories I've ever encountered. The only great thing here was Coolio, who had a beautiful camel like a scared policeman. However, the rest of the film is terrible and boring. It's not that bad, you can laugh at it. Just nonsense. And whoever compares it to the Evil Dead series could compare Tomb Raider to Indiana Jones (well, well, at least there was Angelina Jolie in Tomb Raider)! 1 out of 10
