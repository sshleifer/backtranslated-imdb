A scientist (John Carradine - sad) learns how to bring the dead back to life. However, they return with marble faces. In the end, all this leads to disaster. A boring trip, predictable in the 1940s. This frightened me when I was a kid, but now I'm bored. I had to fight to stay awake! With one exception, the act is horrible. Such boring actors! Hopeless. There are some good things about this: Carradine, despite the script, actually offers very good performance. And there are some gruesome moments involving a ghost of a great Danish going through the walls. There is also one of the heaviest knockouts in the history of cinema. However, none of these things are fun enough to be able to sit around here. Avoid.
