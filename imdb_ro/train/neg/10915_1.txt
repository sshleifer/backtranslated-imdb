I think war films should try to convey the terror of the war, avoid idealism and respect some rudimentary military principles. Zvezda is barely doing the first. Zvezda being a Russian war film, I was expecting patriotism, sentimentality, beautiful pictures, a lush score, slaves and cruel rhymes. What we did not need was naive misappropriation, unrealistic war scenes of war, and the abuse of the soundtrack in a movie that carefully avoids all historical or political references (Stalinism, Nazism, Holocaust), but insults our sense of history about " the liberation of Poland ". An opportunity missed like a movie, but not as an apparent propaganda.
