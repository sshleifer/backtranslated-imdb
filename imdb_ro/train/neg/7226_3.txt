I like comic books. Although I have problems with fully understanding the stories? visual style is unique with all dirt, dust and disintegration. So I thought I knew what I was doing. Surprisingly, did I understand the main plot? but some extremely stupid decisions if they are made for his visual style. <br /> <br /> I mean - very carefully "CG human actors" in almost UPS? ??Why?! It did not work at all! Horus - and the other Egyptian gods - was successfully made in the CG and very close to the comic version. <br /> <br /> I think with real actors this movie could have been a cult movie. <br /> <br /> What a pity.
