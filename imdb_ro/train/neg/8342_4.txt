Rescue: 4 out of 10. Groundhog Day meets a horror movie with the Christian Coalition. Okay, maybe it's not that bad. But it's close. Claire (played by Alicia Silverstonesque Lauren Currie Lewis) is tracked and possibly killed by a serial killer (Chris Ferry, who is quite threatening and brutal). I say, perhaps, because it wakes up and everything was a dream ... Or was it? (Cue Music) The basic question of the film is that these fifteen minutes of plot (Made pretty good first time) are always repeated. And since Claire wakes up every time, and each scene is clearly a dream or an alternative of reality, I just stopped taking care of what happened to Claire and started wondering what a bad luck I wanted at the end to pull this together. was rooted for a session (which, frankly, would have made more sense), but obtained one of those too obvious at the end of the half-surprise (Think of the village or below). The movie collapses faster than Donnie Darko's directors have cut. All the big endings of the Sixth Sense Horror movies, The Original Snatchers Body Invasion, Happy Birthday to Me worked because the audience did not expect an explanation of the left field. (Heck, even canoeing ending on Friday, October 13 was worth a jolt) Save, on the other hand, twist shouts end with each scene change. Other birth defects are the piano soundtrack (although the recommended songs were decent), the obvious fill time (Claire making the dishes, Claire's mother's submarine), the way Claire says "hello is someone there" every time thinks there is a series (especially Claire's mother, played by Maureen Hollander, which resembles a Mary Kay zombie), shows that the budget's roots of the early-stage actor. <br /> <br /> So overly intelligent and not too smart enough Salvage keeps his interest if only to see how they will fix this mess. The problem is that it does not really.
