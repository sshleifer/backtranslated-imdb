I was expecting Grendel, the book written by John Gardner in the late 1970s. He relied on the Beowulf epic, but he said from the perspective of the monster. <br /> <br /> Anything you might think about Gardner's book, a film based on the Beowulf epic should not be justified by Grendel, when he says nothing more about the monster beyond some pathetic scenes in which monster CG is presented as nothing more than a modified Predator. In addition, writers should also be punished for stabbing the original story so seriously and contributing to the growing ignorance of the mass-market television audience in the US. <br /> <br /> Typical Hollywood to get this so wrong. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing and a complete waste of time.
