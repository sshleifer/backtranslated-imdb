Shame! There I was comfortable in the armchair with a beer and a breathtaking popcorn bag in the hope of another splendid Muppet night of entertainment. What I received? Disappointed! How can Muppetsii go from sublime Carol Christmas to this? The humor was horrible, the songs were worse than the Country and the West (and that's what it says), and the plot was as confusing and poor as Blind Pew. I think the main problem was that they lost too much in trying to Treasure Island. A short story, such as Christmas, is perfect because you can trick around Muppet ... here the need to draw the intrigue has stopped the fun. Where do the Muppets go? How about Muppets Wizard of Oz?
