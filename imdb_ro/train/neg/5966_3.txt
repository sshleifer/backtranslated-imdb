Wow! I followed the trailer for this and, although "no, it is not for me". I watched my husband and my friend's girlfriends during the trailer and knew it was a "boy movie." I mean, hello! a bunch of bartenders dancing - another striptease? Then I started to see it, it did not look so bad. so I kept looking. I looked at it all the way. what a wonderful movie. if there is anything, she's a girl. these girls have attitude. is a really good movie and a bit of love story. It really leaves you with a pleasant feeling. In principle, the story of a little girl in the small town that makes her great in the city, after passing through the usual town of big city **. there were some of them, it is almost a new urban legend. but it makes you think about your life and what you've got. well, anyway. I think it's because the whole script in a bar is very familiar not only to me but to many people I know. Do not trust trailers for this - aim to bring men.
