Okay, if you have a few hours to lose or if you really hate your life, I'd say I'm watching this movie. If it's good for a few laughs. Not only do you have obese, topless elders, but also special effects so bad that they are probably outlawed in most states. Seriously, the "PG" rating is pretty humorous once you see native porn extravagance. I would not give this movie to my late granddaughter. You could not even show this to the Iraqi prisoners without violating the Geneva Convention. The land is steady, clich√©, and stupid and stupid. The actor is horrible, and the end is so painful to notice that I actually began to shed my salt in my eyes just to take my mind off the idiots that fill my TV screen.
