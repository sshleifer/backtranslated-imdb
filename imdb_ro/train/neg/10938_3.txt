I did not expect to go into this, but still I was disappointed. This was the least favorite Halestorm production I've ever seen. I thought it was supposed to be a comedy, but I only crashed in 3 or 4 jokes. Is it really a funny gag to see a type of fat eating donuts and falling over and over? What happened to the portrait script in heaven? Fred Willard was hilarious with some of Christopher Guest's collaborations, but this did not work. They must have spent all the budget to make "known" actors appear in this because there was no budget for enlightenment. It looks like it was shot with a video camera and most of the scenes were very dark. Does it really have such a big movie to show someone to shoot and make a basket, as opposed to cutting and editing a ball that shines through the basket? I try not to be too critical about low-budget comedies, but if you want to see something fun, go to a true basketball game of the Church instead of this movie.
