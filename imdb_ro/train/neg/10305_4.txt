As an engineer, I have to say that the first season of this show started very promising. Most applied mathematics were somewhat plausible, and the relationships portrayed between Eppes and Dad gave the show an interesting advantage. But after the first season the show began to degrade, very much. Most mathematics and technology used to solve crimes are now full of insane and ridiculous people for all people involved in science and technology for reality. The involvement of the actors still feels good and I can imagine a fair amount of money is still in the production of each episode, but eventually this degraded to a very unpleasant tasting dish that is a mix of class action thriller C and a CIS police show. you're going to watch him, just go for the first season and eventually for parts of the second. After that, I would not waste my time. I myself gave the show until mid-season 3. <br /> <br /> Season 1 - 8 stars Season 2 - 5 stars Season 3 - 3 stars <br /> <br /> Let's sum up to 4 stars. Since Charlie no longer knows math, I will not even bother with my fairness.
