I am 17 years old and I still like most of Scooby Doo movies and old episodes. I like movies from the 1990s and recently I was treated to one of Scooby Doo's best Scooby Doo excursions this decade, Scooby Doo and King Goblin, which I did not expect to be as good as it would have been. Anyway, back to get an idea! I've seen some episodes waiting for something very good, but from what I saw from her, I was not impressed at all. First of all, I hated the animation. It was flat, deflated and very Saturday-morning-standard-card, easily the worst aspect of the series. Even some shows I really hate have had a slightly better animation. Even worse, Shaggy and Scooby looked like aliens, and I really missed Fred, Velma, and Daphne, adding a lot to the old episodes when Scooby Doo was good. I also hated character changes because it seemed that instead of solving the mysteries, Shaggy and Scooby were now playing a superhero, something they'd never done in movies or in Scooby-Doo. Where are you? show. The theme of the tone was not very good, I do not even remember, and the jokes were blades and contrived. However, I admit that there is a very talented voice distribution if they had a better material and were not told to sound so different from the original voices as humanly possible as they would have done , to add them. In conclusion, I personally thought it terrible and did not try to discredit it, is what I personally feel. 1/10 Bethany Cox
