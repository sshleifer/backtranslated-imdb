Some gorehound friends have recommended "Live Feed," and basically I can not complain, because the movie certainly provides ample amounts of sadness and blood-filled buckets, but of course it's not a very good movie. More than obviously, resorting to the latest trend in horror cinema, the so-called Torture Porn, Ryan Nicholson tries to overcome any other movie in this sub-genre (including "Hostel" and "Saw" models and effects twisted makeup, and well-corrupted photos of naked co-editors trying, suffering and begging for their lives There is no real plot to describe Five friends of twenty years, without any idea, make a trip to Asia One of them but they do not know why they chose to go there instead of Cancun, but they obviously are not interested in the continent's culture, and even provoke a stirring scene when they witness a place slaughtering a cute dog The quintet sinks later in the night life and one of them accidentally insults the leader of a criminal clan. An excuse is simply not su because the gangster follows them in an adult theater and gradually submits them to all vicious tortures. One girl has her stiff tits and another poor wench even has a poisonous snake stuck in her neck; Oops. The "live feed" is surprisingly boring despite all bloodshed, and amateur production values ​​are hard to ignore, even if you're accustomed to watching this movie independently. The fat girl described on the cover, an oriental S & M exercise, is often quite cold and is the most talented of the crowd because at least he keeps his mouth shut all the time. I would not recommend this pile of dirt, but if you like the hard and hideous metal music, the harassment of torture images and the defeated losers, go ahead and watch!
