This movie pretty sucked. I'm in the army and the soldiers described in this movie are horrible. If you are in Militari and you see this movie, you will laugh and you will be upset about the whole movie because of how they acted as a team. It was ridiculous. They acted like a bunch of normal men, with uniforms of the army, not knowing what to do. It was a pretty upsetting movie that I was supposed to say at least. There have been some scenes in which they try to make you jump. I'd recommend seeing if you're bored and want to see a violent and violent film. It will be a better movie if not your Military. I also had to say I loved the first better than this one.
