Richard Dreyfus is not the star here. She has about three 20-second cameos and what does Gene Barry do in the whole movie? No idea, the director was probably his brother! This is a movie that makes no sense. The inept writer / director (the same guy) ruined everyone's talents with terrible work. I have the DVD for a penny, so I can not cry! But it's weird! And it makes you feel weird and not in a good way. That was in the '70s and it seems the director was on an acidic journey and wanted everyone to experience what it was like to be inside his head. It has a somewhat interesting and controversial concept, but, like a scratched recording, it's playing fast. She has that "Manson family on acid" vibe at her. I have no idea how the other reviewer got everything he did from this movie? Maybe they ever worked? In any case, be prepared to lose 80 minutes of your life, you will never come back. Yeah, it's terrible!
