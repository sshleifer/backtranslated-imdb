This movie was the worst movie I've ever seen since "Movie Date". I was laughing in the whole movie instead of being scared. It was funny how the snakes would look for a particular section of the body of the passengers to attack, for example, the eye, tongue, butt, chest. If we saw a national geographic channel, we know that the snakes will not get stuck in the body after they bite. For each particular scene, the snakes would bite the passengers and stay on the body that bites the person. I think the manufacturer has not studied snakes' information and their behavior. I can not believe I wasted my money on this movie. So I do not recommend this film to have confidence in the film just to wait until it's at the dollar theater or to rent it.
