never look at this movie ... it's the biggest stack of theater I've ever met in my life. and that says something. acting, story and filming were absolutely harsh, this is the best movie in the world! seriously, does not even give you a shot, because it cost me 99s from sainsburys and it was only made in 2005? hahaha this movie is like a cheap college movie you can even see the camera in the corner of the screen .... though if u really want to look at it you have to watch "scary scary shark" ... possibly the most the good play I saw in my life ... ha ha. I mean seriously this is the biggest loss of 2 1/2 hours EVER !!
