Tim Robbins and John Cusack are two actors we have appreciated throughout our career and this was the only reason we chose to watch this movie. Well, all I can say is that I totally regret it! These two great actors humble themselves by making a series of irrelevant, non-imaginative and kitch to extreme (not bad on their own) sketches that should make people laugh but fail. The only reason I can think that the director was their friend and decided to support his movie playing in him - I can not think of anything else because this movie is so cheap! Fortunately, Tim Robbins and John Cusack have not disappointed me since then. I would recommend you avoid this movie if you do not want your opinion about the two raped actors.
