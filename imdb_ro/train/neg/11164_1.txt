What a disappointment! This film seemed to try to copy the "late-night" comedy, but the direction and script were negligent, sick and sentimental in the film's most serious tradition. The role / role of Jack Black was self-indulgent and self-deprecating ... and the other characters were unmistakable and uninteresting. The soundtrack was boring. We are (WERE) fans of Black, but none of us has done more than a forced titration maneuver for the duration. Why did he feel that he must make this mistake? We will not watch another in his movies without reading the reviews more carefully first! <br /> <br /> Was he drunk when he read before you enrolled for this program?
