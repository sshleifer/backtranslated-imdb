I do not understand how these animated movies continue to emerge, no matter how well (or badly) people love. I saw this movie with the two children (5,7). He loves everything animated (like most people who appreciated this movie). The theater was almost full, and I was looking forward to seeing the movie with a superb cast. To tell the truth, I'm bored. It was incredibly predictable and simply unhappy. There were some chuckles in the movie and that was it. Of course, they tried to make the cheap laugh from time to time, but it just did not work. My son almost always tells me he wants the DVD after seeing an animated movie, but not on it. My daughter slept half. Children also thought character animation seemed odd. I did not hear that from watching Polar Express, which gave my daughter's nightmares. Trust me, I'm not the type who's looking for the negative in everything. But quality is quality, and as many animated films that it throws there, it has very little.
