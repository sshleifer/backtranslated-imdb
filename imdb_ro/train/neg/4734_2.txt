Do you like beautiful girls? Yeah, me too. What is wrong about beautiful girls / women? Nothing imo, why would I give this movie only 2 stars out of 5, although it has received the "talents" of Chiaki Kuriyama and Aya Ueto? <br /> <br /> If I really want to see nice people, I would watch MTV or something. This is a movie, a so-called action movie, though. So, by definition, does not even need a real plot? I do not agree with 100%, but let's say yes. So what does it need? 20 minutes of movie from part 1 (might exaggerate a bit but it seemed like more than 20 minutes ...)?! That would be "No". But again, you never know, people who saw the first part might not know what they ate this morning for breakfast, so let's remind them ... hey can recall them twice? Just to be sure they will not forget ... at least until the credits roll, of course !!!! <br /> <br /> So forget the story, about character development, about real emotions, about "actors" (and no, I do not think women in skirts going and / or fighting are responsible for acting!) .. what's going on? Give action scenes. Action scenes are not bad and that's why I gave the movie 2 stars instead of 1! I gave this movie a chance, but it was a waste of time ... You got better things to do / watch, believe me ...
