If you are attracted by the gentle, regressive, self-indulgent, anti-establishment, anti-civilization of juvenile, then this is the ideal movie. A very poor scenario, with a often inappropriate dialogue with the scary camera in hand, is a film that presents the world in an appealing manner, Manichean: all adults (especially teachers, parents, priests and doctors) are insensitive at best, and predatory monsters in the worst case. The only escape from the horrors of civilization as a whole is a multitude of primary yawns (yawning) and infant regression (literally) in a primitive space like the caves in the forest, with utopia taking the form of a rave party - again in wood (naturally. ..). Displays all the weaknesses of a first movie and many more.
