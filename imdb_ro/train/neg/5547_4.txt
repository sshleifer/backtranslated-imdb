Zombie Revolution (2 out of 5 stars) No, this is not an ancestor long lost in the classic zombie films of George A. Romero. This is a low budget boiler in 1936, which may have seemed very interesting to the audience of time ... but it seems to be a terrible routine nowadays. There is, in fact, a fairly good scene at the beginning of a soldier who fired the gun into a horde of approaching zombie soldiers ... and a number of bullets falling into the empty chest of one of them. The effect seems to be fake today without hope, but in 1936 I'm sure she had audiences in the air. The story is about seeking the secret of mind control ... obviously to create an unstoppable zombie army ... but later as a means for a character to win the woman he loves. The movie is about an hour long, but it moves in the snail's rhythm, so it seems lengthy, believe me! There are not many things to recommend ... you can get some fun from the images of the fake star studios "beating" through a "swamp". The end is interesting ... so I'd say the movie deserves to be seen at least once. More than likely, you'll see it as an extra feature on some cheap compilations of "4 movies per 1 DVD" at Wal-Mart for five dollars. Hey, well worth the money ...
