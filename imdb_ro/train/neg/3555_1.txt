Years ago, a movie that went to a friend and I went to see a horror movie I thought would be good because he played John Cassavetes. For the uninitiated, John Cassavettes was an actor, screenwriter and director (married to actress Gena Rowlands), nominated for the Oscar three times, who wrote and directed a variety of low-budget films, using his actor's income to maintain on the waterline. Until I saw The Incubus, I did not understand that John Cassavetes' income was made from any film he was offered. If we knew what the movie was before we saw it, it could have been avoided altogether. But I did not leave. At that moment, my friend and I jokingly said it was the worst movie ever made. Now, honestly, this is not true. I have seen many movies made poorly on Friday night on Cinemax (I said that out loud?), Which is much worse than Incubus. Almost any movie with Brian Bosworth is, by definition, a worse film than The Incubus. Of course, Santa Claus conquers Martians is a movie worse than Incubus. However, I have constantly used Incubus as a threshold below which I do not want to fall. When I talk to this friend about a movie I've seen, I'll always notice it's better (or worse) than Incubus.
