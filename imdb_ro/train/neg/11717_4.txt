Many themes or parts of the story are the same as in Leon, then other parts felt like another film, I do not know which, but there is a familiar feeling on the whole movie. It was nice to look, but it would have been fantastic! if the story was more original. The little girl, the evil assassin from Leon, is just a little tweaked. The opening scenes are very good :-) It is strange that people like to fight in the kitchen, in the movies :-) My biggest problem was to remember what parts were from Leon, Nikita and if they were in the French or American version. If you did not see Leon, then this is a good movie. If you liked this movie, then I can recommend Leon. <br /> <br /> Regards / Rick
