The animation seems to be done in 30 seconds and looks more like caricatures than characters. I've been a fan of Scooby Doo ever since the series was released in 1969. I did not think too much about Scooby Doo animated films (I'm talking about TV Shows, not long-time movies), but some of them were pretty cool , and I like most people find Scrappy Doo to be an irritant, but this series is pure garbage. As soon as I saw the animation and I heard the characters (and I use this free term) I talk, I cracked. Also, Mystery Inc. it was a team and without the whole crew to compliment each other, seems to open a box of chocolate to find that someone has already eaten the best and the only thing left is the one no one wants. What's new about Scooby Doo was better than that. If you are going to have a series of Scooby Doo TV shows, include the elements that have made the series so durable. The whole cast of characters and quality animation. She has to put her back under the rock where she came from.
