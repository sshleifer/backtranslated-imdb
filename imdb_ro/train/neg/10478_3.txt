I sincerely consider this film as another poor effort of the Dominican Film Industry. The first 30 minutes of the movie are a bit funny, but when they change their role in society (men do what women and women do usually do what men usually do) the movie falls. Become boring and not at all funny. They left many things without explanation, and the end of the movie is predictable. I did not like the way a Roberto Angel played his character and little boy. I went to the theater of movies hoping to see good work but I really came out disappointed. I do not recommend this movie.
