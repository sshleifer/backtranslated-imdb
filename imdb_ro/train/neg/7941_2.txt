Since 2000, King Kong's adoptive daughter has gone forward and made a complaint that her show is approaching the end. While Miss Winfrey was breaking, I laughed and screamed like an Indian wilderness in the old West. What is Oprah doing? she takes famous people and puts them in the show. what kind of famous people? people who have suffered (like her, except that these people have lost more than their virginity) have suffered melted faces (true story), lack of limbs (true story, see end of paragraph) and husband abuse count). and somehow they come to the show and tell their story, as if I did not hear it before tons and many times (Bethany Hamilton, I heard your story about the loss of a shark arm from the first day that was October 31st, 2003. Do not tell me you have no hard feelings.) But perhaps the biggest thing on Oprah was Michael Jackson's interview in 1993 after being accused of being a baby mole. Unfortunately, Mr. Jackson has since died. but that a certain show told about Michael's personal life, something that many did not know him at the time. Oprah's Real influence comes from middle-aged women and football moms. They seem to believe it is like a Jesus character sometimes. but everything I see in Oprah is a great lady of ghetto that made her great and she just shows how rich she is. I'm glad that her shows will end soon. we need better television programs.
