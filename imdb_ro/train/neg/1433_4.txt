The pictures are wonderful and well reflect the landscapes of Canada. The story was, on the other hand, rather dull; In my eyes there was a love story in the forest, just as the Titanic was a love story on a boat. I did not feel that Gray Owl was a great ecologist. I just like Lord Attenborough, but it was ... bad.
