I am frightened of how bad this movie is. As a passion for the early twentieth century artists, Hollywood sets a new low - even the past of The Moderns or (gasp) Cradle Will Rock & I never thought to see a movie worse than the two 2. Granted that they were about a slightly different environment & period. However, intentions and results were painfully similar. First, is there horrible casting: Eddie Izzard like CHAPLIN? Excuse me? Peter, would you owe it to that? Jennifer Tilly as Loulla Parsons? Kirsten Dunst as Marion Davies ??? The holy smoke, these people do not even attempt to try to capture the appearance or the sound of the period that they are supposed to describe. Well, the last picture was a decent film, but this is a disaster and the rest of Bogdonovitch's pictures were not much better. I think the change from Welles & Hitch & Ford was done a long time ago. However, it is still good to host TCM.
