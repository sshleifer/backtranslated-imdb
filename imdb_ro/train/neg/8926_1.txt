I saw "Myra Breckinridge" when it first came out in 1970. I was a healthy 20-year-old man who loved the movies and liked Raquel Welsh very much. Besides, I read Gore Vidal's novel on which it was based and it seemed very funny. I saw the movie at a local car and halfway around I was very tempted to change my car engine to die of monoxide poisoning and not to see the rest of this film's shipwreck. It was not "smart" or "trendy", it was thick and negligent. All the actors were deaf and the director had no idea what he was doing. Mae West's filming was one of the worst choices in film history. As a commentator said here, her role has nothing to do with her movie or book. Her character in the book is sexually beaten by the young boss, which she would never do for legendary Ms. West. Oh, no, the plot is changed, so it's sexually, very credible by a 77-year-old woman who shows her every day of her age. I could go on, but why? It was a terrible movie. Bluto
