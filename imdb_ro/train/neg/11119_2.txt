Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes join the basketball team. Okay, it sounds good there. It leaves much room for a good comedy and a good story. But no such event occurred in the many minutes of a movie's break. This movie became redundant, delayed and ridiculous after the first twenty seconds. Woody Harrelson played one of the t.v. characters, Woody de la Cheers, and I look forward to seeing him in this movie. But after seeing his "performance performance," we came to the conclusion that he should stay playing the stinking villains. His actor was as boring and poor as the movie. Another actor in the unreal film was Rosie Perez. I liked the movies with Perez before, but I decided that the reason I enjoyed other works in her career was that she was not a main character and did not have those many lines of speech (Do Right Thing). But now, in White Men Can not Jump, she has become a central character with many lines, which means that the audience has to rise up with her enormous and annoying voice. So, after seeing this movie (freely used term) and hearing Rosie Perez for much more than I appreciate, I can now say that I am a white man and I'm preparing to jump. . . from a two-storey building.
