I just saw the movie in the theater. The film has very few good points to talk about. Kareena's beauty and a few songs can be. That's it. The film is a total disappointment in all areas. Anyone associated with the film will be disappointed, even the Indians in Mumbai (right now Chennai has reached the semifinals). <br /> <br /> But the worst I feel about the movie are the action scenes. Today, Bollywood is trying to copy Hollywood action scenes. But they forget that Hollywood executives take a lot of force to make it look real. But, unfortunately, Bollywood directors do not have much time. They spend time on the songs and the advertising of the film. Now, too bad action scenes can work in the south, while the audience pays only to watch their favorite actor killing a bunch of people. But in Bollywood this will certainly not work. All the action scenes I wish I could have delivered. At the end, even some Chinese are coming from nowhere to beat Akshay Kumar. This is the height of stupidity. The audience does not pay to pursue such stupidity. I think Bollywood should forget about action movies. I can not do it. The last good action I saw was "Ghatak" and "Khiladiyon ka Khialdi". The current scene in Bollywood is really sad for fans of action movies like me. Do these people see the movie after it's over? Can not they realize that the slow-moving action (which is done using the ropes) is too unrealistic and childish? Better not have scenes of action if you can not control it. I just want to go back to the Amitabh era where movies such as Zanjeer and Deewar had exciting action scenes. The sound effect was not very effective in those days, but visual is much better than the current scenes. <br /> <br /> This film should open the eyes of Bollywood film directors. Please do not make any other action movies until you get the art of becoming realistic.
