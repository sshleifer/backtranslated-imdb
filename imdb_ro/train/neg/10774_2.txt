What stinkeroo turned out to be !!! At one point, much earlier in her career, Linda Darnell was one of my favorites - she did not make big shields as an actress but very beautiful and enjoyable (especially in films such as The Mark of Zorro and Blood and Sand ") I have seen this monstrosity, the memories of her golden days have quickly disappeared. The story is incredible and farcical, the second rate acting, insufficient support. I can not think of a more immaculate performance than anyone compared to Tab Hunter, and Donald Gray was supposed to be the most boring man he could have chosen. Added to this was the terrible photo (and I'm not just referring to the color!) Everyone associated with it must have shaken whenever it was shown.
