Eric Rohmer, The Lady and the Duke, is based on the diaries of an English aristocrat who lived through the French Revolution. But it is a stuck business, with its weird, painted background and conversational tone. Particularly, this portrait of the age of terror occurs almost entirely at a removal from real action; there is very little of the ordinary people in this film and little of the chaos, poverty and terror that have unfolded away from the hall of the aristocratic class persecuted but spoiled. The result is often boring and, finally, lacking in light about the forces that sometimes lead societies to the brink of destruction; is a disappointing film from an acclaimed director.
