Good. So there are not many great movies around. Precious stones such as American Dream, The Straight Story and even Toy Story 2 are not normally so close. But boy (!) Makes this film counter-balance of quality. I have no idea what these people thought I was doing. The financiers in this world are so easily convinced to finance such a **** crocodile? I just can see her now ... Producer - "So we have Joe Fiennes, he's cute like a button and he was good enough in Shakespeare in Love and we got Rhys Ifans that is not cute but was cool in Notting Hill We will mix in a very mediocre score, some forgotten post-Britpop songs, hemlock root and lizard brain and hey presto you have the worst movie in the new millennium. And believe me, it will be a tough thing to do so "Bank -" Do I love any futile sex? "about the most serious accents on this part of the Devil?" Producer - "Yes, we have many of them" Bank - "Are we wonderful where do we end? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
