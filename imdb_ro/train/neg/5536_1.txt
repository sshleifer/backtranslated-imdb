Zombie revolt has no redeeming features. I'm sick of people who claim it's not that bad and the effects must have been scary in 1936. I think this is not true: it's not like IQs have risen sharply in the last 7 decades. The average viewer in 1936 was probably just as bored with this garbage as he is today. Why? Just try to look at the first scenes and count the breaks between the things that happen, the terrible choice of the moment to cut to the end, editing the slapdash that seems to include another two seconds on each movie to eliminate the running time. Pay attention to the absolutely redundant dialogue: "I'll do some tea / go out / read my book now." "You are?" "Yes, I am." This type of exchange happens several times. Normally, I would love that, being a big fan of bad movies, but I was looking at the apathetic actors who mumbled their sad and compassionate lines, and all the desire to laugh at the film slowly blurred. This kind of disinterested, wasteful time is far worse than energetic, imaginative plants such as the new space plan in the cosmic space or Santa Claus conquers the Martians. Those who claim that this is "better" than those more exciting movies have a backward idea of ​​entertainment. This movie is not bad in the sense that your jaw opens in amazement: it is bad in the sense that your eyes slowly turn into boredom. Which is much worse.
