The fact that there are positive comments about Dan in real life on IMDb just makes me realize that their junket staff is hard at work trying to make people watch this horrific movie. I have no words, no idea where to start describing the really terrible movie I set up last night - Dan in real life. Steve's characters in previous films made me think I'd feel something for his character and enjoy dialogue, but like other posters I felt uncomfortable and embarrassed for distribution. The dialogue was so controversial, the family was Walton's family and the movie was so many times before I'm shocked that someone thought it was an original idea. Do yourself a favor and make a pass on this awful bad movie and you do not believe everything you read on IMDb because the first comments were clearly written by people sitting in a different theater watching a good movie.
