Let's start with simple lines. From the viewer, there are some "good director details", some views of the scenes that are beautiful. The special effects are good enough, too, a good / quality landscape. But the story is too simple. It shows how an elite bomb squad unit lives, acts and sometimes dies. This shows the drama of life in war. In my movie movie as a serious "addictive" action movie, I lost that click that my eyes and my mind blocked on the screen. One of the things that must be present in a movie to consider it a good is the ability to sink the viewer into the reality and time of the film. It did not happen to me. I stayed "conscious" for the whole movie. I think this movie has won its fame on the basis of the "subconscious" appeal of American patriotism, a healthy and authentic feeling, but not the proper use as renowned filmmakers. More than a movie about war, it increases its popularity based on that. A simple thought: If it were a movie of the Second World War or a movie, just the change of time, totally the same, would have been granted? Of course not. Why? Because they are big who raise the bar to the height. Compared to his Oscar rivals, I do not think all the prizes he has won are properly awarded.
