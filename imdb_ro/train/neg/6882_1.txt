I hated how Mrs. Perez portrayed Puerto Ricans! We are not all ghetto - and we speak Spanish - not Puerto Rican! I can not talk to the needy people you've met. But our language is intact, our island is our pride. Puerto Rico is better off than any other Caribbean island! I'm glad we're not like Cuba, the Dominican Republic or Haiti, with no American influence? Free in true poverty, not in the US poverty standard We are not victims, we are resilient, humble, honest and intelligent people. Our ancestors do not include strong African roots, but no "black" roots - I have nothing in common with American blacks 9 research). The analogy between Pedro Albizu, Che Guevarra and Martin L. King may not be further than the mark. MLK was a great revolutionary hero - an honest man who saw a day when we were all free. Che Guevarra helped Castro create Cuba, which is today, is the reason why Cuban boats risk their lives coming to America - because Che has made such a better place for them? You had a great, wonderful and enlightened idea, but you politicized it too much. We have so many things to be proud of as a people - do not bring shame to our people through our victimization. I'm not a Nuyorican and maybe that's why I can not share your views. I am Puerto Rican, I speak Spanish, I am not a victim, and I have managed to accomplish many of my goals in America. If there is a Part 2 in the future - less politics more history more triumph story - there are many. Damaris Maldonado
