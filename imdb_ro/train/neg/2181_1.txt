I saw this movie thinking it would be one of those old B movies that are fun to watch. I was so wrong! This movie was boring and obviously targeted the men who like to look at the body women. The story was so ridiculous and unlikely that I lost my interest. It seemed to be in the same genre as the Ed Wood films - the bottom of the cylinder.
