Why would a person return to a person to strike in their teeth, not once, not twice, but again and again. This film teaches that to find love, we must accept abuse (not just forgiveness, but full acceptance). Lord! No wonder my first relationship lasted only ten years. Obviously I do not embrace my inner masochist. As we make the debut of Bucatinsky, there are many wonderful aspects of this film; however, to justify the reunion of Eli and Tom, a character development would have been helpful. We are never familiar with Eli's masochism, in fact, we are convinced he is not a masochist, although Tom's psycho-emotional sadism is very obvious.
