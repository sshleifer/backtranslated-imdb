Seriously, I'm for romantic gooey comedies and suck it into Miss Congeniality as easy as Goodfellas ... but this movie? Makes no sense! And I'm not even talking about the deliberate suspension of mistrust, which makes no sense. Why does her family live in England? Or, at least, why does not she have a British accent? She is really comfortable with her father and, surprisingly, forgive her for not being in the last two years. (On this subject, no one agrees too much about being so gone). And what was the goo at the baccalaureate party? I will not even get into the fact that the escort she paid falls in love with her - which could have been overcome by a better film. I'm just saying that the characters, setting and plot are not detailed enough to make a fairly coherent story. Oh, and the worst part, in my opinion, is the consistent use of films of the most uncluttering angles on Deborah Messing's nose - I would have sued the directors if I were! I mean, honestly, I am for the women who are, but why, in seven loyal years of Will and Grace's visualization, have I never noticed how strange the nose is? Oh! Because these producers are good with it! This movie, like the other movie ever preferred, Armageddon, is the fault of filmmakers, not actors. I can see both Messing and McDermott in these roles, with a better writer, director and producer. This made it easy for me to vote as one of the worst movies I've ever lost my time. I'm glad a friend borrowed my DVD, so all I've lost is the time. If there was a way to make this ZERO star review, I would do it.
