Now, for truth, his very poor story - for a Walt Disney movie, his total garbage. When Robinson appears, the movies everywhere, I was shocked how poor he was. She's like "alice in wonderland" went wrong! It feels as if there were no crazy powder ideas together to try to get away with it - and they do not. After that, I stayed there and wanted my end. My younger brother lost half of interest and was confused by the story. The characters are weak and after Robonsons appear that you do not care about the end, you just want the movie to finish. His film to forget and forget quickly. If you have free time, do not miss it.
