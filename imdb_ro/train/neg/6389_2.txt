I've been waiting for almost 25 years to see this movie, thinking it might be an undervalued work from a time when the animation was no longer of the quality it had once been. He played one of the best youngsters of all time, relied on a series of children's books and was a Disney Studios production. What could be wrong with her? As it turns, almost everything. Well, not everything. Vincent Price, as the red score of Rattigan and Henry Mancini, are the two rescues of the film. The price is pleasant, and Mancini more professional than the material deserves. They bring a class to a project that otherwise belongs in obscurity. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the rest of the movie, full of inappropriate adult affairs, still suffers from a totally boring scenario, generous vocal work, terrible songs and lazy animations that would not have been out of place on any one of Disney's television shows in the mid-1980s. This was a total disappointment for me. It's amazing that this movie was almost contemporary with NIMH's Secret. The cost of a fraction of this, an independent studio produced something with more creativity in the trailer than GMD has in its endless running time. The extra star that keeps this "terrible" goes to Price and Mancini.
