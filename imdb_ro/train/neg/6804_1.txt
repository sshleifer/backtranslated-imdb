This must be one of the 5 worst movies ever made. Complot seemed intriguing like that of Passenger 57. But with the last movie it worked much better. The plot was elaborated in the worst possible way. Just a few of the awful moments of the movie. A flight attendant sits in the open gate of a 747 flight and tries to close the door without being blown by the winds of 250 miles an hour? After that, several kilometers from 8,000 meters, this is impossible even for 747 pilots with thousands of hours of experience. When on the track (perfectly of course), she is trained to pull on the flaps, HUH !! Come on to the flanks to make sure you're up and running at low speeds, when you use the reverse engine power and give you maximum power! I can continue with small and especially big mistakes in the film, but then my answer will become the English dictionary size. This is a movie you want to miss, take my word for it!
