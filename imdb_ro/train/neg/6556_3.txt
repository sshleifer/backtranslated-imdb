I bought this on DVD for my brother, who is a great fan of Michelle Pfeiffer. I decided to look at me earlier this week. It's a funny piece of fun that contains two completely separate story lines. The section with Michelle Pfeiffer was far more interesting than the two. She plays a growing Hollywood actress who has had many short relationships unfulfilled. She literally hits Brian Kerwin (A regular guy married to Kids) after driving the car behind him. After being initially hostile to each other, she offered to drive her home because she no longer feels comfortable driving. Romanticism is finally developing, leading to tragedy when his wife finds out. What happened at the end was not ready, but the slow pace and routine direction of the TV takes every plot of plot. The other section involves an old Chief Studio played by Darren McGavin. This section has a better distribution with Kenneth McMillan, Lois Chiles, Steven Bauer and Stella Stevens. Everyone wants something from the studio head, but eventually, when asked to resign, they realize their careers are going nowhere. <br /> <br /> It's time, but it's not all interesting and I'm glad it was not bought for me. I'm not a Michelle Pffeifer fan, but she was certainly the only actor to watch in this film and even in 1983 she was a decent actress. Generally, if you are not a fan of it, avoid this because it is very routine.
