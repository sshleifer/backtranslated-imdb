"Cut" is a movie about some movie students who make a movie. It is very much in the "Scream" mold, an ironic, self-referential horror movement that, at least for me, falls because, for all its irony, it is still just a bad horror film, just like movies concerns. <br /> But it was not without her charm. Well, a charm anyway. Molly Ringwald was fantastic, while the straggling American actress, embarrassed, hates every minute of working with the amateur Australian film crew. She was so convincing that her temptation to believe it was not an act, although all those involved in the Cut say she is wonderful to work with her. :-) <br /> <br /> Really, every scene of betrayal, clogging or clogging was great. All others, however, rebelled between being fine and terrible of wood. Anyway, "Cut" has some laughs, a few bucks of gore (some of them surprisingly terrible), and ultimately it's just another bad horror movie.
