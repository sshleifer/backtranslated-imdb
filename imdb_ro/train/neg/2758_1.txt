I give this movie 1 because there are no negative numbers in the IMDb rating system. this movie was horrible. He was very acted, the story was badly written, the action was unbelievable. I doubt that the Rescue Army could fight as badly as the troops in this movie. I will not write even plotting spoilers because the film is not good enough for plotters. Writing comments on the plot would be useless. If I compare this film, we should have compared it to Reign of Fire, though, although I did not like Reign of Fire, at least the movie was better than that. <br /> <br /> Some people in the theater left before the movie was made halfway. The only reason why I was not because I just did not think to do it. We hoped to celebrate a CGI celebration and struggle with craftsmanship, but that did not happen. Martial arts lasted 30 seconds, and this was from a routine of exercises made during the flash-back scene, very disappointing. CGI has not been done well either. A scene comes to mind. During one of the previous battles of the tanks, troops are thrown at ... nothing. Someone forgot to bring the animation boys that film, so the street was completely free of bad guys. I also think that the voice of the evil one was called by Imotep's voice in Mumia. It should have happened the same scandalous thing. (Somebody owed some royalties here?) Since I mentioned the battle scene, I would say that yes, it could be considered a spoiler, but I suppose only to the purists. , do not buy the DVD when it comes out. You were warned.
