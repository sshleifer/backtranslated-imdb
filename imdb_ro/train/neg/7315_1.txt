OK, let's go straight to the subject. We have five recent college degrees (you must be specialized in the word F) who are coming out on a weekend campaign trip. They meet someone who needs help, but instead of trying to help him, they decide to put him on fire. A bunch of people. Then some of them begin to get sick - there must be something in the water from the cabin where they stand. However, the neighbors seem to be fine. Well, when things get really bad, they're blocking one of their companions instead of getting help (try your nearby neighbor). Some locals do not like to like it. They track one on a high speed through the forest for several miles until the truck breaks down. A few ten minutes later, he appears in the cabin (how he could find him and how he could travel at the speed of light to get a mystery). Another type of brain surgeon in the booth realizes something is kind, so he's hiding in a cave to let this blow. He then decides the next day to return to the cabin, believing he must be an altar type. He is angry that he survived (probably thought it was a 24-hour bug). Unfortuneatley is met by some police officers who are not so friendly. Another young man decides to have sex while the thought of meat consumes magic, and then women realize they have to shave their feet (taking a lot of sick skin with shaving cream). Anyway you have the idea. Nothing makes sense here. These are five people I would not like to be friends with. I was rooted in the bacteria that ate the meat. Other characters were introduced, which were also somewhat amusing, but also very inappropriate. Ninety minutes of good life were wasted here.
