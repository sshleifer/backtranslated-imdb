This movie is not very good. In fact, it's the worst Elvis movie I've ever seen. It has a very small plot, especially parties, beer and battle. Burgess Meredith and Thomas Gomez are wasted. I do not know why they made this movie. You could say that Elvis was wasted is also much better in "Follow The Dream".
