I just registered to make this comment (which equals quite a lot with some of the ones already present). The actor is worse than the sub-point, explains the usual stereotypes, has some of the most serious manifestations of feminine objectivity, and has some of the most frightened lines known to man. However, without being limited to "it allows you to see what these boys can do". I should also mention the fact that, when looking at cruelty involving innocent civilians, you feel bad about innocent people and start to hate the characters themselves. The character of Eddie Griffin is also one of the most stereotypical characters of the black guy who breaks people in the wrong way. He may or may not be a good actor, but this film does not allow this type of character exploration. Do you want a movie to leave the audience on the side of the bad guys? Oceans 11. This movie just makes you hate bad guys instead of capturing the audience. Even the cars can not cope with this fluke of a movie. That Enzo, which Griffin destroyed, perfectly summarizes this film. It's just shit.
