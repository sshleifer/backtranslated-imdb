Since the 1970s, Seed focuses on serial killer Max Seed (Will Sanderson), who killed 666 people in six years. He is sentenced to death, but he does not die in the electric chair, even after being shocked three times. Detective Matt Bishop (Michael Par√©) and other officers cover this secret by burying the seeds. Seed breaks and goes after those who put him in his coffin live. Recognized by the worst director in the world (Uwe Boll), "Seed" is nothing but a tobacco film about trying to stretch the envelope of a decent society and fails to deliver a story in any way. And he said that this is based on true events, because if a person survives the electric chair after being shocked three times, they will be released. This is an urban legend and it would never happen. Like the other abominations of Boll ("Alone in the Dark" for one), "Seed" is simply terrible.
