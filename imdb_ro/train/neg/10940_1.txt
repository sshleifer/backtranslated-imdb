First of all, let's admit that Lorenzo Lamas could never be considered a qualified actor, just decent, sometimes simply stupid. However, in this piece of @ *! ^ Named SnakeEater, the cinema industry has come in full. <br /> <br /> First, let's start with the plot. A Vietnamese vet named Jack Kelly, known as the Soldier (which should be as rough as a leather strap and then some that you believe when pushing a nail palace over the feet of two guys and throws them on the floor), his family is said to have been killed and his sister kidnapped. That's why he goes on a solo mission to save his sister. It had a potential but still quite thin to start with. Now, acting. Being an actor myself, I am qualified to say that this was some of the best actions in art history !!!!! Lamas is himself. Jackasses playing the role of "Clampets / Deliverance" should be squeezed and shot for their so-called performances, which are insulting to actors everywhere, especially for the talented ones who never manage to make a big break! The fight with weapons is so from BEST, and the fight with the fist is deplorable. I saw more real fights at the Renaissance Festival (and they were quite fake)! Readers, listen to me: WARNING THIS HAPPY HATE WITH ALL COSTS! IF YOU WERE THE EXISTENCE OF THE FILM ONLY, YOU WISHED TO KEEP IT! For the sake of the number of brain cells, DO NOT follow this!
