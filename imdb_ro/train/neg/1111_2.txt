Johnny Rivers's closing song was the only great thing about this movie. Unfortunately, this is a positive one I can say about this Western film. I have to write eight more rows for my comments to be posted, but there are more than 8 terrible lines in this West. I'm not sure if the movie was a tribute to Hopa Along or just a spoof. The hero and the negative character in this movie were too plastic. It's not realistic at all. A lot of supporting actors in this movie look authentic, but shooting scenes were a joke. An earlier commentator thought this movie was great, and the comments made a cheap blow to President Bush. It was not a democratic or republican Western. It was just an evil western film that was sold commercially. I wonder if he made money. Sometimes I thought I was watching a movie made by film students. If so, then it was a great movie.
