The Danish Slum Slam Slum was surprised to be the worst movie I've ever seen. I did not think it was possible to record my list of bad movies, but that's worth the gold. It's not funny. It's bad, it's badly filmed and the story's bad. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that she has three girls in it. I really think this movie has the potential to beat the other Danish film "Stjerner uden hjerner" as the worst Danish film ever to have! And it's really something. Congratulations in advance!
