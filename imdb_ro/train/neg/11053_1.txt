This is one of the "so bad is good" movies you always hear, but never see! Unlike the Troma movies, which are deliberately bad and campy (and I'm not amused), this is 100% purely serious. However, with features such as a supposedly super lethal killer robot who prances about as one of the massive golden dancers on an aquatic excursion and a first magician who calls the lightning and turns into the Good Witch of the East that takes it seriously pushing it so far over the bad edge that makes it spin around around back to Entertainment. <br /> <br /> Quite remarkable for that.
