"Hak Hap" or "Black Mask" (in English) was a disappointment. I was told that it was a kind of "Japanese version of the matrix." Imagine my disappointment. The movie was either seriously nicknamed, or the soundtrack did not have time for the movie. Another thing is that the dialogue was bad enough. It has been very little thought in the English version of this film and appeals only to the genre of "meaningless action". Not a movie I'd like to see again.
