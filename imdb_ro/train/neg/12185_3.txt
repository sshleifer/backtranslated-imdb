What Martin Scorcese ever had to recall this film? And not only remodeled, destroyed it completely? Decision absurd to make the character played by Robert De Niro (the highest performance, and that says a lot) in a religious fanaticism is ridiculous and exemplary attitudes brought by Hollywood (and especially Mr. Scorcese) - attitudes to forcing writers to believe that the best way to make a crazy character is a crucifix tattooed on his back. In any case, this movie is terrible. <br /> <br />
