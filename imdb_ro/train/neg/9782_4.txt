This movie had such a promise! A great idea, a paintball team that fights for recognition and personal glory, just to lose speed because of a poor dialing, a bad editing and a half story. The characters from the beginning were exciting, only half-steamed to become one-size-frightened people. Perhaps if he spent more time in story and dialogue, it would have been a wonderful movie, instead of an effort almost after the thought.
