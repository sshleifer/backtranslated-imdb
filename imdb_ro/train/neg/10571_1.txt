my wife is a fan of this show. In this case I bought one to three seasons, and the four season is on order. I personally think the show is a big farce, the distribution is just as bad. Alyssa Milano should have been stuck in the other trash movies she has made, such as Poison Ivy, Embrace the Vampire, to name a few, the other female members who support shootings are equally ineffective in their portraits. I saw better special effects in old Republic Pictures Pictures, which I saw as a child. I understand why male leaders have remained in the show for such short periods of time, even if they do not know whether they were their choice or not. Please. please do not renew for another season, because enough is enough, Bob
