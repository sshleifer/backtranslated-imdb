I just could not finish this movie. I gave up after saying that it was my nomination for the most miserable attempt to award the prize for sexual suggestion: a scene where Pia Zadora, at a picnic, is between two boys who want it. One (good boy) pleads for her to see the error of her ways. The other (bad boy) simply asks if they would like a hot dog, which he then keeps for her. In the legs. I hope I do not hurt anything to say he's going back and taking a hot dog with a smile. Just pathetic.
