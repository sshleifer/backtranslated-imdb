Remember the name of Kevin Lime - and please do not ever let him go again. Time, pacing, editing: all are hopeless. Three or four decent professionals (next time, boys, go on the set) can do nothing to save this movie from amateurs like Alice Evans and the kind of production standards you would expect from teenage children's productions on British television. mystery: music. A score so inappropriate, inappropriate and inappropriate for the tone of the movie that one seriously asks if it is a case of sabotage. Add an acoustic that flashes apparently unhappy with a single little director and a director who just recalls intermittently adding audible action to the screen and we <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> have what is to be the highest money rate as a result of last years.
