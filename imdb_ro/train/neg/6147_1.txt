I really do not get all the admiration that this movie has received. It is mawkish, uselessly manipulative and faces many of the big problems - Nash's affairs and his predilection of having sex with men in public places. I assume, in the context of a commercial Hollywood film, it's just tolerable, but what's all the praise for Russell Crowe's performance? Does the man seem to get involved, get his briefcase and wear a muddy hat and somehow seem to qualify as a good adventure? Anyone who has ever met a person with mental health problems will realize that Crowe's performance is a bit smaller than the caricature. It's also quite offensive. And, I dare say, just on the right side of being terrible
