This movie is supposed to be a mysterious, serious thriller about a man looking for a missing girl. However, in 30 minutes in the film, it turns into a funny, unrealistic story with annoying characters and random scenes. I can not imagine anyone who does not laugh when Cage, randomly, Karate hits that blond girl or when she "wears" gives that old lady. Lines, characters and actors are not all made from the beginning. I always liked Nicolas Cage as an actor, but he did some awesome movies this year; this is by far the worst (yet ...). I would not recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch a story-filled thriller. If you really want to enjoy this story, go to rent the original. However, if you intend to watch it, prepare yourself to laugh at some lines and end the scenes, rather than taking them seriously; this is the only way you can enjoy this movie.
