Hill Hills Eyes II is what you would expect to be even more. Of course it will not be an Oscar-nominated movie, it's just pure fun that you can only lose for 90 minutes. The plot is essentially about a group of National Guards trainees who are in battle against the famous mutant hillbillies on their last day of training in the desert. They just struggle throughout the movie, which includes a lot of violence (which is basically the whole movie), because blood and courage continue to fly around the whole thing and yet another scene of graphic rape that is being poured unnecessarily to shock the audience. I'd give Hills Have Eyes II 4 out of 10 for pure entertainment and only that. Although even then I looked at my watch more and more as the movie continued, as she started to shoot because she continued to try to shock the audience with free gore and the occasional scene of jumps only to ensure that the public stays awake. The Hills Have Eyes II is just a decent fun, something going on if you get bored and nothing else. <br /> <br /> 4/10
