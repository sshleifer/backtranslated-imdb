This story of the sword-and-witchcraft of a brutal and tough "hero," facing a bad king, is of no value in almost all detail. The action is horrible from the leaders to the supporting roles. The joyous glory, with which the director shows the hero he swallows, is absolutely disgusting; nor is it redeemed by any justice to his cause, for it is as bad as the people in whom he struggles. Z-movie editing is abundant, including a scene in which a character "dies" from a sword shot that obviously missed completely! The film is clearly banking on the charm of leading the female, Barbi Benton and Lana Clarkson, who are paradise around naked throughout the film. Like a 20-year-old man, I will not pretend that female flesh on the screen does not attract me. But the treatment of their characters is so degrading, and sex scenes are so casual and unhappy that I can not even enjoy this aspect of the movie. Most cheese movies in this era are at least somewhat redeemed by a sensation of language in the heart (the continuation is better in this regard), but DEATHSTALKER seems to take seriously as a heroic fantasy. No way! Avoid at any price! <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/2 of ****.
