This movie does not really promote children to be more enjoyable and have better attitudes than a family movie should, and this would not be considered family, anyway because it has some things in it that children should not I'm seeing. It's not the best ABC family movie if you ask me. If there are fewer sex themes in the movie then it would be better. Hollywood does nothing to make a better movie by adding to sex. There is no reason for them. At least this is a TV movie. I would not want to lose my money in garbage by renting it. If you have other things to do, other than watch this movie, please continue to them.
