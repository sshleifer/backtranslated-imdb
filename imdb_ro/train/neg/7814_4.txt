After a long time in space, looking for the remnants of Krypton, Superman (Brandon Routh) returns to Earth. Miss Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), who married and has a son with Richard White (James Marsden). Meanwhile, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) draws a bad plan using the crystals he stole from the Solitude Fortress to create a new earth and shelter the US. After all of Superman's delightful movies, unforgettable Christopher Reeve or TV shows like "Lois and Clark" (and Teri Hatcher) or "Smallville", great hope has been created for Superman's return to Bryan Singer. Unfortunately, the terrible story is too long and boring, with many unnecessary parts, lack of excitement and overrated in IMDb. In addition, the romance between Lois Lane and Superman is something ridiculously ridiculous. Actress Kate Bosworth, twenty-two, is misleading, playing the role of a mature reporter and the experienced mother of a five-year-old boy. Brandon Routh is two years younger than Tom Welling, who plays a teenage Clark Kent in Smallville. The character of Parker Posey, Kitty Kowalski, is actually a bad caricature. Last but not least, despite being a terrible Lex Luthor, Kevin Spacey is forty-five years old, older and older than the other cast. The conclusion of the corny seems to be a soap opera and it is terrible. My vote is four. Title (Brazil): "Superman Returns"
