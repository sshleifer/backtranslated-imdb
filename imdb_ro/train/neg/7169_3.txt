This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. However, the little slave girl, Alice and Jared Harris who mimics Christopher Walken is what makes this movie fun. Smoking, drinking and the unusual way to show up when her name is called is strange and interesting. I have to applaud Jared for the imitation of Christopher Walken and Christopher Walken for allowing the film to be in the movie.
