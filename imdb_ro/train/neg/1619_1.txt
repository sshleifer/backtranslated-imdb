At the beginning of the movie, beautiful photography and fox scenes were amazing. However, the story was so slow and boring. And then the little girl begins to quench her fox, which leads to tragic events. We live in the forest and we often see foxes. One thing one should know is that let the wild animals be wild and enjoy it far. This movie is a terrible example for children who will follow it, trying to make a wild creature in a pet. I do not know what should have been the point of the story. Even after the terrible events with the main fox, the little girl still wanted to play with the kits. Does not teach the lesson? And there are other scenes featuring predator animals to foxes, which only add to the trauma caused to children watching this movie. What a disappointment was this movie. And what horrible story she says. The final dialogue was so stupid, when my wife and I were screaming at TV! I hated this movie absolutely and I would not recommend it to anyone!
