My name is Modesty is a low budget movie that tells of the origin of Modesty Blaise. It's not that the movie is terrible, it's not what we were expecting or hoping for. While I was aware of the character of Modesty Blaise for years, I'm not too familiar with comics or graphic novels, so I come to this film as an outsider. This may be part of my disappointment. I was expecting more action and more comedy. The film is led by dialogue. I suppose we were looking for something with a lower value of the camp. As it is, my name is Modesty is a deadly serious film. There are very few moments, if any, "light". The actor, at least from Alexandra Staden, is acceptable, but there is nothing special. As others have commented, it seems a bit too fragile to be completely credible in the lead role. What action scenes exist in My Name is Modesty are one of the weakest movies. I never bought the idea that this woman could treat a gang of trained murderers. I really hope that Quentin Tarantino continues and makes rumors about a big-budget movie based on the character of Modesty Blaise. I am convinced that the concept has a lot of potential and I would be very much expected to do so.
