Immediately, this movie was ridiculous. Not that he did not have redemption issues? For example, the best thing about this movie was the beautiful background landscape. Anyone who does not live on the East Coast should know that the South has no beautiful mountains like the West. I knew Utah was really on the bats, but perhaps Dalton could not suppress the English accent, so they had to apologize by saying that it was a southern city. Stressing its emphasis on one in the south was easier. Of course the movie has plotting, but its false sense of place was something I could not get through. It's not like Utah has no lab met ... so why the writers thought it necessary to pretend it was in the south is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Another thing in action pictures always messes with me. Why do I always make the sound "spinning" when the character pulls out an automatic gun? It seemed that every other sound effect in this movie was a "chuk-chich", meaning that a 9mm was loaded and ready for fire. Of course, weapons already had rounds, so it was not necessary. <br /> <br /> Finally, the pyrotechnics was WAY over the top. But, hey, this movie has been geared towards a particular market segment, I suppose ... It's too bad. Each of the actors can act, but this movie has been blades.
