Anyone who actually had the ability to sit in this movie and feel like a good movie does not appreciate quality movies. This movie was an insult to watch, the direction was high-quality film high school as well as cinema. The Blair Witch project had a better cinematography and I hate this movement with a passion! The story had the potential to be a very intense movie, but it has fallen from the first 10 minutes in the rest of the movie. Someone mentioned that this film was about a child's imagination, well, that's good and good. But they could still do better with this scenario than they did. I mean, come in the store indian. Did the child look at the little idol and suddenly imagine the Indian and the whole story of an Indian spirit called Wendigo? What she mentions to the store's employee and she says there is no one else but me to work here, so you're thinking of a scary fantasy scenario, but then she just barterizes the idol sum and forgets that the kid sees this guy. It was so bold that it goes beyond pathetic. The end to the left you ask not only what happened to Otis in the hospital, but also with the sense of GMO !!! Why the hell I wasted my time to see this! This is a move that I recommend not to look at, I'm definitely better quality movies that will not insult your intelligence! Thank God I never had to pay to see this movie, I would have asked for my money back! For those who were easily entertained by this movie ... it is very sad that you have lowered your standards to this level of filming to say it is a good movie.
