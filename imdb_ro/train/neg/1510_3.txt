Reasons to watch this beats ... err ... tribute to a great movie called Se7en: - It's while your navigation channel and there is nothing more on. - Someone's paying you to look at her. Do a favor and use the DVD for Se7en, rent it, download it on iTunes or put it in your Netflix words and jump all over The Flock. Flock the same story with, with a few changes. Moreover, the edition just hurts Se7en and, in fact, ends up getting out of the story several times. The worst is probably flying over desert helicopter shots, with sounds of people talking over the radio, except that there are no police helicopters flying over it. Bottom line: beat. If you want to be cute, you can tell him a tribute, let him go, but anyway, go to the Se7en watch.
