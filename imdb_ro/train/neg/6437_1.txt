Spoilers. First of all, nothing really happened in this movie, other than a woman bloody inexplicably. Secondly, it was not scary. Third, it had the worst soundtrack of any movie ever. Let me explain. Was the sound edited by either Beavis or Butthead? I'm not sure, so let's go with Beavis. The movie is gradually becoming more and more quiet, and people mumble and mutter, forcing you to raise the volume (I looked at this at home). Then, Beavis explodes some very strong sounds, with images of scary / shocking images, forcing you to reduce the volume again. This happens several times until, with pity, the movie ends. I imagine Beavis laughing grudgingly behind the mirror in both directions, as they followed the test group that was always at a distance. If you have children and prefer to watch scary movies after falling asleep, this is a big mistake. But then there is a big mistake anyway. Is this a thought? if you want to make a horror movie, add at least a free headless blonde, a 19-year-old blonde girl who shouts at the tip of his lungs just before he can take off his sweater, the shadow on the wall of a person being eaten alive only a camera camera, a cat tossed to the camera to scare the audience, a weird stranger with a maniacal laugh or a monster that looks like an aluminum foil-covered hand (TV Lost in Space). These people have not even tried to scare me. They just wanted to hurt my ears.
