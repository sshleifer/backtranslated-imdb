This film was awarded the 1990 Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. In the last few weeks, I have seen dozens of nominations and recipients of this award for the past 30 years and I really think this movie could be the worst of all - but it was not just a nominated but won! I suppose 1989 must have been a terrible year for genre. The film shows a group of characters that looks like a super-weak Uncle Festers. It seems to be simple articulated figures that are moved using the stop motion animation. They are all identical - with the same faces, bodies and clothes. The only difference is that each has a different number drawn on their backs. They all sit on a large platform that is suspended, as if by magic, in space. Each has a pole and is also a box on the platform. The platform starts to lean slightly, and in response, the men are moving in an effort to balance the platform. It continues and continues for the longest time. The only relief in this tedium is when one of them acts pretty ugly to the end, but it is not enough to make it fun to look at at least. Besides passive animation of stop motion, this short does not give anything of interest to me .... Nothing. By the way, the great short KNICK KNACK also came out in 1989 and I have no idea why she was not nominated. It was very short and was much better than any of the candidates that year or year ago. Perhaps Pixar's success in previous years has led to a bias against them, but KNICK KNACK is so smart and so funny that he almost seems to have denied a killer. Could Pixar not have entered? This seems unlikely.
