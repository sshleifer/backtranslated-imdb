Anyone who gives this movie a good review must obviously have something to do with its creation. This movie is a painful suckfest. The action is rigid, the generic stock of the stock is ridiculous, the direction is weaker and stranger, the teacher really is not that appealing (making the progress of the students so strange). The creative minds behind these garbage should break apart and spread to prevent such a concentrated craft. I'm sure some hungry children in Africa could have used the money scattered for this project. Hell, the funds would have seen a brighter end that would have fueled a crack addict; at least someone would have to take some entertainment out of it. The only reason why he did not give me a terminal illness, I will give a second film.
