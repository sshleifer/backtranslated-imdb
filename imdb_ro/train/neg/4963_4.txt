turned out to be another failed attempt on the ridiculous science fiction channel. I'm not sure who wrote the script and played the poetry, but I'm sure it was a 17-year-old teenager who thought it would be great to have a shrub in the movie. AAAAAAAH! when I saw that part, I lost all hope. Then ... they started for the heorot in what seems to be the ship Christopher Columbus sailed! when I arrive at Heorot (which should have been a Norwegian room), the sci-fi idiot group decided to make the heroot look like a big stone castle. when I saw that part. I wanted to scream. I really wanted this movie to be good, but science fiction has not yet produced a good movie, so I do not know why I have my hopes. Oh, and Grendel and his mother are also stupid. (this comment is outside of the "Grendel" topic) If someone in the science fiction channel reads this .. there are some good tips. NO EVENT WAS NOT ABOUT A LARGER MESSAGE WHICH CAN BE REPORT ON PEOPLE IN COUNTRIES WHICH DO NOT AFFECT THE SCIENCE OF SCIENCE! And also stop the low-grade players like Stefen Baldwin from being in your movies! DO NOT HELP THE FILM, BUT ANSWER!
