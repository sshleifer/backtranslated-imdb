I chose this film on the cover myself thinking that I was in an adventure at the level of "Indiana Jones and Temple Doom". Unfortunately, I was in marriage. Not like any yawn I had before. This yawn was so great that I could barely find something of quality in this movie. The cover has described amazing special effects. They did not exist. The film was so easy that even stereotypes were terrified. She gives the idea that you can solve problems with violence. All right if you want to teach your children. I do not know. Keep it away from it. If you're looking for family entertainment then you can find something more inspired elsewhere.
