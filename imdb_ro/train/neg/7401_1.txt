* Suspicion * Let her finnish to get a bad idea, breathe in proportion and try to sell her as cool. Lordi is a mediocre band at best, and a single gimmick will only do you so far. For everything you promote idiots out there: this is the reason for the inherent minority complex that is often encountered when Finland tries to export something. Lordi is not scary. Lordi is limp. Lordi is over. I want to apologize to the rest of the world for this idiotic face to the plastic. Sure, they won Eurovision. No, wait - they won Eurovision. That's it. I'm resting my case.
