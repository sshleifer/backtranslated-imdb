This movie is even a big step down from the typical Bollywood rate. The performances were horrible. Even Boman Irani, who manages to always shine, goes completely OTT like a bastard. Neither the soundtrack is memorable. And, despite trying hard, female leaders fail to be "sexy." Vivek Oberoi is able to project much better, while Fardeen Khan seems to be blocked at the same time. But this monstrosity is just under its limited capabilities as an actor. Esha Deol and Amrita Rao are horrible in the roles of the poorly written clich√©. It's time for Indra Kumar to close his hat. I hope he will never lead another eye like this one. The future of Hindi films is now in better hands. To summarize, stay away from cellulose waste.
