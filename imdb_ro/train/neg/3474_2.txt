This is horrible. The character of Ben Affleck is self-centered and courageously sadistic - get in-nose fratboy sadic. And it's romantic HERO! His cartoon character does not change from start to finish, but the money eventually allowed him to buy his happiness. If I were a Socialist, I would salute beyond faith, but I'm not Socialist. br /> <br /> We, the capitalists, like a little Christmas magic from time to time. It's not magic. I do not know what it is. It's terrible. And it's a horrible waste of talent. O'Hara makes me laugh hysterically at the end of the '70s. Gandolfini. Applegate. These people were little used. If Ben had left the equation, these people could have dreamed something excellent.
