Occasionally there is a new entree of foreign films. This is their great attraction. They take it from life and serve it cruelly. American movies rarely dare to touch the forbidden subjects of society. Too many suspensions and a morbid fear of financial failure. The Almighty Dollar determines their selections. Something that invites European directors. In addition, audiences around the world remain hungry for "different" films, especially for those who offer a salty bite in the wretched and suffering humanity. Despite the fear of directors or producers, many audiences wanted the beauty, poetry and dusty flavor of life. That's what the film "To the Father's Left" gives the audience curious. A family enclosed in the belief that family unity results from the unity of obedience to tradition. However, when the patriarch of a family forgot that its members are flesh and blood, full of dreadful dreams, unrestrained, and dark passions, then the two are in motion against themselves. Selton Mello interprets Andr√© as a son who tries to control his inner passions with his father's philosophy. Raul Cortez plays his father. Simone Spoladore is Ana a young woman who tries to quit a forbidden thirst in family waters. Leonardo Medeiros is Pedro, the older brother. The film offers a lot, but it takes a very timeless period to say. ***
