"Valentine" is another horror movie that adds to the list of movies and movies (think of "Halloween", "Friday 13", "Scream" and "Know what you did last summer"). It's certainly not as good as those movies I've listed, but it's better than most of the ripples that came out after the first movie "Friday 13". One of those films was Canadian in 1981, "My Sloquance Valentine," which I hate a lot. "Valentine" is a better movie than one, but does not say too much. Plot: a bastard boy is teased and pampered by some colleagues from the beginning of the film. Then the movie moves many years later when all the classmates are getting bigger, then they're taken off one by one. The killer is supposed to be the young boy now, all of them grow up looking for vengeance. But is he? Or maybe someone else? "Valentine" has an attractive cast, including Denise Richards, David Boreanaz, Marley Shelton, Jessica Capshaw and Katherine Heigl. They do what they can with the material they have, but an unplanned scenario does not make them right. There are, however, some frightening moments. <br /> <br /> ** (out of four)
