Indeed, everyone in this movie seems to want to be somewhere else! No wonder pouring is not done with the left hand, but rather not at all. I did not see anything worse than Natascha McElhone, who behaved like an agent wearing a gun. Do not use a spoiled look like this. The only worse thing I can imagine is the banishment of Doris Day as a prostitute. The rest of the cast is also terrible, possibly with Hurt as the only exception, sometimes you can see him trying but suffering. Oh, did I mention that it's a completely crazy story? To endanger many lives because you are divorced and want to see the family? Well, must it be because the guy (Weller) is German? 2/10, because the picture might be worse.
