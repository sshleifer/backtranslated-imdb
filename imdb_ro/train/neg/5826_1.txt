The sleek and beautiful pictures have changed to one another, with somewhat annoying music (you know Bjork) in the background, for the first 75% of the movie. If you have not slept enough, it's the right time. <br /> <br /> But in the last 20% of the film director he decides to bring ideas of rebirth, reincarnation or something else, through S & M images: "spiritual lovers" cut each body with knives. For me it was very disturbing and, in fact, changed the general impression of the blend of abstract art and the images of the modern Japanese mystery. <br /> <br /> The operator and the director are wonderful but strange. <br /> <br /> I did not like it at all.
