I have said this in other reviews, without a story, you can give the audience all the smoke and mirrors you want, yet no one will fuck. The director seems to have a wonderful eye for the 30-year-old art (which I love), and I think the idea of ​​using all the digital backgrounds and such things could indeed be the wave of the future in film production. However, it is obvious that the director was so interested in the digital rendering of his film, he forgot to film many scenes that would have helped enormously in this surprisingly highlighted film. (SPOILER) Because they shouted loudly, they forgot to have a bastard in this thing! OK, they have one, but it's been 20 years since the movie was shot. Conran loses the point of having a villain. As for the action, we must see that Sky Captain shoots a robot, two or three planes (before Dex (Ribisi) stops them stopping them!) And a couple of robots, but the one he spends his time looking and urging others to fight for him. Paltrow as Polly or Peggy or Punky or anything else is completely wasted in this movie (the reviewer commenting on her and Law Chemistry's lack of chemistry is so right) and I'm a little sick to see repeated shots of her room top , showing that she has only two left left, both of which she later lost in the film, a non-comic one, a pretty funny one, although I have seen her coming from the age of 70. No one, except for Paltrow's law, has a significant time on the screen, and that's the real flaw of the movie. An audience does not identify with the robots, they need a hero to root, and a villain visible and hateful to hate. Without that, plus a good story, the whole CG in the world will not help.
