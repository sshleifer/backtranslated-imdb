This is one of those movies that appears on cable, like two afternoons, to entertain the bored housewives during boiling. The act is the second rate. Poor Mathew Modine seems to look during sleep throughout the movie. And God help Gina Gershon. Her accent is too great. She does not sound like a real English woman. It sounds forced and false, like her actor. She should stay at what she does best, a lesbian showgirl con-artist who plays in a rock & roll band and has a drug problem. The other characters are not better. They are two dimensions. empty, vapid and silly. How should we care about these people? At one point, Christy Scott Cashman is losing to Central Park. Really? It's not hard to navigate Central Park. Just follow any path. Not only did not any of the characters caress me, but I hated them. The only reason I stayed with this film wreck was Fisher Stevens. Even his bright humor could not save that dying fish. Every scene is a romantic comedy and nothing can surprise us. The script was terrible, just like the act. If you catch this fish, throw it back!
