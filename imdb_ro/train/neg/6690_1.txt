I sat down to see this movie with my friends with very low expectations. My expectations were not where it was low enough. Frankly, I could not tell what kind of movie it was from watching her, and if it was a comedy, humor was totally missed. The plot was non-existent, and the act was terrible. My friends and I have been able to watch about 30-40 minutes of this movie before stopping it and promptly asked the video store to take it back. I do not recommend this movie to anyone unless you intentionally intend to watch the worst movies of all time. Honestly, I do not know how this movie lasted more than a day in theaters and, moreover, I do not understand why someone would like to look at it, given not only the very uninteresting title, but also the lack of any famous actress / actress its issue. This review is not a joke and I honestly believe that this could be the worst movie ever made. It's definitely the worst movie I've ever had to sit on.
