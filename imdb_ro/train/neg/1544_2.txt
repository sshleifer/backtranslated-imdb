I think I laughed twice. The line where the main character says something about being on the streets. And then I forgot the other time I laughed. It was probably the beginning. This must be one of the thinnest movies ever. Hollywood does not realize that this kind of humor is degrading and sad, indeed. You can insult so many times. <br /> <br /> 2/10
