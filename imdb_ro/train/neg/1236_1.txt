What has ever happened to one of the most innovative and brilliant storytellers of our time? Well, he did the kind of typical fodder summer action that somebody could do in the film school ... and in fact he probably would have done a better job. At least he should have put half a thought in the dreadful writings. Mark Wahlberg plays an astronaut who traveled through a sort of wormhole and landed on a monkey-driven planet. Except for this moment, the monkeys slipped through a terrible, nonsense and special effects dialogue that consistently reinforces the fact that this money could have been placed on about 10 independent films that would have been considered "masterpiece "as much as I do. As I enjoy the excellent actor talent, which is Tim Roth, his performance as an evil monkey leader, Thade, is nothing but an intense composition of heavy bloating and breathing. Fortunately for him, makeup allows an actor to maintain a certain dignity, and most of the shit is hidden behind the groans and sniffles. And, unfortunately, Hollywood's ever-trusting tradition of taking the male, and women driving them and coupling them, without any development or cause. And "haha, we are so intelligent, are not we?" how Hollywood interlaces the original POTA references in it. Support yourself ... Instead of seeing this, spend the night and call some friends and rent "Ed Wood", "Edward Scissorhands," "Batman," or even "Sleepy Hollow" to a lesser extent, and remember the days when Tim Burton was a man of vision and originality ... not ashamed and ridiculous.
