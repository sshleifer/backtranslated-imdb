This movie is another great example of what Jerry Bruckheimer, in 1997, seems to be the best one year before his release and did not come up with a quality film. I'm not a film critic, but the movie was as predictable as they were. Every attempt at a joke, every attempt in a moment, and a sorry attempt at a love story, was exactly what I predicted in my mind. Do yourself a favor and save your money on this.
