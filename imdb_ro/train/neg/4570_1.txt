Ridiculous. This film is actually a vehicle for the Ramtha Illumination School. If you are wondering who Ramtha is: "Ramtha is a 35,000-year-old warrior who appeared in JZ Knight's kitchen in Tacoma, Washington in 1977. Knight claims to be Ramtha's channel, Ramtha and sessions in which he pretends he enters a trance and speaks English version of Hollywood Elizabethan in a gruesome voice, harassing. He has thousands of followers and made millions of dollars to play at the Seminar Branch ($ 1,000 per crack) (Clark and Gallo, 1993), must have hypnotic powers, seek self-fulfillment, otherwise ordinary people obey her orders to spend long hours with eyes, luck, useless, without losing. John Wheeler, one of the best physicists American theorists, will be watching this film. In the recent past, he criticized parapsychologists for wrong misuse and misinterpretation of quantum theory. There is a wonderful review of this movie at Skeptico. We recommend anyone who is thinking about watching this movie read it first before contributing to the coffers of a cult. Http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2005/04/what_the_bleep_.html I noticed a commentator here at IMDb say take this movie with a grain of salt. There will be enough salt to kill a horse to wander through the garbage thinking of this film.
