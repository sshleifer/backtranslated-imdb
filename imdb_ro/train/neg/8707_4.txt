This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I rented it as a joke, waiting to get rid of the first scenes and tell me I did not laugh so much in my life. The first scene where the ninja accidentally came out of the air and started a huge and ridiculous fight of fire is one of the most incredibly funny cinematic moments of action in my life. This is not a dinosaur movie, but rather a movie that makes fun (and does not mean at all) the kind of action. I did not see the first two, but judging by the complexity of the plot, I do not think I have much to lose. If you want to see a movie that goes well with a six pack or herbal remedy, than insist on renting this movie and going back and watching 100 years of advancement in cinema, throw yourself into the basket trash and hit your carnosor
