After seeing the hot Eliza Dushku in the Wrong Tower pretty well, I decided to choose it instead of Return of the Dead from all the movies. I have not seen him yet, but considering it to be one of the most popular horror films ever, I'm sure I made the wrong choice. There is nothing to recommend this movie and talk about the alleged felon. He did not even have his youthful, mediocre sexual recourse to poor films such as "I Know What You Did Last Summer" or "Valentine" or "Urban Legend". It just did not make any sense, had no enthusiasm, had very interesting interesting or compelling writing. The launch date has apparently been disabled several times for about a year, and the reason is obvious. The whole movie comes like a bunch of meaningless scenes, thrown together, accidentally without meaningless effects. Go wrong in return if you want to see Dushku. I'd like to see a movie with her and super-hot Elisabeth Harnois - but I do not even think this movie could be tracked. Casey Affleck, so promising in Good Will Hunting, is terrible here - he seems to lack both intelligence and courage. That's enough for that.
