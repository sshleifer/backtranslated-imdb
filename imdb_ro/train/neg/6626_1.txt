I saw the movie and I was cheated, because the movie was crazy and boring. I thought the gopal man wool would justify his work, but unfortunately he failed and the whole movie was spoiled and spoiled "sholay". distribution and crew were bad. the entire theater slept while watching the movie, some people fled in the middle. the action of amithab bachan is weak, we thought this movie would be the biggest success of the year, but this movie will be the biggest flop of the year, sure. no one has done justice to their work, including Ajay devagan. this movie does not deserve any audience. I bet this movie will flop. <br /> <br /> "Finally, this movie moves"
