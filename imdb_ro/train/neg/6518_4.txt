The movie is quite funny and involves about four meetings, then it becomes an obvious claim to a guy you (and even his "friends") really can not resist. It's a pretty interesting concept; the film meets in an attempt to find true love in modern LA. The problem is that it feels incredible (and bad) scripted times and self-promotion blatantly. It's hard to care for and be attracted to any of the characters, because the writer / actor is so selfish, inappropriate, untrue and simply inappropriate. Finally, you're sorry for his meetings.
