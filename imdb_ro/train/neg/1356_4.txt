First and completely and with confidence I disagree with the user who calls this a "spoof". Crispin Glover is very serious about his film. He personally introduced the film to the screening I saw in Chicago. He has worked for years on film and is the first in a trilogy. "What is it?" is Crispin Glover's attempt at an art film older than Herzog, Lynch, etc. I heard rumors about this film years ago "epic porn movie with all syndrome programs described in crispin glover". When it finally came out I followed the on-line trailer and read the synopsis and frowned with anticipation. ... I went to Chicago to see and it was a great disappointment. If he had pulled out of his mouth, like a grandmother and a dance doll, he would have stayed with something much better, but only 10 minutes long. In other words, just watch the trailer, have fun and leave it to her. There are some striking images and fantastic juxtapositions and phrases, but its lack of concentration means disappointment.
