Why have I never seen or heard about this junk movie? It's right in my alley with bloody teenkill, ridiculous plot and an irresistible cheese atmosphere around 80 years. For some reason, nobody is interested, the staff and students of an elite Catholic university are killed by an unknown psychopath. The newly recruited teacher, Julie Parker, gets involved when everyone who comes into contact with them either returns dead or behaves strangely. This movie is hilarious bad! There is absolutely no logic or coherence, and each character is just as meaningless to others. For example, a girl is killed and her body is thrown into a container. Then, and for no reason, the story moved sharply three weeks ago, yet a murdered girl is never mentioned or even missed. Not even her boyfriend! The act is pitiful and there is not even a bit of nudity to enjoy. The killer's discovery is quite funny because the producers seemed really convinced it was an original twist ... No, boys! Splatter University is easily one of the worst horror turkeys.
