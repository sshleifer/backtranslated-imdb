This movie is simply horrible. John Ritter makes a pratt crash, 75% of the actors give their lines as if they read it from books, bad editing, horrible mix of sound (dialogue is hard to rise above the background noise) and a plot that - It's not going anywhere. I did not think I would ever say, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this movie. There are at least 3 others who suck more. Patti Hansen offers his lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she did not die inside. Even Bogdanovici's children are terrifying (the oldest is surely reading the lines in a nailed book). This movie is badly horrible. There is a reason why Bogdanovich could not get another project until after 4 years. Do not look at her. If you see it on your TV list, unplug the cable. If a friend suggests you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wishes to pursue her, it is better to find another soul soul. I'd rather put my eyes out with the arrows of lawn than stay again through this garbage. If I could sum up this movie in a word, that word would be: Suckotrocity
