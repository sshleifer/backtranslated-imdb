Stewart Moss plays the role of a scientist who is on a working trip with his wife and feels he has been chosen for his role for his ability to turn his eyes in the head ... Imagine your auditions for it .. "you can ... no, it's not so, thank you, the next!" Anyway, he's bitten by a bat and then turns into a kind of bats creature and kills people or ... he is not. Because no one else sees the strange changes, but he himself seems to think he's changing, because his wedding ring opens when his hands turn into claws, etc. To figure out, the movie stops if it's not strange or if it actually turns into something near the end. This has some good locations and a kind of decent atmosphere sometimes, but unfortunately none of these can compensate for the story of somewhat tormented and a terrible action. Kind of fun in a way "so bad is good," but it is more relying on the bad. 4 out of 10.
