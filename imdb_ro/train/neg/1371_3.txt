I can not figure out how anyone can get a budget for such a bad movie. It's like the television station is desperate for anything, anyway. They are buried under a pile of snow, electricity continues to blink and stop, but magically there is a background light that remains constant. Where does all this light come from (false)? That, and all that stupid thing among the characters. They seem to be more interested in complaining each other than trying to invent ways of survival. Try to create that urgent feeling and help people. But because he's so bad about the director and the actor, you will not resolve Florence Nightingale with this move, I'm sorry. I subscribe to negative feedback and I agree that this is one of the worst movies ever.
