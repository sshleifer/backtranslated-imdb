The Columbo films have been down for years, this year it may have come to the bottom. Peter Falk offers the same unspeakable performance and comes as frightening in this film. As is customary in this series, protocols at the crime scene are unheard of, so plausibility is always lacking. Brenda Vaccaro chews the landscape and pulls pantomime, and Andrew Stephens is a pretty unconvincing woman. However, his weakness was a hohot! The script was through the numbers and delivery patronize. He should never have brought Columbo in the nineties, they just left us all with one or two happy memories of intelligent plots, better scripts, and sharp features.
