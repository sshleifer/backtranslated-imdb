I saw about a thousand horror films. (my favorite guy) This movie is among the worst. For me, an idea leads a movie. So even a badly made, inexpensive movie can be good. Something strange is definitely made cheap. However, he has little to say. I still do not understand what the karate scene has to do with the movie. Something strange has nothing to offer. Save your pain!
