I saw this movie at the AFI Dallas Festival. Most of the audience, including my wife, enjoyed this comedy drama, but I did not. They are Lucas Haas (Brick, Alpha Dog), Molly Parker (Kissed, Cinci Sense, Hollywoodland) and Adam Scott (First Snow, Art School Confidential). The director is Matt Bissonnette, married to Molly Parker. All three actors do a good job in this movie about 3 friends, the marriage of two of them and infidelity involving the third. Everything takes place in a house with a lake and looks great. The film wants to treat the subject first as a comedy and then a drama and I thought it should be the other way around.
