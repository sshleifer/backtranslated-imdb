There are not many good things to say about Subteran, Soderbergh's inadequate effort in neo-noir. Soderbergh reshaped our decent loyalist Robert Siodmak Criss-Cross, without changing the plot too much, yet the adaptation drains him from every single of his latest night-time atmosphere, giving him the same story staged the most less appealing, life styles and anachronisms. Soderbergh, who will later make wonderful crime films such as Out of Sight and the Ocean series, with a style and a special atmosphere, draws the dangerous way of modernization by renovating the story with the ugliest, sweetest, and lower ways of Early 1990s. Nightclubs have terrible garage gangs dressed in rebellion, Peter Gallagher's black version of Burt Lancaster's anti-hero is left by his fatal girlfriend for compulsive purchase of modern cinematographic devices, would be stereo, television and other equipment so far out of the film. It could have been more fun and less boring if he had had some rescue salutes as a good score, more meat for his characters, more than William Fichtner offering shows that are not wooden, a richer rhythm. Unfortunately, Underneath does not have any of these things. Soderbergh, a good director, does not use his dry detachment for the benefit of his movie this time. "This provision works great when he helped a crime film with more language on the cheek such as George Clooney's previously mentioned images or a social drama or characters such as trafficking or sex, lies and video tapes. With a movie like Underneath, it intensifies the boredom faced by the viewer.
