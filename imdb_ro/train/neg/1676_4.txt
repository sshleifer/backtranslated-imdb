Val Kilmer, solid performance. Dylan McDermott, solid performance. Josh Lucas, solid performance. Three very involved actors delivering decent performance. The problem is: who's taking care of the plot? John Holmes. Infamous for his well-equipped goods, a drug addict, and a guy who, despite contracting AIDS, continued to make adult movies, is not an interesting character. and after a vile mass murder that took place at the end of the 1980s in Los Angelos, to which Holmes was tied up, arrested and accused of murder and eventually acquitted. As in the case of JO, the guilt factor, regardless of the outcome, was quite large in the "He did it" area. There is no one to sympathize with this movie, he is a self-serving criminal. There is nothing interesting here.
