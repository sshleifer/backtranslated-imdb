What happened to Peter Bogdanovici? Once a brilliant director, a track blazer ... is back on his ass ... Is he the same guy who directed "The Last Picture Show"? Here, he takes a somewhat interesting (though premeditated) premise and turns it into a bubble gum that loses its flavor when you take the first bite ... Dunst is not bad, but Izzard is mistakast that Chaplin and all the other actors were cast for their "appearance" and not because they were right about that part. Sin. I'll give up again on Paper Moon.
