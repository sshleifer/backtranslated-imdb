This movie is really wack. In fact, I can not say anything about this, in addition to the moral truth expressed in the film's climax about the neighbors who are involved in the fight against crime. In addition, the movie had nothing: no good shot, no good action, no good scenario. I give this film a F and a 2 out of 10.
