This movie is AWESOME. I followed her the next day with my cousin Jay-Jay. He said he is fine, but I think I RULEZZZ! I mean, it's great. Ted V. Mikels is so brave and intelligent. He made a totally different film from Hollywood's horror movies, like Matrix and Stop or my mom will shoot. It could have been better, though. I like ninja and pirates. I also like that big bead that the funny man is wearing. I think he's the youngest guy in that type of pestilence at Domino Pizza. Not only does this movie look cool, like those non-focused movies that my father did to me on my birthday when I turned 6. That tells a complex story with dozens of characters that seem be unrelated at the end. It is genius how this network is woven to make everything happen. I would like Ted V. Mikels to make a follow-up. But he needs more foreigners. And a pirate.
