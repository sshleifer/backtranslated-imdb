The most embarrassing moment in this movie is when Brady Corbet says, "You've blossomed," the movie's close to the end. Basically, I'm dead. I'm still not sure why the scriptwriters put that line there. Should he have a love story? Because it almost made me die. <br /> <br /> The rest of the script was almost as bad. I never liked the original Thunderbirds, but a Thunderbirds movie has the potential to do so. This movie does not. If he did not have the Thunderbirds trademark, he would have been thrown directly to the TV or preserved in post-production. Maybe right before. <br /> <br /> As I said, the best thing about the movie is when the credits roll down and play the Busted song "Thunderbirds go". I can not believe I lost $ 7 tracking this by pay-per-view.
