the only thing that happens frequently in my head while writing this review is, I will never get that half hour back! to show that I'm not just blowing air, I will compare the movie to the other movies of the cube trilogy (cube and hypercube)! The cube was not great but it was original and made for some technical defects! as a sequel lost the advantage of originality, but it went out looking pretty sharp and even liked beter than cube (the story was better)! but the zero cube, compared to its predecessors, does not really deserve a complete lack of good fx, a very f * ck * d scenario and simply old bad does not combine well! For example, all the time during the movie I thought it would be incredibly stupid if ... it should happen and then it would happen, so it's not too original either! my advice: do not miss that hour and a half I lost !!!!!!!! oh and I hope this movie collapses and burns !!!!!!!
