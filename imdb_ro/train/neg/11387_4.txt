Medellin is a fabulous place to live, work and study. I've been there twice, and I've never heard of guerrilla activities, paramilitaries taking hostage tourists or something. There are "invisible policemen," but it's not a * Big Brother system. There is only enough police to make them visible in everyday life, but they do not hurt anyone without good reason. The Sierra is an interesting documentary in which young people described in the movie become essential characters. Film directors carefully set the lines of plot between the daily actions of La Sierra residents, and when a "character" dies, there is a genuine pathos. It is hard to imagine that the three young men are members of the Bloque subway, a band that terrorized La Sierra before the Colombian government began restructuring the country. The Sierra is not an accurate picture of life in Colombia; there are, of course, things that need to be prudent, such as minor offenses, but when pickpocketing is taking place in "modern" cities such as London, New York or Tokyo, Columbia does not seem to be different. Colombia is eagerly looking forward to showing the world that the country once thrown out of war is thriving now more than ever.
