Everything in this movie is bad, the story, the action, the effects but fun, funny, funny! Scott Valentine with the uniform of the ten-size army uniform is so bad, trying to smile the leader of a special hilarious group on the face! "Terrorists" are just as frightening and realistic as "raptors", it's so fake and bad about everything trying to laugh. The part where the T-REX giant, who slipped somewhat aboard a ship and then somehow got down, is thrown up and you will see the pole metal stuck where its head was the perfect end. If your in bad movies, this is golden pot, mona lisa bb-bad!
