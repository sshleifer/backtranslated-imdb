So I finally saw the movie "My Left Foot" last night, after I told my mom how amazing it is ... Day-Lewis's central performance is really remarkable and stunning, but everyone has an exposure the minimum for the other work should not expect anything less. The wrong judgment in my eyes was that, becoming obsessed with proving the normality of this man; the film chose to look like a complete and complete robbery. On the one hand, I see that this is a logical correlation; humanity has always the capacity to be unacceptable, and disability should not notice it. I want those impartial spectators not to forgive so much of the aberrant behavior and assume that the circumstances automatically make them forgiving. They do not have. Action is normal, so yes, people with disabilities behave - but do not do it because they are disabled; they do it because they are unreasonable. A physical failure does not allow you to cast your face in public, just because someone you love is coming back. There are certain things that it is not wise to do if you are disabled or capable -bodied. Giving a person with tacit permission to upload a football directly into your head with the unique purpose of matching is one of them. (Of course, I once saved a strike from the school striker with my face, but I already belonged until then. It was not acceptable.) Engaging in a bar battle is another. By discovering that your father only expands your company, once you have proved able to jump metaphorically through physical circles, masochism takes a step too far. All these things are bad, and suffering through them as a way of demonstrating your bravery does not make them worse. <br /> <br /> So da; just because you have overcome the obstacles to the realization of the great things, do not harm at all ... The fact that you are a good person has priority; establishing an inspired example for people with disabilities should appear far down the list.
