This film is undoubtedly the worst horror movie I've ever seen. And that says a lot, considering that we have seen such stinkers as Demon of Paradise, Lovers' Lane and Bloody Murder (which is almost a second). However, I like bad horror films and, as you can say from my username, it really goes out. Sometimes there is nothing more fun than a weak blow. As for this film, the opening scene in which a woman fries in a tanning room seems to have no influence on the film, especially since the film fails to tell you that the event occurred with 2 before the rest of the film. The act is not non-existent, and most of the filming is in the areas of women who get fat in spandex. The policeman was the most monotonous actor I've ever seen. The best / worst part of this film, however, must be the murder weapon. A giant safety bolt ?! What did they think? Who is the killer? An unhappy employee of "Huggies"? I should have given this movie a general zero, but darned if I did not have an explosion watching it
