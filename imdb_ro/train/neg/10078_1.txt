Boy-girl love business / sequel with songs, just this time she is punkette and he is the right arrow. Movie-buffs out there, in fact, like this movie? Has the fans? I have to say that the mind is spinning ... "Grease 2" is a truly lame enterprise that does not even have the courage, malice or bad luck to take in the memory of its predecessor in flames (such as "Jaws 2" or " Exorcist II "). No, it moves slowly and often plays dead. It looks and feels inexpensive, with a large casta lost in the middle of the disordered direction and uninhabited handling. This was the first time a substantial audience had received a miracle by Michelle Pfeiffer and, although she did not feel embarrassed, was a role to forget. A fire at the lowest level. NO STARS from ****
