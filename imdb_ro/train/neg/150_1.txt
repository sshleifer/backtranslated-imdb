Dude, really !!!! where have you been the last 20 years, that's shocking in every way, horror? This is a joke, there is nothing wrong with the low budget, but this is a laugh. If you want to look at classics, Freaks of Tod Browning, Dracula and Frankenstein's victims, The Undying Monster, Ernest Thesiger, Paul Wegener Golem, and The Ghost Train passengers, you can not compare it, give it a bad name, a bad action , a bad scenario, etc. The total amount of money and spare time, watched a lot of movies, it was like my favorite horror of all time, I'm really speechless, I have nothing to say that please do not make the effort to follow something so confusing, please understand
