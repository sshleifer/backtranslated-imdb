Wow! I remember so many terrible movies spinning around high school since the early 1980s. They usually had a trusted plot and many 27-year-old actors who pretend to be students. When I watched this movie, I felt a bit of nostalgia to grow in the 1980s. However, then I find out that this movie was made in 1989? Say what! Well, the nostalgia factor ends right here, it's just bad. The plot has the city preparing to close a high school and threatens the bus of all high school students in the central city. Which is odd, because the pupils in this school are both rich and abundant. In fact, the main character lives in a mansion. It makes you wonder how I can not find money to keep this school alive, have never heard of property taxes. Oh, but here's the kicker. School council says they will keep school alive if students can raise $ 200,000. So the seniors do that. Hmmm, you raise 200,000 dollars, but instead of saving this for college, did you put her to saving high school that you're Senior in? And why would an overpopulated school close down before the year comes out? And ... look, this movie was stupid and done in 1989!
