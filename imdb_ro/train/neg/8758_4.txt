It's not a movie, it's a collection of shows synchronized with the lips of the shows that were part of the British Invasion, which followed the Beatles' dynamic entry into the music world. Some of these actions did not make a great breakthrough on this side of the pond, but many of them did. Recommended are Hermit Hermit, Billy J. Kramer and Dakota, Peter and Gordon, Faguri, Nashville Teens, Animals and, of course, the Beatles. It's so fun to watch these young acts before they sew and polish their deeds.
