This movie starts slowly, then stops. After seeing for about an hour and seeing absolutely nothing, I went out. Nothing happened. Zero. Zip. Nada. There's no story. Characters are vague representations of the most bored that all of us know. Producers of this film could be sued if they try to sell it as a "motion" image. There is no movement. I could say the same "story" with a couple still legendary pictures. The script is a joke. It's terrible. I doubt that any screenwriter in the world could save her. The biggest regret is not that I lost 60 minutes of my life watching "Love in the money", but that we missed a great opportunity to be a leader. We could be the first one to come out, but I waited a little too much. Instead, I tracked about 20 people to come out in front of me.
