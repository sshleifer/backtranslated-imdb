This film has the core of a very good story. The work of men and women in the Coast Guard, especially in the North Pacific, is the stuff of heroes and legends. This film destroys a good story with three endings (no one satisfies), some unnecessary and useless battles of the bar and two alleged "romantic" relationships that have as much sparkle as the dead fire. The rescue scenes are wonderful - even if the computer generation is hockey and the scenarios are pretty unrealistic - but the backstory is blatant and disappointing. Costner is good - especially his hand acting (watch it). Ashton Kutcher is flat, but not terrible. The main female characters are dimensional. The best female is one of the Coast Guard sailors in the rescue center and she's in the camera for about two minutes in the whole movie. It could have been an excellent movie - and Costner needs one!
