What happened during the Second World War in New Zealand when there were American forces? This terrible story about 4 sisters was really pathetic. Can you imagine Joan Fontaine being a bigger sister to Sandra Dee? Fontaine looked more like her mother. Even more fun was that Fontaine becomes pregnant in the movie. Piper Laurie and Paul Newman who showed such chemistry on screen four years later in "The Hustler," do not have scenes together in this film. Laurie plays another sister who goes to Wellington to travel there, despite being married. Woe to her when her husband returns from the war. Jean Simmons is a widow and finds a love affair with Paul Newman. There's even a love story for young Miss Dee here. The image has little to no meaning. Are they trying to say that everything is right in love and war? If they are, they did a poor job of selling them. Conflict of interests with Newman and Simmons is quickly eliminated. That should have been done quickly for this terrible disappointing film in 1957.
