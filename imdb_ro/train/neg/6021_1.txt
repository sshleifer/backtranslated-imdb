I can not believe they managed to spend $ 17 million on this movie. Spectacular acts badly, flagrant scripting and the effects that you could do on the average PC, plotting unbelievable plot ... a reporter who can get an inexperienced stewardess a major job at the UN? What the? Not only that, but the message of this movie is so bad that you feel like trying to beat your head with a full size crucifix. All these films will preach the choir and make everyone else laugh at such ridiculous waste of money. If the producers of this film really wanted to influence people towards Christianity and show what it really means, they would have used the money to help people really in need. Now this could have made some listen to them.
