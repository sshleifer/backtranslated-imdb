This is a poor film. He has no real plot. We are never drawn to motivations other than wealth. Characters are some of the worst actors ever to have been on the film. The threat seems to be supernatural, but then it is controlled by these three elderly people. Why do what I do; to strike fear in the other members of the group? I do not know. There is a fog from a fog that rotates in the hallways and everyone seems to be afraid of it. Do something? I do not know. There is nudity for her sake. I'm always surprised to see this in old movies. Things have actually been established in this respect these days. Anyway, people run like chickens, ready for the ax. They have no plan; without resources; nothing. There are about five stupid apes in cinemas. Who are these people and "is" there a ghost or a demon. What happened to the others? We challenge anyone to tell me this with any confidence. What a mess.
