I'm watching bad movies. This movie is not good enough to be a bad movie. There is not a lot of humor, not a lot of talents along the way. <br /> <br /> I am LAZY. I usually see a bad movie and a curse. This was so bad, I actually did a review to try to save others from the completely dull misery to which I fell victim. I'm destroying my copy of this movie. <br /> <br /> It's too blatant to even use a clean room. So boring. Watch "Bloodsucking Freaks" or "Shock, shock, shock" for absolute shit that has some merit as entertainment. This mud seems terrible, it is terrible, and anyone who did it should feel terrible.
