I was thrilled to see a Catalu√±a movie in the Berlin competition. But after the presentation we were totally disappointed and angry. Too much blood, too much time, too many topics for nothing. The Spanish Civil War, like any war, was horrible. Revenge, a very human behavior, not at all, is featured in films and insignificant pieces, as well as the relationships between homosexuals and skepticism in Spain over Catholicism. But what Mr. Villaronga wishes is a pseudo-tragedy that may belong to the worst of the film's history. It's really a shame to see Angela Molina in this movie. I do not advise anyone to go see this movie in any way.
