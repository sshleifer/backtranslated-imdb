I went to see the Omega Code with a group of other Christians worth about 15 people. We all expected a good piece of Christian film. What I received was an aggressive, painful, drawn and boring attempt at a movie. It has good production values, but it also has a weak action, a poor scenario, a bad dialogue and no real direction. From the first 15 minutes I knew it would be a long night. We all hated it, and some of our group placed this film as a break in cheese rather than "Anaconda." None of us could think that the movie lasted less than 2 hours. Brilliant effects and cinema with a clear look can not save this bad, bad movie. I would give a 3 out of 10, and the rating is just so great because I rented the abominable "movie" Werewolf (1996) one night before watching this movie.
