This movie was physically painful, perhaps because (as many people my age as younger) I grew up with Dr. Seuss and loved his books - funny, smart, capricious and subversive at the same time. The Cat in the Hat sucks all the interest and spark of the story, and Mike Myer's performance as a Cat is largely amazing. Why the Borscht Belt, the mismatch, the inadequate jokes, the unmatched costume? I had to go back and read the books to see the real problem: the cards are SIMPLE. This movie is OVERBLOWN and a way, too long. You do not expect every child movie to be Toy Story or The Giant Iron, but it put a new low. How could Mike Myers have the money?
