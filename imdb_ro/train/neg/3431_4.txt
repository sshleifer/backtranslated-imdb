This is not as fun and upsetting as the DVD. I really like twisted and stunning movies, but that's really boring! It's an hour of penises out of the fish, flying Baby Born puppets and a lot of rape! I think the intention with this amateur lame was to make a bad-is-good movie, but it does not succeed. They were! Several scenes are good, but overall it's a mess. If you like amateur spitting like this (Just a better way) I would recommend Andreas Schnass "Violent Shit 2 and 3.
