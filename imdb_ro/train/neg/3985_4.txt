Flat, a common thriller about a convincing woman who deceives everyone she loves to grow her bank account. Nicole Kidman plays the misleading Tracey, married to the cute Andy (Bill Pullman). When an old school friend of Andy, called Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin), presents himself as a resident surgeon, the problems are not far behind him. Script fails because it does not carefully develop the promising premise into a true thriller thriller and the severe lack of personal motivation, background, and development. None of the distributors are able to generate interest in their superficial characters, especially Bill Pullman, whose inexplicably curious Andy is unbelievable. Poor director Harold Becker is left to try to revive an impossible project dead, and is unable to entertain any of them. Until the "secret" of the plot is revealed, you just do not care. At least the cinema has the appearance of Massachusetts. There are also stars George C. Scott, Peter Gallagher and Josef Sommer. Sunday, February 25, 1996 - T.V.
