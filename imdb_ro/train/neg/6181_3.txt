If you are a fan of the 3K Mystery Theater, Leeches Clap Attack, or Pinata Survival Island, this movie could be for you. I live in Nashville and I did not even know about the existence of this movie until the day before its launch, when the advertising company panicked and covered Row music with dozens of flyers and billboards. It barely lasted two weeks in cinemas. Spreading, poor writing and poor production were just beginning to describe this embarrassment of a movie. To begin with, the names are a little bit more: Bo Price, Angel, and Dixie? Eesh. <br /> <br /> The quiet delivery of the lines by Toby makes someone wonder what production assistant has been stuck holding the cue cards in the room. Angel's character quickly turns from her liveliest ways to a cowgirl that sneaks into the southern slang after two days on the farm. Her closet goes from chic to a feminine version of Toby - in fact, in the final stage, their costumes are the same, making a miracle if the cabinet assistant sounds ill. Audio is inconsistent - perhaps the most obvious example is when Toby decides to swim and his voice seems to sound like crying in a gym. There is never enough enough explanation or character development to make enough of what's going on on the screen. Overacting, exasperation, grimaces and dissatisfaction best describe the actors' interpretation and direction of the terrible scenario. This movie is best liked after drinking some alcoholic drinks and in the company of the best friends. But that does not say too much.
