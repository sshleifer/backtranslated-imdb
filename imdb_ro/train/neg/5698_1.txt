I almost drowned in CHEESE watching this movie. In fact, I could not even finish. I want my money back. Still a poor Hollywood attempt to come up with a new idea. Okay, I keep a lemon bowl in the fridge. Just in case. He should give Nic Cage a hat and a whip. Swashbucklin '. Cage's performance in Arizona's Growth or Las Vegas beats this "lemon". People who are fully commercialized (and most of them are) should love this movie. If this movie was animated, I would have taken it more seriously. I would rather like to see a completely stupid film that did not try to hide it. In my opinion, it was an incredibly stupid movie and made an incredibly sad attempt to try to hide that FACT. However, SHEEP seems to love him.
