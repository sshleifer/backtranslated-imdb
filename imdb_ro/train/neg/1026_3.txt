Wow. I do not think I've ever seen a movie with so many big actors who have had such a pivotal role, so bad. Justin Timberlake is probably the worst actor to land an important role in a movie with the power of the stars and the money behind him that Edison had. His actor was the PAIN to observe. The story was OK and all the other characters were played by professional actors, heck, even LL Cool J was fine because she had many small parts to cut her teeth. As the director and film company thought Timberlake was ready for this role, there was no way to understand. His character ruins his entire experience because every time he's on the screen you're actually rooted for corrupt policemen to imagine his bad ass, and he should be the hero ... I will not waste money on this at theater or on video. Maybe if you have HBO and you have nothing else to do at 2am on a Saturday night and you are drunk and stoned, this may be fine. Watching Timberlake in this role was like seeing a human Frog Kermit "act in a Hollywood blockbuster, it just did not work at all.
