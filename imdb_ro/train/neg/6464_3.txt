Watching Marlen Brando on the screen is like when you saw a carpenter carpenter giving complicated details to a piece of mahogany. Brando's actor is the only thing that makes this movie visible. The plot is anguished and ridiculous (not comic). The other big names seem to make desperate attempts to give the characters portrayed by modics of humanity ... these characters have humankind humanity. Everything about the technical side of this movie is mediocre or simply terrible. The director improperly throws lock and slowdown frames. Incidental music is animated and destroys any hint of dramatic effect. It's not something I really want in a movie, but even the wardrobe was very far away. Venerable Brando was unable to focus his attention on the awful cracks he had put on him. I've heard this movie called "David Lynch-esquire" and "impatiently annoying" ... there is none. David Lynch's films are worn by the creativity of wickedness - this film was not at all creative. And do not confuse failure to do so with stupidity.
