Another celebration day on February 13, even with some of his music! A group of young adults meet for a small high school reunion and start killing Jason Voorhees. Could that be the crazy guy they used to torture at school? The routine Slash Fest is fun for fans of the genre and has the usual T & A share for movies if it's his movie. The end is a bit more imaginative than your standard slasher. MPAA: Rated for violence / gore, language, sexuality, nudity, and some drug content.
