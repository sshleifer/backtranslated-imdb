Blank Check is easily one of the worst movies of the nineties. The plot is completely useless; his subtleties of loneliness are pathetic. You really think that a 12-year-old, acting as a personal assistant to a millionaire, could do everything in this movie, such as buying a mansion for a $ 300 boost. The notion, not to mention the price of the bargaining subway, will be considered by the most gullible spectators. Please respect your intelligence and do not watch this terrible and terrible movie.
