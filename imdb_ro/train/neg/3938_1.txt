Not even Timothy Hutton or David Duchovny could save this dead fish from a movie. To begin with, the script was written to be transformed into a B movie, but somehow Duchovny (looking for a starship to get out of the television) and Hutton (looking for the "two" of a "fist twice" he hoped that he will define his career after "The ordinary people") became attached to the image. Lines of arrival, large napkins from scene to scene (Come on - who uses the napkins after the 12th grade of the telecommunication class?) Even Duchovny is not immune to the plague that damages the evil, which is this film Only Timothy Hutton rises above I must admit that the feeling of Duchovny's pain reads the lines that are vocal.When I woke up laughing when I'm sure the director wanted me to feel frightened, nothing prepared me for Duchonvey's closing voice: if you ever want a doctor, make sure you call 911. "If only the studio would call 911, this dog in a movie would have never been done. Avoid at all costs. <br /> <br />
