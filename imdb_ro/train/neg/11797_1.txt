Watching this movie was the biggest waste of time and $ 2 for rent in my life. If nothing catastrophic happens before he dies, it will be the greatest regret of my life. Who ever thought about this movie or funded, deserves a kick between the legs, because they were thinking when they made this movie. This is an overweight type that is hopeless and writes a pretentious story that tries to get through poetry. He joins his amorous friend on a trip to the coast. Where girls meet and so. Only the fat type does not get a girl. The movements of the skin do not upset me, they take them for the face value. But this movie is trying to be more than a skin film. It's about a guy who deals with Fat, looking for love for a girl, but he meets another silicone bikini girl who enjoys his poetry. He finds his talent for volleyball, which receives money for his family and impresses the ladies, but anyway he has the lady. The dialogue is super-horrible for even a C movie. It supports a ton of black stereotypes, it has no character, is a glorified porn movie, with no porn in it. Never see this movie again.
