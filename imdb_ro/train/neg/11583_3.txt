This movie features a lot of characters and their relationships in the first half an hour or so. None of them generates any interest or positive response. I waited for the intrigue to begin, hoping for things to improve and get to the bitter end, but there was no reward to do that. If you want a synopsis, look elsewhere. For me, the action does not deserve to be reported. Not that the story was so bad, I think you might say I have problems with the script - that is. I thought he was embarrassed. A look at the credits will show you that there is a fairly powerful distribution that is used without any help. Most old professionals in this movement are doing good jobs; the actors I have not seen before, I especially liked Deborah Kara Unger. It's about everything I can say good about this picture.
