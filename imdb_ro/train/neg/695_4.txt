I've heard so much about this movie as it was a great slash and one of those movies started in the 80's that had died fans of most of the slave movies they just had to see. Well, I hired her and I have to say that although I kept my attention until suspense is taking place for most of the films, such as April Fool's Days, Friday 13, and Prom Night ", this movie could have been right up there, with the above mentioned, lacking the true enthusiasm and potential of the characters, as well as the continuing story. The characters we found were unfortunate to be in this movie was the strange type of hair frizzy that seemed creeping around the home and, of course, which led to its true climatic role eventually faced the killer. Another would be a dirty guy with a jean jacket, he could have played several roles in this movie that would have made the movie more interesting, instead the movie played this guy as just another loser out there making unknown calls while he sleeps with his girlfriend and then lowers his side and cuts it to the end that was a waste, I was disappointed at his side in the end. As to the true identity of the killer, when the identity was released about who he was, I just laughed, but it was obvious, and he did indeed a real villain on his own, as well as an annoying character after true intentions have been revealed. This movie should be one to look at at least once for all slasher fans, but you do not spend money earned on it in a rarely hard-to-find inventory.
