"Speedy Gonzalez" from Friz Freleng was the second cartoon that appeared after Robert McKimson's character, "Cat-tail for Two". In this cartoon, Speedy was a small ugly creature with a large golden tooth, but at his second appearance, the famous design has already been adopted. Despite the fact that it looks significantly nicer, Speedy has never developed into a character. A big hat, an extraordinary speed, and a bad Mexican accent do not make a classic character, and that's pretty much that Speedy had ever done for him. However, the small, courageous mouse turned out to be very popular and continued to play in several shorts, including some of the really stupid movies in the last days of the studio. While these Speedy shorts are better than those later atrocities in which he was frequent (rather strange) associated with Daffy Duck, they still leave much to be desired, relying on predictable, usually-based on a similar formula. In this episode, Speedy is recruited by other mice to steal cheese for them from the local factory, which is guarded by the Sylvester cat. Although it brings the extra weight of a star to the cartoon, Sylvester's role here might be as easily filled with any other cartoon cat. His personality is weakened by the fact that he is forced to be predictable. the undemocratic role of the pursuer. This has always been a problem in Tweety cartoons, but Speedy makes an even sweeter opponent, thanks to his devious cock and the blatant impossibility of his capture. Old Poor Sylvester would have forced him to join Speedy for many years to come. Despite the fact that, after a fairly basic formula and minimal laughter, "Speedy Gonzalez" won an Oscar and a great star was born.
