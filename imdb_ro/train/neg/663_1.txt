Imagine the scenario - you're at the cinema just because you're in Washington for the weekend and it rains and you're done with the museums. You think you could go see Sarah Marshall's movie because the trailer looks like this and you do not have to hire your brain. It's sold. Options? - Banking jobs in Bruges, Leatherheads or Prom Night. You have seen the Bank jobs (surprisingly pitiful film that heist), and in Bruges (again, pretty good), so you are down to two. You do not like to see Clooney or the beautiful office running in 1930s football uniforms, so are you going to see Prom Night? Wrong. Take $ 8.50, go to a stranger on the street and ask them to put you in front for $ 8.50. It would be better to spend money. She actually plays a comedy rather than a horror / thriller or whatever it should be. If I had funded that movie and showed me that, as a last cut, I would not know whether to laugh or cry. Probably both. An insult to someone's intelligence ... my roommate was laughing loudly most of the film, in terms of acting, could also throw robots (or dogs) into roles, they would have been more realistic . The detective must be the worst actor I've ever seen (Ben Affleck and Hayden Christansan) (I hate to act so much that I do not care how you say his name) <br /> So, in summary, "is not good"
