Displayed in Australia as "Hidrosphere", this incredibly bad movie is so bad that you become hypnotized and you have to follow it all the way, just to see if it could get worse ... and not! The story is so predictable that it seems to be written by a high school drama class, the sets are pathetic but marginally better than the thumbnails, and the act is made of wood. The muppet child seems to have been stolen from the Total Recall closet. I did not seem to be the only original idea in the whole movie. I discovered that this movie was so bad that I laughed most of the way. <br /> <br /> Malcolm McDowell should hang his head in shame. He obviously needed money!
