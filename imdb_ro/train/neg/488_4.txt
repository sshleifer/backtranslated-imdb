A terrible movie! It was probably against some real stinkers that were going to be nominated for the Golden Globe. They took the story of the first renowned feminine Renaissance woman and banished him beyond recognition. My complaint is not that they have taken liberties with the facts; if the story was good, it would be perfectly good. But it is simply bizarre - in all accounts, the true story of the artist would have done for a much better film, why did they come up with this boring script? I think there were not enough naked people in the factual version. Finally, it ended with a brief description of the artist's life - we could have saved a few hours if it favored the rest of the film with the same short duration.
