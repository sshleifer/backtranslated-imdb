When Stanwyck's husband is killed on the eve of the wedding, he retires to a mountain cottage where he sneaks from a rock and is rescued by wealthy lawyer Morgan. Morgan falls in love with her, leading her to a truly unilateral marriage, spent in a huge Chicago building (which seems to be surrounded by mountains!). Stanwyck is tempted to play Cortez, but eventually returns to Morgan in a very subtle and unconvincing resolution. This movie has an extraordinary distribution (Morgan, in particular, one of my favorites) and a great director, but the script is meandering and sometimes seems useless. I was so ready to enjoy this movie, but I was finally disappointed. It's still worth watching for distribution and it's good for anyone who likes movies in the 1930s.
