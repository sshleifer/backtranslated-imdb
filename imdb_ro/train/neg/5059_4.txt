If you want to see a movie about two absolutely unsatisfactory characters, that's one. The actress is gorgeous, both from John Cassavetes and the crazy paranoid, who, as they say, are really accustomed to, and Peter Falk is his best lifelong friend to return to rescue. A big mistake, but since both are amorous mobs and misogynists to load, it's hard to decide who to rotate less. Only the writer / director Elaine May could have coped with it. I found it interesting that in a long interview with producer Michael Hausman included on DVD, he revealed that the two stars had "very different ideas" about the script, with which the director was almost impossible to work, the impossible demands made by him that the crew was constantly upset that they should have been waiting and so on. This state of mind of a VERY DIFFUSIVE family is clearly seen on the screen.
