This is one of those movies that I can only sit on once. Charlotte Henry is fine - in fact, all the actors were good. The problem was in scenario, dialogue, direction, editing, sets and special effects. Granted, it was 1933, but it was really squeaky. Part of the problem is that actors such as Richard Arlen, Gary Cooper, W.C. Fields and Cary Grant are not recognized (there is a cry for recognition that has not occurred). The film was crowded, without any cohesion. Much of the spirit of Lewis Carrols, humor and continuity are lacking. What a shame! It's such a great book. I would recommend the Disney version of 1951.
