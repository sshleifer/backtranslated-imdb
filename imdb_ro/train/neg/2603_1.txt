I was interested in the subject, and only the fans of Drew Barrymore's dance on David Letterman's desk will find something interesting from the point of view. OK, she shows some breast (or perhaps a double body does). The land is cut into pieces and the action is horrible. Neither lead has any work material, because the direction of the film does not go anywhere. Do not waste time. See Donnie Darko if you want a creepy movie Drew Barrymore and if you want to see another, jump over and see Darko again. The treatment of the Doppelganger legend is absolutely criminal. See Charles Williams's novel "Descend to Hell" for something worthwhile in return. This is just an excuse to make a B movie go straight to the movie and suck a life out of Blockbuster people. What does any of these people think the actors here were worthy of praise? Save me.
