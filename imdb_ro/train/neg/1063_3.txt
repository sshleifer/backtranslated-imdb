The idea is nice. Bringing so many stars in a single movie is great. But too many stories, too short and meaningless. No connection between scenes. There were about 3-4 brilliant stories ... but they came out of 18 years. The frame reminded me of "All invisible children" - a movie I liked very much. Compared to this, however, "Paris Je T'Aime" does not have the intriguing story, which develops - begins and ends. And she misses the theme that links all those - kids. I do not find enough Paris a topic to connect 18 short sketches together. Perhaps for those who know Paris it is interesting. Otherwise, I would not recommend ...
