I took a copy of this film, considering that the 1964 film with "Zombie Bloodbath" is one of the alternative titles. Perversely, this movie actually has a better rating on this site than the above mentioned title; which may mean the other is very bad! This movie is very bad; obviously you can not sing in a movie called "Zombie Bloodbath" and expect to see a masterpiece and, in fairness, it obeys the title with the amount of gore on the screen ... but everything feels very old and tired, which is not helped by the atrocious and bad behavior line. It is just the average spill of nuclear energy that causes people to turn into zombies etc. The film starts with a sequence that sees people melt and gives you enough to know what you are; low quality zombie waste. There's a lot of gore in the movie, and it's a good job, otherwise the movie would have been really boring. Zombie Bloodbath looks really cheap, and was clearly put together by inexperienced filmmakers! The main influence seemed to be the supreme day of Romero's deaths, though there might really be something about zombies and gorons. Everything is reduced to an end, usually predictable and useless, and generally I can not say I was impressed with it!
