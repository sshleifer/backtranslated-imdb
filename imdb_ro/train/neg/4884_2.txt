Criminal Insane 2 is included in the Satan / Criminal Insane's new Black Nude DVD and it's a good thing, because when I saw a movie and I know there's a sequel (especially something that is as obscure as this one) curious. Now I was satisfied with my curiosity and I will never follow it again. Most of the CI2 is nothing but "flashbacks" to CI, and Ethel's pictures asleep, remember the pleasant memories, I think. Thanks to Proposition 13, she was released from the state of Napa (wonders if she saw Cramps when she was there?) And sent to a half-house led by a lovely old lady whom Ethel immediately calls her "grandmother" . All of these are shot with a video camera so the image and sound are quite pathetic and are even complete with a few "rolls". Of course, Ethel does her work, which is to send somebody between her and food, especially the guy who testifies to one of her chaos and exorcises her desert. You also have to ask about any halfway house for killers with a large drawer full of sharp knives in the kitchen and rat poison under the kitchen sink. I think it's a bad "trust". If you liked or disliked Criminal Insane, anyway, there are no good reasons to look at it except from curiosity. One wonders why the producers of this event even bothered. 2 out of 10.
