Joe Don Baker is a good actor in small roles here and there ... he was fine in Goldeneye and made a pretty good villan Bond in The Living Daylight and appeared in various other movies. One thing he can not do is lead a movie like lead, which is in this extremely vengeful film set in Malta. Joe Don's partner is murdered, so he kills the killer's brother and accompanies the murderer in Italy, but some boys make the plane go to Malta and the killer escape. The rest of the movie sees Joe Don killing the murderer, Joe Don being taken into custody several times, Joe Don torturing a bartender and being interrupted and so on. The movie is pretty bad and you will not find exactly how you pull on Joe Don's character. You will be amazed when Joe Don the hero is pulled out and how incompetent it turns out to be. The crowning part of the film comes when Joe Don follows the murderer on the entire coast of Malta with the killer in a priest's garment, and then gets to boats and follows them all around Malta. This movie also has one of the most serious closing lines to end a movie ever.
