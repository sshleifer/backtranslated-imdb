I saw this movie with my mountaineering instructor and I found everything so ridiculous that there was no mercy. (For one, if Stallone does not climb alone, there is no need to carry any tools, but I think those spinning carabines show the "mountain climby" sort, so let's throw them in.) For those lobotomized people who think Colorado looks something like Dolomites in Italy (where the film was shot), Hollywood moguls have more ridiculous and smelly things to swallow.
