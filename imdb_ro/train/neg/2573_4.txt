If you have enough time to lose ... it's okay. It moves at a good pace, but to remove this movie on it should be a bit more with a little more background on the sitter. <br /> <br /> Action is fine. Mariana Klaveno as a sitter has the best job and is the most credible. William R. Moses played a pretty good part as a husband. Gail O'Grady, as his wife, had a weak part, and the reasons for returning to work were not developed. The end is a kind of stupidity. Like most of these sitter movies ... are interesting parts ... but generally leaves you wondering why you spent the time.
