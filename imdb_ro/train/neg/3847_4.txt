It's a big deal with Helen and none of them is good. Shelley Winters and Debbie Reynolds play the mothers of a pair of Leopold & Loeb killers who move from mid-West to Hollywood to escape their past. Reynolds, a starstruck Jean Harlow Wannabe, opens a children's dance studio and Winters is her pianist. Soon Winters (like Helen) start to break. Everything happens very slowly, and although there are moments of real fury (ugly phone calls, a visit from Wino Timothy Carey), the film is devoid of any real horror. However, it is still a worthy fun. The division of action is good and the production values ​​are wonderful. A musical score by David Raskin, Lucien Ballard's cinematography, and Oscar-nominated costumes are powerful. With this, PLACE IN SUN and LOLITA for her credit, does someone crazy like Winters? Directed by Curtis Harrington, a master of this type of film exploitation, not even A-film. In addition to Carey, supporting casting includes Dennis Weaver, Agnes Moorehead, Yvette Vickers and Micheal MacLiammóir (Orson Welles of Ireland) as Hamilton Starr with hammer nicknames.
