The final game started well, at least it said about the end, the better. it seemed that things were just happening to keep up, for example the reporter who at the beginning is a very intelligent, intelligent person, half does something really stupid and total of character, we are given no reason except the following scene it would not make sense without it. The whole story could have been said in about 30 minutes, it would have made a medium-political TV drama The genius of Cuba Gooding Jr. is highly pursued, however, and James Woods is doing an admirable job. the game was honest one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... and that's what I'm saying, I've seen Gigli.
