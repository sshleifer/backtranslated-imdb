Being a graduate of film studies, I would like to think that I have seen a wide range of films, some good and some bad, but I should say that "summer rain" is by far the worst movie I've seen ever! I chose the movie hoping to be a great British classic such as "Secrets and Lizii" or "Lockstock", but it was not so bad that my colleagues and I came to laugh and get back to ridiculous act and cheesy script (reminded me of a bad school production "theater in education"). The main characters Michelle and Gary have begun to annoy us from the beginning. "Michelle," the main character living with your two friends has a face that you've never tired of blows and Gary was so wet (he kept tearing every 5 minutes) until the end of the movie, did not fuck any of them. All I could think was, "I paid Â£ 3 for this bunch." I did not write a review before, but after watching this movie it has spurred me to warn people about this disastrous production. So avoid at all costs. Thanks for reading.
