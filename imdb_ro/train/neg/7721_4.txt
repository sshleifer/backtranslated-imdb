The battle scenes play as Jackie Chan is slow and the attempts to understand are pathetic (the worst word: "Guess what?" This time I heard you're coming.) The stars are an inappropriate pair: Brandon Lee, despite terrible lines which he has to say, actually shows traces of charisma and charm on the screen - things Dolph Lundgren is completely lacking in (at least in this movie). Note to the director: in the future, please remove yourself from any scenes love, especially when your main actress will not do nudity and you have to rely on a double body. (* 1/2)
