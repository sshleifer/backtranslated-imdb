This is the first time I've ever seen a movie with Jamie Foxx and bet it will be my last. I have not been able to see why it was fun, though people in the audience thought it was very funny when he turned his face on the camera or because he said, "I'll take a shower." <br /> <br /> The plot is completely predictable. The bad guy comes after the good guy. The good guy has a woman, so the bad guy uses it. Meanwhile, officials mistaken. The final scenes are absolutely incredible. You spend 2 years and millions of dollars chasing a guy, but do not do your homework to solve a trivial puzzle? There is not much action, there is not much a plot or a story, and photography is done in the MTV style. Do not waste money on this. <br /> <br />
