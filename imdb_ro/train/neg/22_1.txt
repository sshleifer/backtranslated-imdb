I saw this DVD in my friends' house and I thought it was a Turkish action movie with some Hollywood names - not very big. Quite interested, I decide to give him a shot later. It was a hard-to-learn experience, believe me. Then, after I finally saw the role of credit, I understood, "We, the Turks, really suck at the Hollywood style movie. This is an insult to the genre of the hostage movie ..." but then wait! I checked a few names and no, they were not Turkish names and no, it was not a Turkish film; on the contrary, he was literally shot in America with a director and an American crew! That made me think again! - How can you convince names such as Micheal Madsen, Edward Furlong or even Arnold Vosloo to participate in such a project? with the money probably .. That kept me thinking more .. How can you raise that amount of money to give them a prestigious international distribution? Then all my meditation rewarded, and I came to find the answer. By hiring the cheapest equipment and crew you can find. And if you still have difficulty adjusting your budget then: by writing and directing the movie you are trying to produce - or vice versa, I have no information about it - So it's not a bad movie, as everyone is so eager to show that ... It makes you think - even in my meditation - and there are many movies that do not even give that impact. at least make you think; It makes you wonder .. It leaves you with unbelief ... and then makes you ask again.
