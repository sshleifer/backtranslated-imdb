Some have commented here that this is the MULTE Elvis movie ever made. Well, they're only partially correct. For me, this is the best movie you've ever made! I have never seen anything so brutal, insulting, and upsetting, and against human nature as this movie. A real embarrassment of the film industry, it's not that bad, good. There is no mania fun here as in some of Elvis's most evil films, such as Clambake. It is so rotten to stand in front of its pain. Pure trash. American natives should judge for their poor clich√© and stereotypical treatment here. In fact, maybe, ALL human beings should sue for murder and destroy this movie for the species as a whole 0 Stars, seriously. Grade: F
