Whenever I compose a list of the most serious movies I've ever seen, this movie is always on it. He does not have redeeming qualities. There was a need to sit on the whole thing, and I'd rather shed my blood than put it on. What's wrong? Let me tell you the story of my trip to go see her in the theater. I went to a midnight show on a Saturday night. The only ones in the theater were myself, and a bunch of teenagers, loud, strange, quite disinterested, sitting somewhere behind me. They were obviously feeling good on a Saturday night and came to this "comedy" for some laughs. Before the movie started, during the previews, they laughed and joked and made great voice comments that had an old old time. It was annoying; if he had continued his enthusiasm unprecedented in the real movie, I would have said something, but I felt tolerant and empathetic to their spirits, so I let her go. And they reassured once the movie started. Why did I tell you all this? Because you can judge this alleged "comedy" by the effect I had not only on me but on this crowd. During the entire movie, no one in the theater laughed. Not once. Not me, not the good kids. Absolute silence, apart from the soundtrack. And when the movie was over and the lights lit up, we all, both of us, slowly retreated from the theater in slow, gloomy and absolute silence. It could have been a funeral. This was the effect that this "comedy" produced. No laughter, not joy, but absolute DEPRESSION. It was a depressing film, depressing and no less funny. Preachy, self-indulgent, depressing, but not funny. I think Mel Brooks' "Blazing Sessions" are on the short list for the most fun movie in history. Still, it seems wonderful to me that the same gentleman might be responsible for the most likely funny film. In short: If you feel too happy, give this film a turn; otherwise, do not say I did not warn you.
