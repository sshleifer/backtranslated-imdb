Dan Duryea, an honest actor of the cinema, who made a lot of novels in the 1940s, can not do anything about it: the young man is accused of killing an unlucky married singer; when sentenced to death, his wife decides to settle the case with the wife of the dead woman. After a blinding opening blow, the quick blow is found in the B-movie formula. Surely it looks good, but the finish is without worry, and the cast (including Peter Lorre and Broderick Crawford) is just a bit stiff. Based on a novel by Cornell Woolrich, and accessible for a single viewing. <br /> <br /> ** de la ****
