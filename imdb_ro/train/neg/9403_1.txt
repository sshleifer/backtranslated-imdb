This film should not be classified as cinema. Although he has over 10 years ago, he should never have gotten funding and is a blow to the Australian film industry that now produces such brilliant films as "The Dish" Actors can not act, Music is .. to be blunt, not music, the story is completely non-existent and is a struggle to stay through. Do not watch this movie. It's a total loss of your time.
