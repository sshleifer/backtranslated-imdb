Cheap and boring of boring story and action. There is no good line, not even a bad line to be good and no memorable delivery. Even the bloody bobbin included on the DVD showed how inept the actors were and how little the fun had any of them. The esoteric and occult base was apathetic, and the antagonists failed to be creepy or credible. The "homoerotic" concepts were useless and unhappy, and they were limited to the young boys who stroked their chest while they were blackened in their boxers. I'm not gay enough to appreciate, but a little action could at least keep me and my waking girlfriend.
