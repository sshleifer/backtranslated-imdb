I took this as a turkey movie and I was not disappointed. By acting - generally, although many have been in other films, it is clear that they had to work hard to act so badly so constantly on the entire movie without accidentally leaving a certain degree of sliding. Plot - being generous I could say that the screenwriter originally started with a plot, but he did his best to ignore it. the plot broke off faster than a Chinese computer scribbled Scrip - now it was an abomination of nature. failed to flow with no rhyme or reason. most characters' lines were, at best, pathetic to imbecile. the script worked hard to make sure that no character was able to be considered memorable. I watched other movies where the extras were more exciting and memorable. Special Effects - ROTFLMAO !!!!! These were special short buses Targeting - until you can come up with your own targeting ability you copy your favorite directer style, otherwise you will only make failures like this. <br /> <br /> It is good to know that your friends / family give you 10 stars for this movie
