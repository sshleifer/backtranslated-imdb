It's not cinema. There is no talent. It is not informative. It's not scary. It's not fun. There is nothing. I took this because my cousin says, "Diablo! COOL!" Yeah sure. The only great thing about this experience was the fact that we did not buy it, but we rented it. He's shot like a bad ditch. Do not Wait. Soaps at least professional LOOK ... sorta. This? Looks like he was shot with somebody's video camera. It's terrible! Miserable! It's sux. Cinema is detestable! Who is this director anyway? I do not even care enough to look for him. He STINKS! The performances of these poor actors, who were not present, were much better than they deserve. <br /> <br /> 2.6 / 10 on the "B" scale. <br /> <br /> It records about 0.3 / 10 on the scale "A" from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
