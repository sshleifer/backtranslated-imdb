Looking through the other comments, I am amazed that there are no warnings for potential spectators about what to expect when renting this garbage. First of all, I rented this with the understanding that it was destroyed competent by Indiana Jones. What I received was one of the most offensive movies I remember trying to stay, became even more shocking by the relatively high production values ​​of the film. I do not think it's a spoiler, but if it is, be warned ... If your idea of ​​entertainment seeks Bimbo to be raped by the Fricosome Tribal Chief, while she was staring in the eyes of another's significant cut head , all the means, rent this movie. If not, I would advise you to look elsewhere for entertainment. Come to think about it, that scene so briefly summarizes the movie that I have nothing else to say about it.
