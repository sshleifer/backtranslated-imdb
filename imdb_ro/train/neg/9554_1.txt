This is the worst and I mean the worst movie I've ever seen. The whole plot is completely unconvincing and stupid. <br /> <br /> I mean ... The guy in this movie can actually talk to the computer as a real person. Now, you probably think you have to be a super cool cool computer, it is, but it also does it with other very poor and poor computers that do not even have a graphical interface. the main idea of ​​how to overload the "super" computer by connecting to it through the game on the net is really bad. My mobile phone will shut down lighting to keep the power, but apparently this genius computer can not decide whether to use its resources to deal with threats to national security or to upload games to the computer. but I do not have much time for that. Just can not believe someone could record the bad movie like this one
