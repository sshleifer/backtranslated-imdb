This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I was watching this movie with some friends and after 40 minutes I had plenty. The plot was bad and there was no single good character. We could get more fun watching statically. I gave this movie only 1, because the scale did not go into negative numbers. Avoid this movie at any cost.
