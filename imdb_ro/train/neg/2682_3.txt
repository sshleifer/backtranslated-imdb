I was looking forward to seeing this film for a long time after seeing "Turn to Paradise," which I discovered as a pebble. I was so disappointed. The most realistic thing about this was the unpredictable end that I think was partly stolen from "Return to Paradise." <br /> <br /> Maybe I was expecting too much. <br /> <br /> From the positive side, Danes, Beckinsale and Pullman were fantastic in their roles. Though I did not like the character of Danes first and I found it very annoying. <br /> <br /> I could not see anything realistic about the movie. It could have been done much better, for example, more emphasis could be placed on conditions of detention and horror. It was a movie too cheerful to be realistic. There could also be more actions and tensions The best thing about this movie is the end of "tragic". I could not predict that. But until then, I did not care what happened to them. 3/10
