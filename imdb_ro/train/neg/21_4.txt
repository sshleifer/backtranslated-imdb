What was with all the Turkish actors? No offense, but I thought it was nothing for all these actors. The film had no scenario to test any actors acting skills or abilities. She asked alongside anything bought this movie to see Michael Madsen. He is one of my favorite actors, but this film was another failure for him. The script was so bad. They had nothing to sink your teeth, and all the characters were two dimensions. Madsen tried to act like a tough guy, but the script and the direction did not even allow him to make enough of his character to make him more interesting or 3 sizes. Even the sound effects of the blow from the beginning of the movie sounded like the sound of the paint gun when they were fired in a fight. It was very weird and did not look like real weapons. A video game had better sound effects than this movie. There was also a very annoying boy at the beginning of the movie that was a member of the robbery gang. She had this voice full of American voice like a girl who called out lines like "Let's get F" and "What we'll do." She called like a girl. I've laughed for a few seconds.
