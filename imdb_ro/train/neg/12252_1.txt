** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie. Seriously. By acting in an absolutely horrible way, the FXs are awful, and the plot is terrible. But hey, so bad that his fun watching! The script is so bad that pleasant! You just have to overturn and laugh at lines like "I think that's what you call CROCTEASING." because women throw their breasts at the crocodile. I mean, Come around here that it's funny so bad! He has such horrible jokes that they are funny! But after a while, it becomes very much because the movie turns into nonsense. I really started falling asleep. Trust me, however, the plastic punching foot on the leaves and the constant fluctuations of a tail queue keep you laughing for a long time. Although I have to say he had a great part when the Croc broke this guy in half and just hung there for a while imagining what to do. Heh heh film without mind, who must be nominated for the MST3K line!
