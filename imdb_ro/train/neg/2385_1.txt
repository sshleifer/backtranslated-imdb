I watched this movie because I'm a big fan of Phoenix River and Joaquin Phoenix. I thought I was going to try their sister, Rain Phoenix. I'm sorry we checked it out. She was embarrassing and the movie just has this strange plot, if that's what you mean. Sissy was just weird, and Jellybean was just sitting on a toilet sleeping with the old man in the mountains, what's going on? I have never been so dissatisfied in my life. There was only total garbage. I can not believe that the actors have agreed to make such a loss of film, money, time and space. Sissy being "beautiful" did not come to me. I thought it was all, but that. Those fingers were stupid, and why do we care if he can walk? WHAT'S THE POINT??? 0 out of 10, shame that the survey does not have a 0, it does not even deserve 1. Hopefully Rain is better in other movies, we forgive her for this show, I would not do much better with this movie.
