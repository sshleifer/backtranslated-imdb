Is there a book titled "How to make a movie with every man" against the "Clich√© Imaginable" nature? If not, the ants would make excellent material for the killer insect chapter. Anthuriums do not have a single piece of originality to be found at any time in its 100-minute run. I suppose the most surprising thing about Ants is that they stretched the movie 100 minutes. The setting, the characters, the various sub-plots, the death scenes and the way the ants are presented have been made before any number of times? and in most cases, much better. It's amazing that so many of these Insects on a Rampage movie were made in the 1970s, because they are basically the same movie. And can anyone please tell me what God does in the name of Myrna Loy this monkey-turd of a movie? A so talented and classy woman like Loy deserves better than Antory as one of her final films.
