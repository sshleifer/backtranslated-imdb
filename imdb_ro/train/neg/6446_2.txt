Western society was fed with ideas about India being a poor country. Movies like these just make these beliefs stronger. Such illustrations make it harder for Indians to accept abroad. I agree that in India they are poor and homeless, but why there is no representation of educated people if not those who have succeeded. I totally forgot the idea of ​​the film that represented Patrick Swayze as another Teressa mother. In my opinion, this film has shown India in a very bad light, giving the wrong notions. It is unfair to discuss only one aspect of society. That's exactly why people ask me, "When we go to India, we can hire an elephant just outside the airport, so we do not have to go on so dirt-and-snaky roads?" <br /> <br /> Those who want a second opinion about Indian contemporary society should follow Monsoon Wedding.
