For my first taste of Shakespeare on the stage, I can not believe what these people did in a perfect piece. <br /> <br /> - Let's start with a little good, is not it? - Alan Rickman is fine, although part of his dialogue could have been delivered with more sensation. The other actors needed to shoot him together. <br /> <br /> Romeo, Romeo, why are not you still dead, Romeo? The actor, while not only wood and wood, could not read his lines with no taste. He was completely unshaken, had difficulty even looking at Juliet in front and absolutely NOT grateful with the lines he gave. Anyone throwing it deserves to be punished. Juliet is almost acceptable, but it does not deepen the character and seems to be completely unrelated to the play. Mercutio was incredibly creepy and complete of character for his entire dialogue. Benvolio was helpless and ruthless climbing his lines. <br /> <br /> I was forced to support this production by Romeo and Juliet. The act was stuck, and the costumes were not distracting. I have seen puppet shows in the kindergarten with more effort in them. I just wish I could give this movie a zero rating.
