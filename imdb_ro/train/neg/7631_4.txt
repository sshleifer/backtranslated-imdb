I am not going to comb the obvious peterbogdanoviciene flaws of the TLPS. Instead, I will look at the positive aspects of this exaggerated celluloid pyramid of a movie. <br /> <br /> 1. Peter Bogdanovich managed to make a film that can be fully endured. This puts the film up and down to the end of its blade film. <br /> <br /> 2. Bogdanovici showed how amazingly generous are lucky lovers, dividing the fabulous body and the breasts of Cybill Shepherd (then gal) with his male audience - and not just one but two occasions. Brava! The main incontestable moments of this cinematic fest del siesta. <br /> <br /> 3. TLPS has barely a stereotype pride in the background. (Peter tried to point out that the film is placed in South America Deep (as though it would not have been avoided), so it struck that point and so on ...) How is this advantage you could he ask? When the movie ends and the monotonous country music finally ceases to mask your tired ears, you begin to experience an extraordinary extravagance: "The movie is finally!" It is a pure joy. <br /> <br /> 4. The film gives all women who look like Cloris Leachman hope. I hope they can one day pull a younger friend and maybe even better. 5. Cloris Leachman's biography (which I realize is not technically part of the TLPS) gives hope to all women who look so that they can also win a Miss Chicago beauty contest someday. (Provided they have enough money to bribe the jury with.) (Do you think I'm kidding that Cloris won a beauty contest, huh? Well, check the bio and then we'll see who laughs the last ...) 6. The film was shot in black and white, which spared the face of Cloris Leachman's face in its original non-natural glory.
