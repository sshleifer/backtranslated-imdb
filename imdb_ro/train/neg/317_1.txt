This has to be the worst movie I've ever tried to watch. In the first 15 minutes, there was nothing to keep my interest in this movie. I was on vacation at that time and I had plenty of time to devote myself to a movie that was fun. The condo I used to have had this movie on stock - must have obtained it from the $ 1 store or something like that. If you like Adam Sandler, it's nothing like any other movie he's made. This started with a bad premise and then worsened. There's nothing really fun from far. I watched a lot of movies, including some that I did not care about. But if you decide to waste your time with this movie, do not say I did not warn you.
