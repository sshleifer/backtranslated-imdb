They really can not get more stupid than this movie that deals with 3 losers trying to surprise the college spirit during the annual spring break celebrations at many of the higher learning schools. The problem is that these losers try to do so after 15 years of college years when one is entrusted with supervising the daughter of a senator who is taken care of as the next vice president. The problem is that her daughter is nothing but popular, but of course it comes out of it all. Girls go through drunken rage, exotic dances and other absolute nonsense. In fact, it can not be much worse than this dreadful movie.
