The original "Cube" is a fantastic B movie, rich in paranoia, food characterization and excellent performance everywhere. It's creepy, cryptic and cool. And it's perfect, on its own, without a stupid sequel like "Cube Zero." <br /> <br /> This third (!) Cube series movie is part of the retreat (most traps are unfortunately recycled), a partial aberration. It takes a bold step to explain what the cube is - something that has never been revealed in the first film - but since the explanation was gentle, I would prefer to keep a secret. There are some potentially interesting references for the society that exists outside the cube, but it never grows beyond the clues about a kind of totalitarian political-religious state. So, what little social commentary feels flat and unfocused. What works? Virtually nothing. The actor is a purely amateur hour, the rhythm is slow (how much of this movie is made up of two nonsense watching a screen?), And the gore effects, while rebellious, fail to convince. In short, "Cube Zero" reminded me of a "Cube" fan, an unpleasant and sophomore clone of a good film that certainly did not need a sequel.
