After seeing a very censored version of this movie on TV years ago, I was curious to see the needless version. I was surprised that it was more credible and better acting than I remembered, but one thing really came out. I think other commentators have mentioned this, that is, what is the nature and motivation of the character, Chris Sarandon? Has he raped other victims? Is it completely psychotic or "average" sociopath? How did he expect to escape with the attack on the younger sister? Is this character not at all credible, or is it just a matter of more background required? Apparently, at the same time, he is an inconvenient and credible and too crazy character to be able to maintain a teaching post that puts him in contact with young, vulnerable girls. This seems to be the biggest cry of the audience in general. It has nothing to do with its performance, which is terribly convincing. The film occupies an unclear position between total exploitation and a serious approach to the subject, without being found in any way. Not the worst movie ever made, but not everything that's good.
