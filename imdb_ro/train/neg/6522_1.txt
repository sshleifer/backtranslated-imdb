This is not a comment on the real movie, but on the release of RUSCICO DVD for North America. I do not know if there were any different broadcasts and updates, but the discs I rented had copyright for 2000 if that meant anything. However, mixing the sound on these DVDs was absolutely horrible. Levels often taken up and down; when the scene was cut into a battlefield panorama, the orchestral piece would sound so loud that I did not know what it would be like to explode first - my ears or my speakers. When it was time for dialogue, the volume would usually fall to something barely audible. Occasionally, Foley's orchestra and work would remain loud while the dialogue was overlapped at a much lower level. My wife and I found that the only way to watch this movie from these DVDs was if one of us held a hand on the remote to continuously modulate the volume. And, as another user has already commented, when I selected English, the dialogue continued to pass between Russian and English; and occasionally, when the characters spoke in French on the native route, doubling was in Russian, so you are SOL if you do not understand one. Finally, I gave up watching the first disc. Before you borrow $ 50 + for this DVD movie for your own library, I would really recommend you get hands on a rental copy to see if you can really enjoy this epic movie when it's burdened by a so bad sound, never read the book and you really want to understand the story.
