Unfortunately, there is no rating for a rating, otherwise I would have chosen it. This film does not have the power of the star that the original film had in abundance. Carol Burnett, Albert Finney, Tim Curry, Bernadette Peters, Edward Hermann, the innocence of new commissioner Aileen Quinn and the director of expert John Huston (actress Angelica Huston's father) made this movie so charming. Even the 1999 remake with Kathy Bates, Victor Garber, Alan Cumming and Kristin Chenoweth had more to offer than this evil excuse for a sequel. Before making this film, Ashley Johnson was also known for his role as Chrissie Seaver in the Growing Pains spring-time show. He had some pieces in the movies, but I do not know who thought he had enough talent to wear a movie on his own. And adding Joan Collins as Lady Edwina Hogbottom, ridiculous! They could not get enough actors to play major roles like Daddy Warbucks, Miss Hannigan and Annie, but will they sign Joan Collins to play a British lady? I'm not surprised that this movie was just as bad as it was. Critics were right to disagree with this film, even if they were made just for television, it was a bad sequel to an otherwise appealing film.
