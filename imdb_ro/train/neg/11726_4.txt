Wesley Snipes is James Dial, a hired assassin, CIA agent, and special agent. During his free Dial dons a cowboy hat and horse breeds with macho names such as beauty. Agent Collins entered, his surveillance officer. Enter a new mission - kill a terrorist in custody of England. Of course the United Kingdom is an allied state, it is a great place for undercover operations and head outside the courtrooms. The assassination is a great success apart from the fact that the evacuation plan blew. So Dial's partner and local liaison are killed in action, trying to escape the police, while Dial becomes hot property, and the trees in London are trying to reach him and the CIA trying to eliminate it. Fortunately for Dial Safe-house is usually visited by an adolescent Emily Day (Eliza Bennett) who loves to stay with cold-blooded murderers with arrest warrants and help them escape the law of the United Kingdom. .. a scenario like that I have to say more? On the plus side Wesley Snipes is Wesley Snipes (whether he is a pro or a con) and the film is quite engaging. The minus editing is very disjointing and has a hurl effect on the stomach.
