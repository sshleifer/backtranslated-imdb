This is only the second time I stopped a video / DVD part through. I was willing to give this film the benefit of doubts at first, even though it managed to be both superficial, clich√© and stupid. And without joy, plodding and pretense. It was like a special after school led by that strange new monk who thinks no one understands it ... creepy and sad, with a narrative voice that only the most misguided adolescent would consider poetry ... and singing and .. not, indeed, the suffering of the poor child ... Enough already, especially when he turned into a furrow, cowardly and insulting. And did I mention the song? This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but certainly the one I felt the least compelled to stay. I do not recommend anyone.
