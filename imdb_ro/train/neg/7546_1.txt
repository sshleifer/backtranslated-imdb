I'm a big fan of Nicolas Cage and I never thought he would work on such a movie. I could not believe in the other reviews and I thought it would not be bad to follow her at least once ... but believe me, it is. I did not see the old movie. . But why would he want to remember such a movie. The very basic idea of ​​a horror movie is whether it should have an extremely clever script or it should be extremely graphic. This film does not fit into any of these and remains just stupid. I just looked at the movie hoping it would become interesting at some point, but it never happens. <br /> <br /> So this movie is great not for both Horror fans and Cage fans. He might have appeared on television.
