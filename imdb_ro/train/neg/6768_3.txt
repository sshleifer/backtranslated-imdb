Herbie, Volkswagen who thinks like a man, is back now, being led by Maggie Peyton (Lindsay Lohan), a young woman who hopes to become a NASCAR champion. The only thing that is in his way is the current champion, Trip Murphy (Matt Dillon), who will do anything to stop them. The original love bug was not that good. Even as a child, I remember I do not like it too much. I had some hope for the continuation. I mean the distribution is pretty good and the trailer makes it a funny movie. Unfortunately, Herbie is no better than it was before. The film is poorly weak for people over 12 years old. He's probably going to have fun with the kids, but that's all. I realize it's a movie for kids and it could have made the movie more interesting. There were very few laughs and they were almost bored at the end. Most actors also seemed dead in their roles. Lindsay Lohan was okay like Maggie Peyton. It usually offers better performances, such as Freaky Friday and Mean Girls. Matt Dillon gave the best performances all over the world. He was very good as the bad guy, even if he did not have much to do. Justin Long, Breckin Meyer and Michael Keaton are right there and do nothing special. Angela Robinson leads and does a good job. She tries to keep the movie's interest, but she works with a poor script. Thomas Lennon and Ben Garant wrote the script and would it be any surprise to you that they were also responsible for Taxi and The Pacifier? These two make light movies, but they can not make the story interesting or enjoyable. It is not their fault, but we hope that next time we will try more. Eventually, Herbie is a safe and predictable family movie that deserves to watch if you are a child. Everyone is better to jump. Rating 4/10
