This is one of the most serious movies I've seen in years! You could randomly take 5 people off the streets and could act better than anyone in this movie. The absolute loss of time that follows it. I gave him only 2, as I like naked movies, but this is just plain litter. The actor (and I use this term very badly) is abisal, someone please tell me that the five main actors in this movie made their first film? Do not waste your time watching this. The hostel was a better movie in a way. I can not believe that someone has spent money to do this, I hope the producers would have cost only $ 50,000 - it looks like a school project done by children who have no clue. Did that even get to the cinema?
