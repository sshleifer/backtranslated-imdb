It's simply not useful to try to glorify any part of this movie. It was a straight garbage. From the very beginning, you might think that you are in a stunning visual cinematic ... and then shortly afterwards you are hit with a big bag of FAIL! The fight is barely martial, the action is heading to the edge of the hair, and music is not worth describing. There is just enough story to make an excuse for this movie to have been made. The decisions made by the characters and how they are confronted with the situations are weak and they have only bothered me. I think the only reason this movie came out was to act as a fan service by using Yumiko Shaku.
