Say the truth I'm a bit amazing to see all these positive reviews by so many people, which is also the main reason why I actually decide to see this movie. And after seeing her, I was really disappointed, and that's what the guy loves this kind of movie. I'm a surprise to this full movie - it's like a kidny movie with nudity for absolutely no reason and all involves babies curse and swearing. I'm not at all right, but this has gone too far in my account. Synopsis: The story of two guys was sent to the older brother's program for their foolish behavior. There they met with a baby with obsessive boobs, and the other is a medieval weird. Just the name itself is not really connected with the story at all. They are not a role model and they do nothing but serve their time for what they have done. The story is very predictable (though expected) and humor is blades. And I have not already seen the same characters (Mc Lovin's game) in many other movies (like the Sasquatch Gang?). I think I'm laughing three times and I almost fell asleep. Well, the casting was good, but it is he who produces the script. And the action is like that - as you would expect when you look at this type of movie. And the direction, what can be expected? This is the same type that brought us American summer Wet Hot American, and the movie is also sucks. But somehow he always managed to bring a star to attract his horror film. Anyway, I did not feel all the way, but a waste of time. Only naked scenes seem to be the best part of the movie. I can not really see where I should recommend this to anyone. Pros: Elizabeth Bank? Two topless scenes. Proverbs: Not funny, terrible story, nudity and kids do not mix together. Rating: 3.5 / 10 (Grade: F)
