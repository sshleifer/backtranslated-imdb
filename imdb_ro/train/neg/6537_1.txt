First, let me be warned that I saw this film on TV and in English - which can be totally spoiled by the atmosphere. However, I will evaluate what I have seen and hope to remove people from that version. I found this movie boring. All the atmosphere of the movie is lost by doubling the slow frustration of a stalker film. I'm sorry, but sin the worst movie in my book is to be slow, except the film about philosophy. I have not seen any profound philosophical meaning in this film. Maybe I missed something, but I have to tell her how I see it. I rated her "1". What can I say, US-oriented tastes, maybe.
