I hired this movie only because of the promises of William Dafoe and Robert Rodriguez. I assumed that, seeing the RR name on the cover (as an actor), this movie would be good. Sounds like a movie that Rodriguez would do so if he gave him the name, should he be okay? WRONG WRONG WRONG. By far the worst editing from "Manos' hands of fate". The way it was edited makes no sense and made the movie impossible to follow after the first 30 minutes, you will not even want to try to follow it. I have no idea how Dafoe and Rodriguez got involved in this movie, maybe they owe someone, but they did it. Besides, they were only in this movie for a few minutes, and Rodriguez did not even speak. So if you want to see a movie Poor, poor action and a confusing story than being my guest, but do not say you have not been warned.
