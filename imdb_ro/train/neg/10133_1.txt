Unless you are mentally ill or hottest angry segger you will get bored with this terrible excuse for a movie in less than 5 minutes. Plot - Even for a Seagal movie, the plot is just bad. I mean not just bad, barely coherent. The actor - Woody. She saw literally better acting in porn. Ironically, this movie is trying to earn money on this audience, a "lesbian love scene" that is extremely valuable. Special effects - would not be lacking in a 60-year sword and witchcraft. <br /> <br /> If you do not suffer from insomnia and you have exhausted all other treatments, do not make the same mistakes as buying this DVD because you will demand that hour and a half of your life.
