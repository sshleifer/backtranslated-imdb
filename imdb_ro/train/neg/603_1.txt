Absolutely ridiculous movie. I live in London and intrigues are so badly investigated, it's ridiculous. Nobody could be terrorized on London's underground. Soon it does not work every night, there are teams of maintenance workers who check the parts and make repairs, etc. There are homeless people living there as equally unlikely. Or that it is even possible to block yourself and not have access to a mobile phone on this day and age ... <br /> <br /> The worst thing that can happen if someone is there after the last train is that it could make them graffiti. Although this has come under control due to the massive number of network security cameras, another thorn in the story part. (Remember that in London as a whole we have more security cameras than any other city in the world.) Had it been sitting in a city I did not know I could have enjoyed by ignorance , but it's not a high quality movie, so I could not help but stop my unbelief and try to enjoy it for the trivial story I have. <br /> <br /> I would have given 0/10 if there is such a rating! Probably the most disappointing movie I've ever thought I'd like.
