This piece of shit, since I can not call it a movie, can be summed up by the following. - The black stereotypical black shoe partner is in trouble - Black Midget claims to be a baby with a fully grown adult face with body hair and genitals - The black cat is wrong (somehow) man and woman who happens to - and want a child - the black cat, before continuing to commit acts of physical and sexual violence, and committing more crimes - Capable of closing <br /> <br /> Honestly, it could have been a good satire if it would not have been so deeply drawn and would have had some poor talents in it.
