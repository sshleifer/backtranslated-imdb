I was quite interested in this movie as a cannibal film. I was completely disappointed. was the same kind of disappointment, I felt like I was watching "Friday, 13: jason manhattan." so much potential lost! the opening scene is a decent attention grabber. then stops. copious breasts and fashion 80 years can not help this movie. the only things that eat near this island of cannibal monks are piranha! I do not ask for the level of the "cannibal holocaust" of gore, but we were looking for a cheap gore over exploitation. I did not find anything out of this. We've found some parts of the somewhat interesting battle scenes, here's the two stars. I do not think it really deserves the time to look at it. I was able to show him at a party where no one cares about what happens and you just want something in the background. but I would not tell anybody, "Oh, dude, you see this movie." it is neither good enough nor bad enough to justify much attention.
