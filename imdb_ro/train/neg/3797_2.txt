The years have passed since Alex Rain (played by Olivier Gruner in the first film) gave birth to the terrible plot that involved replacing people with cars, yet a war between cyborg and man broke out and now we lost a supermoman like a daughter the character of Olivier Gruner (she inherits only half of her minimal ability to act), which I think the film is a minimal link to the first, but when the super woman is created she hides in 1980, while a hunter Future rewards hunt this confused sci-fi bell. Nemesis has become a cult hit, that I can see why people liked it, even if I was not a fan of this movie. Nemesis tried very ambitiously to come up with different ideas, develop a beautiful look and offer a lot of actions, almost worked. Nemesis 2 does not even have that ambition, it's a cheap extraction from The Terminator with a muscular woman who is so low in the ability to act that makes Olivier Gruner look like a theater master, and the sequences The action does not have an explosive area that was the main point of sale of the original. I admit I was not a fan of the original, but it deserves better tracking than that. The original also had a good cast, such as Tim Thomerson, Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa, Thom Mathews, Brian James, Thomas Jane and Jackie Earle Haley. It has no one and this time is just a boring movie with a pretentious atmosphere. In fact, after seeing this, it inspired the addition of a half star to the original. <br /> <br /> * from 4- (Bad)
