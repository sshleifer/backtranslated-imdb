The only good thing about this disadvantage is that I did not have to pay for it. I saw him in college. And if a college student can not find humor in something that is free, he is hopeless. Defeated and poor jokes can not be masked by an excellent yet amazing design (which goes out of its way to sell Beetles Volkswagon). I do not know what Michaels Myers is doing in this movie, but I have not seen anything more depressing. This was nothing but an obvious effort to capitalize on the previous success of Grinch (which has opponents, but I really liked it). It is hard not to stand by this failure and to ask yourself what better projects have been sent to finance it. Want a fun adaptation to Seuss? Go with Grinch.
