*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERI *** Are all adolescent movements suffering from a drought of originality? It looks terrible. First of all, this is a noble premise that could have been used well. A rejected young man, who grows up, crosses and kills all the girls who tortured the devil when he was young? I can not say you have nothing to work for. But this movie goes through the same moves as all the other recent seductions. Everything from scratch to camera angles allows us to anticipate exactly when a false alarm comes in and exactly when the killer will hit. We know the model so far. These stupid slasher films push the credibility envelope more and more by the minute. Let me ask you something: Who, in their right mind, will surprise a friend of theirs in an obscure morgue in the middle of the night, and will surprise her in the blue while she is alone and surrounded by bodies? Does he have any doubt? Valentine is just occasionally innovative. A good shot involves slaughtering Denise Richards' character. She is caught in a pool and the killer hits her with a chain. There are some good songs in the soundtrack, including a cool Orgy song. The music video is contained in the section with special features on the DVD. Even the drive is mediocre at best. Actors all sleep in their roles. Of course, David Boreanaz is often stoic, even in portraying himself as a title character on Angel. Denise Richards is a beautiful actress and she keeps a stone throughout the film. "Valentine" is the same as you would expect: pretentious, implausible, forgetful, cheesy and without a good defeat. It does not even bother me. <br /> <br /> My score: 4 (out of 10)
