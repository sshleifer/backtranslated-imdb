I love Billy Crystal and I thought it would be fun to watch this movie because I know he admired Alan King and it would be amusing together. I thought I saw all of Billy's movies, but I did not remember that and now I know why. It is so full of false cliches and emotions; you can smell every scene coming (and going!). Billy does not get too funny. She's too busy trying to cry out false tears or show her anger in how loud her father left. Alan King himself is quite pleasing, as is the subplot about being extra in movies. But what is the coincidence that Billy is going to visit his father just as a major health crisis occurs etc. Or that two busy doctors can close their practice for Monday in LA. And when the end comes, boy, it comes fast! Almost as if the writers realized they were painted in a corner and that the only way out was to make a scene of death. Mostly disappointing with some glamorous good humor.
