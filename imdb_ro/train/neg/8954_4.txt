I had great hopes for this movie because I liked the book very much. However, I do not think I would have understood the premise of the film if I had never read the book. The film is a noble attempt to show the despair of people who are trying to break the ties of governance, but the books portray much deeper suffering. Corrupt government officials have comfortable lives, close to luxury, while ordinary people struggle to get the bare need for survival. Perhaps most people feel so to their leaders and leaders, whether or not they are oppressed or repressed. Orwell's dystopia seems as though it could exist in many places in our modern world. It's been a few years since I read the book, but references to Big Brother, Thought Police and Newspeak are often heard in media and casual conversations. Probably many people using these terms can not figure out where the terms are. We strongly recommend reading the book.
