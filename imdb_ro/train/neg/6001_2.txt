This may sound crazy even to those who remember the show ... But I remembered this as live action. I do not think I saw the animated drawing. but the movie? may be. I remember very clearly. The guy was in a building like a showroom. He also had the red jacket. It was dark and turned into a red car, and there was the guy on the second level looking down at him. The car / guy came back and crashed through the large showroom window and went out into the street. Then he continued to come out. That's all I remember. I really hope someone else can remember that too. If not, maybe I'm still crazy. But I hope they are not.
