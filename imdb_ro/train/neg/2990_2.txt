Man! Now that's what I'm talking about! As for horrible or frightening horror movies, this movie really was in its own class. A real jewel! First of all, the movie was not originally in English. It's okay, because the doubling of the voice was really exceptional! Here's my favorite fragment of the dialogue (and there's a lot more where it came from) ?? "I feel a little better, I'm just thirsty for your blood!" And what a drama! Is this a piece of play through recapitulations of the interaction between the military and the scientists? Scene 1? Scientifically: "Can not you do that? It will be a disaster!" - Military Officer: "This is just science fiction" (he continues to cause a complete disaster just as the scientist predicted). Scene 2? Researcher: "If you do that, many people will die!" - Military Officer: "You do not know what you are talking about." (he does and many people die). Scene 3? Scientifically: "Do not do that? They will kill everyone!" - Military officer: "That's nonsense" (he keeps killing everyone) Scene 4, 5, 6, 7 ?? (do you have any idea). If that was not enough? there have been some scenes that have proven to be instant classic! In one scene, the army has literally 10 boys throwing weapons to two unarmed men. The leader shouts: "Go!" and all 10 army guys, one by one, throw the guns and fists of the two opponents! Instant classic! And do not worry. No attention to detail was left out! This movie even had a hip / upbeat 'keyboard 80 / soundtrack synth to set the mood! And trust me? I realize that this review might contain some spoilers, but there are so many goodies in this epic, in fact, I just scratched the surface. A movie of this caliber comes only once a decade! A true viewing experience! A masterpiece! Wow!
