How Good Is Gwyneth Paltrow! This is the right movie for her ... too bad to have a complete role. I did not read Jane Austen's book, but I can not believe it is so superficial, and the characters are not much more than caricatures. It was not easy to cut about 600 pages of the book in 2 hours, but I expected to see more than just seeing old pieces of furniture and tea cups. I get a relief every time I see an actor who has not crossed the sign of overtaking (a few times).
