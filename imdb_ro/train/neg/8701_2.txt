This is probably one of the worst "I want to be low-budget low budget" to give credit to the dinosaur genre. The film is so predictable that you could leave, cook your dinner, answer the phone or something, and when you get back you will know exactly what happened. The special effects are so feeble that you thought that Lego bricks were used, and the "super-fast" dinosaurs were so hungry that they make a pet dog look like a super predator. The action is over. They try so hard, yet there is not enough character behind them to enter the characters and the scientist ... Yes, we know exactly what will happen to the blonde chickens in the glasses. The stereotype was created for such films. If you want to watch this movie, I suggest that you are not in a serious mood, obviously like the distribution and the crew. And if you're really in the dinosaurs and you know everything in the world about them, do not watch it, you could break the screen - the deeds are so far.
