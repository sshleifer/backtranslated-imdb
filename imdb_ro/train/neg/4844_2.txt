I am certainly in the minority opinion on this matter. "The Hurt Locker" has won several "Best Picture" awards from critical groups than any other film this year. However, I not only did not like it, it was hard for me to stay. There is a minimal plot and a small character development. They disarm bombs, fight and disarm more bombs. This is the whole movie. <br /> <br /> But the worst part was that the camera never stops moving and shakes constantly. This was a way to become recent in the movie and is supposed to make it look more real because it has an inexpensive documentary look. The camera shook me so much that it made me hard to watch the screen. Normally, I do not care about war films and "The Hurt Locker" was not an exception. But you do not have to take my word because critics love her.
