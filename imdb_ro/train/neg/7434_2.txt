If it is based on the real relationship, as it is supposed, between Mrs Curtin and Mr Levinson, I am delighted that I do not know them personally. This is painfully slow, and both characters take the silly pills freely throughout the movie while the theme song becomes played in the ground. Many stupid scenes with stupid people do not make a comedy.
