The film had some nice looks. Maybe too much for my taste. It felt as if the writer / director was desperately trying to make us feel the inner conflict of all his characters. Not once, several times ... but all the time. <br /> <br /> This is the television thing, not the cinema. <br /> <br /> The station location was well-chosen and I liked Sascha Horler's performance as a pregnant girlfriend. <br /> <br /> I felt as though Justine Clarke's performance was a winner. Her reactions to things were forced, as though the director tried to vocalize the themes of the film through protagonist expressions. I also can not believe that a director can make wonderful Daniela Farinacci in an incredible presence. <br /> <br /> I do not understand the choice of pop music over all the sequences. This is a lazy device, especially if the pop music comes from no diagetic place to the movie and / or if the song lyrics feel embarrassing seriously. <br /> <br /> That being said, there is a british film quality that evokes Australian attitude and local attitude with originality. It creates an atmosphere of warmth and sunshine. Especially with the use of some wonderful animation sequences that save the film from its full mediocrity, infusing it with passion and artisanal charm. <br /> <br /> I'm curious why the dialogue feels so overwhelmed. "Who knows if there is a god? Like a guy standing there in the sky telling us what to do" or whatever the line is. Perhaps one of the most embarrassing moments was the boyfriend returning home from cricket with a bunch of flowers to tell his wife "quit smoking." <br /> <br /> An anti-smoking advertisement? A TAC ad with tasty animation? I had to leave the cinema at 50 minutes - it was too much.
