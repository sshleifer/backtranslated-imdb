I saw this movie and the other one. The Trinity is my name and I find it is worse than the first. I have no idea why they even made another movie, it was stupid and useless to say that I have everything. I've often stayed through them and still lead me to turn it off in five minutes in the movie. I like Terence Hill's movies and I like Bud Spencer, but this movie just drove me to the wall. If it were a different story line or at least a story and a bigger comedy, it could have been fun and worth the 5 dollars I spent buying all the movies. But you make mistakes, so I'd say to save your money and not to forget this movie or any of those who go with it to trust me.
