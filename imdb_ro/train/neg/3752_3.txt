I grew up looking and loving TNG. We just finished watching the entire ST Voyager series on DVD, which may have intensified my sense of disgust for this episode, as the difference in style and approach between the two shows could not be stricter. The idea could have been good if it had been used as an opportunity to extend Riker's character, as it would probably have been treated on VOY. They could have contained memories that would be "new" to the audience, rather than simply regrouping the old clips of performances. Entrances and exits between the "memories" and the "present" of this episode begin as a clich√© at first and very quickly become intolerable as the tired pattern continues and continues. Bar none - the worst episode ever.
