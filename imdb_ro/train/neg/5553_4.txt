This third Darkman was certainly better than the second, but far worse than the original one. What made this better than D2 was that Bad Guy had been changed and Durant was not brought back. In addition, there was, in fact, a certain clue to the character's development when the evil family and Darkman himself came. This made my heart soften and I gave this movie as much as 4/10, that is ** / *****.
