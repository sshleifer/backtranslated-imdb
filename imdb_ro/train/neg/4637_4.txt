Bangville police marked the debut of Keystone Kops, named after the studio he worked for. In this case, however, they do not dress in silly police suits or drive the car at a fast pace which is their mark. Anyway, Mabel Normand is a girl who asked her father a calf. Later, she sees strange men in the barn and calls the police quickly. One responds and the pursuit is continued. Next, Mabel hits his door as one enters. It seems that her mother, who jumps to the conclusion, is there! So while Mabel blocks his furniture door, Mom and Dad are trying to fight! This was probably the most fun part of the short, along with some explosions of the police car. That was a short 7 minutes, that passed so fast it ended before we started. The only real characterization we develop is Mabel's exuding charm with only her big face and eyes and she seems to be so optimistic here except, of course, when she's frightened. It's easy to see why it has become a star. It is largely because of her that I have recommended to see this at least once and why I give this a 4.
