The Dynasty Reviewed in Hawaii ... Complete with clich√©s, extremely predictable, unrealistic, and sometimes even stupid. If you have nothing better to do, however, it offers 40 minutes of simple, unrestrained entertainment, endless looks at male and female muscles, and a great photo of the spectacular landscape of Hawaii. On the other hand, If you look more than that, stay away ... Oh, and by the way, if you've ever worked in a hotel or you know something about running one, you have two options: 1. You will feel bad at Every two minutes to the stupidity and stupidity of how the show presents Hotel Business or 2. Look at it as a science fiction comedy as I did, come back, relax and laugh it!
