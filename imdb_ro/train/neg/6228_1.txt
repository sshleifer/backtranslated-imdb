This movie is incomprehensibly bad. Start with several random explosions and then cut into a T-Rex sock puppet that speaks (!) To the public. She goes back and forth between the stocking doll and the animation all along, probably because the filmmakers could not afford the actors alive. I will change your long, tiring, tireless plot that draws this bad film for a rough 85 minutes. One of my friends found this video very rarely at a hobby shop somewhere selling the b-movies and buying it for the sole purpose of having fun, but as it turns out, our intervention was not necessary. This movie makes fun of itself better than we could. I thought Ed Wood "Plan 9 of Cosmic Space" was the coolest movie in existence, but let it go to Japanamation / Lego cars / Socks to skip it. If you see this movie anywhere, buy it without hesitation. It's very rare and worth a lot, many laughs good.
