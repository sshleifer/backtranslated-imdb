A vaguely famous actress in a movie starring a mother in a child. It's shown on BBC 1 at midnight, I wonder if it's TVM <br /> <br /> You have to give it to TVM producers, do not be happy to make a mediocre movie they give us usually two mediocre films in which two themes are mixed together, and HOW TO HIDE is no different.

Then there is a final twist that left me to feel like an idiot to watch this
