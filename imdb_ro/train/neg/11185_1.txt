Yes, MTV really has a way to sell Daria. What began as a smart teenager attack - "commenting on everything that sucks and making the viewer feel better about their teenage life," the sitcom has now turned into a "way to deal with your problems ". I looked at Daria all the time and I loved it. Now sitting here after seeing the so-called "movie," I can only ask why the reason for all of this. Daria tells us how to lead life in college? Excuse me? did not give Daria in every episode that what you like to do is ok, as long as it's okay with you no matter what the rest of the sad sad world thinks? All this reminded me of the scene in "Bites Reality" on the documentary film channel for the first time.
