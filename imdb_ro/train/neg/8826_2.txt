This extremely low-budget movie is compared to the classic Night Silent Night Deadly because it is labeled as a Slasher hit. First, let me say that I think even "Silent Night Part 2" is better than that (that one was filled with retrospectives of the original for more than half of the film). "Bad Christmas" tries to become psychological, introducing the main character as someone who goes crazy (a powerful word) slowly (very slowly). He is irritated by people who do not get the true meaning of Christmas, and at work he can not resist how toys made with such a lack of quality and love are made. Dressed as Santa Claus, he finally goes on a killing spree. Also a powerful word, because only 3 people are killed without the real need of special effects. No tension, no emotion, no gore, no distribution. For one exception, Jeffrey DeMunn is in it. He is best known for playing Tom Hanks as one of the guards in the classic "The Green Mile". He must strike these days because he has ever accepted this role. He is truly the only one who can really act, his supportive role is better than the main advantage. (which is also not so bad, but if you are shadowed by a small character of support, you are not too big.) And what about the strange ending? (you have to see it, believe it). "Bad Christmas" is absolutely boring, nothing is happening, and the artwork is just misleading. This is not a slasher. Want to see a true Christmas wizard, see what's greatest: "Silent Night, Deadly Night".
