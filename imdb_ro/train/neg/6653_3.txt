I just saw this movie and I have to say it was a great waste of time. The girl who played Eva (Ellen Fjaestad) can not act at all. She read her very inappropriate lines and had a very natural facial expression throughout the film. Rosanna Munter, who played Petra on the other hand, is a natural thing. She played her role with perfection. <br /> <br /> SPOILER! The story was simple - I've seen it several times, several times. It breaks down, finds another, is jealous, separates from the other girl, and finally ends up together. There were no surprises, they knew that Eve would split up and that Adam would "bind" with Petra. The only thing no one saw was that Petra told Adam to go after Eva at the party. She became serious, which is a part of Petra that the audience had not seen before in the movie and told her to win the heart of Eve, who was really nice. Besides Rosanna Munter, there is not only one actor who gives a memorable performance. This is a mediocre film with mediocre actors, so I do not recommend it!
