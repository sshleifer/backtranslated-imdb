MULTE MOVIE EVER !!!! I can not believe I lost 90 minutes of my life watching these nonsense. The only reason I did not stop him was that I wanted to see the gangster pattern on the cover and did not even talk about false advertising. People who gave this movie a dozen are either horrible, stupid or CAST members or CAST MEMBERS 'friends. I gave a solid 2, because nobody else did it. <br /> <br /> I have to write more and I do not even want to. losing my time talking about this garbage. Do not look at her and if you voted then this movie can go where it belongs. 100 movies downstairs. I can not even tell you how bad it really is. think about the worst movie you ever seen when you were ten and this movie. He was sucked! If you think you are bitter, watch that I dare you! This movie should be used to torture war criminals or terrorists. If they see this thing twice and they will be shedding the bean and begging for MERCY!
