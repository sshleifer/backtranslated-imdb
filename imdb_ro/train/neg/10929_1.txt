This movie was the oldest Mormon movie ever made. It made RM & Sons of Provo look like good movies! It should have been funny to what I was told. The best part was the best film actor - Travis Eberhard - if it was not in the movie, it probably would not have been done! He led! <br /> <br /> 10. It was not funny 9. He was beaten 8. He had Thurl Big T Bailey, the character that did not make sense 7. He was made in Provo 6. He did not have fun with Brokeback 5. At had Larry H. Miller in it 4. It was the first movie Clint Howard was not funny in 3. Gary Coleman chose the perfect movie 4 a come back 2. It should have been distributed to the Surreal Life 1 auditions. Halestorm Entertainment !!
