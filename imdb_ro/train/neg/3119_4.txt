Robin Williams gave a wonderful performance in The Night Listener, like other cast members. However, the movie seems to hurry and leaves too many free heads to be considered "you must see". I think the problem is because there is not a strong enough relationship between the caller and Gabriel Noon (I had to write it this way because IMDb wants to correct the correct spelling on the "No one" character). The movie runs a little over 1:30 pm, and in the first 15 minutes, or so it seems, Noon starts looking for Pete Logande, the boy's caller. This happens after he speaks to the mysterious caller about 3 or 4 times. The conversations are not too in-depth, most of the time it's how you are ... I'm in the hospital ... why you moved your friend ... etc. In the book, the child becomes almost psychiatrist and vice president of Noon Versa, and the reader understands why he goes looking for this boy once he finds out that the child is missing and thinks it could be a hoax. In the film, Noon becomes obsessed with finding Logande, but the audience is left wondering why? Because there really is not a strong link between noon and caller, why bother you? Who cares if the caller does not exist? <br /> <br /> I know there is a difference between a book and a movie, but those calls and that relationship have been critical to setting the screen because it provides the foundation for the rest of the movie. Since not, the movie is breaking up. This is surprising due to another work by Maupin, Tales of the City. When it was made in a mini-series, it worked nicely.
