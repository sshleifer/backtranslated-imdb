When MAGIC LASSIE was opened at Radio City Music Hall, I was pretty crazy to think it would be a warming up of my heart as some of the first Lassie films. Not. The story was hollow, the songs of the Sherman brothers were far below the usual level, the characters were uninspired, and JAMES STEWART and MICKEY ROONEY both saw a lot better days. <br /> <Also, I was interested in seeing ALICE FAYE's contribution because she has been absent on the screen for so many years and has always been appealing to her previous roles at Fox. Alice was also left aside by the crazy scenario and useless photography. Another disappointment. Nothing originates here, nothing interesting even for an adult to enjoy - and obviously no magic gift for anyone. You can skip this without losing anything.
