What happened in God's name here? How to do about creating what is a cheap knockoff of Redneck Zombies? Zombie '90 should have somebody entertain ... someone or even make a profit of dollars? But above all, what happened here? <br /> <br /> Zombie '90 Extreme Pestilence was directed by a madman by Andreas Schnaas, who specializes in gore films such as Goblet of Gore and Anthropophagus 2000, some of which contain profanity in titles. In the Gore department, it is not much different from the rest. Though the level of ineptitude ... well, shaking the ground. <br /> <br /> Zombie '90 Pestilence Extreme is just as bad as Peter Jackson's Dead-Alive is upset, think. <br /> <br /> Getting specific details with the story would be a waste of time. An accident, involving chemicals, causes the dead to come back and eat the living. The concept has never been treated in this way. The gore effects are a whole, new low. Just a Z-Day Nightmare. I can not say whether or not this was originally intended to be funny, in a way, I doubt that English doubling was very true to the original scenario, but tighter things were It happened. Everything reminds me of a video introduction on a Troma movie, except that it takes a lot longer. I just saw a movie worse than this, The Chooper. To prove that Andreas Schnaas is a director, I would strongly recommend Nikos The Impaler If you think you have no standard in what you are looking for in a bad movie, give Extreme Pestilence, but you have been warned. It takes steel nerve to make it all the way through. But if the gore is all here, then you could stomp him. Besides, no atmosphere, no, and I mean no budget, no entertainment value, but especially no pride. Show some pride, Schnaas. 1/10 <br /> <br /> Updated 7/5/09: After a few views of Zombie '90, I've had a heart change or I think I've just done it now. Zombie '90 is hilarious, so never harsh words, though, Pestilence Extreme still deserves just a star.
