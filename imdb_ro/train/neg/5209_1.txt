Okay, so I was bored and watched it all the way. This film is gentle, harmless and unmistakable. The story is so bold that it breaks your teeth on the opening headlines. A queue of two children "traumatized" by learning about "God" the kind of fairy tale that has sincerely left me more traumatized. Use the Irish blarney in such a stereotypical fashion that he does not hope any real Irish to ever see it. For children who honestly would stop after the first attempt at an "OIRISH" accent. All of the reasons they pump.
