The film is poorly cast except for a few old Hollywood names. Other performances with unknown names (ie, Jennifer Gabrielle) are not helpful. I have seen other movies by this director, unfortunately this is one of the worst. Perhaps this is a reflection of the scenario? <br /> <br /> In a positive note, Kim Bassinger and Pat Morita's performance saved the film from oblivion. I liked Pat more in Karate Kid. There are many good movies to see, and in short, it is not one of them. Save money and celluloid. <br /> <br /> Jason Vanness
