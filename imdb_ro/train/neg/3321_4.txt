I usually know after the first minute of a movie if I hate or adore it ... but now I'm wrong. The start was great; "this is based on a true story," and bla bla bla was fun. Afterwards, the cartoons and the boys' picture of the pictures made me think I made the right choice. Then, seeing Torontou's false harassment was cold. Also, the situation and appearance of the house seemed to confirm my first idea. That was perhaps the first 10 minutes of the movie ... which then looked like an eternity. <br /> <br /> Maybe I just do not understand Canadian humorism in English (this is possible, and English Canadians do not always understand the humor of Quebecois) but hey ... there were enough things for a short film, nothing more . Maybe it could be a meaning for the title? However, almost everything was filling up and, in my opinion, things were very close to being fun. In fact, "making" was better than the movie. At least you understand the motivation behind what has done everything bad. The potential of the idea was great; that's why we rented the movie, being interested in the "extinction of annoying people". But I did not know that the whole universe would disappear, and even a point in the movie. If you are English Canadian, it seems that you could appreciate local humor, given the surprising number of people who gave this movie a 8. Otherwise, think twice only before you lose your precious time. ..
