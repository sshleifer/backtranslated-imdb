This was one of the most serious movies I've ever seen. Branaugh seemed to have so many problems in reminding himself that he could not give his lines. The complaint was not worthy of John Grisham's name. No wonder it has never been published as a book or released in theaters. I have not even seen everything. I decided I did not care who did it, then I realized there was no "whome" to care for!
