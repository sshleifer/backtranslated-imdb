THE. THE WORST. MOVIE. EVER. MADE. After watching this gay movie, I guess someone rounded a semi-blind neo-Nazi and made him make the worst gay movie ever, all in an attempt to attack the gay culture. I had to stop the movie and call a friend to come just so I had someone to beat me when I stopped the film from shock, unbelief and indignation at such stupidity. <br /> <br /> Above all horrible lettering and illogical and stupid behavior, it's just a poor film. A dog with a handycam attached to his tail could have cleared himself better. Seriously, after reading some positive reviews this movie has here, I suspect that the writer must have half a dozen IMDb accounts. Anyone who says that this film can be watched as anything but a joke is a liar or is very much paid to say that.
