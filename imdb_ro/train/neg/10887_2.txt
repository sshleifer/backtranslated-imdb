...... this movie is quite terrible, the only thing that stopped me from giving a rating of 1 was the fact that, unfortunately, I have seen worse. jungle music, juttering demons, and fluorescent blood / teeth / eyes give a "terrible" look, and the script is terrible ... this movie is more of a test to see how long you can last before dropping it. It is also predictable, but not in a good way. Nothing makes this movie is in a good way. I saw it 10 minutes ago and I thought I'd give it a little joy. (oh and the act does not let the film down, it's also terrible)
