Bashki should be congratulated for trying to turn one of the great works of English fiction into a movie and then slapped stupidly for this attempt. The animation was bad, the characters seemed ridiculous, the music was totally overwhelming, and the film was a shining flash through the first book and half of Tolkien's masterpieces. I remember disappointment and contempt for the film when I first saw it. Now I realize that any attempt to turn a book into a movie is bound to fail in many ways, simply because of the environment, but this film, no matter what the source of the story, is simply pathetic. Bashki is capable of much more.
