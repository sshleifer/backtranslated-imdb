This movie was probably just as stupid as the Naked Army (which should have been). The case in question: 1. To counterfeit his drowning, Roberts secretly swims schools at YWCA. After her "death", YWCA calls her husband to work to give her condolences. HELLO how did they get their work? <br /> <br /> 2. Before leaving town, leave her wedding ring in the toilet. Days or even weeks later, her father finds her in John. Does that mean the toilet was not flooded? <br /> <br /> 3. There is no explanation as to how she pays for taking care of her mother in the retirement home (since she was doing her behind her husbands RICH). Toward the end of this tiring film, Roberts suspects that her husband is in the house. Instead of going to life, he goes to the kitchen to see if the boxes are stacked easily.
