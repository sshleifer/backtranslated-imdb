This movie was terrible. The plan was sucked, the actress was bad, editing was inept, and this movie makes me want to throw my eyes. I'd like to have the time spent watching this movie. The balloon scene was bad, the Mormon jokes are really old, the soundtrack has been sucked, I have not seen the chemistry between the two causes, it is full of stereotypes, stupid local "celeb" cameo's .. the most remarkable was Del "how I quickly want to ... "the computer idiot. What is worst is that these actors had to play themselves on the spiritual side and even have cheated on it. This film helps create a long line of insufficient efforts to incorporate LDS beliefs into Hollywood. I.E. RM, church church, etc. and so on I would love to watch this movie and rather go first into a brick wall. You'll be more entertained than watching this poor apology for a show.
