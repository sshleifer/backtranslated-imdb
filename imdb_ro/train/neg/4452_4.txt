Let's say I have to suspend my Spiderman of unbelief less than I did for the hooligans. That is, let's say, I have fewer problems to think that Toby McGuire can stick to buildings than me Elija Wood throwing hard in Manchester. I'm not going to be specific, because I do not want to write a spoiler, but the idea that the British grown professional men who come to death every weekend is, uh ... funny. And this movie is not. Fighting, the idea of ​​fighting, is taken with great care. The gravity of pugilism, the respect of which the subject is treated, becomes irritating, because it neither establishes nor solves the conflict. It seems that the intrigue, with holes big enough to drive a Guinness truck, was sank along with a controversial theme of "fish in the water," so viewers could look at Woods's tears while he was learning how to become a man. hitting other youngsters with soccer tastes opposite strange objects and then running as fast as possible. The characters are caricatures, especially the Harvard Americans. Character development and story line are telegraphed to the viewer across the picture. Unfortunately, the absurdity of the film does not reach its height until it's almost over, which has since been spent nearly two hours of your life, never come back. Raise the "Football Factory" or "Wrestling Club" instead of this horn, and disappointing dock. Do not waste time with the empty melody, the old tired "Yankee in Aurthur's court", or crying, the parables of the old man's coming. It is pure, dark and intelligent; how violence should be.
