this is what you would get if you let a 10-year-old (American maniac) write a story about a month's journey. Garbage Absolutely Without Redemption Possibilities Maybe there was a fascination in the 3D department. but as a narrative and fun animation did nothing to make you lose an hour and a half worth of time. Save time and money and watch BOLT instead <br /> <br /> Damn. There are not enough lines, yet I feel it sums it up ... well, I agree with a review above - it's like a story of cold war propaganda. Perhaps it would have been more interesting if it had done with the flies that discovered the moon landing farce or if the flies had died in the first minute. BTW - why did all the main flies have deformed? - none of them had full membership!
