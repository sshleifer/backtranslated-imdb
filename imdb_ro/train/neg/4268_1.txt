I remembered the show when I was a kid. I could not remember much about it, just a few minor things about the characters. for some reasons I remembered it was very intense. also was really very early in the morning until the PA. Finally, after watching the web for a long time, I found an episode. the first episode no less. Criminey! This show was so horrible. was obviously done just to show the children who played the laser tag and had a wonderful time. the show opens with bhodi and tells his mother "my name not Christopher, I am bhodi li-PHOTON WARRIOR !!!!!" then we are forced to watch the children playing the labyrinth in the "free foot" song. and not just a little bit, but the whole song. ahhhhhhhhhh my brain just hurts to think about it. oh, yes, and as if I could not make myself worse, you can not even see the laser beams in their weapons. such as running around the whole "free foot" song. Later, after Bhodi climbs into space or sometime, they have a fight with the crush laser on Phil Collins' su-su-sudio. ah, believe me, you do not want to know the rest. what can I say ...... SHINELE LUMINII !!!!!!!!!!!
