"Why?" This simple question had to be on the lips of each New Yorker during the 12 months of terror that David Berkowitz created in 1976-77. The same single word will surely become the same questionable question of 22 summers, later when people leave the theaters and show "Summer of Sam". Director Spike Lee is trying to knit the story of a wrong pack of fighters seeking the famous psychopath - who paralyzed New York for more than a year - with a clear and graphic picture of the murders, of Berkowitz's demons and the frustration of a maneuver useless of NYPD. He presents an ensemble of despised losers, hearing a few "barking dogs," living a life of love, honor and humanity - no different than Berkowitz. Lee listens to the audience in almost every frame with "none of us we are what we seem to be." Many times, a critic of the white institution, Lee perpetuates the stereotype by including a scene in which Mira Sorvino, playing a newborn with a deceiving husband (John Leguizamo), hopes to have oral sex with a black man "behind a Cadillac big black. "An Italian mafia tells a black detective that the famous field catcher at Willie Mays's center was" lucky. "Lee even assures the release of the racism of a middle-aged black woman who says" I'm happy that a white man kills all these white men, because if he were a black man who would kill all these white men - he would be the greatest race outside NYC history. "Apart from a remarkable launch of a disco opening (which reminds of Martin Scorcese's" Goodfellas "or" The Third Man "photos), this film has no soul, purpose or passion. , without any human decency.While we do not find out about the true victims of this terrible scarecrow, Spike Lee seems to say that New York City has achieved what it deserves during this terrible, hot summer two decades. "How could anyone do such a disaster in his beloved city? "How can one show such hatred to his fellow man?" Are these questions suitable for Berkowitz or Lee?
