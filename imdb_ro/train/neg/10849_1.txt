Normally, when I go into a raid of Hollywood's local film, I'm heading for B-Horror movies. For me the main principals behind a B-Horror movie is the value of the camp, Heavy Gore, a lot of unnecessary nudity and special effects that anyone can put together with a packet of corn and latex syrup. I hired Cradle of Fear just because I was a fan of the band since the first demonstration was released in 1995. The film started on an interesting note, and then, when I saw Dani Filth stomp on an obvious latex mask LAUGH. When I saw the lesbian sex scene for a lesbian sex scene, I was even stronger. I spent quite the entire movie laughing and when I did not laugh, I shook my head thinking how a rock star of several million dollars would want to make a movie that seemed to have a more budget many hundreds of dollars. The whole point of this film for me seemed to attract "Hardcore Goth children who believe that death, destruction, sex, blood and Satan are the greatest things invented from Lava Lamps. That was really. For me this movie seemed that 80.5% of what happened in this movie happened just for the sake of being Satanic. This movie had a lot of potential and could really have been a good movie, but eventually this "movie" is really a Cradle of Filth extended.
