Disgusting and undoubtedly boring to the genuinely crime film, who played poorly in character actor, Jeremy Renner, mumble in the role of Jeffrey Dahmer, who was easily one of the most renowned degenerates / serial killers. Launched direct to the film back in early 2003, "Dahmer" is a feeling of boring, boring, angry, and virtually bloodless true murder drama that does not really fit into the late-night massacre and dementia psyche had the perfect potential to do! What, however, does the attempt to make for reasons unknown to me is to evoke a kind of sympathy for man, portraying it to be what is ultimately a lonely, nebbishy and severely ineffective loser who just looking "for love in all the wrong places, unlike the cold, calculating and depraving the sick and the crazy that it was!" On the whole, "Dahmer" in 2003 is one that the true directors of crime everywhere would he can jump and because I do not joke when I say he's one of the worst serial killer biopsies ever made! It's even more fun than other pathetic and explosive garbage like "Gacy," "Bundy," "Ed Gein," and "The Night Stalker" (Turkey-Zero Stars)
