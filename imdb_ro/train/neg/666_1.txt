I saw this trailer and I thought my god was this real movie, who would want to see this movie and at the same time I thought my friend came back to me and said "we have to go see this movie ". ..celum said that I saw that for about 5 minutes and I tried to put a courageous face and enjoy the cheap fears, but there was not even one of them. It has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen The director has no influence No perspective The same photos have been used again And again He did not build the suspense Cast cast probably was simply said cry crying fall fall. I would love to see the script that the first 40 minutes was the most annoying girly giggles and bad music, there was absolutely no character development. Plot is just ... well there was no plot was basically know we'll terrorize a high school group in the night of their ball with a serial killer who is brilliant! hmmm The actor was what you expected in an hopeless Australian teleservice, that main character, the Blondie Dam, which annoyed me. her longest line should have been a half-sentence, and every time she was on the camera, she was just taking another facial expression. Please listen to me if you taste in movies, you do not go see this, and if you like me and do not have a good choice then I wish you luck, smuggle into an iPod or magazine. I can not believe this movie was done!
