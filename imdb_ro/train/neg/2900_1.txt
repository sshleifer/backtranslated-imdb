I have a rule of 5 minutes (sometimes I will leave the street for 10). If a movie is not good for the first 5 or 10 minutes, it's probably never going to be better. We have not experienced any film that proved to be challenging this theory. Dan in real life is certainly an exception. I was looking at this turkey and I was thinking; wow, this is not funny, does not touch, not sad, and I do not like any of the characters at all. The story of a counselor / widow counselor raising three daughters who fall in love with his brother's girlfriend. Do I assume that the slogan would be "a counselor who could use advice"? I do not know. The Dance character did not impress me as someone qualified to give her advice. I think that's irony? I do not know. He goes to see their parents, brothers, sisters and children in a kind of annual family retreat that seems very sweet and potentially fed for good comedy, story lines ... none that ever appears. The central story is how she loves this woman, but she can not. Anyone who has a pulse will realize that he will eventually receive it, but you will have to suffer through a painful, unhappy, life-lived dialogue, the movie "killer of love" to reach the inevitable happy ending. is really one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
