The problem with family dramas is that, apart from TV movies on channels like Lifetime, most people do not want to watch them. And those who are viewed tend to be sensational about current or topical issues or issues in news (or recent news). Movies explaining or exploring the human condition are not popular. Especially with the young crowd that would be the basis of Mr Lohan's fans or the younger crowd who tends to make movies not only popular but also financially successful for studios. The specific issues with which I had this film are cartoons some of the characterizations. There was a little more to blame for what Lohan's character (car destruction, drug use, etc.) is doing on what her stepfather did. While it is not unlikely, it is a little more to expect the public to swallow. In addition, other aspects, such as giving young boy Morman, oral sex or the fact that she would really do a good assistant to the veterinarian, who happen to happen to have something for her mother etc. really help this movie along. She placed her more in the element of a comedy situation trying out one of the "special dramatic episodes", then she did it for a full-fledged, well-written film. When you look at the DVD and listen to the comment, especially for the different alternative terminations, you can really see all this is a sharp accent.
