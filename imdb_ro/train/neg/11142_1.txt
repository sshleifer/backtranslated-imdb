This is the worst piece of shit I've ever had to watch - it's actually so bad I'm gonna look at her :-) <br /> <br /> CGI is really bad that it's fun! It's not even close to the animations from CGI to Spawn, it's so bad, grace ... I'm amazed that a distribution company actually put money to release this on DVD, but I think they'll get more money out of it in this way, "because the cost of doing it could not be more than a few hundred dollars It's so terrible that a kindergarten could have done it See her and laugh!
