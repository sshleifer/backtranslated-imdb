I was an avid spectator until I personally spent long hours of coolness helping to build a White House home just to be sick to see the house a year later. All the beautiful stonework was removed, the superb sidewalk and the front fountain were removed, all the pine trees and the pecan trees were cut, the sprinkler system was pulled. Now it looks like a disaster zone. I do not even live there anymore ... I live in the city and come out only on weekends. It makes me sick to think about all the hours the great people in Oklahoma have donated to these people and to see the result. The story I saw on TV was not the whole truth ... I do not think every thing you see and hear.
