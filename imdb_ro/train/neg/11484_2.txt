Is it just me or is that very annoying child? Hideous sister, spends most of her time running around after the disobedient little so and so on. As far as he is concerned, I know he is a child, but his ability to act is like a dead tree. So far, I'm only half, and I'm fascinated by the story, but the people in her, let it down, I hope it will improve to the end, because I can not know what it is. Although some messages supposed by crypts in the scratches on the wall and on a notebook show that everything is back, that is, the dog is God, life is bad, etc. ... seems a little bit obvious at this time, but no one mentions its significance obvious yet anyway) If my opinion changes at the end of the movie, I will update this post, but if you read this, then well ...... See the statement above.
