I received the DVD from a friend who received it from someone else (and probably this is happening right now). Even the cover of the DVD looks cheap, like the whole movie. Firefights and fights with delayed sounds, some of the worst actors I've seen in my life, a very simple plot, made me laugh "until it hurt my stomach! I have to admit that it seemed quite professional, seen as a movie, was one of the 13 of the twelve gangsta films that no one expects. So if you're tired and want a cheap laugh, watch this If not, throw it out of the window.
