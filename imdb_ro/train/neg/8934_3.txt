I bought this DVD without any previous reference, but in the name of John Huston, Raquel Welch, Mae West and Farrah Fawcett. I found the Brazilian title very strange, but I decided to watch myself waiting to see a funny comedy, maybe "Switch". However, the non-sense story is terrible and hard to describe. Myron Breckinridge (Rex Reed) is undergoing surgery to change her sex in Copenhagen and returns to Hollywood, saying it will be Myra Breckinridge (Raquel Welch) and claim half of his uncle Buck Loner (John Huston). Over time, Myra and his alter ego, Myron, have corrupted a young couple in his uncle's academy with pungent sex. At some point, the dirty scenario is so confusing that I think the whole story was just a journey to Myron's mind caused by an accident. Unfortunately, the beauties of Raquel Welch and Farrah Fawcett are not enough to keep this move. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Homem & Mulher At√© Certo Ponto" ("Man & Woman Up to a Point")
