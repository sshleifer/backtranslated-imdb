I thought she should have named this film "White" instead of "Heights." Godawful ... the kind of movie that makes people hate the people of New York. People who are so accustomed and think their lives are so important ... give me a break. Such a black-and-white glide that Glenn Close was the most ethnical character in him, this movie has cried out that someone real has come and steal ... and so they introduce, they get a whiter character than the rest thought it was originally an albinist) that should be Welsh! I'm still trying to decipher this accent! Unfortunately, from an intellectual point of view ... this movie is a kind of movie that can fool so many people to believe it deserves, because it has some more ambitious traps. Better to fill theaters with MI5-10 than with this pretentious carp ... it must have been a better piece because you can not fall off the floor.
