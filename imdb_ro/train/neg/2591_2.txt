To begin with, I would like to say that I am a fan of the American Pie series. Even if "bare mercy" and this is the two most serious, it seems to be the collapse of the whole series. First of all, the best part of the movie was that it was American Pie movie, which is always appreciated. However, there are tons of bad things to say about this movie. First of all, the story has a very old "arch" structure. First, there is the introduction of the characters, then the hiring of the beta house and finally the Greek Olympics. Each of them has exactly 25 minutes of length. Besides the general stagnation of the plot, there is no evolution of character, which makes a double bully of a bad plot. Besides, I am deeply dissatisfied with the stereotypes in this movie. It means jockeys like extremely cool guys who think about sex only and who explicitly show geeks as inferior. It also shows that females are just sexual objects, and men just want to treat females as sexual objects. Besides, the act was also poor. Probably the exception of Steve Talley. So, finally, a horror movie, if it is seen from a critical point of view. If I see a teen, I think it's better, but this movie is rated in 18+ in most countries, so it should not be seen by minors.
