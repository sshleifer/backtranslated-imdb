Although there is Guillotine Flying within the title of this film, he does not have links to the original Flying guillotines (1975) and the sequel to Guillotines Flying II (1978). The two original are masterpieces of the kung-fu film and still appear as a classic. This is a far inferior copy of the original, and even as a regular kung-fu film, it is below the average. First of all, this movie does not have much acting. It's a meaningless battle scene after another and the guillotine flying does not even play a major role in them. The story is about some Shaolin monks who pursue evildoers who left with a sacred book, and an evil prince who is part of this book is part of the plot. The same evil prince intends to lure the monks and use the flying guillotines on them. There are four Flying Guillotine movies as part of the title. This is, in my opinion, of the slightest quality. The design of the guillotine flying in this film is different from the other three, which indicates that this film was produced by a different entity from the other three. The film has no chemistry but is unintentionally funny because of poor production. <br /> <br /> The best goes over this and watch the two original.
