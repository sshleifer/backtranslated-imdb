The first Cube movie was an art film. She set up a world in which all the major archetypes of mankind were represented and showed how they struggled to understand a hostile world they could not understand. There was a "om vs. cruel" plot at the alter native, where the individual who represented innocence and kindness eventually came to the triumph of confronting a new, undetectable world beyond man's human lies; a world in which there is no more fighting, but peace. I've rated Cube 10 out of 10 and it's a movie that has never been meant to be successful. The second film, Hypercube, was a massive disappointment. Some of the ideas were pretty cool, but in the context of the original film, both the story and the setting did not make sense and made no sense. However, because it was quite fun, we rated it 5 out of 10. The third film, Cube Zero, while ignoring the second, plays as a remix of cinema B without symbolism. There is no "tribute" or "tribute" here; there is just breaking off. The same type of plot, with some elements idiotly modified (as if you had letters instead of prime numbers between cubes - an idea that shows more clearly than anything else that it is a rupture without absolutely no originality and nothing to said "br"> <br /> That we see something from "behind the scenes" does not mean anything, because observers are just part of the Big Bad experiment, the architects we do not hear about. And in this movie, those who reach the exit (as Kazan did at the end of the first film) are just killed - if * bleep * is meaning in that? That's just stupid. I'm glad I did not pay to see this. The production values ​​that act in Cube Zero are not too bad, but the story and the ideas are so inspirational that this movie can only get me a rating of 3 out of 10.
