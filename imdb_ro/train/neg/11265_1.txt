There were little moments in my life when I was stunned and depressed. The meeting through Rancid Aluminum was one of these. The warning signs were there. No premiere (even the stars did not want to participate) and no reviews in magazines. The only reason I stayed in the movie was hoping to get out of my sleep. Nothing in the movie was explained. The narrative was idiotic. I was annoyed at a time when the film seemed to be shot, then to my growing despair, it was revealed that she was not really shot with joy. I sincerely hope that all those involved in the film are hanged for this atrocity. <br /> <br /> There have been some positive aspects, mainly unintentional moments of humor. For example, the scene in which the main character, for an unknown reason, feels the need to manually lighten himself in a toilet, while telling the person in the next cab to put his fingers in his ears. <br /> <br /> My words can not explain the anger I feel, so I will end this way. <br /> <br /> Rancid Aluminum: for sadis, wandering and regressing, who want to torture themselves.
