Arg. Dinosaurs on the move are coming back to make another bite out of our health in this third appealing film. This time, European terrorists (Irish I would say) hi-jack an army convoy would have to carry uranium. They enter a shipyard, open the truck and discover our old carnosaire friends. The pandemonium comes to visit when the rubber dynasty shoots terrorists, police officers and some navy. The whole movie seems (again) largely inspired by Alien (as was Carnosaur 2), with the pathetic sailors passing through the "claustrofob" shipyard? weapons ready. This third opus is probably the driest and most non-aggressive film of the batch, with only one shot of blood when a rubber dome breaks a navy head. Dinosaurs are rigid, mixed creatures as usual, and T-Rex sounds like an elephant angry when laughing (also seems to have no eyes). One of the strangest scenes of the movie is when coppers get to the stage: they enter the building where the hijacked truck is kept and hear a strange noise coming from another truck. At the opening, surprise! The rubber reptile gang broke out and devoured them. Why were the dinosaurs locked in the second truck after they escaped from the first? How were they blocked because the truck door could only be locked from the outside? What was the point of shooting this scene ???? Oh, bother, who cares? Both fingers for large rubber lugs.
