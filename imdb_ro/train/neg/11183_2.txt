"The people I know" is a man who has no roots and nobody cares, despite the gambling efforts of a talented cast. Pacino carries out his usual force as Eli Wurman, an advertiser over the years who has been taken out of a life of moral corruption. But, unlike Michael Corleone, it is impossible to have an emotional investment in this character, in his dilemma or in his fate. The film follows Eli's preparations for a benefit for a liberal political cause, (Ryan O'Neal, good in a subscribed part), the latest "dirty laundry" - in this case, a TV actress comrade involved in the heaven. Leoni Tea brings the star's routine strength to this supportive role, although again the script does not give him much to work on. As Eli's brother-in-law, Kim Basinger manages to evoke sympathy despite the unwavering plotting mechanisms. This movie is strictly for those who like to watch Pacino and enjoy the other directors. Unfortunately, between script and direction, "The People I Know" is strictly amateur. Therefore, its limited theatrical release and fast DVD travel. Consider yourself warned.
