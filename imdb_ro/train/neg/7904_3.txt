A little bit of small buds that throw foam and reproduce. Until now for the horror elements this movie has. All the rest of the MUNTIES behave like a really retarded comedy, which is so bad that you will not find amusement in about 15 minutes. I can imagine the little ones applaud these martyrs, but adults will only stay with those "smart" references that translate into stuff on the screen, such as Capt. Kirk of STAR TREK, the most famous ET scene, a blatant statement from filmmakers that goes "Look! We start the GREMLINS success here!" and a clipboard cut by Clint Eastwood, who told us ... what about his western movies? The last one was totally lost to me ... Yes, and the disposal of chemical waste in the caves seems to be a bad thing. I do not know where they got that idea. Not to say that MUNCHIES is the most unbearable movie you can present for that. It's just really, really stupid. And if you manage to smash a smile while you're following it, you'll probably feel like you did it after the movie's over. Bad Badness? Yes, but only if "stupid", "retarded" and "ridiculous" are the criteria you are looking for. 3/10 and, uh, uhm, 6/10.
