Gillian Anderson is an arrogant, driven, career woman who takes over Danny Dyer's working class for a night of fun. After a silly accident in the countryside, they are brutally attacked. After recovery and after a casual encounter with one of the attackers, their thoughts are heading for revenge ... I thought Straighthead was terrible. Violent, brutal, misogynist and unpleasant. If I did not like the phrase too much, I would call Straighthead an ugly video. Of course, it was a kind of film that would not have had a direct budget release on film during the dark days of the 1980s. I honestly do not know how "Straightheads" got a cinematic release. I'm not a puddle. I do not mind sex and violence in movies, but they have to be married to a film with a) a good plot or b) a good characterization or c) preferably both. "Straighthead" had none. No progression in plot or characters and too much unexplained and unspecified left. Fortunately, "Straighthead" did not go anywhere quickly. He only had 80 minutes. It was a shame, because here was the germ of an interesting movie, with a very interesting tower in the plot in the last third. How often do I say this, but it could have been good if it had been done properly. What a shame. I really like Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer, but they did not hide anything with this movie. In particular, it is highly underestimated (and is still particularly well suited). If you want to see a good British revenge movie, rent or buy Shane Meadows' Dead Man's Shoes. It's a small masterpiece. Last week I should have seen "In England". What sera sera ...
