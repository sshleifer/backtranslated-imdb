This is a bit for the first time for me, the first time I've ever been disappointed by a Tim Burton movie. POTA is not a bad movie (great sets, extraordinary costumes and extraordinary performances), but it could have been done by any Hollywood director. Pacing was very weird, the last third was just spent waiting for the movie, me and distribution to finish. Tim Roth was excellent, perhaps the only pleasure in the film. Turn Tim back.
