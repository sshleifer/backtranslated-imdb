I have seen a lot of movies and rarely would have ever given me a movie "1" but this movie was beyond terrible. The act was terrible, the intrigue was ridiculous, the effects were unrealistic and the characters were annoying. Usually, when I see scary movies, I think it's DUMB when the characters hear a noise in house / forest / school / etc and then shout "hello is there someone?" - but at least they are credible when they do it. This movie could not even get that. This is a movie that will make other B-horror films like Venom and The Fog look like a winning masterpiece of the academy. I always have an open mind while watching movies and can only say that this movie was a complete waste of time and I write this comment so that anyone else thinking about watching this movie will think again. It's a pestle!
