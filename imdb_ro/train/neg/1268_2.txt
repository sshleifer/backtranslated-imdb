What a condescending movie! Located in Los Angeles, the center of the Hollywood film POV, this movie tries to be a profound social commentary on contemporary American aggression. Stereotyped, astounding characters of very different socio-economic backgrounds in their daily, humiliating lives. The land is dislocated and desolate. Numerous unimaginable plot material keeps the film, such as a shot, an abandoned baby left in weeds, a band of thieves who intimidate a lawyer, a guy flying through the night sky across the city, a kid at the summer camp. And through all these events, the constant is the generous help of the sociological "understandings" transmitted through dialogue, while the characters compare notes about their experiences of life. A character tells another: "When you stand on the edge of that thing (Grand Canyon), do you realize what the joke we humans are ... those rocks laugh at me, I could say, I and my worries, really joyful for that Grand Canyon ". Another pontificate character of the significance of all: "There is a abyss in this country, an ever-growing abyss among the people who have things and the people who do not ... You do not ... it's like this big hole opened up in the earth, just like great as ... Grand Canyon and what is flowing ... is an eruption of anger and anger creates violence ... "Besides the horrible and unnatural dialogue, besides the superficial and astonishing characters, besides the stupid plot, the rhythm the story is agonizing slowly. The action is uninspired and superficial. The tone of the film is deceiving and self-satisfied, in the contempt of spectators. This was an approved Hollywood movie film project, which is thought to be omnipotent gurus, looking from above. They think their movie will be an amazing revelation for us, those who do not know the movie, eager to learn about the true meaning of American social change.
