Woody Allen, when he's the best, has one of the sharpest pens around. He can make an acute observation and wrap it around a blow line like no one else. However, when he is at the worst film, his films can hurt his claim. Unfortunately, "Melinda and Melinda" has this odor from opening to closing. Configuration is one of his more interesting ideas from time to time. Four friends sit in a restaurant discussing whether the essence of life is comedy or drama. To help solve the argument, a man relates the beginning of a story and asks the other two men (a comic book writer, the other dramatic dramatist) if the story is a comedy or a tragedy. The two men continue the story, and the film plays the stories I crawl. Now, when I first heard about this movie, my understanding was that they say the exact same story, the genre (comedy or drama) changes only by the way you look at it. It would have been interesting now. However, stories have only one main element and a few lateral elements. They are completely different stories, with major plot differences. Drama is so rigidly scripted and pretentious that it can only function as a self-parody. If this was the point, then it failed because these elements prevent the public from feeling any emotional investment in any of the characters. Comedy is the story that has moments of success, but they are still short and passing. Farrell should have stood up for Woody, but he could have played this creature more credibly without adding Woody's stomachs and bats. Woody's best to be Woody. When someone tries, they do not play a character but they shape a recognized actor. This kind of thing just pulls the audience out of the story. My favorite films, Woody Allen, make me leave the theater a little easier in spirit than I have entered. That made me want to get my money back.
