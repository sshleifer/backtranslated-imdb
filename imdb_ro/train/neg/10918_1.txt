Manmohan Desai has made some fun films, though illogical such as AAA, PARVARISH and NASEEB, but has made some craps like COOLIE and MARD and then GJS. This film is one of the worst movies made him Mard ko dard Nahin hood, but the film is so bad that you tighten the British were made cartoons and the film seems so strange scene in Hotel Britania is fucking stupid < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film has many stupidity as Amrita assaulting Amitabh and then the whole scene plus the climax the film gets even worse There are more stones like the statue of the life-giving horse, the masks of Amitabh haha ​​and more Manmohan Desai is bad Music is fine Amitabh is part of style, nothing different from COOLIE, LAAWARIS roles Amrita Singh is fine Satyen Kapuu is ok Prem Chopra is as usual Nirupa Roy is again her usual self Dara Singh is as well as usual
