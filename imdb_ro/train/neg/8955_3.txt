As for the movie, it's a science fiction movie OK. She has a lot of interesting things in it, and some quality scenes. That being said, it's not so good and some things are pretty loaded ... As far as calling for another cube movie, it's absolute and complete. This is the very definition of an original and inventive film ... The whole sense of it can somehow be translated into the center of the first, but the introduction of people / androids as part of the "team" behind the cube itself is somewhat stretching ... I gave this a 3 *** because of the backstabbing of the original. It should have been sterile in so many parts of the movie that there is no place or time to mention everyone ... Watch for those who have not seen Cube & Hypercube, but is not recommended for fans of the series ...
