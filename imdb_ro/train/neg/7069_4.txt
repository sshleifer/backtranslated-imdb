When the movie was released, it was the most successful and soon became the Blockbuster. But the honest film is a ridiculous watch with a plot that glorifies a loser. The film has a line of tags - "Preeti Madhura, Tyaga Amara," which means sweet love, but the sacrifice is immortal. In the film, the film's hero (Ganesh) sacrifices her love for the main lady (Pooja Gandhi), even though the two loved each other! Its justification is the meaning of the labeling line. This film has influenced so many hearts broken by young people that they found this attitude "Needless to Sacrifice" very thoughtful and therefore became the movie of worship when they could have moved with their lives. Ganesh's act in the movie is Amateur, Crass and Childishly stupid. In fact, he looks funny in a song (Onde Ondu Sari ...), when he should look cool and elegant. His look does not help even the role of leader. His hair style is wrong done for most of the movie. POOJA GANDHI CANT ACT. Her costumes are horrible in the film and very inconsistent. <br /> <br /> The good part about the film is the excellent cinema and the brilliant music of Mano Murthy, which are actually the real rescue talents of the film. Also, the lyrics of Jayant Kaikini are very well written. Director Yograj Bhat must be praised to paint the songs in a tasteful manner. <br /> <br /> Anyway, all-in-all, with the exception of songs, the movie is very common !!!!!!
