Lorenzo Lamas is a type of CIA agent who surprises an exotic beauty called Alexa, kidnaps her daughter and forces her to fight with her former employers. O.J. Simpson is also on board to provide a gentle credibility acting for the ensemble so talented. I have to admit I'm not a fan of Lorenzo Lamas or his films. Trick. However, compared to OJ Simpson and Lamas "comatose wife Kinmont, Lamas seems ah, Jean-Claude Van Damme. I just saw the CIA because of renewed interest around the OJ Simpson trial, you see if your parents had cable and additional channels you can not get rid of this movie.In 1994 you could go into an Amish community and some morons would have this game on their portable TV.The movie itself is a collection of blade action sequences and would be intrigue, although the value of OJ Simpson's shock jumps after the balls of fire and the exchange would be a lining does not offer unintended humor. Also where was Bobby Knight and Kobe Bryant to make this classic full class? <br /> <br /> * from 4- (Bad)
