FEH. This movie started in an interesting way, but it quickly ran from confusion to boring. The confused parts occurred especially at the beginning, where the cut scenes are so numerous that it's hard to say just what happens in the first twenty minutes or so. Boring comes later, with a charming love between the two living people (both pusses). The revenge of the dead girl is, in fact, the most animated person in the movie, who is sad. If the rest of the distribution was up to its size, the movie might have been better. May be. Because the story is really interesting for a while, because it seems that the 60-year-old priestess mother, a dead girl, is trying to raise her daughter from death, with the unfortunate side effect that all the other dead would he also returns to take a solid human form and most likely to start killing everyone. A sort of "dead dead night" type thing. But this does not happen. Even though this unmoved priest, with a small basket of heads, tells young people not interested that this will happen if the priestess finishes her ritual, she does so and the only dead person she shows herself is her daughter. No mass ascendancy of the dead, no army of cadavers, nothing. The priest only makes the girl's spirit return to the land of the dead, taking a friend with her because she crushed her spine as a fragile peanut (when I was tempted to speak out loud, the idiot went to kiss and love the girl DEAD ,, ewwww !!!). Robitussen, best friend of a thorn, has a long introspective look at the end when he comes out of the village for the last time, and that's all. No real horror, no real anger, which the Japanese tend to do far better than the American film makers, with the emphasis on face-to-face makeup, without screaming. I was very disappointed.
