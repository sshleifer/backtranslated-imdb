Please do not hate me, but I have to be honest, looking at this movie, I've had a lot of fun ,, It's a movie with stupid songs and stupid songs !!! <br /> <br /> Songs unnecessary !!! Mehbooba ... A total insult to the original Holi .... well .. it was OK! Thanks to Tradition Every film must have one! Chad Raha hai Nasha Whatever ... Very stupid Song stupid Jee Le ... Sounded like a Stupid Song Playboy Song ... Other than Songs. The movie was OK This was the adaptation of Ram Gopal Verma's own ... If you think you like this movie, this movie is just this movie Depends on the viewer and judgment if he / she believes this movie is totally Copied he / she would like to hit his head on the cinema seat or if he / she thinks his own directors looks he / she would be relaxed and take a look at this movie anyway I looked in both ways I would congratulate and abuse by Ram Gopal for this disaster he did ... Well, other things that disturbed that CAST was incredibly bad Amitabh Bachchan Like Babban / Gabbar (Amitabh in his remake of Funny what the director was thinking) Ajay Devgan Ca Heero / Veeru (Bobby Deol could have been better) Prashant Raj Like Raj / Jai (Abhishek was Signed for This Appearance in the Mehbooba Song) Sushmita Sen Like Radha / Durga (Jaya Bachchan Was Right Tabu Had right for this role) Nisha Kothari Like Ghungroo / Basanti (I think Es ha Deol would have been great) Mohanlal As Narishma / Thakur (Mohanlal is so cute .... Oops Sorry, hehehehe, It was ok I could not think of anyone ) The film would be even FAVORITE If the movie was OK, the movie was not really interesting, the movie was fine, just for viewing. <br /> <br /> Directia ... 8/10 I got a credit Cinematography ... 9/10 Script ... 3/10 Poor writing songs ... 5/10 Unnecessary in the movie, could be better, Easy on the ears to be played in PCs and iPods and Cast Stuff ... 1/10 <br /> <br /> Total ... 3/10 <br /> < Syed Shabbir Aly Naqvi from Pakistan
