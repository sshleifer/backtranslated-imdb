There are some beautiful pictures in this movie, it captures some of the landscapes with such a beautiful light, in fact, cinema is probably the best advantage. But it is basically more than a movie made for television, and although it has a lot of twists and turns, it keeps a pretty interesting view, no subtitles and key developments of the plot are presented in Spanish so that the speakers non-Spaniards will be left a little lost. <br /> <br /> I had it as a Christmas present because it is a family trait that works through the films of an actor we find talented and Matthew Mconaughey was great in "A Time to kill "and" The Newton Boys "I said I wanted to see more of his work. However, although it is said on the DVD box is a movie by Matthew Mconaughey and uses this as a marketing game, he has a few lines and is on screen not for very many minutes at the end of the movie, he is basically an extra and does not illuminate the screen exactly while it is on, so bad fans die, re ally is not worth it from this point of view. Star movies, though, Patrick McGaw is great, though very light on the eye, and his character is just so beautiful and good and thoughtful, a true saint of a guy, he would be well written in a com com. true Mcconaughey acts the shine of those I've seen, I would recommend "Time to kill", "The Newton Boys" "Frailty", "How to lose a guy in 10 days", "Edtv" and "Amistad" and avoid too "Larger Than Life" and "Angels in the Outfield" kids around because none of them are indicative of his talent, but they are quite funny movies for children, again MM is nothing more than a supporting artist, with only a few if any lines. As for Scorpion Springit's not a bad movie, it's not the theft of the screen.
