Manoj Agrawal after the failure of PARDESI BABU (1998) returned with this film The film has Govinda in 8-9 roles as father, mother, grandmother, sister and later disguises <br /> <br /> In short, a detective uselessly sends a case to his friend to get evidence against his wife whose photos he loses at the airport while flirting with Rani Disguise as a Sardarji on the plane and again as a girl The fun part is how easy and in short time does he do that? Then he disguises as a French singer and enters a TV to get lol evidence and then as a maharashtrian (even inside the TV) The rest of the movie has the same wrong identities and ends on a predictable note There are some funny scenes like that be Govinda being beaten by an African and many other portions Direction by Manoj Agrawal is good Music is fine among the actors Govinda proves once again that he is one of the most observable actors He is usually a tastic fan though he has done so roles before falling into all rises and roles too good here again, though the roles too hyped 6-7 do not actually fit into the movie Rani looks fat, the teams well with Govinda she cares she She's nothing great and continued to make such roles among the rest of Pandey Nirmal is as usual Johny Lever is too loud at times and funny in places in 1 role and irritates like Tinnu A old nand is fine Satish Kaushik is hilarious, Paresh is ok Tanaaz is okay
