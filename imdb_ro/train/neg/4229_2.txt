I'm a big fan of low-budget horror films like that, but come on! This must be the worst piece of monkey S # # # I have ever seen! I ignored the reviews posted on this site, imagining it would fall into my horror, but I got bored and turned it off. Let's see: The closet: It was made up of cheap costumes of cameo and costumes of painters from the home warehouse. The masks were made from what looks like the tin sheet. <br /> <br /> Gore: The Gore was pretty good, I have to give this. But Ittenbach's Burning Moon was better for a low-budget movie. <br /> <br /> Action: It was horrible! I was not upset about duplication. It sounds like this humorous as in Ittenbach's "Premutos" (great movie). Battle and action sequences were stupid. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Do not watch any of Schnaas' movies. There are much better directors, such as Jorg Buttergeit and Olaf Ittenbach, with films of the same subject and subjects. Check Premutos, Blood House, Schramm, and Necromancers.
