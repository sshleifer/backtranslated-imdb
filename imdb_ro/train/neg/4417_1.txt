I am a Catholic taught in elementary parish schools of nuns, taught by Jesuit priests in high school and college. I am still a Catholic practitioner, but he would not be considered a "good Catholic" in the eyes of the church because I do not believe in certain things or do not act in certain ways just because the church told me. to the movie ... bad because two people are killed by this nun who should be a satire as the incarnation of a feminine religious figure. There is no comedy in this case, and satire is not doing well by Diane Keaton's excess action. I have never seen the song, but if it were very different from the movies, then it might be good. At first I thought the weapon might be a fake and the first shot of a plan by the female student of the four former students as an attempt to demonstrate the emotional and intellectual fanaticism of Mary's sister of faith. But it seems the bullets are real and the story has a tragedy ... the tragedy of the loss of life (besides the two former students ... the life of the aborted children, the life of the mother of the students), the dogmatic tragedy authority over the love of the people, the tragedy of the organized religion that replaces the true faith in God. This is what is wrong with today's Islam and Judaism and Christianity yesterday.
