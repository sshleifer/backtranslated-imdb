I do not know how to describe this movie. It's definitely one of the weirdest movies I've ever seen. It is sometimes very disturbing, but also boring in other places. Scenarios of dental torture are very elaborate and can attract anyone who is in gorges and splashes. I woke up holding my teeth during some of the scenes mentioned above. The intelligent thing about the movie is that it plays with our fears, and the dentist is therefore quite disturbing. The humor of the movie is somehow hidden and may not be recognized by everyone. But if you are a fan of weird and strange entertainment, and your teeth are drilled in dust, this is just the movie you're looking for. If you read the comment and feel somewhat attracted to this type of entertainment, try it! <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10 (maybe a bit too strange for my taste)
