Little Mosque is one of the most boring CBC comedies I've ever seen. They have a way to produce the easiest comedy programming I can get for the oldest viewers who are the most offended, who for CBC means 85-year-old farmers in Saskatchewan. Banknotes are all predictable and deadly blades, I can not believe. The shows are very strange and they have acted, but they do not blame the actors, because those types of stereotypical characters in a single dimension are probably exactly what CBC asked for and asked for. Very lame show with bad jokes tried to present as "controversial" well, it is less controversial than other boring CBC comedy such as The Hour has 22 minutes, Royal Canadian Air Farce and Rick Mercer Report.
