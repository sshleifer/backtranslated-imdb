"Steve" (Chris Hoffman) brings together a high school group for a meeting in the place where his twin brother Wes has disappeared. While I'm there, a reptilian creature in the shape of a man (reminded me of a lot of Gillman from CREATURE FROM THE LAGOON BLACK) waits in the wilderness to choose the right moment to choose one by one. A biker, the "Ellen Ripley" female model, Kat (Chase Masterson) has an underground military bunker in which he practices experiments, and serves as a safe place for the bloody ravages. Kat knows more than she says (she also suffered a child's loss), but there is another novelty novelty that most of the group has no idea. This creature might be more human than they realize ... and its earlier identity could shed light on a deception that just another person hid from Wes's death. Kat holds the key to many of the mysteries that unlock as the group stays near the cabin. Fortunately, much of the film stays away from the creature that jumps in the air, while we see the blurry screen as we look through his eyes. The film has melodramatic Dawson's Creek, which often hinders any real tension that has to be built into a small monster movie. The direction is very poor, resulting in a rather dull experience rather than causing aggression. The distribution is rather lifeless and uninteresting. Pretty Maggie Grace (FOG remake) could be the only draw for this movie.
