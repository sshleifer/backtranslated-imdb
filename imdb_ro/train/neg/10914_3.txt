Is not it hilarious when a schmuff environment that leads a pathetic life has suddenly something magical, transforming life upside down and teaching them some valuable lessons along the way? This formula does not get old, is it? It's such a safe way to create a classic movie! Look at major hits like Liar Liar and Big! ... This was Rob Schneider's line of thought when he did the semi-success of Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo and followed her with The Animal. Since I've already tracked the plot through sarcasm, let me color it more: Schneider plays a missed cop who suddenly gets involved in a tragic accident but is rescued by surgery ... by a doctor a veterinarian who loads him with parts of animals, making him drink like a horse at inappropriate moments, run like a cheetah, etc. This movie is a bit more enjoyable than other Schneider films (like another lame, the same plot watching The Hot Chick), but it almost feels like the audience would hate it by throwing a television star like (Colleen Haskell from "Survivor") and the insertion of a cameo by Norma MacDonald. My favorite scene ... does not exist. Sorry - nothing remarkable, except for the production value. I just want to close this review by saying that the light references to other movies in a movie may be fine, but when it comes to delivering exactly the same lines ("You can do it!") There is a word for that - " milking ". In fact, here is another word - "cheap."
