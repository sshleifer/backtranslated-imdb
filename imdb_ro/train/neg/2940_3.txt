I saw this movie when I was very young. It's by far one of the weirdest movies I've ever seen. Now, normally, I like strange movies, but this was just a little too much. There is not much to plot for the movie. In any case, it starts as Toy Story, when the toys come alive, and Raggedy Ann and Andy make an adventure to save their new friend, Babette. That's where madness comes from. There are Greedy, Looneys, a sea monster called Gazooks, and a bunch of pirates singing songs, all doing just the stranger movie. Also, I can not help feeling that Babette is annoying and a little tangled. It definitely did not help the movie. Now, even though I did not like this movie, there were some nice pieces. I liked the camel song. Even if it was a song about being alone, she had a friendly feeling. Then it was Sir Leonard. While most Looneys were just nuts, Sir Leonard was the most interesting and probably the most funny. King Koo Koo was just a small glass that made Dr. Evil look like a serious villain. It was also Raggedy Andy's play, Toy Girl's No Toy's. It was certainly a good song for boys who wanted to work hard. But honestly, even these things did not make the movie better. (But remember, this is just my perspective.) While I personally would not recommend this movie, I really have to admit, it has charming moments. See if you are interested, but only if you are in the mood for something "really" unusual.
