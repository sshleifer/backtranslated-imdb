So it was an HBO "Made for TV Movie" eh? Is it an excuse for such a pathetic plot and a terrible action? Such a shame to see Jim Belushi reduced to such a repeated role (shot, survived, lie, beaten, survived, shot, lie, and so on infinitum.) Call on a scenario, as far as he is concerned British, embarrassing to see Timothy Dalton pathetic (or was it just getting p ***, depends how much was paid I think?) try at a South Sheriff). As for the other Brit, the blond white, what was it! There is a tendency to glorify in recent years these "English bullies", probably because of Mr Madonna's two films, which manage to entertain and justify violence through the use of irony and humor, such as Pulp Fiction. However, this film discredits and devalues ​​the genre. you definitely miss them.
