I've seen a better quality of production on YouTube! I'm sorry for the actors, the writing is terrible and the shocking direction, they're not sure how to get the lines - I doubt if any actor would have saved this movie, no matter how good it is. Characters were not developed at all, and there was no real cohesion in the plot, which seemed to go far. It is a shame indeed, because the premise for the film was good and with better production quality, direction and scenario could have been a decent film. It was certainly not a comedy, if you did not laugh loudly at dubbing - who was amateur, even the English actors sounded weird.
