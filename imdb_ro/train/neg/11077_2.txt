The only reason I chose to shoot a movie was due to the presence of Oscar winner Ernest Borgnine. All I can say is that it was the biggest loss of a good actor ever put on the film. As far as I know, Borgnine was the only actor in it. The other performances were so terribly uniform, I am amazed that a studio would pay for the "performers" to appear. Young this level of talent in the acting department with such a frustrating and insipid story that I thought my eyes would start bleeding until the credits rolled and you got a perfect cinema disaster. Obviously, the movie was made to appeal to a child audience, and to its credit, it was better than most of the initial programming on Disney Channel and in similar networks for children. But honestly, that does not say too much.
