This film, though not very bad, should have been filmed where real events took place. Grand Island, Nebraska was devastated by no less than seven tornadoes on the night of June 3, 1980. Grand Island is located on the plateau near Platte River Flat in Hall. The producers of this film filmed the hills of Ontario in the trees and moved the whole event into an inexistent city called Blainsworth. The people of Grand Island survived with annoyance on this dreadful night, just to be forgotten because of a bad movie.
