Three Stoogi - They Rocket, They Will Travel - 1959 This was the first feature film to play Stooges and it's pretty bad. It makes the three stoogi walk around the world in a nozzle (from 1963) looks like a masterpiece. The stoogs are portraits in a rocket spot. He climbs into a rocket and goes to Venus. They meet some things there, including a unicorn speaking they call "Uni" that they bring to Earth with them. "Uni" speaks like an ordinary, pleasant person - "Oh, hello, how are you? A wonderful planet here. <br /> <br /> Very few gags and so many scenes go and continue and continue. <br /> <br /> Stooges gets out of space and the movie ends until the story goes, but no one said the filmmakers for the film continued for another 10 minutes or a party where nothing happens. The Stooges leave the party and then the film is near the end. The high point of the movie - the end of which Stooges plays a tiny song on their journey Larry and Curly Joe hit Moe in front of two pies Brutal Another writer mentioned the fine musical score It was not the only music I noticed was that there were two songs classic - I'll take romanticism and I'll take it back to this song, both of which are played at the party, and * this * is really the culmination of the picture - the music of old Columbia movies. Great - a new VHS video from the 99 cents store.
