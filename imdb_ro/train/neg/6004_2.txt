The best thing about camp movies in general is that you know what to expect. It's like watching a professional fight or a day or Jerry Springer show: you can immediately track the plot, identify the characters in the cardboard, and watch with satisfaction while all the clich√©s are fulfilled. However, sometimes the director does something real unexpected. It can be something extraordinarily stupid, or something strange, or something insightful. Director Makinen is there with the best film directors, and this is his best film. In Yon saalistajat, everything seems to come together. There is nothing good about this, but it still succeeds to be a coherent whole. Not once the movie slows down - action is running and the blows continue to come. The strangest thing is that there is no sense of time: some characters seem to take months to do something while other characters have just spent an hour at the bar. This is partly due to the Finnish summer, in which the sun never fixes, so that you do not experience the day when it turns into a night at all. Finally: there is a plot, somewhere out there. You may have to watch the movie three times before you figure it out, though.
