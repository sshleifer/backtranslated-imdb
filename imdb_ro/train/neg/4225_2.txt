This film is another Christian propaganda film, according to the Omega Code. Not that this is necessarily bad, but because most of the propaganda films sacrifice sincerity and realism for the message they want to bring. If you enjoy a life portrait on the street and the way the gospel can change your life, you can probably enjoy this movie. I say, save your money and rent the Cross and The Switchblade or Mission. When will Christian leaders learn that sometimes people say bad words? It was frustrating to see criminals who are not allowed to swear (are they? Criminals say bad words?) And flat characters I could not relate to. It would also have been great if the movie had shown some T & A. Now it would be something I'd like to pay to see. Who was the head of the block that compared this thin thin story of a movie with The Boondock Saints and The Sting?
