What is this shit? My little cousin has obviously chosen it for the art and title of excessive DVDs ... I decided to follow her, so she was not bored and I was definitely terrified of the horrible quality. > First, the act was terrible. They seem like amateur actresses who read the playing cards. Delivery is sub-par and very formal. Scene cuts were terrible. Looks like they got it right off the storyboard if there was only one time. Second, jokes and stereotypes were not original or well-played at all - again, very formulas. I can not count on the times when I could anticipate the next joke. I made some chuckles of "subtle" sexual indignation. Cat, Beaver Patch, Hung Wong? Just stay away from this movie. It's not cute, it's not funny, it's not even stupid. It's just stupid - stupid. It's like a PG child movie with unnecessary sexual futility, vulgarity and violence to downgrade the MPAA rating. STAY AWAY. "Would you like to travel with my yacht?" "Is that what I call now?" <br /> <br /> "You could let me go." "I think I have blood on my chair!"
