I bought this video at Walmart's ticket basket. I think I paid too much! In the 1940s, Bela Lugosi made a long series of films for small studios (in this case, Monogram - those who made the majority of Bowry Boys). While the misfortune of most of these films is not approaching the horror of his latest films (Ed Wood "classics," such as The Monster of the Monster and Plan 9 in the Cosmic Space), these are still poor films and should be avoided by all but the toughest fans. I'm an old filmmaker, so I made a try. In addition, some of these smaller films were actually pretty good - not just that. Lugosi is, what else, a crazy scientist who wants to keep his life fairly bizarre and violent in the life of a sermon, he collaborates with young brides. They never explained why they had to be brides or why they must be women or even the sickness that his wife had - so you can see that the plot was never uprooted at all. a really annoying reporter (a guy Lois Lane without Jimmy Olsen or Superman) wants to get to the bottom of all this apparent murder in which the bodies were STOLEN! So she follows some clues up to Lugosi's door. Lugosi's home is complete with his crazy wife, female nurse and two strange people who are apparently the sons' sons (an ugly and an ugly dwarf). Naturally, this glamorous reporter lights up repeatedly throughout the movie - apparently narcolepsy and good investigative journalism go hand in hand! Eventually, ALL maniacs die - especially because of their own hands and everything that's good. At the end, the reporter and the doctor he just met decided to get married. And of course, the reporter's poor cameraman lights up when this happens. If you have not noticed, there are many faints in this movie. Or, maybe because it was such a slow and heavy movie that it just fell asleep!
