Pathetic is the word. Bad action, pathetic scenario, strange dialogue and hip hop & fashion music ... what the hell was that? The direction of this film is as bad as the movie it made. If someone had some time and effort to restore everything, they may have a chance. Bet the studios that are still trying to figure out how they could get their mistakes. The best thing about this movie was Stacey Dash ... Asian chickens were not too bad either. These galleries worn the whole movie. If it had not been for them, I would have destroyed my copy of this film. If any of those who have not yet seen this and had a notion, do not waste your time ... you'll regret it later.
