It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but the Hostel is certainly a lot worse. This movie is funnier and ridiculous than frightening. I laughed most of the time when I looked at her. Low quality effects (when you look, you will understand what I'm talking about and how small the quality is), bad actors (I heard about them for the first time) and it seems to be shot by a camera amateur (so shows more a TV show than a movie). But at least I had the patience to see it to the end. Like comedies? Look. Do you want to think about horror? Go Ju-On Watch: The Grudge or another horror movie. If I'm talking about Legend of Diablo, I do not even know if I can categorize it to a Horror genre. Just some low-budget nonsense. I rated 3 out of 10
