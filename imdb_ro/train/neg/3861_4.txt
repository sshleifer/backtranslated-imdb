I'm not a big fan of rom / coms in the best moments. Some were pretty good (checking the dream for an insomniac), but this is just more than the same, but less. With a running time of 100min, I expect more than 1 laugh every 30min. The only real belly laugh is when aliens and male friends instinctively help Lee's character. <br /> <br /> Everything I can say is avoided. I gaurentee there are at least 10 other movies on the shelf that worth $ $$ 3 out of 10 (And just because I'm a big Lee fan)
