I usually watch the MTV Movie Awards to watch a fun show that offers a unique prize award (Chewbacca wins a lifetime award as an example). So this year it was no different. While I'm not a fan of Justin Timberlake, Seann William Scott has always been funny - the stupid bleach - for me. I laughed at Stiffler in both American Pie movies and even enjoyed it in Dude Where's My Car ?. But the MTV Awards were simply horrible. Nothing was coherent, humorous, or fun. Justin Timberlake should stay sing and dance; he sure can not act. I'm curious that some writers were for this show. Last year's performance of Jack Black and Sarah Michelle Gellar was extremely funny (Lord of the Rings parody was worth seeing the whole show), but this year was completely different. Has anyone been able to understand Timberlake's comments on Luke Wilson and Kate Hudson ("They look in a movie together, but they have never met here!") Where was the joke? Kate and Luke have just entered their tortured dialogue without ever referring to Timberlake's "joke." And Seann was completely wasted as a talent, not even making me smile, but laughs alone. And what was Harrison Ford's point of view? Did they make any sense to anyone? Perhaps MTV writers thought that young spectators would only know old Ford, like Han Solo, Indiana Jones, or Air Force One president. I'm tangled. And would anyone tell me the deal with Adrian Brody? How old is this guy and how much he thinks he is? The guy looks 30, tries to act again ... to quit, to show a class (as in the acting actor's best speech) and to act your age! of 4, simply because of Gollam's speech for best visual performance. This was very creative, extremely well done and caused the only real laughter of the whole evening.
