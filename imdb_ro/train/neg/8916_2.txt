I rented this DVD after I saw it while I was looking for something else. When I saw the title on the jacket, I could not believe my eyes. I read Yalom's book a year ago and I loved her, in fact, I admire Yalom's work in general. (I'm a clinical psychologist). I've probably watched 30 minutes of this movie and I had to stop it. I'm not sure if I can take much more. At superficial level, false accents, as others have commented, distract attention at best and are irritating and vapid at worst. The act is boring when it must be passionate and comic when it must be serious. Lou Salome's representation is simply flippant, and Freud's glow is no more than a schoolchild. I see very little of the spirit of the book so far. I was hoping to be able to recommend this movie to my students. Instead, I will refer to the book. Imagine this.
