Tim Robbins is strangely comic strip comedians in the 50s of New Jersey who fall in love with a blonde who turns out to be Albert Einstein's niece! Although he is on the screen many times, Robbins cancels the inner workings of his intense characters and fades into the background (it's easy to forget that he is right in the picture!). Light romantic comedy with a trick, which is Walter Matthau playing Einstein (who does what he can with a cartoon character conceived). Otherwise, it is sweet and sunny, directed rather somber by Fred Schepisi, who shows the heart, but has no spirit or brain. Meg Ryan is her usual self and the chemistry between her and Robbins is charming, like her affectionate sister and her older brother. ** from ****
