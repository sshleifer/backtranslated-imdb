The movie had a nice opening, I really thought I was one of the best romantic comedies we've seen for some time ... there was something special "strange" about how the movie was created , realistic and yet abstract and mystical. But then the story line began to become more and more unrealistic. Saying that the end was CORNY and PREDICTABLE would be almost an underestimation ... The most romantic ending where everything goes great for every character "full of love". A scene where the main character realizes that he has made a mistake and follows the "woman in his dreams" just to confess his love of her to a crowd of sympathetic people. Come on. Finally, "good boys" win, "bad guys" lose ... You have the picture. A desert of a potentially exciting film.
