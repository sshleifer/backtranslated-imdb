I've read some internet reviews about this movie, such as "... harder than Hostel ..." "the room never passes when it gets really brutal ..." But none of them is true. The camera never passes because there is nothing to show. The same scene is repeated one hundred and a hundred times. Women are on a table, murderous killer women a few times, the killer cuts the women in pieces (you never see it during the whole movie!). The police came and arrested him. The killer opposes the jury. The movie is over. In Germany I would say, "Viel LÃ¤rm um Nichts". In general, one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Absolutely not recommended.
