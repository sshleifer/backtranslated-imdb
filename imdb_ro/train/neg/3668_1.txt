This movie is so bad, you almost feel contaminated by it. In fact, there is a strong sense of relief when it's over, the exemption that you can now put the box back in reverse and RUSH back to the video rental shop before it contaminates the rest of your video collection. I jokingly suggested it when I hired her to look like a kind of film in which William Hurt would "phone" in his show. I mean he will not try too much. But here is a huge number of scenes in this movie, Bill Hurt is actually on the phone! The realization of this irony was the only pleasure we derived from this confusing misery. Cinematography and editing are dark and hungry, the story is chaotic, and the soundtrack is barely audible. There is a very little resemblance to "Falling Down," but the film had a bold tale of storytelling, great writing and acting, and an exciting soundtrack. "Contaminated man" is just a sort of European tourist trap broken down and seeing it is like driving an unknown road in an unknown country where you do not speak your tongue in constant rain immediately after the nightfall, the windshield keeps fog. Do you have the picture? Do not take that.
