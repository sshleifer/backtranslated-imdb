I'm laughing in this movie, that's for sure. Michael Keaton is a talent and he was fun (before deciding he was a serious actor). However, what bothers me so much about this movie is how impractical are practically all the characters. Apart from the two main leaderships, everyone is a bastard. I mean, these losers in the small towns are almost as unpleasant as you can. See and think, man, these losers should be unemployed. Moreover, the American worker in the factory is portrayed as a lazy and ungrateful slob. It made me wonder if this movie was made by Japanese nationalists. Sure, eventually everyone is united, but I did not like the trip to get there.
