Before I started, I left Eddie Izzard. I think it's one of the funniest posts around us today. Probably that means I'm getting into this with too big expectations, but I did not find Eddie funny on this trip. I think the main problem is that Eddie is trying too hard to be Eddie. Everyone knows him as a completely irrelevant comic and we all love him for him. But in the Circle, he seems to go more irrelevant than funny and completely lost in places. Many of the topics he covered covered them before - I even think I recognized some jokes recycled there. If you buy the DVD you will find a look behind the scenes at Eddie's tour (interesting in places but not very funny) and a French version of one of his shows. Die-Hards will enjoy seeing Eddie in a different language, but subtitling comedy is not very funny. If you are a fan of Eddie you've already taken it, or you're going to buy everything I say. If you just go, buy Glorious or Dressed to Kill - you will not be disappointed. With Circle, you'll probably do it.
