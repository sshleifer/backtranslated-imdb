I just liked to look at her and have fun with the total evil of a movie. I saw this movie through the useful sarcasm of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and I have the DVD. If you go back to the other side of the DVD, they show the real movie, so I gave it a chance. Seriously, man, this is a barbecue cheese. The effects, the special effects and the plot, in general, are very astounding and unrealistic. "He does not need his lungs," Crow said, noticing how his head can talk while he does not have a body, and Tom Servo notes with sadness "No, he has throat juice!" The end is just classic and no one can touch this soundtrack with K-Porn! I liked the "cat fight" between the two strips. This "Meow" after the fight or scene, no matter what, was classic. So in some ways it was a fun movie. I think for horror fans, you'll probably enjoy it. For a good time, watch the MSTK3 version, you'll get a big laugh. <br /> <br /> MST3K version: 10/10 Brain that would die: 1/10
