This was a painful example of a cheap, boring and non-original show produced by Australian television stations to meet local content quotas. The writing was really terrible and I'm not surprised that the writers are responsible for the worst Australian film in the recent Honestable memory Wally Norman. Nothing in this television series was funny - never - not even funny. He was just tired and BAD and, worst of all, he really thought it was funny. It was simply embarrassing to watch. There is something very shameful about this show given 10 out of 10 on IMDb. Try to find a (real) examination by a (true) Australian spectator of the show (there was not much) and it's impossible. Or crazy. There are pieces of bread that are more fun than this show. <br /> <br /> Avoid the show at any cost and, if it does not appear on DVD, remember that the laughter that deserves was unintentional.
