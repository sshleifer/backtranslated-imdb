This is a kind of film that shows the lack of French cinema when it comes to doing thrillers. The director's desire to "sound the American" is so brilliant that you will not be fooled for a minute unless you've seen a Peeping Tom serial killer. Two male policemen (or a year and a half, rather, as you will see), horrible crimes, a plot more complicated than complex. Charles Berling is not lucky with the genre (see the amazing "l'inconnu de Strasbourg" a few years ago). Scenes with his pregnant wife - who should be the counterpart for the noir atmosphere of the rest of the plot - are among the worst filmed. Add a love scene between them and a gorilla autopsy to get a PG 12 and thus to attract the giant adolescent audience. A violent and absurd conclusion, followed by a silent epilogue that could make a beautiful advertisement for the c√¥te d'azur, is indeed the silence of the lame.
