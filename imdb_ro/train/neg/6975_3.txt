Oh, my God, that idiotic movie! Incredibly inexpensive, with fake special effects (the creature is played by a guy in the blade costume) and a stupid plot. All the dialogues are incredibly bad and these actors (HA! HA! HA!) Just did not really see characters so annoying as in this junk (those stupid kids or pregnant women with her husband and much more.) In total, this is a wonderful fun if you are drunk like the plague I drank I do not think ...
