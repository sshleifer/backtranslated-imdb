This story was not an original idea. The themes were drawn from different sources; some being The New Gate, In Gura Madness (another Carpenter film), and The Ring. It really went to the same brilliant circle from The Ring and using it as a tribute to the movie. Cody Carpenter's soundtrack was just raised by Suspiria. We hope that no one will oppose this comment, spitting the word HOMAGE around. Yes, I saw the theater play Argento Deep Red. Claiming homage would be an avenger. This was the bottom-of-the-barrel. Throwing gore and "disturbing" pictures in the pot does not make a horror film good. Carpenter used to know that. He should disappear into obscurity or acquire a time machine.
