Okay, let me break you for ... It's HOT! <br /> <br /> If Roger Kumble did such a fabulous job about the first raw intentions, why did he do such a bad job. I'm sorry, but this movie is bad, it's true that it could have improved if its series was ever broadcast, but it allows you to be realistic ... this movie a crock! A lot of bad action * NOTE The Shower Scene * "Kissing Cousins" ?????? What kind of line is that? "Slippery when wet" ?????????? We can say DUH-M! This movie has worked, I will give you this, but it was too bad! They even tried to make it funny, giving the servants houses stupid accents, which actually ... was not FUNNY! It was pathetic. Not to mention that they made everyone who looked at this absolutely nothing like the original distribution. It's as if it were made to look different for purpose or something! I like to see him when I'm really a board that does not happen occasionally. For those who liked you ... All right, what do you think? Can you choose this movie over the other who had a great action and the fabulous Sarah Michelle Gellar? A movie is golden if she has Sarah Michelle Gellar, DUH! But this movie is not, no crime Amy Adams. Oh, yes, since Sebastain does not have a heart ????? UGH!
