It is impossible to think objectively about this film. Not that I did not try, lie - but I sit down and pop in the older VHS, and I look at the opening ... and suddenly I'm five years old and I hang on my caretaker and I see the movie her eyes open and a sweet heart. I can see objectively that this movie is a combination of BABIES mascots of merchandising type and scary children of prepubescent children with bad powers that have a thin story and uninteresting animation. But I, five years old, takes me, "Yay! Care Bears!" every time I think about it. So I would have advised (cautiously, reluctantly) this film for those who have seen it during their early youth and can appeal to the extraordinary power of nostalgia while watching it (like me) or to those cynical Gen- X / Y deliberately looking awfully evil / weird (a category in which this movie ... certainly does). For those who are actually looking for a convincing movie or healthy family entertainment: you may want to keep searching.
