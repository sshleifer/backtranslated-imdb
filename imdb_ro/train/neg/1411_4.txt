This movie was great the first time I saw it when it was called "Lost in Translation". But, in a way, Bill Murray turned into an eccentric black man played by Morgan Freeman, Scarlett Johansson turned into a Latino woman, played by Paz Vega, and Tokyo, Japan, turned to Carson, California. Instead of meaningful conversations and silence that we liked in Translation, we get bluntly stunned in 10 Elements that go on annoying. Instead of characters who were boring and introspective as in Translation, we get characters to tell him unnecessary tips on topics he has no idea about. How can a character wearing hundreds of dollars and who has never been in a Target store expect to offer advice to a working-class woman about how to prepare for an interview as an assistant? He does not think that stops him. If she does not give her advice on clothing, she tells her what she should eat. The most annoying part of the film for me was the way they were supposed to hurry to make a date, and yet the characters continued to find time to carry out another task, either washing the car, stopping at Arby, from their lists 10 articles or less of things that I love and hate. I wanted to cry to them, saying, "You did not say you had somewhere where to be, what the hell are you doing? A minute ago, you were practically late, now you eat beef and you think about your life!" Until I saw this movie, I never understood how they could "insist on themselves", but I think this movie does exactly that, and no doubt so. The dialogue makes the characters healthy and unsatisfactory, except that I felt sorry for both actors to have signed up for this project.
