He saw this on television. I'm glad I did not go to the cinema to see this or spend the money for rent. The film is completely predictable - from the corrupt owner and planner to the shock electric cables. The plot is very poor and unbelievable - the avalanche expert is struck by a wave of 20 feet of avalanche breaking the bones (using effective images) and all he has to do is get up and shake. The avalanche tunes down to one million kilometers per hour and stops at the edge of the road. Some avalanche materials are impressive and show their devastating power. But the contract between the real avalanche and the stuff made makes this film look even louder. Do a favor, do not bother with this even on T.V.
