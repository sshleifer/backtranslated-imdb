Watching "Speak Easy" is painful for Buster Keaton fans. Seeing such a phenomenal writer, actor, comedian, director and stunt man subjected to this humiliating show is like seeing a Picasso used as a cloth dropper or rather how to see the best forged Camembert with Whey Whey and processed in Cheez-Whiz. <br /> <br /> Keaton is stupid as a post teacher, whose exaggerated vocabulary is the only one that prevents him from saying, "Tell me about the rabbits, George." (Post would have said something like, "Please let me know about the status of Lagomorpha small mammals of the Leporidae family, sir, which I think is primarily addressed to the epithet" George. ") When Keaton created the characters his personal, could be situationally clueless, but they were not bad, they were quick studies and became the masters of their world. Not so much with Post, who never stops stumbling or blowing, and who does not have more control of his destiny rather than a blood rat that had Titanic.While Keaton's original characters had a naivety and a charming innocence, Post returned as a profound sexual delay that if he had ever physically awakened , would have put a bag of ice on the bumps and would seek medical help. There are some great moments, such as Keaton's attempts to get rid of vampire Thema To dd or his suggestion of clothing suitable for a Greek dance, but it does not deserve to resist the whole movie to see them. If you're a fan of bad movies, watch and watch "Speak with ease" with friends at Mystery Science Theater 3000. But besides that, you remain silent. Let them be 100% of what Buster Keaton remembers.
