This is a film in which actors are good, especially Brigitte Bako and Erik Palladino, in a film where each of the three couples meets in a situation that seems to be forced to either be nice or to put the story on the move. In other words, it feels like movie scenes, not real life. Even though women working in landscape sceneries go out with one of their clients, they just do not seem realistic as it is written in this movie. Also, when one of the characters encounters the overweight woman in the film, she feels artificial, the way she looks every other second after she quarrels. Again, the actors are all good and the moments in this movie are nice, but in general yet another indie that could have used a rewrite before the production rolls.
