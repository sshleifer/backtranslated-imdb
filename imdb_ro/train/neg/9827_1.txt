First of all, this film reminded me of the old films I used to follow in the religious class in school. It's not a good thing. Basically, it's just a piece of pretentious and demanding dirt, just like the terrible series "Behind the Left". I'm not offended by religious movies ... but I'm offended when these religious movies happen to be extremely terrible. I just wish I could say beautiful things about a Christian movie, but it does not seem to happen soon. I bet that if you gave the Bible beats a decent budget, they would still not be able to come up with something good. Just avoid that. Also, the fact that the "American Family Association" (essentially Reverend Wildmon's shortcomings) crosses this movie on their site is another reason to make me hate myself. In fact, after seeing this, I went home and looked at Cronenberg's copy, called NC-17, "Crash." Forgive my dad for sinning. Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
