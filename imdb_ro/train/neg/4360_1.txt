First, let me say that I had to think a lot about writing a comment for this movie. The best review for this type of cinema can be just silence. Film addressed to domestic women and grandparents. This movie tries to look "authentic," and the characters should be supposed to be "real people." An Italian could never believe that the characters could be "real": they are just "low profile" stereotypes. It gives a very false view of what rural rural life is in Italy. The plot is weak (plot, what plot?) And humor does not laugh no one older than 12 years old.
