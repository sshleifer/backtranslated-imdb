Probably I will always go to see Woody Alleb because we never know when he could really return to his greatness in the past. Just one or two moments or big lines could make it worthwhile. Unfortunately, however, this film does not make any scores. Saying it actually makes me sad and even a little guilty. I'm sure my reaction is the same as many other Woody fans, but what can anyone say? Probably it's time to focus on Clarinett, which, in my opinion, is pretty good. By saying all this, I will probably continue to go to any new film that Woody may have in the future. There is always hope and I will continue to love and respect WOODY!
