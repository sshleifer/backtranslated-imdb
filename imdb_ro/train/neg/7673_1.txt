I do not know where to begin. Tara Reid must be stopped before being put on another movie. Stephen Dorff seems to have received the motivation of his character from Val Kilmer in "Top Gun". Slater goes through sleep. Direction, editing, sound (do we really need a heavy metal film in the middle of a gun?), Costumes (he has bulletproof muscles on them) and hey, there is no discernible plot. It amazes me that no one stopped and said: "Hey guys, this makes no sense, let's start from the beginning." We hope Slater's career can come back from this disaster. Hands down the worst movie I've ever seen.
