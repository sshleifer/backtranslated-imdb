First of all, let me say that I am the LDS or, rather, I am a Mormon. So when I watched this movie, I automatically gave it the benefit of the doubt. Usually, I find something redeeming in every movie I watch. And that was no exception. She has her moments of redemption. But they are few and far between. One of the first things I noticed that it bothered me a lot was that Halestorm seemed ashamed of our Church! In the LDS church, the congregations are called "wards," and the basketball court is in the "culture room." NEVER, any of these two names is mentioned. The church is never mentioned by names and "standards" are to the extent that what our Church thinks is mentioned. Makes me wonder if the directors are really WDS or LDS? This movie has so much potential! He could have really shown our Church in a positive light and helped the public to see not only what we have to offer but also what we believe. Instead, it was just fun and left much to be desired. If I had not already been LDS, I would have allowed the Mormons to be stupid, idiot and ashamed of their beliefs. It's NOT a movie I'll recommend to my nonLDS friends. <br /> <i> I'm sorry Halestorm. You can do better than that!
