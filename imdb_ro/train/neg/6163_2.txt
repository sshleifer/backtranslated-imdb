Hooper is not funny, not rhythmic, not romantic and non-informative. There is no real drama. You'd think a movie about the biggest stunt in the world would have some drama, there was a try, but it did not look real. No study of characters, nor lessons learned, did not even show that the actors were really entertained, just trying to behave as if they had fun. There is no reason to watch if you do not like to look at Burt and want to take a quick look at Sally. Prancer the horse was beautiful and did what she had to do. In fact, Prancer was the best actor in this movie. Smoky and Bandit was such a fun movie that I was ready to like Hooper. This movie proved to be a real disappointment and waste of time
