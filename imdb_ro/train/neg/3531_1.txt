This movie is now my gauge against which all the other films will be compared ... as in, "Was it as stupid as Revolver?" And I was at the audience at the Toronto International Film Festival last night, where a room full of more than 2,000 people came out in a wonderful silence after being absolutely stupid in 2 hours of nonsense. Jason Stratham would have been amazing if he had only one purpose. In the first 10 minutes he gave a suggestion of Andre 3000 and Big Pussy (Soprano Fame) that does nothing SENSE AT ALL! Then there are some shooting and then Ray Liotta wears embarrassing bikini ribbons, then there's an animation, Ray Liotta's naked ass, a lot of shots, gnarled teeth, the art house wants to be even more pretentious than Liotta's embarrassing body , which caused laughter at each show. .I am not sure it was the reaction she's been looking for ... not five times anyway. Everyone in this movie thinks they're smarter than the average bear and that Guy Ritchie thinks Yogi Bear is incarnate. The story lines could have gone nowhere, but the posture was not visible! The only way this movie could have been worse is if Madonna had been in it.
