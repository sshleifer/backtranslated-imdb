I tried to watch this film only if I found bad phrases about "teenagers seduce and kill the man in his house" and so. I think I first saw parts of this movie when I was 10 years old when I was running on the cable. It made a pretty big impression! It's a kind of movie that kids know they should not look at and change the channel when their parents come in. When I saw who was the cast, I could not believe that some of these good actors were in such a horrible movie. Then again, if you want to see men cheating their wives, they are killed, then this is an interesting movie. Also, if I remember, there are some interesting pseudo-lesbian moments. Probably the worst finality of all time, but still ... memorable.
