I'm not one of those who think the king is a wonderful writer, for his books are very distracting for a few hours and often have interesting premises, but in my opinion he breaks out quite quickly if you give them a serious thought. br /> <br /> This movie suffers from being an exact resumption of the King's story. If you've read the book, there are zero surprises, no changes, no changes to scenes or characters. This is a movie made by King fans for King fans. For the rest of us, there is nothing terrible about the film, it is a horror of a "gypsy curse", with its twist being the curse being what many people want to become thinner. The third step has some serious structural problems, and the slightly forced termination seems to violate the rules of this genre. There are worse ways to spend 90 minutes of your life, but you might well read the book because there is nothing new here ... <br /> <br />
