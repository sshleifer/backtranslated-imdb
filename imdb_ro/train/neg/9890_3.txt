Another rape of history This film is a catastrophe; uses only a historical history and makes a sweet love story with a bad attitude and a low-budget production. The film should be 1/3 of the time, just dragged the time to make a mini series. <br /> <br /> Battle scenes are so bad and illogical, the soldiers are stupid, the costumes a catastrophe. The Romanians were good at fighting in open areas, one of their armies was completely destroyed by the Germans when they tried to fight in a forest, in this film the Romans choose to fight sideways, I want to say real. > <br /> And by the way Cleopatra was of Macedonian origin, which means a person with open skin.
