Nothing will destroy a movie as much as a combination of a bad scenario and a bad direction. This is the case with The Mummy's Tomb. The script is the remnants of the bigger, better Universal horror films like "Dracula" and "Frankenstein". The direction is tricked and obsolete. The actor is mediocre. Even Kharis de la Chaney is weak compared to Tom Tyler in "The Mummy's Hand" and the producers are crazy enough to add Christy Cabanne's career pictures that are much better and show the weakness of their own movie! he realized how bad this movie was and basically remodeled from zero to two years later as "The Mummy's Ghost" with a much better script and a better director. The result was probably the best film in their fourth Mummy, though not as good as Karl Freund's original 1932. Cabanne's pictures raise this movie to 3. The "new" is in the best case 2. Dick Foran and Wallace Ford were probably glad to see their hit characters, so they did not have to be that way!
