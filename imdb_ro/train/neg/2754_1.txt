My original review of this movie was simply the word sh * t written 2000 times. Although this was a very precise criticism, I felt that my review should be a little more descriptive. I'll start with the lead actress; her facial expression does not change once in this film, she does not show fear, happiness or depression. Her skills in body language go down enough to cast her eyes to the left and right and looks as if she does not know the jack. She is a shell without emotion that I suppose has had too much botox. Her lack of facial expression through the film is outweighed by the deplorable love of the actor who seems to spring from nowhere and makes them make a beach and fall in love within a few hours of meeting. The leading actor, whose hair needed more attention than she did, was mediocre at best and did not make me feel really distressed. The only thing at the head of the hideous act is the direction, the story and the inaccuracies in the plot. I saw ads with pockets with a larger structure than this movie. There is no development in character, they seem to say and do things that I can never believe a real person. This movie would not have been bad if he wanted to be nonsense like a snakes on a plane, but he tried so hard to be a serious blow that I could not even laugh. I think I now have a brain tumor from watching this movie and thinking about all the different ways in which I could have used that budget and the cg team to create something far superior. If I bought this on DVD, I would break the DVD into pieces, burn it then dissolve it in hydrochloric acid for a good measure. DO NOT SEE THIS FILM!
