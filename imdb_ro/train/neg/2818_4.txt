Genie (Zoe Trilling) arrives in Egypt to visit the hypocritical archaeologist father (William Finley) who cites the Bible and draws attention to a group of culturists led by a descendant of the Sade Marquis (Robert Englund). Englund also plays Sade in flashbacks, twisting his cell. Genie is led by Mohammed (Juliano Merr), who walks on a naked horse and Sabina (Alona Kamhi), a bisexual who introduces her into opium smoking, leading to a wild hallucination with topless harem dancers, a woman who simulates oral sex on a snake, an orgy, and her father's preaching in the background! Meanwhile, members of the black-headed hooded cult, pull out their eyes and drive away their throats. When Genie is drugged in her tea, she imagines that Sade is hung on a cross, a woman painted in gold in a row of leaves with leaves and bloody on a snakes bed. Everything is because it is the reincarnation of the love lost by Sade. This typical Harry Alan Towers production is redundant, scary and pretty meaningless, but sets, costumes, cinema and work are excellent. at least always something happens. <br /> <br /> Scor: 3 out of 10
