This total disorder of a movie was directed by Bill Rebane, the man who is partly responsible for the true infamous Monster a-Go Go anti-classic. As I approached the end of the Cold, I came to the incredible conclusion that this film was actually even worse than the 60-year shock. The story ?? such as ?? is about three eccentric millionaires that invite a group of people to their remote manor to play a series of macabre games. Anyone who manages to resist and survive to the end will win $ 1,000,000. It's a very simple plot, but Rebane still does some incomprehensible process. It happens. Characters are completely forgotten. Nothing makes much sense. And then it's over. Weirdly. I mean what the hell did it all right? I think you have your conclusions. Production values ​​and drive are undoubtedly a pornographic standard for movies. In fact, Pamela Rohleder (Shelly) is not that good. It's so incredibly terrible that it's convincing. Unfortunately, the same thing can not be said about this carp-fest as a whole, it's just a bargaining trader.
