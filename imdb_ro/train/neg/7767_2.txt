For anyone not familiar with c.S. Forrester's book, this movie should be interesting. It is colorful, well acting and presents a high adventure, but to those who know the original stories is awful. I could hardly stand by it. For some reasons, scriptwriters seem to be forced to rewrite the stories they are working on. Of course, the spoken word is different from the written word and there are some episodes that would be difficult to shoot. But why do writers rewrite the story instead of adapting it? In this case the writers made themselves. Just a few examples: There was no rebellion in Renown. The officers took over the ship after the half-crazy captain was completely driven by madness when he fell into a mouth-for implied but never-given reasons. There was no martial law. The court of inquiry was conducted in a near congratulatory atmosphere. Captain Pellew does not appear in this part of the Hornblower, nor the wife of Colonel Ortega. Hornblower himself was never in the brig, neither on the ship nor on the shore. There are a lot of such manipulations of Forrester's story. On a purely technical basis, I think repeated film use of the flash-back device hurts the continuity of the story. Why, why did script writers make a good story?
