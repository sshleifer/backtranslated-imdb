"A Christmas Story" is one of the most beloved movies of all people. ACS managed to take the spectator at a time and place in such a way that he has very few films. She had a sweetness and a goodwill for her, which is rare. So I waited (and waited for) his continuation, "It's running in the family." The film was almost released a few times, just to be shot at the last minute. When it finally came out, IRITF was (and is, I think) a total failure. The sets and the cinema were good, but the overall direction completely missed the sign. The film was nothing but a lean casting cash-flow formula, lazy writing and disconnected action. The narrator, Jean Shepard, one of America's greatest humorous and storytellers, was forced into a false replica of the warm spirit he used in ACS. He was too excited and why he did, I will never know. He somehow managed to become an annoying parody, overwhelmed by himself. Writing and acting in IRITF is inappropriate and forced. The actors could have seen the ACS, but any clues and nuances that were in the ACS must not have registered anyone at all. The actor was a shameless robbery and she had no Shepard's dry humor. ACS will always be a real treasure, but calling IRITF a sequel is to insult all fans of Jean Shepard and ACS.
