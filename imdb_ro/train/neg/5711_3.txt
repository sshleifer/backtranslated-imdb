The National Treasure is just as over-rated and over-hyped as they come. Nicholas Cage is not a credible action hero at all, and this movie is not "Indiana Jones". The people who compared this movie to the classical trilogy of the Jones Indians fell seriously on their rocker. I can not figure out what kind of target audience was filmed for this movie. Perhaps the pre-teenage audience will love it, but it seemed totally absurd to me. Also, I can not imagine adults or young adults to find this to be a great movie. Simply put it: it's okay best. The National Treasure is unimaginable and uninspired, borrowing what it has from the "Da Vinci Code". I would recommend that you wait for that movie to be launched in 2006 and transmit this stupidity. The whole idea of ​​being able to easily steal the Declaration of Independence and run around Washington DC and Philadelphia with her (while never giving it), fighting against "bad boys" and living what is supposed to be "action non-stop "is absurd. I particularly liked the scene with the Declaration folded into her tube, set in the middle of a busy road, while the cars were strolling without damaging it. Oh brother! <br /> <br /> I remembered that episode of "Brady Bunch," where I go to the amusement park and Mr. Brady loses his architecture plans. Except, the Brady Bunch episode was much better than the whole movie! <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​such huge treasure, which no one thinks is buried in a secret ruin of the US, is extraordinary. Literally, in this treasure there are thousands of undiscovered "priceless" objects. Yeah sure!! Ridiculous!! <br /> <br /> And worse, the speed and precision that Cage finds and realize what should be the "harsh" hints for these ancient riddles are pre-posterous !!! Oh ... humanity! Cage, Voight and other National Treasure actors are as rigid, righteous and full as they come. However, when working with such a stupid dialogue, it's hard to get 100% wrong for the actor. <br /> <br /> National Treasure is a movie OK to see once. I can not recommend beyond that and certainly would NOT have bought this over the hunt of a mess. <br /> <br /> Rent it if you need to see it first .......
