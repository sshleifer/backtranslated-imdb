I really can not believe this movie is not in IMDB the worst 250, it's absolutely terrible. When I first saw it, I remember talking about it in a college class, and two other people saw it. We told all the other members of the class not to see it because it was so horrible. Until we finished, others wanted to see it just because they could not believe that something was as bad as we were. Do not be like them, just pass this. I'm sure everyone involved in this movie would prefer never to see them in this movie.
