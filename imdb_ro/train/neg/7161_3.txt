A young American woman visits her Irish roots and takes revenge on a druid witch who keeps her out. It sounds intriguing, but after an interesting start, I lost myself and spent most of the time wondering where she was going. The film seems to be spreading in two directions - do we look at the pains of the Irish-American woman who are struggling with the problem of alcohol or do we look at a horror movement from a witch coming back from the past? The director does not seem to decide. The two do not seem to gel, and in the end you do not get anywhere. This could be much better done, and the story seemed to come to an end. This was the most boring and disappointing.
