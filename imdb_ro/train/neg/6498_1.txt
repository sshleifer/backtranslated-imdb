I've seen some bad movies earlier, but this movie takes away the "Worst Life of Life" award! Anthony Hopkins must be totally ill to have the name attached to him - anywhere! I will never see another movie with him in him, guiding him, etc., etc.! I can not believe the other actors and actresses I liked (in this picture), who leaned so low to be part of this disaster! There must be some big drugs there! For anyone not to be embarrassed to be part of such a movie is beyond me! Save money on this! HUGE FLOP from start to finish! Shame on you, Mr. Hopkins! Also shame on Christian Slater! I can not believe you put your reputation on the line for that!
