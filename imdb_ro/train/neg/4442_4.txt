I do not know ... maybe it's because I'm Brazilian, but all things were too many. Too much love for music, too many parties, too much contrast between the beautiful lives of the main characters (come on, it's not so sad) and the look of the city shown by the director. Everything seems too fake for me: families, relationships, music, "happiness". It simply sells a small taste of false Latin culture. I have to be honest: I'm a little mistaken, but who would not be seduced by those fake lives made of music, sex and beautiful parties? I'm not so stupid: what kind of world is this world where people do not suffer from diarrhea, profound sadness and sexually transmitted diseases? I liked the scene with Caridad's mother phone and the discussion about the contract with all the musicians and the Spanish people.
