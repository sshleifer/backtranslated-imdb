You have seen this at the Chicago Film Festival - avoid it at all costs if you have no trouble sleeping. It's a pretentious movie - it opens with a minor quote from "Hiroshima mon amour" and everything is down there. Roommaking - Imagine a child trying to imitate Wong Kar Wai. The story line - Smokey Robinson and the miracles "The love I saw in you was just a move" extended from 3 minutes to over 2 hours but full of rehearsal. For headache, this film is located with the banks in the Methodist church that my father dragged me when I was a child. I want 2 hours of my life to be reimbursed. Julian Hernandez's promoter pretended commenting on the film was "controversial" - this is true only for the narcotic effect of the film.
