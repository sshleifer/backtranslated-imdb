Where did you start with a movie so bad as this one? <br /> <br /> Mention the wrong hero's casting? Action above? The terrible script? <br /> <br /> Just tell everyone who pays money to see a movie as poor as it needs their head look. I know I do. I respect the poor who saw it with a word from the magicians like Empire (usually a bad sign if a preview copy is not available for the quality film). However, cinemas should start thinking about reimbursement if the customer is not satisfied with the finished product. I went three days after I opened up with two other partners. The only other person in the cinema was one on his own. And that was cheap at night. Neither the advertising campaign failed in a dilemma, nor did the word spread through most of the country just what is a stinker this is. Not since Avengers (1998) I felt so briefly changed from watching a movie. If a partner meets this on the video in a few months, make sure he pays you the electricity bill while you see it. Country Fitzgerald deserves a prize not to crack - or to walk off the set; Keith Allen retains a certain dignity in the midst of the cinema massacre; Barry Foster should have been arrested on stage for his performance, Rhys Ifans makes his career without favors after Notting Hill's success, and only Dani Behr is half-liked as a busty secretary. <br /> <br /> she was accustomed to the Word, the expectations of viewers to act as actors were supposed to be small enough to get started. Production values ​​are not bad taking into account the obviously limited budget, but the scenario is atrocious. If you want to hear a bunch of inappropriate characters say "Fak!" for a few hours then this should be right on your street otherwise the bargepoles needed. <br /> <br />
