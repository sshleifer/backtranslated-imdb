I'm a big fan of the real crime genre, but I could not stand by this vain piece. It was almost as if Dahmer was erotic, up to the pornographic soundtrack. It has not been seen what Dahmer has done, no exploration of his victims. Nothing but "Look at how creepy this guy is." And I have to give so much to filmmakers - their Dahmer is the strangest thing that the screen ever disturbs.
