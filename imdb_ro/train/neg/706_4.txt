The story and the show were good, but it was very depressing and I hate depressing movies. Ri'Chard is great. He really put a top show, and the girl who played his sister was really wonderful and gorgeous. Seriously, I thought it was Carmen Electra until I saw the IMDb profile. I can not say anything wrong about Peter Galleghar. It's one of my favorite actors. I like Anne Rice. I'm currently reading Vampire Chronicles, but I'm glad I saw the movie before reading the book. This is a bit too "real" for me. I prefer Lestat's and Louis's preferences for slaving battles. Eartha Kitt was so creepy after her character did what she did The film was destroyed for me; I could not wait to see the rest of the show. (I'm sorry for the ambiguity, but I do not want to give anything) Sorry, it's not just my show guy.
