Servant: Honey, here are the eggs you ordered. Honey, like a bee, do you understand? This is called unnecessary preheating. <br /> <br /> Edward Basket: Huh? (On the way) Basket: Here's your doll, little girl. You really should not be so careless about your things. Girl: Yes, anything. Crash! Boom! Whoosh! Crow ?? Cos: I think something bad is about to happen. <br /> <br /> (Later) Basket: Mmmm. Vicodin! What the?? ? (Open lessons.) Wow! My face scriptures have really improved. And look, the missing daughter looked like a doll girl, accidentally I was kind of responsible for being killed somehow. And she has a hair. I wonder, should I torture myself and find it? Let's see what my friends say in the premises. <br /> <br /> Male male policeman: HAHAHA. Willow is a funny name. Cos: I think something bad is about to happen. (On the island) Basket: What's in the bag? Ahhh. <br /> <br /> Christmas tree name: She is not her daughter. <br /> <br /> (In the tavern) Basket: Can you legalize? Big-boned, tree-named tavern wench: Huh? Cart: (destroys a bee). Everything is alright. Sensual cute, promising actress, who played a fresh tavern job: It's good. However, honey is not a plant. (Green) Willow: Oh, yes, and I forgot, you are my father, Conan, er, I mean Rowen. (Yawns.) I could stay and have a life with you. But I did not. I wanted to be a princess of the hive. I do not mind. (Down, wakes up, eyes open to anime proportions). Mwah, kiss-kiss. I love you! What have we talked about? Cart: Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Willow: Edward. Smell. Blink. Why. You. You. Scream. La. Me? Is that because I linked your Vicodin? Smell. Snore. What have we talked about? Shopping Cart: I think something bad is about to happen. Willow: My lips are hurting. (In the school room) Rose: What is man? Unsupported twins, unison: phallic symbol, fake symbol. Rose: Echo? Echo? Shopping Cart: Step away from the bike. Rose: And I'm good twins. Cart: I think something bad is about to happen. <br /> </ b> (La stupi) Cart: Hmmm. Hallo? Ow, ow, ow, it bothers you. Old ugly bear. Snore. (At Regina Bee's Mansion) Sister Summersisle: You have so much potential. What are you doing here? Was not that Cher stud before Moonstruck? (Licks bucks.) Basket: I was about to ask you the same thing. Where's the girl? Sister Summersisle: How are you doing? Let's talk about the significance of my surpluses. Shopping Cart: Look at it for that truck that is heading towards us! AAAAAA! Oh. Does not matter. Damn it! (Another pill.) Mmmm. Thorazine. <br /> <br /> (Returning to the tavern) Great and messy tavern: I tried hunting singers, Jenny Craig, South Beech, and I got up since last year. <br /> <br /> A tree named crone: HAHAHA. All the better to fry that cop, my dear. <br /> <br /> Wench with a large crust: In total. Basket: It was the last straw to break the back case! Take this, wench! (Slugs her.) (Edward Basket is mysteriously attacked behind) Voluntary tavern wench: EEEE! Get out of it! Leave the island already and take me with you! Do I have to deal with you or why? Get out of it, I say! EEEE! Shopping Cart: Take this, wench! (Curajoasa strikes her in front, her eyes spinning in the head and become cartoon Xs.) Voluptuous wench: Snore ?? (To Nicolas Cage's Cake) Ellen Burstyn: And who can forget the side where Basket's cell phone rings in the middle of the costume scene and then the call gets abandoned. It's like a wireless ad: Help me! Can you hear me now? Hahaha. Kate Beahan: And do you remember when we produced the bullets we linked to the Basket? She looked so surprised. You should be more careful with your stuff, Nick. Hahaha. And your movie choices. <br /> <br /> All: Drona must die! Shopping Cart: (screaming) Oh, yes, you? Well, the roast with me will not help you mess! Aaah. My legs! Honey, (honey, take it?) He put down his torch and left the Warehouse. Honey! The bear bear says he does not play matches. Hahaha. What the??? Look at that truck with trucks! Ahh! Oh. God, these flashbacks from my drug testing phase of the seventies are getting old! Where's my heroin? Ouch. Ouch. My watch is not fireproof. Ouch. I think something bad will happen. Can you hear me now? I'm ready for my approach. Damn it! (Six months later) Wench voluptuous in everyday clothing: I told him that everyday case to take me with him. <br /> <br /> Cute innocent young man: I like to help people. /> Voluptual wench: Then get me out of my sequel contract! I think something bad will happen. Eeee!
