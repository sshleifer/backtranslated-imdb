America needs the best possible man to win the "game", so who does it hire? A Gymnast (Brother Oh!) Played by Kurt Thomas, who has the skills to win in a game involving the ninja, a mad village and Richard Norton, about which Kurt Thomas tells him to "keep his hardware in pants". (His exact words) I missed this in the theater and it is a good reason for I probably would have been kicked out because of the laughter I broke at regular intervals. The first thing that went through my mind was how blades are these ninjas if a gymnast can kick her butt. Kurt Thomas is just like 5 foot 4 and he hardly strikes one as "Best Man for the Job" As to the actor talent by Kurt Thomas, well if you can not say something nice ... With all the seriousness , although one has to wonder how much cocaine has been used to offer such a bad idea. Just the decision to make Tara Reid as a scientist get up here. For 18 years, however, he was the title of the worst film I've ever seen. Not to say that I have not found this invaluable, I laughed so hard that I almost suffocated. Twice. Only in the 1980s could a film with such a bad idea be made. Although for the record is the only film ever having a hero so late, he can not even draw a stung sword from the ground. This is the greatest action movie ever made and one of the most chaotic. <br /> <br /> * from 4- (Bad)
