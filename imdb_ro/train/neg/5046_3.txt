The lethargic direction ruins an otherwise convincing epic story that sees Zhang Ziyi awesome as a woman who joins an extremist group in China since 1928 just before the Japanese invasion of Manchuria and reunites with a former who now works for Japan. Each bit of drama and motion before the story is aspired to the director's somnambulistic style of director Ye Lou. The characters are still looking at each other for a few minutes, without saying anything, the handhelds always keep on the faces that show endless reactions much longer than they need, while repeating the same reaction is triple redundancy. We do not know anything about the characters, as the story begins and they are given little new information as the story progresses, just silence and static photos of non-speaking lovers, who interact with silent dances but have no seemingly emotional intimacy. A very inductive sleeping film.
