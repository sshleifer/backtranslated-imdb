Tatie Danielle is an aging old lady who tortures her loving and stunning family of anger. There is a bit of a subtext that might be about the colonial past of France, but in large part only Danielle does those things (such as the deliberate abandonment of a small child in a park) that soon will have a man to Take your teeth with broken fingers. Unfortunately, this is not happening here. It looks good and the action is good and there is nothing really wrong about the concept, but it's just so terrible. God, this movie loves oneself. Too bad he's not as smart or fun as he thinks he is. The only impulse in the show - apology, film - comes from Danielle becoming more nasty and nastier, and the only surprise comes from pursuing the increasingly unlikely ways it does. That's right: just like in a sitcom, which is what it is, with the bonus "added" by delusions of grandeur and a 110-minute running time.
