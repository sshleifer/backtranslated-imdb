The typical action movie: a good policeman is embroiled in a mess of crooked policemen and Japanese gangsters. The good result has decent performances, some transient moments of invasion and a few correct action sequences - plus a chance to check out the wonderful Danielle Harris - who makes most of her perpetual typecasting as a teen rebel daughter. <br /> <br /> ** from ****.
