It seems that anyone can make a movie nowadays. It's all you need is a camera, a group of people to be your distribution and crew, a script, and a bit of money and Walla you have a movie. The problem is that talent is not always a part of this equation, and often these low-budget films prove to be good. Video store shelves are filled with these so-called movies. These are not even guilty pleasures, they are just a waste of celluloid that are better forgotten. Troma Entertainment is known for cinematography, but most of its films are film gold. However, some of the movies they have left have nothing to do with doing, and some, such as "Nightmare Weekend," deserve no form of release at all. <br /> <br /> Pro: The pouring members do everything they can with bad stuff. The unintentional ear. Moves at a good pace (should be 81 minutes). Cons: great writing, which includes a confused dialogue and countless plot holes. Weak, especially the night scenes and the end, which you can not give at all. Do not make a lizzy sense. Very marked. Cheap and very dated effects. The total lack of character development and you will not care about anyone. It should be a horror film, but it is devoid of that area and it is by no means frightening. Nothing interesting or interesting happens. Loaded with unnecessary filling. Final thoughts: I never expected to be a forgotten jewel, but I never imagined it would be so bad. I do not know if it's the worst movie ever made, but it's a clear competitor. Troma should have let this film rot rather than give it a release. It does not make the same mistake I made and let your curiosity get you the best. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/5
