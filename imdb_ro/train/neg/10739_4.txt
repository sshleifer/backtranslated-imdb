"Iedereen Beroemd" has everything we can expect from a movie direct to the movie. It's the story about a man who thinks his daughter could be a star. The only thing he needs is to bring her on stage, surrounded by cameras and reporters. A simple plan for kidnapping and making blackmail. The problem with the film is not the basic plot but the way it's done. Everything should be fun, but it is not. It is banal and clumsy, the characters are superficial, and the final sequence is totally without climax or emotion. The last sequence is probably the only scene you like to laugh at, but only how pathetic the whole configuration is.
