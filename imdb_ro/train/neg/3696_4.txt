Normally I would have given a movie 6. It's a very important theme and it does it relatively well - despite Katie Wright, which is an accomplishment in itself. I have no idea if she was actually being trained to play this character as such or is naturally irritating, but she did a great job of making it impossible to take care of Lexi. It has no other dimension than confused, helpless, and devoid of who she is and how good she is at whimpering. I can understand how a young woman who blames her friend's loss and whose eating disorder spirals out of control would be distracted, scared and in pain. However, Wright's entire performance is based on unremitting and moving straits, the rest being weeping. I could not feel that this problem of a particular girl was not caused not by the demon that is Bulimia, but by the fact that it does not have a backbone. I very much doubt that it is the purpose of the film.
