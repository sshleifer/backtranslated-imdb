I just saw this horrible thing on TV. Needless to say, it's one of those movies you're watching just to see how much worse it can get. Frankly, I do not know how far the bar can be. <br /> <br /> Characters are composed of one type of blade stereo after another, and the obvious attempt to create another "Bad News Bears" is embarrassing to say the least. <br /> <br /> I have seen some turkeys appreciated during my time, but there is no reason to list any of them, since this is "Numero Uno". Let me tell you that, I saw the movie Vanilla Ice, because it was so bad it was funny. This ... this ... is not that good.
