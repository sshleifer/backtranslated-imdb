Although he rightly warned I was actually watching this movie. In part because I usually give each film a break, and because I thought a single movie could not be that bad. I am corrected. Neither George Kennedy, Barry Bostwick, or Ben Stein could save this dick from diving as a ton of bricks. Only once, during this humor, I left the parody of a doll. Namely during the scene, Simon says. The other jokes are either bad or simply inoperative. And some of them actually see it coming a mile away. This movie just did not get what it takes to be a good parody like Airplane! (I + II), Gun Naked (I + II + III) or Scary Movie. They all had A. Funny Gangs, B. a good dialogue and the most important of all memorable quotes. Men in white have D. None of the above. To call this bad movie would be a gross overvaluation. WARNING THIS MOMENT CAN NOT! CONSIDER YOURSELF!
