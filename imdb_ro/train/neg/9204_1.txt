I've seen this movie several times, (and I've read the book on which the film is based) and every time I see it, I just want to spit on all four. The fact that they do not realize that Tom Hank's character is spinning in the character of D & D (oops M & M: :) ("Oh, he just acts in character") outside of the gaming session. This and the fact that, after three months of therapy, we will destroy all this and feed ourselves with delusion! This kind of people are what give RPGs a bad name. Also, the ballad love corny, and the music made by the "cat on the piano" and "stop us if we become too annoying" is almost enough to fix your teeth!
