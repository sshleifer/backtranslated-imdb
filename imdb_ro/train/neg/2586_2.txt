Let's cut it down: this movie is softcore pornography marketed for the masses under the name of a studio that is pounded in the last penny in the American Chest. Period. The whole plot (and that should not mean that there is a lot to go around) serves as a vehicle to show the public more tits and sex scenes. <br /> <br /> If you are a Tween guy and you are too squeamish to buy real porn, then this is the movie for you. Otherwise, the movie does not have much to offer. The actor is sub-par, the character's development is virtually non-existent, and the story is a nonsense nudity, drinking binge and jokes (none of them is particularly memorable). Go buy a real porn if that's what you want to see, and if not, go see a good movie. Animal House, Kids or even the original American Pie are all excellent cinematic works, all of which contain heavy alcohol and nudity. <br /> <br /> "It's not how much you use it"
