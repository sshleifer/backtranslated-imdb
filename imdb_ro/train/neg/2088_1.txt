What a terrible show. Science fiction fans seem to see something more, regardless of quality. I am shocked that something exceptional, like Firefly, takes a season, while garbage, such as the Battlestar Galactica remake, gives birth to a spin. This spin is pitiful in every aspect of the show. The act is minor and uninspired. Characters are cardboard clusters for everything that has ever been in a serious Sci-Fi series. The story is bad. Dialogue is worse than a first-time digging. The direction is unclear and the sets are terrible. Capricorn is a waste of film, a waste of time and a loss of effort. This is a spin that should never have been done.
