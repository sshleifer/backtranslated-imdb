- Bad Stuff: This movie is real shit. Bad stunts for one thing, they seemed so fake that I thought it was "Twilight Zone". Flashbacks are almost useless. A part of the movie that he thinks will take his anger on a window will make his life better. I want to know the casting director and if it was great, because acting, even from adults, was horrible. A kiss scene in this movie was even sucked. This movie killed the book. The book was great. I do not recommend this movie very much. Not even for educational purposes. <br /> <br /> - Good thing: I do not know what I can really say. There are some parts of suspense that make you go, but they are quickly shot by stunt and action work. <br /> <br /> - My verdict: Do not look.
