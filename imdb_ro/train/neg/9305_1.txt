I and a friend rented this movie because it sounded really good. But I was wrong. The first of those who act .... wow ... the act was the worst, the effects were very bad, also seemed like a movie made by a college child. The plot was pretty good, but it was done. The thing that destroyed most of the movies was the actors. The main guy was the worst actor ever ... it's a shame I really call him an actor ... The only good thing about this movie was so bad it was funny ... so if you want a good laugh ... but otherwise than ... stay away from it. I usually love the list of movies and more, but that ... I do not know how it was passed to put it right on the video ... this is the worst I've seen ... and I've seen some bad the.
