When this piece was first presented by the BBC over 30 years ago, it would have been something quite different for the time. So some people would have found it rather scary and might have been impressed by the special effects? Looking at playing this day and age does not seem to be all scary more, even the special effects can leave much to be desired. Would a train really be allowed to pass through a RED LIGHT in a dark tunnel? I do not think ...... but if you watch this game again, you will notice that the first train entering the tunnel is heading directly through RED LIGHT! (maybe it was during the dickens)? You will also notice that the path that leads down to the Signal Box is very steep and in a bad state. Of course there would have been a series of steps that would be suitable for the Signalman to climb up or down in the cut. (I can not help but notice that) <br /> <br /> I will not give up the action, both Denholm Elliott (signalman) and Bernard Lloyd (the traveler) gave wonderful performances. > <br /> I'm not sure what's going on ...... I mean, was the traveler the ghost or what ??? Does anyone fully understand this fairly confused story ??? (maybe I'm the only one who does not) <br /> <br /> To sum up ..... <br /> <br /> The song has a wonderful atmosphere, character. It suffers from not being so frightening these days, and if not very confused in places, and has some unusual signage practices .... Thank you for reading my review.
