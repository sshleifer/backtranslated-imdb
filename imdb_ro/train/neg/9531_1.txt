This is an atrocious movie. Two young demented women seduce and torture a middle-aged man. It's not too much to give up a plot or a "spoiler". I would just say that the end is almost the most absurd part of the film. Most of the film implies that Locke and Camp are reluctantly harassing, still smiling mentally at the room. Add to it a soundtrack that repeats itself again and again, including a song about the "old old father" that suggests an incestuous quality the viewer never sees. Music is at first annoying, then ends up subjecting the viewer to worse torture than the one on the screen. The theme here is that of the youth, amok, understood as a reaction to the 1960s, but made with little imagination or style. Avoid it!
