A lot is put in a suggestion of Teen Ape. When she wakes up, she is considerably more determined (the plays played by Debbie Rochon in this sequel) and for revenge on those who have done it wrong. As the subtitle and art of boxing assumes that it really is a take-off of the films "Kill Bill", but this is Chris Seaver's film, it is a poor incompetent satire (and I use the last extremely weak term) that I would like to say that it is better than the first movie but the truth is said that I was so impossible to drink on my ass when I saw the previous movie that I can not even hope to compare the two at this time. But I have to enjoy it since I bought the sequel (see when I'm immersed, I like it, for lack of a better word, complete and complete films) There are a few laughs moments (very few) but I remember Bonejack being more fun, however. Well, at least over an hour, it's over the quick power for what it deserves. <br /> <br /> My class: D + <br /> <br /> DVD Extract: Audio comment by director Chris Seaver, actress Debbie Rochon and Lbp band; Second comment by Seaver; 31 minutes Making features; Lloyd Kaufman is a 6-minute tribute to low-budget photos; Fake 2 minutes of commercial syrup; photo gallery; Trailer promo; and trailers for: "Mulva", "Quest for Egg Salad", "Fialthy McNasty" 1, 2, and 3; "Feral Man", "Bonesetter", "Midnight Skater", "Demon Summer" and "Splatter Rampage wrestling "
