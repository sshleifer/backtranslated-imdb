I gave this film a very good chance and betrayed it. This is a little bit more than a black and white excuse to keep audiences in the audience, even if the selfish Bogdanavich (who did better with Targets) gets "extraordinary performance" of a ton of hams in their debut. A lot of teenage sexual clich√©s came out of this movie, such as Making the teacher's wife, Impotence, Making an ugly prostitute (which is very strangely shot and splinters things in a complete place, not that things really went anywhere). I suppose this movie should be funny because of all the sexual nonsense for me was just annoying. I was really much more distracted by cleaning my fingers than seeing this mess.
