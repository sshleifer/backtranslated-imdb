I bought this movie on DVD to get an episode of the Mystery 3000 Science Theater. Luckily, Mike, Crow and Tom Servo are being watched because the movie itself is not. Although there is a plot, a story can be followed and some actors who can act, there is nothing. The film was so boring that I firmly confirmed that I would never follow her again without Tom, Crow and Mike. As summarized above, however, it was better than the movie presented in the previous MST3K episode; Mitchell.
