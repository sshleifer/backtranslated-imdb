DeNiro is a master ... one of my favorites. And I like BUN sports videos (not in baseball so much, but hey, his sports movies, right?) I was expecting much more for this movie. I do not like it very much, it's really good like a starred star. "Barkin's role, for me, was fine, she was a good actress, but she did not seem to have a role in this role. hurry up the scenes, and then shoot a little in places It seemed to me that it seemed so uneven! Given the distribution and the plot, it could have been a lot better.We rated it "4", and I was generous ~ Tough with numbers!
