Thank you for killing the franchise with this turkey, John Carpenter and Tommy Lee Wallace. This movie sucks on so many levels is pathetic. The first VAMPIRES was fun, but this budget cutback makes me smoke. Jon Bon Jovi (Kevin Bacon) moves around Mexico with a surfboard that houses a hidden compartment, Banderas's Guitar Case in DESPERADO. She has some torturing hunters along the way (including a frightened infected feminine girl who takes the pills to not turn into a vampire) and have decided to stop a female vampire who has no backstory, less about her search (to walk in the sunlight by striding the Black Cross and doing a ritual to allow him to do so). If you've seen the first VAMPIRES, you've already seen this and done much better. John Carpenter has been responsible for many bad movies lately. Honestly, I think he passed his first and incapable of making another classic horror. The only decent film he made from THEY LIVE (1987) is VAMPIRES. Everything else is a complete carp, to incredibly cheap, looking and retarded GHOSTS OF MARS ... and now this waste of celluloid. Where are they bigger, such as ASSAULT on PRECINCT 13, HALLOWEEN (1), ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK and THE THING? Carpenter crony Wallace proves he can not write his way out of a paper bag with his paper - the third scenario full of stunts, moans and recycled gags from the original. Did I say I hate any character in the movie? There is only one memorable character in the whole movie. How does that happen? The movie has nothing to recommend. Even the presentation of the DVD is not good; the menu seems terrible. By comparison, JASON X: "WEEK 13 IN SPACE" was a masterpiece. Now, this is how you do a sequel and reload a franchise, ladies and germs, as well as creating an interesting DVD menu.
