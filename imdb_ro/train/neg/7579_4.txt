The name "cult" is often given to films that are still being watched or marketed in home cinema format, more than a generation after they were first released. Superchick, which was first launched in 1973, now falls into this category. Its cult status is largely due to the continuing interest in those women who consider it a feminist film early and efficient. In spite of Superwoman, Superchick is not a cartoon character, but a very competent young woman who works as an airborne stewardess - a career option that in the 1970s was regarded as one of the most full of charm open to any girl and also allowing him to emulate the traditional matelot who has a wife in each port. Since she has the black belt status in karate, she is able to make it quite clear that she is very pleased with her bachelor existence and is not in any way worried about any of her extended suits of male admirers. This film is a comedy situation that avoids the general appeal much shorter, lived by an absolute farce. His appeal to females is also highlighted by a climax in which our heroine uses karate skills to avoid a hijacking and save all other passengers on her plane from a potentially unpleasant fate. To make sure that this film will attract both men and their partners, the director has wisely assured that it is sprinkled with eye candy. Superchick can be enjoyed by those who are not too critical and who want a very easy comedy easy to watch that they will soon forget after watching. It is so forgetful that it will probably be as pleasant as it will be followed again in a year; in spite of his age, may retain his status as a worshiper for some time. However, dialogue and action would make it difficult to give this film a rating of more than 4/10.
