I'm generous offering this 2 star movie. the line about "you've ever seen the wizard of oz" was the best part for me! with a terrible writing that acts as it's shown in this movie, no wonder that so many are being screened by reality TV shows. do a favor and get out of the house and hit a basic baseball game, you'll be glad you did!
