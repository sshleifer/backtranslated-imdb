Dakota (1988) was another beginner Lou Diamond Phillips with the vehicle. This film is similar to the later Harley movie. There are some differences, but both are the same. I do not know what was the first time. I think it will remain one of the mysteries of life. But both are disturbed "children" who are trying to come back there. Instead of bikes, it involves horses. In principle, they are the same movie and they are as bad as the hell. If you are serious L.D.P. then I recommend you watch both of them. You will get some extreme distortions and posture from L.D.P. if you're playing, go then. <br /> <br /> Not recommended, except for L.D.P. fans !!!
