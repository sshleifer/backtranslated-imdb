It was a film agonizingly bad. It will eat your heart while you watch it. I beg you: do not look at this movie! You will be hated to lose 1.5 hours of your life! It's not like some movies are so bad you can watch them and enjoy ... this movie is boring ... it's nothing as boring as this movie. You will hate after watching this movie to the end. And you will hate that you have not listened to me. I hate myself. I tortured myself and looked at the film all the way. Now, excuse me, I'll shoot. I've seen everything. Please. Read this carefully. Do not watch this movie. Please!
