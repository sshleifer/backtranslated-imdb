I knew I was going to watch a low-budget movie, but I expected much more from an Alex Cox movie. The action of the two leading men was terrible, especially the white guy. The girl would have won an Oscar compared to the two. This movie was full of what I think there would be jokes for people in the movie industry and a few other jokes I actually understood and made me laugh out loud, which is rare. Without these moments of laugh-out-hard I would have given this movie 2/10. What happened to Alex Cox, who made all the classics of the 80's? <br /> <br /> SPOILER: <br /> <br /> There were a few questions I had after the movie was over. Why did the Mexican guy come to the other man's house at first? What did his daughter say he received 100 people fired from his last job? Why did she break her own things when she was mad at him? I think I should have gone to the movie after the movie, but I did not want to get up at 10:00.
