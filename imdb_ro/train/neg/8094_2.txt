As someone who reads the novel and saw the movie, I have another way to consider why the movie was such a flop. First, any comparison between the novel and the film is purely superficial. There are two different animals. The novel is probably destined as a satire, but it turns out to be a cross between tragedy and polemics. Any comic elements, such as those that later formed the stylistic basis of the movie version, are only incidental to the cynical uniformity. And as the author's whimsical white suit to trick you into thinking that there is another Mark Twain, think again. A more appropriate literary precedent would be Ambrose Bierce's specter in a hat and peak tails. Tom Wolfe is equal to clowns and hackers, more celebrity than the author, always looking for a new piece for his self-absorbed mill. <br /> <br /> It is no wonder, therefore, that the excellent production skills and the direction he has made in making the film have been condemned from the start. Unlike the true satire, which translates very well into the film, the polemic is not based on universal observations accessible to a certain form or another of human behavior, but in a unique attack on certain persons - men's real or fictitious steps - somehow won the wrath of the writer. Every effort to create a successful story story or narrative from such a beginning must have a clean start without the influence or interference of the writer. Having said that, I have a casting mistake. Not only do incompetents such as Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith fail to measure, but those true talents like Tom Hanks, F. Murray Abraham and Morgan Freeman are either wasted or given roles that are just caricatures. <br /> <br /> There are enough up-to-date materials here for a really great film satire, but it does not even come close.
