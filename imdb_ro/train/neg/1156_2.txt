Looking at The Tenants was an exciting experience for me. It's the first movie I've ever seen where I moved to speed through parts of (non) action - and I can normally watch any turgid action movie in the Serbo-Croatian indie and find them fascinating. /> Tenants are frustrated by lazy and over-orchestrated. One of the main issues of the scenario is that there is a bit realistic character dialogue, apart from the pieces where the characters "collide" in a very structured frame (to do this, the film had to feel more conceptual,). This leads to a lack of realistic character development; everyone seems to be two-dimensional. Worse for this is the character of Bill Spear, known as Snoop Dogg. I found my characterization very awkward and very inappropriate. At one point, I even stopped the film because I was annoyed by the aggressive, violent and monotonous delivery of the character, the lack of any other personality layer apart from that of the "on" reactionary switch (which is really predictable after a while ) and so I desperately wanted to have some redeeming qualities. However, a reason for this jar might be the nebulous film of the movie (supposedly 70 years old, feels and seems earlier noughties). Had he been better fixed in the 1970s, his character would have seemed easier to understand. The light of the film was also inconvenient. In the end, the soundtrack tries to provide a certain atmosphere with stones, jazz-infused, which just did not come out, largely because the set was too bright. The tenants, for me, are an incredible movie. He does not describe real people and does not propose any interesting way to think about race, identity, or the life of a writer, be it white or black. Strangely, I came out with the feeling that this project needed David Lynch; his strange, clastophobic and obsessive appearance would have lifted both the actors and the script into something remarkable.
