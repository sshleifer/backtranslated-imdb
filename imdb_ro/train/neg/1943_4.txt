What useless! This began with an intriguing mystery and interesting characters. Of course, he moved to the speed of a snail, but I was caught and kept forgotten. David Morrissey is always good and Suranne Jones was a good ruler. Muslim aspects were very interesting. We were tantalized with possible terrorist ties. But Morrissey's character was killed and all the air left the ball. The last episode was boring, boring, boring. Everything turned out to be very small beer, and it was incredibly weak. Five hours of my life for that? My advice: Look at the dry paint instead.
