This film showed more racist hatred for Jews than David Mamet than I ever met in an American film. The shields are so big that my ability to continue watching has died. I was so disappointed by Joe that Mantegna called for a bunch of men sitting in a New York City Jewish center that cleared arms, heroes that prevailed in common sense, and I stopped. I am deeply disturbed by the idea that the Jews are not American and "different". I suggest that Mr. Mameth is one of the causes of hatred, not the healer of the same.
