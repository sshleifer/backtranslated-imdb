Okay, we rented this movie because of the director ... he made some interesting films in the past (if you did not see Waxork lacking a fun walk). Anyway, I had doubts about this movie from the beginning, but I decided to suck it and take a look. It's bad. Very bad. If you have not seen the movie and you do not mind spoilers read before. First, the old saying "You can not judge a book by covering it" applies here. The box for this movement seems to indicate that Jill is a long-haired, foxhole fox with highlight. The back of the box has a cool picture of red leather Jill and some other pictures. The description makes you want to rent the movie because it is good sounds. Start watching her and suddenly find out that the movie is (inexplicable) in 1977. Jill is a total dog that is not the girl on the cover. The movie is not as predictable as you thought ... and that's not a good thing. Characters make so many stupid things without any motivation ... it's embarrassing to look. Ten minutes before the end of the movie, Dolph and another lady have sex without reason. Also, what was the purpose of killing Dolph the other cold-blooded lady who had helped him. Anthony Hickox, the director should have seen a stinker when he read the script. If she had been placed in the underworld of the new millennium and transformed the half-intelligent characters, it would have been decent. Putting it in the '70s makes no sense and has nothing to do with the story. Avoid it!
