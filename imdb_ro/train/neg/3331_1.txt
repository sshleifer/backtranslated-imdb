Dance around three beautiful California women who cover some festivals (or something). All hotels are reserved, so they have to spend the night in an old creepy house. What I do not know is that there is a creepy inhabitant who likes to kill ... Yawn. Bored, useless, absolutely stupid "horror movie". Bach and his two friends are certainly beautiful, but the movie itself is boring. Bach and her friends are not actresses - their faces are bare to the end. The final "revelation" is predictable by laughter and there is no blood or gore to keep you interested in the road. There is free female nudity, but this is not enough to save this. Bored, useless and unknown (for good reason). 1 all the way.
