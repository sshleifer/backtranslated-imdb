Boogyman's return is a terrible movie that does not play as a movie, it plays like an episode of a TV sitcom when it comes back to older episodes. Boogyman's return is just a clip show. Mutch's film is constant and annoying flashbacks from the first movie. Again and again the same movie. How boring this is. The film is really about a psychic woman who has visions of the first film. I saw the first movie I do not want to see the same scenes again and again and I do not know who they are. The whole movie seems to have been done quickly to make a few dollars and that's it.
