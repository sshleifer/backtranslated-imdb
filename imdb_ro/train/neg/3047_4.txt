I have seen this movie many times in the late 1960s / early 1970s, whenever she grew up as a reindeer with rabbies every November-December as a kid's matin√©e show on Saturday. It has always been a rigid competition for CHRISTMAS WHO ARE NOT (Oops - Can I say "Christmas"?), Perhaps the biggest, most iconic Christmas movie of all time. But this is another review. At the time, I was surprised that the temptations on the screen of SANTA CLAUS were almost "pink and white," so much changed the color of fingerprints torn with the sprocket. The movie is a bit creepy! Then I thought - and still do, actually. I was extremely entertained then, as I am still! It's funny in a kind of "elf-turn". By the way, the image quality looks much better on the DVD I had now than in the theater, around 1969-74. If you expect, perhaps, "RANKIN - If you want FELLINI Christmas - read on ... By nature, doubling foreign movies (the original version here was in Spanish) makes them seem" surrealist. "This adds to the inherent strangeness of the movie and is quite terrifying that a "bad demon" (as described in the original American trailer) spends the entire movie trying to turn decadent children into a "bad" boy who wants to have parents for Christmas - all of a sudden, a "family port" comes out of gigantic "Christmas gifts" until he realizes that he has only a dreamy dream! If you are a stoner, save your stash - this movie will make you think you are hallucinating ... no drugs!
