I'm not a big fan of Freddy Krueger, but that does not mean I do not like Robert Englund and other Nightmare films on Elm Street. I think Robert is a very good actor. Nobody plays Freddy Krueger better than he does. But no crime Robert, this movie sucked.The action is terrible, the plot is very weak, and Freddy Krueger is the only part of the cast that really deserves to forget. Sometimes the sequels can be better than the first such as Friday, the franchise (I thought the remake was the best of the series.) But that's not one of those movies. The original was good, the second in my opinion was better, the third was ok but I did not see the others. No matter what you do, do not make the same mistake that I made by looking at this madness.
