The Pallbearer is a disappointment and sometimes extremely boring with a love story that simply does not work partially with the casting of Gwyneth Paltrow (Julie). Gwyneth Paltrow walks through the entire movie with a confused look on her face and it's hard to tell him what David Schwimmer really sees in her. However, The Pallbearer is sometimes funny especially for the church scene and group scenes with his friends are a laugh, but that's practical. Look at The Pallbearer just for those scenes and fast ahead with the rest. Believe me, you do not lose too much.
