First a technical review. The script is so slow, it's really a 25-minute story blowing up to 1 hour and 40 minutes. The dialogue is so flat and really one-dimensional. "The actors" are pathetic, they seem to have really scooted the classmates to read a few lines from an idiot council. As for the whole "point" of the story, namely "war is bad" (oh, there is a shock!) It really is nonexistent. Without taking the "shock" and getting extraordinary advertising, "no one was talking about this movie. It's so bad that it bothers me to think what better things could be used for the money you used to believe in. Believe me I saw some movies bad "of the Emperor's clothes," but the only thing I can say to them is at least that they were well shot and well done, while the camera went down in two scenes in this sense! Read all the other reviews - avoid at all costs and do not talk about it.
