The Seventh Sign has an opening hook because the Israeli defense force is in a terrorist base. This is the type of hook that is needed when writing a script, attracts the reader / audience and the introduction of David Bannon as he rents a room from Abby and Russell Quinnn, telegrams that he is a man who is not he says it is. However, after the big opening stage, I found the rest of the film confused and not engaging in a large number of galleries, and it does not differ from the other supernatural thrillers I have seen
