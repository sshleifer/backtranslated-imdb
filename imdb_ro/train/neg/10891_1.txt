I saw the trailer on this movie and it looked great, so I went out and bought it. What a mistake, action is a nuisance, the special effects (if you can call it), it looks like something that would not miss the place in a school. Some characters are so bad in this movie, you will have fun in the minute they are on the screen, which, unfortunately, is very common. As for a story, look at it. This is a warning, you do not waste any money on this movie has to be one of the worst things I've ever seen. If, for some reason, you like this movie watching Troll 2, you'll probably also enjoy that as well.
