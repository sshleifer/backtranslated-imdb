This horror movie is actually one of Renny Harlin's best. Story is a common thing, but the atmosphere is what makes it come alive; in fact, the ghost story is almost a later idea. The real horror comes from the prison itself, and Renny H. does not spare any detail in showing us how bad the conditions are inside that old hole that sneaks, infected with rats (and with a sadic guard!) Viggo Mortensen is excellent as usual in the lead role, supported by very authentic prisoners (there are no nice boys in this cast.) Horror fans should check this.
