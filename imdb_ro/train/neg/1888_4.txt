This film reminds me of "Irr√©versible (2002)", another art film with a violent and radical approach to human nature. I did not like the movie, but I can not say it's a bad movie, it's just special. I also remember Camping Cosmos (1996), where a bunch of small class figures live in a seaside camp in Belgium. The same description of the people who live together, along with their will and all the confrontation with characters that do not fit together. I also thought of the books of the French writer Emile Zola, who was the writer of the naturalist style. I did not like the movie and I also do not like people who are in it. They all seem so vulgar without a good taste. They may ask why they live, all seem to be on this planet a member of a great feud, forced to live against their will. Or you could say, the hell is in this world.
