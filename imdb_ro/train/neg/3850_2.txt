I saw this movie at SXSW with the director in attendance. Few have gone out, and the audience barely managed to get even polite applause. Of the 60 or 70 films I've seen at this festival, Frownland is one of the worst. At 106 minutes it is at least 95 minutes too long. You will notice that attempts to communicate, in real-time, of the main character have failed and highlighted. The same grimaces, mouth movements, repetitive repetitive and repetitive repetitive and repetitive words and syllables, again and again - WE HAVE THE POINT. A site actually compares this work with Mike Leigh early. What medications should you do to make this statement? Considering that Frownland is a Captain Beefheart song, maybe you should enjoy the trout car replica on a heavy rotation to appreciate this movie. Incredibly, she won the jury prize at the festival. You can bet that he has not won a prize for the audience.
