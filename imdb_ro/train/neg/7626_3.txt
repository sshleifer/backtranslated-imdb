After I heard raves about this movie for years, I finally decided to rent and watch. Let me start by saying that I'm glad the rental was free of charge from the local library. This movement was slow, boring, unrealistic, and the plot made no sense. After two hours, I was ready to destroy that Texas city and put the group of those characters out of their misery. I realize the taste is subjective, but believe me, I just do not understand all the hype I've heard about this movie. Dallas gave a good detail of Texas life as well as this movie. Rent it only if you want to understand how movie studios can pay enough money for reviewers to convince the public that a bad movie is good.
