Randolph Scott leaves the US for the greener pastures of British Columbia in Canada. He wants to start a cattle farm with partner Bill Williams and cook Lee Tung Foo. He shoots his small flock on a tax bridge built by Victor Jory. Later, Jory is ruining his cattle, and Williams is losing his left arm during the fracture. From 1945 to 1962, when he retired, Randolph Scott made a series of good Westerns for adults, some of whom considered them to be true classics. Unfortunately, the Cariboo Route will never be listed among its best vestiges. <br /> <br /> It's more like the material that Roy Rogers or Gene Autry might use. The story is sometimes stupid. Williams, who went along with Scott, wanted to take a look at gold because it was a big strike at the time. He does not blame the rust, blaming Scott for persuading him to make the trip for the loss of his arm. <br /> <br /> There is also a scene in the movie when Scott, Lee Tung Foo and Gabby Hayes are captured by the Indians. They escape because Gabby's mule was taught to kick the command and he kicked away from the Indians, allowing our heroes to escape. I'm not sure he would have played in a Rogers movie. Besides, the story actually wants you to think that young prospector Randolph Scott happens accidentally in a golden shot after just a few lessons from prospector Gabby Hayes about how to find gold. <br /> <br /> This was Gabby Hayes's feature track. It would have been better if he had gone to a good western and actually would have done better pairs with Randolph Scott before that. I will say this, although no Caribou has ever appeared, this is one of the few Canadian films in the past that did not have any Mounties. <br /> <br /> But if I were you if you were not a big fan of Randolph Scott or Gabby Hayes, go to the next detour on The Cariboo Trail.
