The Corpse Grinders 2 scene is very similar to the original Corpse Grinders, which is different from the other, consists of strange aliens. I think this movie would be # The worst movie on IMDb - if someone had actually seen it. The plot is disconnected and, in a few (too many) cases, it does not make any sense. The real wonder here is why in the world this sequel was created in an unsuccessful and horrifying film (but still better). I would recommend this movie if you like to watch awesome movies for a good laugh.
