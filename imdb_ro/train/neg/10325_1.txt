This series is getting even worse. Poorly written and simply not funny! The premise is excellent, but the writer's lack of experience shines. Trying so hard not to offend anyone, they eventually insult everyone. Now, in the second season, the desperate distribution has stopped banging and resorted to that adventurous, "ah, stupid" style that has a laughless scenario. They turn their eyes and shake their heads together, as if to say, are not we angry? That's not funny? Well, actually, not really. Gingival disease is less painful. No wonder, with the exception of Corner Gas, Canadians generally avoid Canadian television. Come on CBC we assume that we are our main station with the best Canadian talent. Pull the plug on this amateur mess.
