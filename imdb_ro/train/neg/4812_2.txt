I figured any horror movie with Orson Welles would be weird. Necromania was sure, but it was a little too strange for his good. The film really has a creepy sense because it deals with a covenant of Satanism / witches in a small town and the attempt of a young woman to escape them. The director, though seeming to deliberately try to confuse the audience using flashbacks and dream sequences. Finally, there are too many unanswered questions. What's worse, because the story is so confusing, it's hard to roots for any of the characters. It seems odd that Welles agrees with the title of this film, especially because it does not have much to do. Perhaps one day they will take out an exit tape and bloopers from this movie. Now it would be fun!
