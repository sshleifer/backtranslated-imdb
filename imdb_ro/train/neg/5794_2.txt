the Germans are rising out and mowing with a machine gun. Good Boys never die, if not for dramatic purposes. "plot" has so many ridiculous holes. (Where did the German soldiers go once they rolled the fuel tank to the train? Erik Estrada, please!) And the whole idea, hijacking a train? That's terrible! The Germans know where you will go, not how you can leave the path and move away! What a waste. I'd prefer to knock on my head with a ball hammer 10 times, then I have to sit back over it. I mean, seriously, it fits like it was in the 1960s, but it was produced in 88! 1988 !! Team A is more credible than this horrible excuse for a movie. Just look at it if you need a good laugh. This film is for Tele Sevalas what Green Beret was for John Wayne.
