(A possible spoiler or two) <br /> <br /> "Soul Survivors" is probably the worst ever published movie. Nothing makes sense, there is a plot about a girl who has strange visions about people who may or may not die. The entire movie is just a bunch of random shots that do not really bind to the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Action is non-existent, working with the camera is offensive and the script is so confusing, it just makes the movie even harder to watch. I'm still waiting for something to tie the movie together, but nothing came. Definitely the worst movie of the year. - **** 1/2 stars.
