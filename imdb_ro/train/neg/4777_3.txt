The idea behind this movie was a good one. Too bad it was not written well. Casting Sidney Poitier as an FBI agent was a good idea and he did a great job. Tom Berenger, on the other hand, knows only an excitement in most of his films, anger. The character of Kirstie Alley could have been extraordinary and even showed a few possibilities once, but the writer really let us join, playing a mostly helpless woman. This was completely incompatible with the strong independent character that he had to do. I do not care that Alley works anyway. The movie should have ended about fifteen minutes faster than it did. Director of cow's milk before the incredible final action. I will keep this in my collection just as an example of Poitier's performances.
