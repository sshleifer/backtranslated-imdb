There was no single redeeming factor in this movie. The girlfriend and we both love action movies. In particular battle scenes (Bloodsport and Kickboxer was great), but this movie was not fun. Five minutes of action followed twenty minutes of talk and "angry" expressions of her face. The main hero is a troubled person who has seen the battle and is thus forced to look seriously constipated at all times. The army has disturbed intestinal movements in addition to improving combat techniques. And music is not good. They are fighting for the rap and hip-hop style of the streets, because these guys are the beatings. The rest of the soundtrack is the background noise of low budget dramas. Everything about this movie is classic B style. The actors are giving their lines as if they read them out of the books and the lines themselves should light up and be burned in a Hollywood subterranean. The film is called "Honor," but there was no honor in making this film. It was simply a waste of money, and spending wisely is something I think is valid. <br /> <br /> Go to Felon's place. Scenes and battle situations are more real.
