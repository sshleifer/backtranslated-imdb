Last week we reviewed Nielsen weekly ratings, and there was Veronica Mars, considered "the best show you do not track". Well, they're right you're not looking at it. It was broadcast twice and was ranked 147th and 145th out of 147. Translation: This is the lowest level of any nationwide broadcast network ... and worth it. I tried to track it a few times, because of the whole press coverage, which made it a "good" show, a "realistic aspect" of life and all that nonsense. The reality was different. Veronica Marte is a cellar. It's just as unrealistic as it happens and it's worth it to be canceled. The only mystery is why CW felt obliged to put its inaugural program on the smallest show in memory after two years of continued commercial and artistic failure.
