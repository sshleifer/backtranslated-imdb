The brain that would not die is a terrible movie that bursts out of opening credits. It has all the classic signs of being bad: unknown plot of plot, terrible action, low quality sets and lighting. The plotting line goes like this: When a doctor and his fiance are trapped in an accident, she is beheaded and raises her head and leads her to her lab where she puts her head in a pan with a special liquid that keeps it alive . I bet Virgnina Leath, who played his head in a pan, had to spend a lot of uncomfortable time, wearing the pan around his neck and squatting under the table. However, the doctor tries to find a new body and hires two strips so she can choose one to have her new body. Evil along the way, so bad was broken into pieces on Mystery Science Theater 3000.
