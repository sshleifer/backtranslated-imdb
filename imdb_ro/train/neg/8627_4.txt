Although this is generally a jungle-adventure adventure film, it has a few points - the settings are quite beautiful, and the pace of adventure is good. You will not be bored to watch him. Keith is as vindictive as possible, playing the homonymous role, a jungle guide unswervingly drunk to escort rich boy Van Hoffman and his splendid wife Du≈°u on a hunting expedition in the cannibal country. He does not take things seriously. The shower is like decor and Keith uses it on a large scale - it does not have to work too much. She is not the only woman to show her body and the prudential aspects of the film make her almost half way to a T / A image. There is nothing in this movie to draw attention to or away from it. Produced to be a shlock, he succeeds without much excitement. A good 2 AM cable programmer.
