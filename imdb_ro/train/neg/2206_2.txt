A scientist on an island is in deep pain about the loss of his son who died of kidney cancer. So he thinks: Why do not I turn my dead son into a hammer shark. Well, who is not? It's hard to deal with the fact that the hammer shark that kills everyone is constantly called "Paul." Also, William Forsythe's casting role as a rescue chief MacGyver - a kind of hero, has no credibility. On the other hand, there are some hot guns that make you look at the screen, while Shark Paul bites another to death. Actually, it seems to me that b-bad movies are pretty funny. But for my taste it would have been a better movie if it were made to say $ 100,000 less. Then it would have been fun.
