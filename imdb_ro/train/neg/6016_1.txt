This movie, which was released directly on video, should be labeled as a warning that it is dangerous to human health and may subject the viewer to terminal boredom. This is another thin, evangelistic, "kidnapping" movie, with good boys (believers) who suddenly disappeared, and bad boys (non-Christians) left behind. It's an interesting concept, especially as we see how it happens in a flight captained by a non-believer who has a sinful adventure with a steward on board (needless to say that the sinner does not disappear anyway!). Unfortunately, with all pilots being unbelievers, the plane did not collapse or the film would have ended with pity. Although this could have been exciting without heavy religious agitation, overall, the plodding movie makes a gag, the acting is horrible, and obviously the computer-generated simulations are highly falsified. In addition, it's still a film shot in Canada that claims to be New York City. Wash me ... I will read the Bible.
