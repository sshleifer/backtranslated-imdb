When I noticed that "Hamish Macbeth" was broadcast in the United States, I was delighted. I then had the misfortune to follow the daring things. I adore M. C. Beaton's books about the wonderful Scottish contestant. The characters in the book are fun and very well written. The powers responsible for this mish-mash have never read one of Beaton's books. Only the name "Hamish Macbeth" has something to do with the series. Besides the lack of familiar characters, it seems to me that the whole show is offensive. It seems the actors feel they have to shout lines and scream at each other. If you love Hamish Macbeth, admired by M.C. Beaton, do not waste your time with garbage.
