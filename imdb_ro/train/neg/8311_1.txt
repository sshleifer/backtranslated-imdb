What this movie fails to answer is how bad this war is (and most American wars have just done just to get some oil). How many innocent civilian casualties have existed, how many lives have perished and how blatant So let me ask you if the American soldier kills women and children besides the enemy is OK but if the government accidentally kills its own substance forces chemical deadly, while killing many civilians as well, right? Your logic fails, gentlemen. I will give 5 for solid performance and 1 for everything else, 3 in total.
