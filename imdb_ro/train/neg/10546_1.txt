<br /> <br /> I have recently seen this atrocity in my movie program and thought it terrible, as I said in my slogan, it was pretentious, treacherous, wonderful and phenomenally self-important. <br /> <br /> I think I'm a fan of the movie and all the stuff the movie offers. If I want to see a documentary at the Cannes Film Festival, I'm going to watch A & E .... and it would probably be more objective about it. I do not recommend it, period. <br /> <br />
