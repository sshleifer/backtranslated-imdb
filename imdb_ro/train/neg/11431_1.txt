It is important not to be insulted by the lack of logic or common sense, and those who have "gray issues" will agree that this movie does not work. Problems are in the direction, selections and lack of depth in the character building. The word of comedy was very difficult to say when I expect to laugh when these words are used. Let's look at the problems in the direction / scenario. Brother and sister, in the mid-30s, seem to be well adjusted. They meet a complete stranger in a park, and the character Heather Graham heads to her and asks the most intimate questions that even half a man could otherwise lead him or at least shout for a police officer . Then she goes unexpectedly and makes stupid statements and she falls for him. Then, once they all come together, falls in love with her and decides to marry in Vegas in a week? Hello, someone feels bad? He comes out with thousands of women and meets this person who says about ten words that we see on the screen and wants to marry her. Not only there is no chemistry but it does not make sense. Sure is a romantic comedy and I want to believe it could, but the direction has made it completely flat. Now Heather falls head over the heels with her and when Heather Graham and Bridget Moynahan (very little superficial character) kiss or more to the point was the sloppy kiss ever that chemistry can be there. I found her unmotivated and unhappy and while many say Heather can not act I think the reality is Heather was clearly the wrong person for this role. This was Sue Kramer's debut as a director and for me it was too much for her to chew. It would take a lot of crafts to make this movie work and IMHO could be done with better writers and casting and direction.
