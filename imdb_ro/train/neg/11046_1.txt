This is probably one of the worst movies ever made. Evil acts, bad bad effects, evil plot, everything bad. In the last 15 minutes, a cyborg suitable for the cyborg has been introduced. Malcom MacDowell must have needed to pay a house, otherwise he would have had to sell to Hollywood Blvd to pay the bill. I do not know how you can go from Clockwork Orange to these crap and you can look in the mirror every morning. I could do better special effects in my tub. It's no continuity. The editor must have been asleep or the drug is so you have to smoke to be bad, the gun either throws flames or blue bullets, think, bad girl and the other girl in the movie looks so much confused Whay is called 2013 Seadly Wake. It has nothing to do with the movie
