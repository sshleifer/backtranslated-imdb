I remember seeing this during the first time I was 7 years old. I was a huge comic book reader at the time, and anything about superheroes was anticipated very hard. The end result, however, was overwhelming. I was aware of the stories of "Emma Peel" Diana Prince, because they recently came to an end and Diana was turned to its Amazonian form. However, there was so little action that I was bored throughout the movie. The final costume was an interesting idea, but it looked like a cheerleader rather than a superhero. I have seen the movie again in recent years of adolescence. He had not improved much. Cathy Lee Crosby was much more familiar with That's Incredible, but her acting was not better. The script had some good ideas, such as the dishonest Amazon and a decent character in Ricardo Montalban, but he had just not met and was still boring. I think he should have built the story better, and built the show in a more epic climate. It was too much like a gentle spy movie, crossed by a superhero story written by someone who had never seen a comic book. The elements of the amazon were interesting, but they had to be extended. The film managed to force the producers to return to the drawing board and come up with something more faithful, if a bit too camp and a low budget. The budget was also quite low here, and superheroes are not cheap. It would be nice to have the movie available on DVD if it's just a comparative and historical document. Even Superman 4 is available and has nothing over this movie (except Chris Reeve and Gene Hackman). It's worth seeing for curiosity and for a little inspiration and caution for future versions.
