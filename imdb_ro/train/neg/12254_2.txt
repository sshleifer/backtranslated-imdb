Some may be playing the game, but there is, in fact, a real art that makes movies particularly bad. This loses all fronts. A bunch of young people - women with spinning tresses and tuxedos - are naturally wet - go to the movie "surfing the blood" and end up running in a crocodile foot. <br /> <br /> Not only was the Croc obviously false, but some of the props [notice that the boat hitting the reef in private] show that they came out of cannon birds! <br /> <br /> No good from start to finish. You do not see him!
