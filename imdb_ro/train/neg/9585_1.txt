I remember watching this movie in 86 years when it first came out and a terrible movie. The actor was atrocious that the plot was so thin he should have or should have breathed in a wind blow. I think I let myself sleep more than once and I was not tired of remembering. Please avoid at all costs better to remove all your teeth without anesthesia, which would be more fun. It's just a shame I could not give him a zero score or a negative score. I wish I did not waste my money by getting the one from the video store, all I can say was that the band she was on was still new, just as surprising as the movie was so poor. If I remember well, I sat down and saw her with a girl I really wanted to give her and the fact that she was next to me was still not enough to keep me awake so this movie was bad.
