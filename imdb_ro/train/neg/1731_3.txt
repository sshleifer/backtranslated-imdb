The Twilight Zone has made a certain mythology about it - just like Star Trek. That's because there are many beloved lovers of the show that no matter what each episode thinks was a winner. These are the scorers of each individual showing a 10 and can not objectively evaluate the show. For this reason, a while ago I reviewed all of the original Star Trek episodes (good and bad) because the overall ratings and reviews were just too positive. Now, it's time to do the same thing for the Twilight Zone. <br /> <br /> While I've scored many episodes 10, it gets a simple 3 because it was bad. The writing was, in fact, embarrassingly bad. Two people from the opposite sides of a big war are seen lost in the entire episode. After a while, it is obvious that they are the only two people left on Earth - as you learn in a truly stupid and totally unconvincing conclusion. Usually, twisting at the end makes the episode big - it killed it!
