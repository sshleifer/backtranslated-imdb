An absolute bunch of cow's steam. It's great for me that this movie was really done. Hip-hop and old vestiges do not seem to interfere. What public people were going to think about when planning this work. Not only is the concept and plot a joke, but the action is atrocious, and the fact that some decent actors were right in this nightmare of a movie makes their entire career a laughing background. The chicken from someone should never be forgiven and stripped of any remaining dignity. After reading the first ten pages of the dialogue, she should have wondered who among her friends was playing with this sick joke. After some research, I found a list of other actors who went on this film: Jada Pinkett-Smith, Denzel Washington, Brandy, Monique, Kim Kardasian, Jenna Jameson, Oprah, and Marge Simpson. /> I would simply prefer to watch an empty TV rather than watch this movie again.
