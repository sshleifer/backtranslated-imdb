This early role for Barbara Shelley (actually her first in the UK, after working in Italy) was made at the age of 24 and she is sure she made an amazing debut in Cat Girl 1957. While blondes and brunettes receive the greatest attention (I will always cherish Yutte Stensgaard), the beautiful actress cheerleading with deep-eyed voice always emanates intelligence as well as vulnerability (such as 1960's "Satul lui Damned" in 1960). whose screen time was much less than her character's husband, George Sanders). She is the only reason to see this harsh "Cat People" update and is seen at great advantage all the time (it's hard to tell if her beauty found her even better presentation box) character. Her apparently sleeps in the nude, and we are exposed to the bare bare zemos when she is awakened (also exposed 8 years later in 1965 "R asputin-Mad Monk "). the rapper dress she wears in the biggest movie is a miracle without stunning strings (I do not see what the dress went up but I sure want to). All in all, as proof that Barbara Shelley in a badly written role that she would defeat most of her actresses, grow above her material, and make the film constantly pursued, a real star power test that she will soon find at Hammer's studios in Bray during the 1960s .
