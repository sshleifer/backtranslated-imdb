Graenthumb Grace is left without money after her husband's death, so she goes back to raising the ganja to pay the bills. It sounds promising, and Brenda Blethyn, with all confidence, does not disappoint, but the material is thin. In fact, there's a scene where Grace asks her young gardener for "Give me" (a toke), and he thinks he wants sex and he's acting totally weird. Yeah, it's funny, so a nun will get bored. Saving Grace does not seem to know what it is: the amazing cinema and impressive rhythm evoke memories of Ryan's daughter, while the eternal whims of the people in the country could be picked up from any episode of the Antique Roadshow. It accelerates after the first hour, but until then it is too clichy to care for her. The climax is unpredictable only by the introduction of the most shameful Deux ex Machina I have ever seen.
