This movie was on the second day, and I did not like it at all. The first George of the jungle was a good comedy, but the sequel ... was totally terrible. The new actor and actress to play the main roles were not at all good, they should have had the original actor (Brendon Fraiser) and the original actress (I forgot his name), so this movie gets the rating 0 out of ten, not a movie which you can sit and enjoy, is a movie that you return to another channel or you return it to the store if you were hired or bought. It was good to see Ape back in the monkey, but it was not as fun as the first one, he should have had George's new son as Georges's son raised, and still had Bredon and what's in it) in the movie, I was a bit better than it was.
