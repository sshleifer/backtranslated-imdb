Although nothing can compare to Vampiri Vs. Zombie ... in any shooting region, I will try to judge this movie. First, the special effects were breathing. When an explosion occurred on the TV screen, I thought my whole house would explode, and when they were pulled with automatic weapons, I thought the shell would land on the floor right next to me. Simply amazing my friends. But the scene in which Jack Black's sound gives the worst monologue I've ever heard I've committed suicide, but do not worry when she was blown away by the movie he can get from his terrible screenplay on "I have to be great". Seriously, he had to look at him with no mind about the incongruous thoughts that had absolutely no meaning, and he just added that he must be "tall" to justify his terrible actions. Well, if you can say that to excuse the terrible act, then if you talked to writers, directors, executive producers, sponsors, you probably get the same answer ... seriously. With a production team called "Shock-o-Frame" I was shocked that I did not put a rifle in my mouth and ended my life after this terrible excuse for a movie. If you want to see this movie then you should be killed <br /> <br /> Really, <br /> <br /> General
