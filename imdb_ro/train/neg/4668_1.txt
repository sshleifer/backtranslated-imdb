The extravagance of the potential film, established in the nineteenth century, failed to produce. With great actors such as Maggie Smith, Albert Finney and many others, there was no reason for the film's failure. However, the film had no end, it had a bad excuse for a parcel line and fell into pieces with its continuity. A typical story of a rich girl and a poor boy brought by love and destroyed by the beauty (or lack thereof) and disapproval, has an appealing part of the early death of the mother and an absent father. The father, played by Finney, is a disturbed man, torturing his daughter both in life and in death. He thinks his daughter's lack of good will not destroy his wealth through marriage under their social status. The actors are trying in vain to save what's left of the story. Washington Square is a black hole of ruin and destruction, losing the precious time of those who look terrible. I give this movie 1 instead of 0, just for the actors' attempts. Save yourself, stay away from Washington Square.
