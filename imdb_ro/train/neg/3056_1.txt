Before I saw this, I saw some bad Christmas movies. But once I saw this, "Jingle All the Way" looked better than "The Godfather." "Santa Claus" is a jolly movie about Santa helping children, but he feels almost demonic watching him. Santa's Ho-ho-ho's Christmas is replaced by a diabolical laugh, bad that I'm sure he turned many kids out of Christmas. The plot of this massacre is very strange, which matches all the performance and dialogue. Santa lives above the Earth in the North Pole where he and the children all over the world are preparing for Christmas. But Santa Claus has an enemy called Pitch, or Satan. Pitch tries to destroy Santa Claus's Christmas, making three naughty boys and diversions, such as moving the chimney and boiling the doors. When Pitch causes Santa to be attacked by a dog, it helps Santa, Pedro, and Merlin to bring Santa out of this kitchen. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie, along with the fact that it's really bad, is so bizarre. Satan dances very much and in fact seems more joyous than Santa. Santa talks about delivering gifts to all boys and girls, but he seems to deliver just 5 Mexican children's homes. Sharks are toys, and when the reindeer laughs, I'm amazed that she does not tear the eyes of the children ... it's scary. Everything is terrible. The first 10 minutes are simply Santa playing the organ while the children sing to him. Probably one of the strangest scenes is to shoot Santa in Pitch in the ass with a mini-cannon and laughing laughing about it while Pitch dances around the pain. I think parents are better off telling their children about where the children are from than showing them. The only positive thing is that he will laugh hysterically if you can appreciate a bad movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 85 minutes.
