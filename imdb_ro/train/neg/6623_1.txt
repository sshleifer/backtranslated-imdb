First of all, I'm sorry that I even awarded a 1 rating to this movie (nothing less than available). The film fails in each department either by scenario, direction, characterization or action. <br /> <br /> 1) To begin with, the name of the movie is really Class C (although the movie matches the name). 2) Amitabh Bachchan strives to live up to character, but the weakened script, coupled with the pathetic direction, makes him a humorous character. 3) In Sholay Gabbar Singh has a reward of 50,000 on him (which was convincing). Here, in Aag, the figure was 100 crores for Babban (Amitabh Bachchan, but the poor man was beaten by so-called heroes and had only a few bikers to switch with all the automatic weapons). does not seem convincing 4) Regarding Nice Kothari, one has to tell him that he does not know how to act. Why is Ram Gopal Verma rolling up again and again? 5) Mohanlal was good, but there is almost nothing for him. 6) Sushant Singh and Rajpal Yadav, who are great actors, are wasted in the film. 7) The role of the legend played by Lila Misra (Mausi de Basanti) in Sholay is cheaply replaced in this film by some Gangs mummies. I pray that you grow up and understand that there must be some intellect in your movie. Pretty stupid characters in your movie like Shiva and Aag. 8) He should not say anything about modern Jai and Veeru. To summarize, I was shocked to see this movie because it looks like a cheap and comic translation of the original classic. Do not waste money and time on this movie. I think viewing Aap Ka Surror (which I thought was the worst possible movie) would be a better idea than seeing this terrible pack of stupid characters, bad songs and miserable directions. Thanks Saurabh
