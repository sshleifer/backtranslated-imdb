ba ba boring ... ... this is alongside the field of battlefield in science fiction sleepiness. genie francis has a small role as a reporter and she should tell you that this movie must be bad ... there is Ben Kingsley (an academy winning actor) in this stinker and others some decent actors. You have to ask what he has possessed to decide to make this awful movie. The music rises dramatically up and down as if it were a dramatic story. Even if you pay attention to the plot, it is impossible to follow. The effects are also mediocre and seem to be really dated. All actors speak in a monotone voice and have no realism in their dialogue. I could go on and in what way is a bad movie. At least with Battlefield Earth it's so bad it's funny, but that's just a problem. Avoid if you do not want to be left to sleep.
