This movie certainly has one of the strangest themes in history - right there with Ed Wood's passionate defense of cross-dress in "Glen or Glenda?" Subject: The bridge of play. Park Avenue sets it up; Bohemia plays it. The Russians - who were very shameful "Russians" and have the most unconvincing accents when they speak English - play it at the restaurant they work in. If anyone is not interested in the bridge, - even despite the big distribution - it is unlikely to be much interested in this bizarre movie. Loretta Young and Paul Lukas are all right. (Well, Frank McHugh is a fantastic writer - Lukas is an unlikely shame.) But everyone is immersed in the fetishist script.
