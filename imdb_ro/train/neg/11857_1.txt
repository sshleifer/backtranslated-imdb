The smallest movie ever made! Please refer to the real movie reviews from the professionals in this movie. Check Rotten Tomatoes on the web for some independent reviews on this movie. Comments made on this site are apparently from people with a financial interest in this movie. I think positive comments are very deceptive. I find it amazing how negative comments are so bad against this movie, and positive comments sound like an Oscar Speech award. Do not lose your hard earned money !!!!!! This movie is retarded! I can not believe that a movie like this would ever have been done. Why would Hollywood have been scattered for junk too? This movie is an attempt of nothing. I was wondering what you could sink the money that produces such garbage. I went to the blockbuster and the attendant really told us not to waste our time or money. I did not listen and I wasted my time and money. Please do not make the same mistake! It's really "The worst movie ever made!"
