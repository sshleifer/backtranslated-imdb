This movie is so incredibly bad that I almost felt bad watching him. Until now, the other rates have had at least one good thing about it. Part 1 was suspense and annoyance. Part 2 was off and fun. Part 3 was interesting, with great effects. Part 4 has excellent music, good special effects and a new fun Freddy Krueger. Part 5 is more boring than anything we've ever seen. Alice, a much nicer blonde, of part 4 returns with her friend Dan. On tracks, this alleged Elm Street tranch turns into a soap during the day. The newer characters seem to be harsh, and even that sweet Alice has a chip on his shoulder. Freddy seems to be completely out of this. It seems tired and does not seem so terrible. Its captains do not seem to be different and different, where, as in Part 4, it could be quite funny. Leslie Bohem's story never gets to the ground, and Stephen Hopkins's direction is so bad that my grandmother does look good! The whole scenario of this film is ridiculous and unrealistic. It's also confusing and pretty stupid. Avoid Part 5 at any cost!
