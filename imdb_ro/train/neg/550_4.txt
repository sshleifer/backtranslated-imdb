After the superlative AANKHEN (2002), which was a remake of a Gujarati game, it comes with WAQT which too looks like a stage track <br /> <br /> In the plays we have screaming characters, /> > The first half shows that Amitabh jokes almost 40+ Akshay Kumar, acting too funny like a little nerdy The film has a good message not to ruin your son, but unfortunately the path Amitabh wants to do Akki responsible is absolutely false Even the reason to hide his illness, his runnign from the hospital and the melodramatic discourse of Akki is a deserted emotion touches you, but most are too above the top Rajpal's comedy is hilarious, but too stretched in the second half <br /> <br /> The direction of the Shah Vip is too upset though some scenes are good Music is good Amitabh surpasses it in the first half but is superb in emotional scenes. Akshay Kumar too has good part but looks amazing and in some of his cats chemistry with Bachchan is untouchable Rajpal is a climax, makes you laugh without overcoming and just his presence and his bad behavior and humor deadpan he is a Boman riot is good in some comic parts but too loud in places Priyanka is the heroine so nothing to do, this is her last film with Akki so far Shefali is wonderful although she looks too young for Bachchan
