Spike Lee has been in a decline since his early successes and this mess does nothing to help. I looked at my clock frequently, hoping the movie would end or come to an end. Lee's first film with a white cast is a great disappointment. What is the purpose? That the Italians also swear a funky sex, but not with their wives? If I wanted to see Scorsese, I'd go to a Scorsese movie. The incredible bosom of the nose is only added to the stereotype. I have admired several of Lee's films, especially "Do Your Good". This movie is a waste of time.
