This is probably the strangest Santa Clause exposure ever to engage in any medium, be it a book, an image or a movie. Santa looks like a perversion in children, and the twisted story of bringing Merlin to help him defeat one of Satan's servants, Pitch, does not do better. It's laughable to say at least, with negative effects, even for the standards of 1959. If a child were watching this movie, he would have nightmares and he would not want to visit Santa again. It would be scars for life. Imagine that the baby is in a "Christmas story" when he begins screaming after being put on Santa's lap. This will happen if the child will see this movie.
