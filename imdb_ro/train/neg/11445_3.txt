I've seen a lot of fools in my day, but kindness, Hot Rod takes the cake. I saw a free view in NY last night. I only hope to show the funny version to paying customers. The large rivers were rare, the plot was uninteresting, and the characters were at least dimensional. A climax is a hilarious dance scene with Adam Samberg. It was invaluable and it was the only scene I had a real laugh at. Besides, I can only remember you randomly and dead air. SNL and Samberg fans can be disappointed. I know I was expecting more from her. But in short, I certainly would not recommend attending a free screening or pay to watch this movie.
