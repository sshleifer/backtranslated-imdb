We had great hopes for this movie. The theater monologue is wonderful, and Nic Balthazar is a very interesting man with a lot of experience and knowledge when it comes to movies. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of many Belgian films, but this movie is bad. It is completely unbelievable that actors who are 34 years old suddenly play the roles of adolescents. The "language games" were terrible and above. Nothing about the movie seemed real to me. The end was too deus ex machina for me. I'm very disappointed, and I think I've lost an hour and a half of my life.
