Maybe I do not know or I do not know what Electra is in the current publications ... But the Electra I read was much more manipulative and seems to always have a plan. Usually she used others to do her dirty work and more often than a kind of double cross. Only when you think you realize he's pulling the wool over your eyes and making his way. This film was rather weak in dialogue, the action was not particularly convincing, and the action was unclear. I was really looking for something more, like Frank Miller's "Electra Assassin" book. Which is much darker than anything else in this movie. A special effect when it was cold, the action was interesting sometimes, but more often than the story and the plot was slow or illogical. The hand was not dangerous enough, and Electra was ... not quite strange. It's the girl you love to hate ... but in this story, I just did not care.
