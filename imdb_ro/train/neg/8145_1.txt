This movie is so bad I can not believe it was actually shot. People who voted 10 or 9, 8 and even 7, are you crazy? Are we really watching the same movie? Or the same sh ** I should say. Everything is bad in this movie. The story (is a story?) It does not go anywhere, completely incoherent, the act (some dialogues are simply ridiculous), the musical score (what is ****), editing and especially the artistic direction, a pure disaster. It reminds me of the old Macist movies ... To give you an example of amateur production, the siren suit is a sleeping bag with sponges stuck on it. I'm not kidding, it's exactly what it is. Another example of the enormous mistakes we find here: you see in a scene an extra, a fat woman about 200 pounds, talking about her cell phone. The next photo, which is in a completely different location, you can see the same woman, still speaking on the mobile phone (!) Yes, it goes so far. <br /> <br /> A great, huge waste of money. Useless.
