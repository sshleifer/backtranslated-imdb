There is an excellent reason why Edison went straight to the film: he would have landed in cinemas with a broken sound. The movie lasted a long time and was boring. Just a note above the lowbrow (thanks to Freeman and Spacey, which obviously had two weeks before the next films), bad guys are just as ridiculous and action as almost nonexistent Justin Timberlake's act. I do not like to beat the guy, but the sooner he realizes that the pop is his strength, the better. The movie is not bad ... just the majority. I like the fact that LL Cool J has received what seems to be a chance to lead the man. He deserves that. And, unlike his musical and co-star colleagues, he can act. Kevin Spacey is almost always enjoyable (you can see him several times while chewing the landscape) and Freeman has the ability to raise this movie to three stars (out of ten ... not so good). /> <br /> When everything is said and done, the final error with this movie is that it is a mundane and tedious piece of poppycock pseudo-action that fails to keep anyone awake. It also fails to make someone foolish about any of the characters. In general, it's simply boring. That being said, rent this when you suffer from insomnia.
