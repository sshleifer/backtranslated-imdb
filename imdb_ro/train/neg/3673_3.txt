William Hurt scientist scuba diving ??? American agents conducting the investigation abroad? The sick man who died after falling to 20 feet on his back and fled? Lack of a sniper and not killing Hurt (he just hurts him), but the second shot "dead" is dead? A waste of time. Comparing this with falling down, as other reviewers have done, is ridiculous. And by the end of the movie, they decide to start their gloves in their hands, except for the "bad" agent, and Hurt decides to kill him, giving him "shake-up". What the? BTW ... when IMDb needed 10 rows of text? I'm just buzzing here. Does not this only dilute the content of the reviews if you are asked to have x sums of lines?
