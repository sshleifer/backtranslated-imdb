He watched 8/3/2003 - 2 out of 10 (Dir-Brad Sykes): A 3-D mindless movie about a zombie who eats meat in a 3 story story in a movie chronicle. And yes, we get to see zombies who eat parts of human flesh in 3D! Wow, no! This has been done from time to time in 2D in a zombie movie, but what usually makes a better zombie movie is the underlying story not of eating meat. That made the classic zombie be good. Meat food has just been discarded. We've been bored along most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame (similar twilight area), easy to understand, and the slowdown revealed. The last story is actually the story with which the movie started (having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and, of course, we get to see the flesh eating and zombies in that. Well, I think I said pretty much. Look at the classic, not at this 3D feast.
