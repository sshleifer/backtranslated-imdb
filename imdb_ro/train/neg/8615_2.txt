This movie was so bad, outdated and stupid that I had hard times to follow it all the way. I saw this guy by Rodney in Natural Born Killers and I thought he was funny like hell, but this movie was bad. "The jokes" were not funny, the actors were not funny, nothing about it was fun. Do not waste your time for that! Only positive things about this were beautiful wives :) and Molly Shannon, who are sure they tried the best, but the script was too terrible. That's why I rated it "2" instead of "1", but it's certainly one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
