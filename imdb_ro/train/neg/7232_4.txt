I loved Bilal's graphic novel when he came out, and he was amazed when I saw the trailer for this movie, and all the more so when I heard that Bilal had guided him himself. The film, however, was a major defeat. The images are nowhere near the rich and stony texture of the original artwork, and the story is not well said. Bilal seems to have chosen to focus on the more esoteric aspects of the graphic novel, and does not do any good work for him. <br /> <br /> The most enjoyable part of the original graphic novel was the hatred of friendship between Nikopol and Horus. They were both outside their time and place, forced together by circumstances. Moreover, they were fun and enjoyable. Not so here. Nikopol has no distinct personality, and Horus is a pompous joke that just wants to be put. Even if the movie is French, Horus does not have to be! We've seen all the movies we've enjoyed, but I would not recommend it to everyone, for one reason or another. I would not recommend Immortel to anyone, except perhaps a warning not to exceed your talents and resources. Bilal is a master storyteller, but obviously he is not a master of any visual environment.
