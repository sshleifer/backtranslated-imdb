Should it start? This is by far one of the worst movies I've ever paid for to see them. I will not comment on the story itself, it is a wonderful classic, but here it feels like a soap opera. For starters, the actor, with the exception of Eric Bana, has a soap quality. I've always been a fan of Brad Pitt, but here every actor on The Bold and Beautiful makes him shame. Also, camera action does not help. What about him when he thinks, takes me back to Brooke Forrester's lab classes! Peter O'Toole had either a very bad plastic surgery or desperately needed one. Anyway, look more like Linda Evans than Linda Evans! And to put an end to my comments, Diane Kruger is a pretty girl, but it is certainly not Helen of Troy. Peterson should have chosen Saffron Burrows for the role because Elizabeth Taylor would rather be miscast so far.
