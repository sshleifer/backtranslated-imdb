I like the 30s and 40s in the movie. I like Salma Hayek. I was more than ready to love this picture. but. . . <br /> <br /> BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! ! ! !! ! <br /> <br /> No, sir, nothing good about this. The only fun thing about me was that Colin Farrell's character is an insecure writer and this scenario, despite addressing juicy topics of racism, is approaching the public in the style of an ABC Afterschool Special. <br /> <br /> The only person who does not sound like he was "acting" was Sutherland, and his minutes were few. Stale approach to a tired plot.
