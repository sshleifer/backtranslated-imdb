Why when a star gets to the top of the chain of stars, they destroy all good works making a bad movie? Burt Reynolds reached the climax, after which he began to make terrible blows from Hal Needham. Arnold Schwarzenegger has become the hottest Hollywood property, just to invite him with the terrible hero of the last act. And here, Prince Eddie Murphy wipes out memories of trading venues and about 48 hours with this "family" adventure movie, which is an incredibly boring, childish, and generally simple move where the chance to see big tits of Charlotte Lewis in a tight blouse is the most appealing aspect of the entire movie. The story is pure. It refers to social worker Murphy, contacted by mysterious types, and said he is the one chosen. He chose what, I heard you asked. His mission is to save a Tibetan boy with mystical powers from a race of demons who want to master the world. As a leading demon, classical actor Charles Dance looks extremely embarrassed to be in the movie, but hey, I'm sure he was well paid for sacrificing his talents. Of all Murphy's movies, this is easily the worst. I read some reviews suggesting it's nice to see Murphy in an atypical role in a non-formic film, and while both points are true, there is no pardon that the movie - no matter how atypical and non-formal could be - is an absolute garbage load. <br /> <br />
