American Pie: Beta House is a kind of language between genres. On the one hand, it's a comedy without any plot and some truly intelligent jokes. On the other hand, porn is too teddy-core to activate, in fact, any viewers. Essentially, Beta House is a collage of sexual scenes - some humiliating, some blurred, humorous - with some thin plotting plotted in a cohesive effort. Characters are barely two-dimensional, most of the developments are based on Miley Naked's knowledge, and scene scenes "important" are so far that you wonder why writers have even felt the need for a story. <br /> <br /> In all fairness, I have not entered this movie without expectations. I liked the three original American movies and I thought Band Camp and Naked Mile were tenants. I thought Naked Mile was almost good enough to be released to the theater, so when I saw that some of the same characters were coming back to the Beta House, I was thrilled to see this installment. I was aware that there were many scenes of despondency and sexual humiliation in multiple forms. And I felt good, because in the past these scenes were backed by the story and were well integrated into the plot. In Beta House, however, it's almost as though writers have forgotten why the formula worked in other AP films. They spent too much energy working in nudity that they forgot to write a story. This movie is a disappointment and not even worth a one-dollar rental. Banknotes are blades, the story is non-existent, and porn is too loud if that's all you care to see.
