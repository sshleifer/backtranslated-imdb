Woody Allen has made some of the greatest comedies ever and I would seriously consider that Annie Hall is the biggest film ever, but if I really think, I'll probably think of one or two that's better, but be hard. Of course he had some movies that are not good enough but not as bad as Manhattan Murter Murder and Sweet and Lowdown, but he never had a bad movie like Melinda and Melinda. Not so tired and so unhappy, his movies are usually full of witchcraft and hilarity, but how did this happen, is our old Woody good yet? The story unfolds around four friends who have dinner together. Two are writers and one of the others mentions a funny story that happened to a friend of hers. This is a young woman who bursts into an unexpected party. We never hear the rest because the two plays start to debate if it's a comedy or a better tragedy. Then we start to see the two points of view. Both focus on this woman named Melinda, who has both drug problems and her ex-husband. In tragedy, she is an old family friend who, after trying to commit suicide, decided to look at the best of the best friends for no apparent reason. The comedy is about Melida, who stops at the party after spending over 28 sleeping pills. Both go into a wild wind of events that never make sense or do not fit together, or make you laugh several times or twice. There are some beautiful shows by Radha Mitchell and Will Ferrell, but they can not fit together there. They do not stop him from diving further than most of the other movies this year.
