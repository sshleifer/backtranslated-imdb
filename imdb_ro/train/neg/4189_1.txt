We had the distinct misfortune of catching up with two of the worst 2004 films back in the morning this morning: first, the incoherent blunder of the Riddick CGI, and then the derisory project known as Greendale. Many millions of costs and other costs, but both are bad. Really, very bad. <br /> <br /> At the top I should say that I am not the greatest fan of the world, Neil Young, but also contributed to the classical songs: Buffalo Springfield (whose best recordings were compositions Young) at Rust Never Sleeps, Harvest and Mirror Ball, the guy wrote some very good songs. Unfortunately, there are no great songs in Greendale, and some good precious ones, and the film around them is a really serious and simplistic political slogan. Completely without merit as art and unimpressive as a polemic, Greendale is best forgotten. Buy the book if you are compelled to contribute to Young's bank account.
