Dance was probably the only thing that could be tracked about this movie - and that was disappointing compared to other films. What seems to me to be the worst kind of movie - one that assumes it's a work of art, because it has all the traps of the movie. Yes, it's beautiful, but ultimately it does not have the depth and tension of the dance around which the movie is supposed to surround itself. Tango is a press, it's hot, has drama, it's bold - exactly what this movie is not.
