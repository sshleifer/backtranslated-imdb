I'm not a regular spectator of Springer, but I watch his show in glimpses and I think the show is a guilty pleasure and a good way of killing some time. So naturally, I'm going to watch this movie waiting to see "Jerry Springer Uncensored". First, Jerry appears in about twenty minutes of the movie's running time. The other hour and twenty minutes are spent to build this pseudo-farce about trailer, jealousy, incest and deception. Jaime Pressley (who looks as hot as HELLLL) is a trailer slut who sleeps with her stepfather (Michael Dudikoff, a very strange man, smoked by anger, who eventually moves away from his hero's character) . Mom finds out about the business, she's fighting, wants to take her to the "Jerry" show (does not it, or Springer). And then we have a parallel story with an African-American couple. I'm going to the "Jerry" show. Characters collide. Blah, blah, angry! Trash was rarely this BORRRINGG !! I was wondering why Hell Springer has millions of fans, but none of them checked his movie. Well, now it's TOTAL obvious! Whether you love or hate it, you will hate this movie! How can I explain? It's a total misery of a movie (if that's what you call it). It's so badly edited, with scenes that do not connect, and after a while, the plot vanishes virtually and it's all over the map! Imagine just a predictable soap opera transformed into a comic joke. He laughs seldom. <br /> <br /> My only positive note is a hot-girl scene. It's so risque how it happens. Do not get me wrong, the scene is pretty risque, but if you look at the general movie that compares it to Springer's material - this disastrous farce seems extremely disinfected. My score: 3 (out of 10)
