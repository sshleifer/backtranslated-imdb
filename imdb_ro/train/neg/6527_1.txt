Of course, no morning children morning television show has ever been so bad. After all, those producers had to count on the returning audience. Well, in this appalling offense, they could at least count the money they saved on the sets. The script could have been a rejection of the long-awaited space opera series, with some brilliant lines added for Gerald Mohr to look at Naura Hayden's death. No director could have done anything decent with such a pure story, so the action turns boringly. Spacecraft harvests are absurd - a Bulova wall clock and a portable type car, for example - but the planet sets must be some of the worst in cinematic history. Most are rough designs, and all are bathed in a red light, often unclear. Even Mohr's hairy chest is used as a support. And it's a bad one - as thin as the plot. Any viewer who can do this by the end of this movie will hear a message from Martian - and probably will totally agree!
