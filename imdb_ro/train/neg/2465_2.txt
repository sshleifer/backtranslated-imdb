This would be a respectable mediocre film at Hollywood if it had a good editing. It's based on the typical American thriller plot - "who will overtake everyone". The action is below average, but with the brilliant appearance of the detective who is the best actor in the film and is more responsible if the tension in the movie grows. The film was completely choked by bare video and sound images and often looks like raw film material. Generally, if you do not mind watching a movie that looks like a student film project, it's a movie to watch. I think it would be enough to say in this film, anything else could even ruin the tension that is probably low.
