His first film, after the death of a friend of John Belushi, Aykroyd shows a lot of fatigue, trying to get a character that would have been a blow to Belushi. Instead, "Doctor Detroit" gives Aykroyd's book teacher a strange and violent puzzler to remove a rival known only as his mother. It's pretty bad, but he also has classes to teach, a dinner at the school to host, four ladies of the evening to protect and a Pimp dinner (or something like that) to attend. No wonder Aykroyd seems to be amazed most of the time. Why should the viewer be alone? It was on this film that Aykroyd met upcoming wife Donna Dixon. At least something good came out of this chaotic mess. One and a half stars. You want Aykroyd well, see "The Blues Brothers". Worry, see "Doctor Detroit."
