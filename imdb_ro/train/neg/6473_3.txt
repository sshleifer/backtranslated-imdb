As a child, the first installment ("The Little Mermaid") was my favorite movie. It was full of characters, songs and a fun family movie. For another week I watched this movie for the first time. I think this movie was like most sequels and did not exceed the original. I think I feel this probably because we had big expectations and we grew up. However, it is not a bad movie. It starts when Ariel just gave birth to a beautiful baby, Melody. Eric and Ariel feel threatened by Morgana (Eurselas's sister), so I'm building a big wall around their house on the sea. As Melody grows, she begins to wonder outside the walls, where she is forbidden to leave. Problems get worse as Morgana tries to take control of the seven thousand. I do not want to quit the movie, so you have to see it to find out. I liked the voices being the same and singing wonderful again. I think this is a good family movie, though in general!
