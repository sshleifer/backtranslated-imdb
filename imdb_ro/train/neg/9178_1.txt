The thing about calling the House of the Dead the worst movie of all time is that it really is not. There are worse movies there. I look at many ninja films in Hong Kong, which are basically the result of an unfinished Japanese police drama, with ninja images finally introduced to create something that could be technically called a "movie." Dead is still one of the worst movies I've ever seen in theaters. Halfway through, I felt that I was pretty stupid enough to get over 45 minutes of this garbage.
