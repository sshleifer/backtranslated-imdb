I know no one cares, but I do. This movie is historical for a reason. It's the unit of two heroes in two fantastic seventy movies. Well, one is wonderful and one is very bad. The big one is really great, it's actually the best. The bad guy is really bad, in fact, it's the worst. Of course I'm referring to "Star Wars," and it's star Mark Hamill, known as "Luke Skywalker," the hero of this movie about a child who escapes Vette and then goes to Vegas (on the lead) and after a lot of adventures, eventually recovers it. (Since I'm dealing with car repair, I think you can call it "Lube Skywalker"). Along the way, she meets a golden prostitute and ends with a character played by Kim Milford, the hero of the 1970s sci-fi "Laserblast", which, as I suggested earlier, bad SF movie ever made. Milford plays the baddie role that Hamill has to steal again. I realize no one cares about the meeting of two great sci-fi heroes, but I do. And I have to say that this is one of the best / the worst movies of all time. Mark Hamill's actor needs force, the plot needs extensive Jedi training, and the cloth character played by Annie Potts might be the most annoying character of all time, anytime in any movie I've ever seen . But it's a fun movie to watch on a weekend or night, late at night, very late. It's one of those movies that is marching, looking for something, but without finding it enough and at the same time, its whole purpose is, like free jazz, simply to exist. And that's what's happening. And what it is is not so great, but you can not say it is not fun because you may feel kidnapped for an hour and a half, but you will not feel cheated. So stop your mind, relax and enjoy this jewel muddled without expectation, and force it to be with you, always.
