This film is about a New York rape / writer feminine writer who decides to move away from the brilliant city shine and move to a dirty place to descend into the small town where she finds a refuge in a trailer with one side on a dirt batch in the middle of the 12th and nowhere. People in the city are mentally ill, yet it is to invite crazy people into her trailer. Annoying is that he has the ability to do exactly what he needs to put himself in a dangerous situation after dangerous circumstances. DB Sweeney's performance was, at best, high school. She is one of those young cute actors with a sweet smile. Unfortunately, the career was not good and the mother nature was okay. For the previous commentator who said the act was "so real," I strongly agree. In fact, he was not acting. The two main characters are really pathetic, weak and unable to make mature and healthy decisions. In short, this movie sucks like nobody else, rent it to laugh at her. The real scene of the crime? Atrocean wood in the trailer panel - enough to make ME kill him. And, finally, he is an artist / writer, so he could not afford a double trailer and anything other than a Chevy queen for the yellow sun, for the love of God!
