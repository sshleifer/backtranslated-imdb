I'm glad some people liked it, but I hated this movie. He had a great idea for a story, but that's over. It was misspelled, it was badly done and it was bad. They had some interesting plot points, but they were just jumping over too soon, the writers had to figure out what to keep and expand on these bits, as a lie about why they were kidnapped and wipe out the slag. Instead, it was "what's going on?" 5 seconds later they tell you. This movie did not have suspense, and I was bored from start to finish. I just wanted to finish it. Go and rent dirt, or the best laid plans if you want suspense or twists that keep guessing to the end.
