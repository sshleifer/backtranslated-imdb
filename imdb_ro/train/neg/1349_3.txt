I got the DVD 2 years ago and I just decided to see it yesterday. I do not know why he took me as long as I like the Inspector Gadget and even the new Gadget and Gadgetinis. While it can have a brilliant palette of color and all the technical sophistication of a modern animated movie, there are some old things missing from this gadget even on the toilet. First of all, Classic Inspector Gadget song and music are completely absent. The composer tries to compromise by making a similar sound, but he is still not good enough. Gadget-mobile is now a talk machine, not a car that can be turned into a truck. In addition, it looks much nicer and rather than cool. Penny does not have her computer book anymore, and she and Brain do not look anymore. Complot is non-existent. There is something about a formula of transformation and Doctor Claw using for some badly revealed never, but that's all I have. What happened to the short / giant Italian guy I will never know about. It has nothing to do with anything. And if the title is something to go through, its last case is wrapped in no way. And he remains in force, so why is called "the last case" is also a mystery. I was not impressed at all. This is an affront to an extraordinary animated show that is strangely absent on DVD, but do not let it ask you to buy any DVD Inspector Gadget you can. I sold only a few seconds after I finally saw it. No child likes or appreciates this, and no fan of the old show with tolerance.
