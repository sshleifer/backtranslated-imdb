Jonathan Rivers (Michael Keaton) suddenly becomes a widow when his wife dies. Soon afterwards, he was approached by a Price Price doctor, an Electronic Voice Phenomenon (EVP) expert, who claims to receive messages from Jonathan's wife, Anna, through various electronic gadgets. Does Anna try to tell Jonathan something? Is it just an indication of something on a larger cosmic scale? It's good to see Keaton in a leading role, but the story he's left on is convoluted and absurd at points; it's like the movie does not know how to answer any of the questions it brings, so it distracts the viewer's attention with new questions unrelated. Keaton himself is pretty good, convincingly expressed that the old wizard is desperately trying to communicate with his late wife. He matured quite a lot as an actor, leaving behind the friendly roles with his brother, who played 15 years ago. It looks a little cramped, with a little more wrinkles than it could have expected, but it did not lose any guile and panache that it showed during the fourth century in Hollywood. So it's not that Keaton's returning to a mediocre performance is that the script itself is under. Written by Niall Johnson, the plot becomes more confusing as it progresses, each wandering path ending in another sinuous way. This is good and good if the path leads to some acceptable disintegration, something that links more or less everything together and explains ... something. But no white noise; I knew less about what happened to Jonathan than I did before I first saw him. Keaton is the only reason you looked at this junk though he gets good support from Ian McNeice (like Dr. Price) and Deborah Kara Unger as a necessary religious interest.
