If you appreciate the renaissance in Asian horror, do not bother with Gawi. The film does not deserve to mention alongside the A-list, such as Ringu, The Story of Two Sisters, Cure and Ju-On (or even so good material as Eye or Inner Senses). Those movies are full of subtleties, unexpected images, rich characters, and certainly non-Western, taking what's scary. Gawi is tied together with the remaining limbs and organs of everything that has made horror American terrible over the last twenty-five years. The film tries to mix the Asian ghost story and the Hollywood slasher, but it's an incorrect match. An aesthetic is obliged to persuade the other; guess what? They have no story of telling the producers the Ringu movie for an evil-child subplot, but the situation is hopeless. Clich√©s, bad characters, mindless plot, a dull, humming ghost.
