This is one of those horrible, sex-driven B films that could not have played near a theater. Women run in costumes dressed in expensive "bunny" clothes, a fat woman is the weight of many unlucky jokes and works at the restaurant of a dirty old man who has a strange son (Jim Hanks, Tom's Brother) whom a man wants Put him down. Hanks is actually kind of good, but this movie does not go anywhere and it's pointless. We have to ask why it was actually done? However, due to Hank's performance and a few moments of entertainment (but no more than a few), he received a "2" star out of 10. I think I was beautiful.
