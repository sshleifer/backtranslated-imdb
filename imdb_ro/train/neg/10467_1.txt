If there ever was a call to make an evil film that reflects how bad humanity could become, it would take the prize. The plot is focused on Bible prophecy, which is in the hidden messages of the scriptures, which determines a group of fighters seeking power to try total control over the world. How stupid does this writer think people really are? <br /> <br /> The act was the best in the best case. Casper Van Dien has lost his talent to make this film. Michael York's work was a fair match for the role because it was the center of the film and he did a good job. <br /> <br /> This plot was sick and very disturbing. You should not see this movie, with no delicate or immature mind. This is how a good basic plot vs. evil can wander. There must be a lot of floating mental illness around film circles, looking for ways to commercialize this type of junk. There must have been something censored to get a PG-13 rating, but it was still terrible.
