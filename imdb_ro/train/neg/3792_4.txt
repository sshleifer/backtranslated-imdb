I have seen many, many productions of the Nutcracker. Now maybe I have watched this movie from the point of view of the theater director, but I was disappointed. I'm sure people in the specific field of ballet choreography find this impressive production, but from a purely theatrical point of view, I found everything, from design to choreography, to be deprived of imagination and untouched by a "cinematographic image." None of the "strange" and impressive traditional costumes showed what it should have been (candy did not look like candy, rats did not look like rats, but rather chocolate kisses), the act was weak, tortured too much for screen, and the choreography did nothing for me. This makes the whole show very satisfactory (at best) as if it did not want to get away from any other production. But remember, again, from the artistic perspective of a theater director, not a dancer or choreographer, but a direct director of male theater.
