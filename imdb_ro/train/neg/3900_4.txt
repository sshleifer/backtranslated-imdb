Like someone reading the book, I can say that this is far inferior to the big American version with Gwyneth Paltrow. There are various reasons for this. First of all, Emma is too unpleasant. Yes, he has defects and is not the easiest person to like - but the viewer should not start to despise it. Secondly, Mr Knightly is mistaken. Burying and melancholy in this version are better suited for a Bronte or Gaskell adaptation than Austen and throws the mood of the whole business "out". Third, Samantha Morton is too strong actor to be relegated to Harriet's role; and why was she made to look so sick? Harriet should be blonde and thriving - not to think it will be taken to the next scene. Fourth, the structure was bitten and cut scenes. At the end, when Emma decides he loves Mr Knightly, it is completely confusing, because this narrative has not been properly portrayed and carried along the film. Fifth, what exactly happens to Mrs. Elton's accent? She left the sounds like an American actress who was trying to suppress her own accent from the beginning, everyone on halfway and then back to English at the end. Eventually, this dragged to the end. The book and the big movie version ends with Emma and Knightly's wedding. This version gets confused after the wedding announcement without showing us the ceremony. <br /> <br /> Overall, a rather haphazard attempt. Read the book or rent the Paltrow version instead
