A terrible movie like everyone else said. What made me laugh was Scott McNealy's cameo appearance, awarding a programmer shot in front of a wall of SUN logos. McNealy is the CEO of SUN Microsystem, a company that practically defies hatred of Microsoft. They helped make antitrust complaints against Microsoft. So were they stupid enough to think this bad movie would add fuel to that fire? There is no public record I see about SUN involvement, but clearly producers of this movie know Scott McNealy. An interesting mystery.
