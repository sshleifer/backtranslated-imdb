I bought this movie at a sale of car boots, so I did not expect to be a horror film at the same level as A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) or The Hills Have Eyes (1977), but I thought it will still be nice enough to look. However, it turned out to be unpleasant, but the acting film and the general movie were witnesses, such as the way the killer of the "countless" kills the victims and how all the killers happen to be young blonde women. It was a stereotypous horror movie. I say this for the following reasons: 1) Three blonde women in danger, most of them killed. 2) One survives by crawling in the dark as he is followed by the killer. 3) Surprise surprise, help comes in the form of a chick! By using three simple points, I saved you two odd hours, summing up this horrible excuse of a horror film, so you are now lucky enough not to have to look at it.
