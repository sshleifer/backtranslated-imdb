"Screaming The Skull" opens with a warning and offer for free funeral service if you have to die looking - Now it's a hook! The story itself has a rather interesting interest in a horror film: the exhilarating husband marries a rich woman with a history of mental illness, then tries to convince her that he is ill with hidden noises, mysterious clashes and skulls that appear at times unfortunate. Add to the formula a pretty creepy gardener who still cherishes the memory of the first wife of the man to whom he was dedicated. Perhaps only the 1950s did not have the technology to remove some of the scenes of hope needed to succeed this film, the techniques used here seem to be contradictory and banal. But again, when I first saw House on Haunted Hill as a nine-year-old, he gave me heebie jeebies in the same way that I'm sure this film made for young spectators of the same age. <br /> <br /> Do not misunderstand me, the movie is not terrible, it seems to be sometimes tedious. But there is a high atmospheric tension in the house, generally immense but not furnished, Whitlock, and the gardens and the pool are a pleasant touch. For me, the best-played scene involves the fact that Eric Whitlock (John Hudson) maniacally walks into the pond, trying to recover the hidden skull, simply dressed in clothes and everything, in perfect contrast with the mentally challenged gardener (director Alex Nicol in-hand). It makes you wonder who the real dimwit was. In her good way, perhaps the most shocking thing about the film: How about that neat road, Whitlocks make their first appearance in the 1958 winged door! That made me at least jump from my chair!
