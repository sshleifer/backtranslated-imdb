A previous commentator said the movie is not that bad. What the?!?!?! The film glorifies child molestation. Oh, but Sylvia Kristel was naked in her, so give her 5 out of 10 stars. Why not a 10? Because the filmography was "agonizing," the child's shock was "unrealistic," and the fat friend was "irritating." Nowhere in review the reviewer expresses any indignation that an American film in 1981 presented scenes of a child having sex with a mature woman. I happened to catch this steaming funnel of a movie while I was at a hotel with Showtime. For me, even if the fat friend had a storm and deserved an Oscar, I should have given the movie just 1 star. Howard Hessman on this TV played in the movie at the same time he appeared in the WKRP is particularly ridiculous. But do not take my word!
