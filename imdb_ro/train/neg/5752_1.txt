They usually do not comment, but there are things to be said. If it starts ... <br /> <br /> The actor, on the side of Jeremy London, was horrible! I did not think it could be so bad. The plot could have been good if it were well directed, along with a good solid performance from the main actor. Unfortunately, this is one of those movies you've read and you think it has great potential to be fun, but to be disappointed from the start. <br /> <br /> Well, at least we laugh good. I would not waste my time if it was you.
