I like bad movies. I like to rent bad movies with my friends and destroy them for their duration. Then there are scary movies like this. Redline is not just a bad film, it's a sign that the American film industry should pay, for the sake of the spectator, at least the scriptures before funding a movie. If a stereotype took a carp, this movie would give birth to it. The story is unbearable, and the surrounding action is ridiculous. Nadia Bjorlin and Eddie Griffin probably have the weakest screen chemistry I've seen in a good time and even individually should be isolated from humanity and beaten with an orange bag until they change their profession street traders with which they can legitimately qualify). Moreover, the way Angus Macfadyen convinced himself to make this film is so far from me that I can not even think of an analogy. I'm a true fan of him, but that made me ask him. <br /> <br /> To summarize. Several people want revenge for different reasons (and if you care enough to know what they are, you are a greater person than me) so much to turn into violence (I think). The film is like Ouroboros, the snake that swallows his own tail, that it is an endless cycle of confusion and dialogue that does not fit human ears. This film is essentially a large commercial car for the first half of the year and a movie indispensable for the rest, should be avoided at any cost. <br /> <br /> I would like to find a positive film look, and I think it is in the fact that the credits are finally rolling. PS Nadia Bjorlin, if you played these two songs in this movie then you are a hack and I hope the old age hurts you. P.S. If you rent this movie looking for a fun experience, listen to the beautiful lyrics of Nadia Bjorlin.
