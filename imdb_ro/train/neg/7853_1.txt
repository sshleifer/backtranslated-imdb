No plot, crappy action, and useless gore .... This should be a horror movie? There is no fear or suspense, just BOOM BANG GORE, then finished. Some sailors are in the desert for a strange and terrible motive and are hunted by those mutant beasts from the first film, which was good and should have been left to that. just another excuse for money and the use of unnecessary violence, just like the "Saw" sequel. They know no matter how useless the plot is and the more they can add, people will see it. I miss horrible suspense movies. Come on to Hollywood, you can do much, much better.
