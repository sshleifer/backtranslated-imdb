One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Action was terrible for both children and adults. Most of the characters did not show too little or too little emotions. The light was terrible and there were too many challenges during the day when the movie was shot (in the scene where the boat was destroyed, there are four photos, the sheriff and father on their boat, Jillian and Molly on the evening of swimming, the other children during the day * when supposedly evening evening * at the river bank and doctor, Beatrice and Simonton at night, but not in the evening, getting off the boat.) The best actor in the film was probably from the sheriff, Cappy a sliding character when the pulse detector * Everything is when people die, beeps * show that Cappy has died, he still moves while the beep can still be heard and while the assistant manually checks his pulse , then shows the pulse again and then MEA finally dies.) I think it will not be perfect because it's an independent movie, but it might be better. It's not worth watching, frankly, even for children. You might look at something good like The Lion King or Toy Story if you see something you'll remember.
