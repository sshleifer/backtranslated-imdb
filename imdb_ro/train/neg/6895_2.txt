The land is rocky. The actress is somewhere south of the Jr. High School game. Cinematography is not bad, but it seems to have been cut with a layout. I could not decide it was an intentional hockey blow or if people behind her thought I was doing a good movie. Think Death Valley Days meets Mayberry RFD. People moving to a modern "no law" town, wearing six fast-track guns. He has more than just a fair share of the "cutsey" stuff. Imagine Good Boys going down to an old farm and park Ford Mustang right in front of a rails. Imagine the hotel clerk watching an obviously occidental (hemisphere) movie that has a Japanese sound track but with subtitles in English. Everything is very strange, but it can be improved if you watch it while you are in a small peyote. It's a real curiosity with the modern parallels with every western film you can think of. There is even a modern version of the good-looking dancing girl, and a Jewish chorus in the soundtrack. Really! If someone brings this to you at home for a Saturday night movie, tell them your DVD has died.
