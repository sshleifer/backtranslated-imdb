The previous display has obviously worked on the movie. It's a joke how bad it is and nobody will see this type of movie as it did. Reiterating all the actors' names and what they were before is a sure sign that he is involved in some way. > <br /> Now it's on Cinemax and I was sure it was a movie where porn stars (the one called Ava is gorgeous and well-equipped) were forced to do something else for a crazy motif. <br /> <i> When I saw it for the first time, I was sure it was made around 1986 and I was born in '73, so I thought I knew what I was talking about ... but not ... was done in 1993! Incredible! <br /> <br /> Although I would call one of those so bad, they are good movies. To see a train wreck.
