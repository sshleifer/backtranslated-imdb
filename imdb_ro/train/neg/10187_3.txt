A stupid and mindless mistake about a jet packed in hours by mechanics who never worked on airplanes (piloted by Burgess Meredith) pursuing a Porsche racing car running on Lee Majors' ten-year old sludge gasoline with Chris Makepeace as a runaway technician - who can make McGyver spare parts in a radio receiver that can simultaneously take all the frequencies and who somehow learned how to buy and use chemicals to make great explosives in a perfectly peaceful society . As it sounds great. Terrible waste of Burgess Meredith, but Chris Makepeace can at least be forgiven because it was just the second film.
