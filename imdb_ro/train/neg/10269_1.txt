this movie is scandalous. of scandal, that is terrible. I had more fun looking at dry paint at my local iron store on an August day while suffering from a migraine and heat stroke. the act became progressively worse as the "movie" advanced, and the use of the euphoric drugs by the directors became evident as the final scenes approached. when she was shot misty, she decided it would be prudent to blink in the mood. who was not intelligent. honestly, Stevie wondered if he could have caught this with his eyes closed. if you decide to play with a nail gun while you are intoxicating and watching this movie, remember that your nail gun will probably give you a better story to tell your friends.
