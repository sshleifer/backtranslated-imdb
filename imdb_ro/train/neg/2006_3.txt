It would be helpful to know why it took so long for a book like the movie ready "that the" House by the Door "be adapted for film or television. The book was copyright protected in 1978. One of the reasons could be the problem of designing the "house." The house in this Lifetime movie is indeed so ugly that I can not imagine anyone buying it, in fact it is so ugly that someone would have come and it would destroyed as soon as it was built I'm not crazy about the musical horror books but it was hard to give up when I came around it ten years ago The main characters are not the sort of people to look for something occult in life, and this is one of the strengths of the book. There are no people who would conclude that the architect was a type of demon (or the personified devil) without assisting and analyzing the events described so well in the book. whole this is, for the most part, a book in which nothing can be done, and I do not think it is addressed to those who lead life. Maybe someone will come up with another version of the book in the years to come. A better house ... a better music .. a better scenario and darker lighting ... surely it would help.
