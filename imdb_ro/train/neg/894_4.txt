I saw him yesterday at the Sao Paulo Intl Film Festival. Just before I went here to see how it was rated, and at that time it was 7.4, a fairly nice rate ... After 15 minutes I was dying to get out (never did that), but felt embarrassed to do so as the filmmaker was in the screen. I did not like it at all, the dialogues are superficial and do not lead anywhere, the characters are fewer than the dialogues, nothing leads anywhere, and the worst and worst: a lot of Siemens and Organics publications about the film. Despite the fact that I have already paid to go to the film and have fun, I have to be bombarded by the main character running on the internet, and Siemens mobile opens all the time on my laptop; or another character who has a bath or cut hair just to have Organics Shampoo displayed enormously on the screen! All this would be bearable if plot, character, romance, anything good, but it was bad, very bad! I do not know how to do sex in town. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time or money.
