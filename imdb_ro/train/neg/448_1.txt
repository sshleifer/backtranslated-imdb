What I hate about this show is how poor the writing is. These women have no self-respect or dignity. The whole plot is that he throws himself at boys. Amanda Bynes's talent is completely wasted. She was brilliant on "Everything" and her show. Why would they and Jenny Garth write like vapid, airhead, desperate, men watching, Wannabes "old maid" is beyond me. Their plots and dialogue remind me of "The Simpons," says Homer whenever his cartoon character Poochie is not on the screen, "Everyone Should Ask, Where's Poochie?" All the discussion centers talk about a guy, then crying to a guy. Sometimes he changes the guy instead. Then they come back together or break up at the end. The two women are either superficial, foolish or sexually dependent adults. The only word I can think of is sucking.
