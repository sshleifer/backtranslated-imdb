This movie was broadcast on radio, television, magazines, etc. Almost every hour or every problem. When we went to the Kinnepolis multiplex, our expectations were very high. But oh, boy, how sad this movie is! It's a Hollywood-style movie about a movie in a movie. The shades show so clearly that we are not ready to make big movies at Hollywood. I'm not a film critic, but I think a good movie starts with a good script. And the script is a nightmare. As the line of the subject says, there is nothing, and then the loops. You could just watch TV without seeing anything. That was the feeling I had when I saw Shades. Shades is a BAD Production!
