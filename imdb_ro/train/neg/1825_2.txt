I'm not sure what. I could not laugh at her. I had an open mind. I did not want to be a tight thing. But I seriously could not laugh at this movie. It was not funny. Some parts seemed like Ben Stiller and Jack Black were trying too hard. Just because you put two very fun people does not mean it will be a great comedy. Some movies should not be made. This is one of them. Because he does a lot of old jokes, and the act was stupid. I know, I know it's a comedy. Kind of at least. But I was not impressed. I'm sorry, but I can not give anything less than two. And that's all I give. <br /> <br /> 2/10
