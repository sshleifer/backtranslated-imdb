This film is too skeletal. It's a rather low film (I hope!) Which apologizes to some extent, but the lack of a decent distribution and a detailed plot suffer too much. Phillips is quite credible in his role as a son of a well-broken family looking for himself (although his family is ... er ... well, a little white ...), but the rest of the cast is clinging to straw. Every moment that has the potential is ruined by excessive melodrama and there are too many sub-parcels (which is a clear sign of plot failure, they needed filler ...) I would not recommend this movie to anyone is no fan base Phillips , or who has absolutely nothing * to do. 4/10.
