Winner and Fighter Fighter. The young "Red" is wearing full clothing and extremely short trousers and coats. It took about 20 minutes and I realized it could be a pedophile dream. Up-beat music sounds like something I hear at a strip club. In fact, I think this movie is a sick joke - it's not a family movie. Gross, glad I was watching this with my daughter, I do not want her to believe it's normal for families to see porno quasi-child porn together. Very sorry, Sadly that it is sold as a family film, Joey Fatone will probably be embarrassed he was in it. And what is advertising like a "spectacular special effects" ??? The effects show a low budget, they are terrible.
