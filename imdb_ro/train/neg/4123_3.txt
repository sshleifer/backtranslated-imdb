Although the beginning suggests Still quiet on the Western Front, this bad and evil version of the war moves away largely to a much better contemporary. This describes the funniest war ever fought, with the first hour and a half devoted to romanticism and good times. When we finally see a battle, it's lame: An enemy plane flies over? Drag it down (in a single photo). Sniper in the tree? Kill him before he shoots. The enemy soldiers in the forest? Do not worry, they surrender with joy. Ho-hum. <br /> <br /> Tepid, turgid, predictable ... <br /> <br />
