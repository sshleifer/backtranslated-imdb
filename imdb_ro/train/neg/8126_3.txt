I did not think it was absolutely horrible, as some seem to do. It goes like one of those horror films that can lose your time in the middle of the night, when you can not sleep, though it's not better than that. It is true that acting is not great - I thought Marianne McAndrew as Cathy Beck, for example, met with absolutely no passion - but the main problem is that many aspects of the plot did not make much sense. Becks is on a trip described by John (Stewart Moss) as part of the work and partly the honeymoon they never had (now romantic!) The work has something to do with the tourist caves, which itself strangely sounds a group of tours through a cave refers to someone's work?), but it becomes stranger when we find out that he is a doctor doing research in preventive medicine (huh? This connection lost me completely.) A hit by a bat as it is in the cave, it begins to turn into what it is supposed to be a hybrid of bat-man (though when we see it in makeup, it looks much more like a monkey of a kind ) and starts a killing shot. Here's another problem. The first killing is a nurse in a hospital. At first, everyone thinks her death was an accident. The second murder is of a young girl who is described as having her neck thrown. The sheriff (Michael Pataki) tells her that her death was similar to that of a nurse (which means that her neck was destroyed? - How could anyone think it was an accident?) And what about the sheriff? She seems pretty stupid to the scene in Cathy's hotel room when she drinks her drink and then almost rape, and then everything seems to go back to normal. It is burdened with an end that left almost everything unresolved and also with one of the most irritating themed songs I've ever heard in a movie. Even for all this, it was something that kept me from looking. Sometimes, pure cheese can bring you over an hour and a half. Pretty bad, yes - but not as terrible as some say.
