Hiya people, <br /> <br /> Well, this movie is really shit. Think of "True Love" in reverse. Nothing suits perfectly, nothing is coherent, and certainly nothing makes you laugh. Love is rare in this movie. It's a total flop. As I have shown, however, there are three redemption points about this film's roughened potential. A) With a star invoice of Jennifer Love Hewitt, there will be hordes of boys who will submit with grace to see this just to catch a glimpse of Hewitt petite with shape-fitting clothing. Let me tell you guys now ... there are some promising scenes .... but it is a very poor eye candy. The "possibilities" here are watered. However, I watched everything that was tempted by the next scene you know what ..... titillating! B) The end is romantic and positive. That is contrary and "over the top" is relevant ..... still for me it was still a positive point. C) Dougray Scott plays a friendly amourous guy ........ UPDATE! THANK YOU! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 2/5, do not worthy of your 10 dollars you <br /> <br /> 2/3 of the way through, I was convinced Jennifer Love Hewitt became the next softcore legend. Although I'm gonna take this back ..... it's very much linked to her next movie. Oh, and her sister is pretty bad. Her husband is kinda stupid ... and what the hell, she's stupid. Next time. I can not wait for the next Love with JLH!
