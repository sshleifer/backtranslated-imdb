Wendy Wu: Homecoming Warrior has a very good, powerful plot but is ruined by the briceag details throughout the movie. I am a young teenager and I did not really enjoy this movie. I thought the effects were horrible, but it might seem fun to younger children. The motion matrix has destroyed the action, you know it was absolutely false. Then there was Yen Lo, an evil spirit that temporarily possessed random people and a return that Wendy struggled to win. It all ends like a typical movie that feels good when Wendy and her cousin Buddhist Shen monk defeat Yen Lo (and destroy him forever) in the end. So Wendy is learning a lesson ... blah, blah, blah. I'm ready for the next DCOM.
