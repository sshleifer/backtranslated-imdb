This kind of movie reminds me of the movie A Mary-Kate and Ashley, worse. Only rich sisters one thing think, although Alysons more actress in this movie Amanda michalka was good sometimes, but Alysons act stunk. I think that after high school music they had to come up with something better, and that certainly was not the case. The story line was not that great and I think he should have gotten two more people to play Taylor and Courtney. I'm not a big fan of Alyson Michalka and this movie did not make me better. I think it should be sick to definitely sing and watch this movie if you have nothing better to do (which unfortunately I did not)
