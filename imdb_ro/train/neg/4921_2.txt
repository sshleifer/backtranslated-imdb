Bleed executive producer Wes Craven and Weinstein's financiers for this budget disaster: a thrash-metal update of the "Dracula" metal with a verbally verbatim blow to Bram Stoker (he probably would not have liked his name on this issue ) and nothing much for the rest of us, except for Slasher-style blows and ghosts. Christopher Plummer seems to have defeated Van Helsing today - not just a descendant of Van Helsing, but the real thing; he continues to go with leeches obtained from the corpse of Count Dracula, who was exhumed from his coffin after he was stolen from Van Helsing's vault and flew to New Orleans. That's exactly what New Orleans needs in the 21st century! The movie, well produced, but without a single original idea (except for multi-racial victims), is so repulsive and lazy, and after about an hour begins to repeat itself. * from ****
