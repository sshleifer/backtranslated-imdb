First of all, as a longtime student of the Titanic disaster and a member of several Titanic clubs, I feel right to comment on the film. I do not care how many prizes and awards the movie won, but for me it is still an absolutely horrible film. Cameron had the resources to produce a semi-documentary film about the disaster, but unfortunately chose to turn it into a romantic mushroom. The fact that so many people around the world have fallen for that shows, in my opinion, the sadness of the taste and common sense that film critics and the public have these days. Who said all the movies should have a hero and a heroine to fall in love? In fact, most of the real events are nothing but romantic, and the Titanic disaster certainly was not one. I feel that it takes a better script and a director with a semi-documentary approach and an as little as possible artistic license. I almost threw myself into the last sequence where "dead" lovers meet among other passengers and lost crews that burst into applause. Is it a smart movie? Ask yourself.
