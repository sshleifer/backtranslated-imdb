When I was younger, I liked the show, but now ... BLECCH !!! This show is sappy, poorly written and rarely funny. The three directors were good and fun actors (Saget was much better than what happened with this show, as it was best for Coulier and Stamos was a better actor than the average). After a while, Stamos wanted to get out of the show because he wanted to do more serious things (who could have accused him?). Eventually, the show was canceled when many actors asked for more money. Here are some things that make me crazy about the show: 1. Catch phrases - how many times can a person get up with usual catching expressions, such as "how rude," "you got it," "nerdbomber "," cut it "and" have pity "? <br /> <br /> 2. Kimmy Gibler - the most annoying character ever written for television. <br /> <br /> 3. Writing - Stay and clich√© like an oreo cookie. There is a good chatter writing and a clear writing. The complete house wrote bad. Three men living together in San Francisco - he said enough. <br /> <br /> 5. Unrealistic things - too much to remember. 6. Modern kids - the girls have all the latest shopping malls and you can see the posters of the fashionable recording artists they would be in. Now this show is on Nick @ Nite. I would not call her a classic. I have nothing to say about the people involved because I think many of them are talented themselves. But this show was sweet, I could not stand after a while.
