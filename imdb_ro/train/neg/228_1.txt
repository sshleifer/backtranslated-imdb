I thought it was a movie in New York: wrong! It's a small British rural setting. I thought it was a comedy: wrong! It's a drama ... Well, up to the last third, because after the story gets totally "abracadabrantesque," the symbolic word for a French presidential mandate. It means that, close to nonsense even the reasons would like to bring a sincere feeling. What have I left? Perhaps, a good actress duo: Yes, I know, there are 3 friends, but the red-haired cop is a little invisible to me. High doctrine surprises his fist, and McDowell gives a fine attitude as usual, all in a delicate, soft and almost mute attitude. This gentleness bothers me, because, as other artists or directors, the same pattern always repeats itself. In her case, it is as if, regardless of the movie, she is always the same personality defined by her feelings, her values, which lives infinitely different stories. I still do not know how to set the limit (or fusion) between artists and works. Another positive part of this film is his feminine touch and interesting points of view. Women each have their own way of living, even if they are alone. It brings a lot of tolerance and learning to see how an identical and unique reality can be perceived in as many ways as humans. Eventually, the movie is quite visible, but the great end reduces the desire the next vision.
