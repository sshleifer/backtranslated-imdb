It started with an interesting concern. I always like things in the Civil War and the old secret societies. The more the film progressed, the more I realized that at best it was a movie B. In the second half, it quickly became a movie C, then D, then F, then "I wish that this was not a rental so I can put it in the microwave! " I can not say that acting in all cases was terrible, most of all. Writing, though ... I never read the book. Perhaps the book is well written. The script has been written for over ten years. It was ridiculously superficial, unwavering and uninteresting dialogue, the characters as interesting as a pound of 5 pounds of fertilizer. I really forgot this movie, just like my wife. I am a Christian and I have no problem with films that promote or support Christianity. This film has caused a great disadvantage to the cause. Great, terrible, worthless. If you liked it, I strongly recommend Superman 4.
