this is just the usual Indian garbage that becomes cinematic as the Indians can proudly boast that we have the largest cinema industry, yet the worst. how can other poor countries have real-life movies that challenge the views of those companies, and just keep pumping the garbage. take a look at Russia, Iran, China and Latin America, look at the brilliant films they have and we'll do nonsense like Kisna! Reaching out to real people, no wonder the international community laughs at Cinema Indians.
