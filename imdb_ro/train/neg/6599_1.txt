Who was George C. Scott? George C. Scott was a renowned actor. Basically, any movie he has attended is the better for him. Now George has absolutely nothing to do with this movie ... but he once said something that describes the movie to a T. I do not remember his exact words, but he essentially said that great writing can save evil, but the great act can not save the misspelling. Never this little observation was more true than in "All New Adventures of Laurel & Hardy: For Love or Mummy." The casting of the two leaderships was absolutely perfect. Bronson Pinchot (Laurel) and Gailard Sartain (Hardy) not only look at the songs, but they do an exceptionally good job in imitating real understanding (manners and all). This film should be a long-term testament to their talents. That being said, this movie collapses when it comes to (you guessed it) PAGINS. Apart from the opening dialogue between Pinchot and Sartain (which was very "in character") and a short gag involving a taxi, this film is an absolute chore to stay through. <br /> <br /> PROBLEM # 1: Too much time and effort went into the field. <br /> <br /> I do not want to know why the mummy wants to kidnap the pretty British lady. What I want to see Stan and Ollie (or, at least, their stand-ins). The excess time of the screen was dedicated to explaining the plot or the characters that were not very funny, which the plot turned around them. However, even though this movie would have been all the jokes, we with ... <br /> <br /> ... PROBLEM # 2: Most jokes are what I would call "wet" paper. <br /> <br /> What do I mean by "watered down"? In a slapstick, a character is hurt in an exaggerated way for comedy (Looney Tunes, 3 Stooges ..., or how about Laurel & Hardy?) <br /> <br /> In the "wet-down" weakness ( as they define it), a character becomes slightly hurt or inconvenient, and directors play for the comedy effect. <br /> <br /> Perhaps an illustration would help: <br /> <br /> In Looney Tunes, Daffy Duck is shot by Elmer Fudd. His letter falls and puts it back. This is a classic robbery. In this "gem", Ollie accidentally falls into some people. They are coming back, telling them to be careful and to continue on their cheerful journey. This is not a chocolate. It's not really funny. It's just ... boring ... and this movie is full of such jokes. It's like the bread and butter of this movie. Writers and directors just take these tedious moments and behave as if they were supposed to be funny. However, the example I just gave is the most extreme case, but I can only cut it so hard. Short Story: The movie does not work because the script fails to harness Pinchot's and Sartain's abilities to adorn Stan and Ollie. Instead, the scenario uses a parcel exposure and slide jokes. Watching this movie looks practically two excellent imitators who have not been given any real material to work with. It's not a good movie, it's incredible sleeping aid. (just as long as you move away from "Atoll K" and "Be Big").
