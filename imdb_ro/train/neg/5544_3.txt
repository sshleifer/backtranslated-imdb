While this movie certainly has the smell of a bad movie, it is surprising to be watched on several levels. First of all, for old movie fans, it's interesting to see the role played by Dean Jagger (unrelated to Mick). While Jagger continued to play a very respectable role as a supporting actor (even now the Oscars in this category for 12 O'CLOCK HIGH), his performances are truly unique, as he has a head (not I never saw this before) and because he was by far the worst actor in the movie. This film just shows that if an actor can not act in his previous films, it does not mean that he can not finally learn to be a great actor. Another good example of this phenomenon is Paul Newman, whose first film (THE CHALICE SILVER) is considered one of the worst movies in the 1950s. A second reason to watch the film is grinding it all. The writing is bad, the act is bad and the special effects are bad. For example, when Jagger and an anonymous Cambodian are beating through the water, it is obvious that they really just walk in place and the background is poorly projected behind them. In addition, once they leave the water, the suits are 100% dry !!! Continuity continues and mindless dialogue abounds in the whole movie - so much so that it's hard to imagine why they did not ask Bela Lugosi or George Zucco to play in the movie - because they both played in many horror films. In many ways, this would be a perfect example for a movie class about not making a movie. So while you give it a 3 is probably a little too generous, it's fun to laugh at short, so it's worth watching the bad movie fans.
