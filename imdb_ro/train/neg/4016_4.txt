There is a DVD published in the UK in 2002 Code HRGD002 on the cover, not ASIN, VFC 19796 on the disk, no IFPI code in the inner rim. Probably a direct transfer from VHS. <br /> <br /> There is not much point commenting on an adult movie. But it contains a minimal plot, and the characters are credible. It was seen in the United States in normal cinemas. I saw her in Pensylvannia back in 1975. As such, it deserves a place in an encyclopedia of movies. The DVD has no special features and has no subtitles, and was probably made using a VHS tape source
