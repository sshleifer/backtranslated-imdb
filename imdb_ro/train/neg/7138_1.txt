In fact, this title should be called "PERMA-TURD" from now on. Calling a movie is a transvestite and insult. fearful, angry, cruel, detestable, disgusting, disgusting, frightening, dizzying, exorbitant, fairy, frightening, lurid, evil, ugly, unpleasant, offensive, repulsive, repulsive, shocking, sick, terrible, frightening, wicked, reckless, ruthless
