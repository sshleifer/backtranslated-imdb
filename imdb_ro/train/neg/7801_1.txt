I will keep this as short as possible, because this piece of nonsense only needs a mention. ZOMBIE 90 is one of the worst movies ever made - right there, with another Schnaas zombie entry - ZOMBIE DOOM (aka VIOLENT SH! T 3). These movies suck so badly that everyone involved in their creation should be shot. I just managed to stay with ZOMBIE DOOM (just after ...) - but ZOMBIE 90 is so terribly helpless - even when compared to another horrible film by Schnaas - that I had to go through all the things after the first 10 minutes. ZERO acting skills, unequal gore, horrible camera in the video camera, dubious ridiculous ... it just goes on and on. I really can not find one redeeming thing about this trash - and usually I find NOMENE redeeming in almost every movie. This is really one of the worst movies ever made - You have been warned ... 1/10
