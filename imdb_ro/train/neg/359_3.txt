I saw my beautiful part of the wrong endings and final films, but I do not remember any movie that committed absolute suicide like this. The filmmakers clearly hoped the big twist would "surprise" all of us ... and so did it, but maybe not in the way the executives hoped. I was surprised that Connery, Harris, Fishburn and Capshaw had to deal with this turkey, individually or collectively. The film up to the last thirty minutes was quite interesting and I like the way the story unfolded and the nature of the movie in general. But once the revelation was revealed, the holes and inconsistencies of the plot were remarkable, the avenging motive for revenge was badly conceived, and the way things so elaborate for Bobby Earl were ridiculously taken over. What's worse is that once the breath has been revealed, the rest of the movie has become extremely predictable. Harris has done extraordinary performance, and Connery is like Morgan Freeman, because he never performs badly, even if the movie is not great! So, on the whole, it starts well and the spectator is interested in the performance. The last 30 minutes are one of the most memorable diving in the history of cinema.
