Difficult to call The Grudge a horror movie. At best, it made it easy to jump from surprise a few moments. If someone forgets the scary (scary) dimension and looks on other parts of the film, it is again disappointed. The act is ok but not great. The story may be somewhat interesting at first, while someone is trying to get what's happening. But in the end it is understood that there is not much to understand. The "frightening" elements seem to have sometimes been added to the script for no reason ... <br /> <br /> So ... (yawning) Watch this movie if you have nothing more interesting to do, such as cutting carrots or looking at the clouds.
