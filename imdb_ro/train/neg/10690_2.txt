I think it's possible that I saw worse movies, but this is a real stinker! the plot is unimaginable, but that's not the worst. Direction is not where close to what you would expect from Andy Ching. he is capable of a good job, but failed to shoot this movie together. Angie's harmony, playing the role of feminine as a reporter dogging in who is behind the assassination of the president, really killed the role. there was no chemistry with kindness, her behavior was flat and wooden, and the five-inch heels she wore along the film were absurd. this excursion for harmonics puts it solid at the bottom of list "b". And what was the good thinking of Cuba? he has in his credit a series of remarkable performances, but this was far below what we have come to expect from him. poor james woods and burt reynolds. poor poor poor poor poor
