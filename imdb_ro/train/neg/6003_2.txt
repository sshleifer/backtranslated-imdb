Sundown - with the weakest and sweetest vampires ever seen, accompanied by one of the most inappropriate scores ever written - and with Shane the vampire, which is every movement and spoken word, was so ridiculous that I broke out laughing half the time and the eyes of others. Vampires do not seem to have any special power - except for force (sometimes) being able to stop a lamp with the mind (once) and ... - that's really. Do you ever imagine that Dracula pretended to worry about a fight because he ran out of bullets? Me neither. Basically, any other movie - Dracula - would eat this for breakfast, skin the followers, and use bones as toothpicks. The main scenario of the film is that a family of four people is caught in a fight with vampires - Dracula against old people. It could have been an old fun, but the dramatic music was clearly written by someone who made this film too seriously and ends up destroying the rest of the movie that has not already been destroyed by clay bats, and the script ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Finally it's too bad to be funny. Sure, they have some funny moments, but they are few and they are very distant.
