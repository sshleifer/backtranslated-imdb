This movie is painfully slow and has no plot. It sends the life of a group of men who were fired. One of the oldest is sincere in his attempt to get a job. There may be a social commentary here, but it is muddled that no one is painted in a very sympathetic light. I do not understand why he had 7.8 when I decided to see her. I looked at all the tiring work and created expectations for a great redemption salary. No luck. The IMDb rating has always been a good fit for my tastes. Anything over 6.5 was worth watching. And my wife says Javier Barem does not look really good in this movie. He's not my guy, so my deal does not mean too much. Stands up. I give her a 1.
