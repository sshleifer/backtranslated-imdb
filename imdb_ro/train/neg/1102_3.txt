First of all, I have to admit that both of the films I saw from this director, I saw without titles and so I lost the points. My Czech is not bad, but after going through two of his films, I would not want to try not even to learn. Samotari is too cool. Too cool. It's about ten different story lines that merge and display together. It's not so unusual in a city of Prague size (tiny, indeed.) The main characters are between 20 and 30. They have a job and only one study. The best character is the young girl from the Balkans. Her feelings are resumed by immigrants here on every cursed day. It's about that. The only big character. All others make their own lives quite alone. How can I sympathize with such obvious incompetence? Perhaps there are interesting bits with Japanese tourists, but do I need another stereotype in the movie? If you like good music, watch this movie. If you want to laugh at the stupidity of others, see this movie. If you like irony and dry humor, look at an original Jarmusch, not an imitation. And in no case do you see Ondrejk's film, Septej (Whisper.) That's if you do not enjoy homophobic stereotypes.
