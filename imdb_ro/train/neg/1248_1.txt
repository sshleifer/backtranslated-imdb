This movie was bad because there was nothing interesting about it. It was kind of a remake, but again, not really. I was very disappointed with the tools Tim Burton has at his disposal. It had a great make-up and CGI available and a lot of money (100 million dollars), but you can frankly say that what I received was as good as the original movie that was made for less than 6 millions of dollars? Heck no. So in this sense, the movie fails. At least in the original film, the scene of the statue of freedom was shocking, but there was nothing shocking in this film even at the end of the scene because you could see her coming. And by the way, if you give a thought, and I did, you can figure out how the end could happen. I just wish I had a time when I thought about thinking. This movie would have been brilliant and entertaining if it remained in the line of the first film and adopted part of "Under the Planet Monkeys." Here's how I'd write it: An astronaut (really should have been more than Marky Mark, because he's not good enough to care for a movie by himself, so I'd put three boys) would land on what they think would be another planet, they will meet people (not the sound), a city driven by monkeys, have been hunted, made friends with some good monkeys, discovered that they are on the ground by finding ruins destroyed, running into mutant madmen living underground, a war breaks out between mutant humans and monkeys, and then ... well, let your imagination run wild as you want it to finish. But my point is that there could have been more to this movie. Unfortunately, Tim Burton really knows how to destroy a good thing. Consider what he did with the Batman series. He's a broken director, no matter what people think. He is trendy, so it must be good thinking. Sorry but no. If someone else had done this, they would have proven better and would have been more satisfying.
