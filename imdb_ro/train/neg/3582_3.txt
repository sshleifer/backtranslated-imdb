No, it's not the horror film ... This is actually a love story. The ring is a silent film of 1927 that plays two boxers and the woman who comes between them. He loves the boxer known as "One Round" Jack. He loves him until the champion comes. Even if she marries a single round, she starts flirting open with the champion until the final boxing fight between a round and a champion. She returns to the corner of a single round, even when things look the most grim, and he miraculously finds the inner power of winning the fight and winning his wife's love back. This movie was very early in Hitch's career, but the boundaries of time do not have to make him make a lasting film. Although there are special movie tricks and comedy relief, this film just does not support any of its later works. Perhaps it was extremely risque for the time, with the shameless adultery wife. Maybe it was pulling back in 1927. As you look through all these old movies, it's amazing how I think they could be redone on today's screen and even get out. Maybe I should be the one who ... Skip this movie if you do not intend to see all of Hitchcock's movies. You could fall asleep in the middle.
