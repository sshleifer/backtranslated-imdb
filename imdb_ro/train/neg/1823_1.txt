Jack Black's character, Tim Dingman, Envy's "Dreamer," finds wealth and success in the idea of ​​an aerosol spray "Vapoorize" which, when sprayed on a dog dung, makes poo disappear into thin air. <br /> <br /> For a moment we hope Vapoorize is a real product so I can spray it on this film's "stinker" and make it disappear in thin air. <br /> <br /> Although Envy is not the worst movie I've seen in the past 12 months (this honor goes to The Cat in the Hat), it has the honor of having a close second. , not sad, not nothing. A true "Stinkeroo" !!!! <br /> <br /> Un 0.2 of 10!
