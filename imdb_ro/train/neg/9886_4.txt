This is Peter Falk's movie. Period. I was 10 years old when this movie came out; I was already a movie movie. Of course, my parents did not see this movie when it came out, but I was in love with the text of her ads and the aura in which it was an important film. Okay, 34 years later I saw the movie - never seen a movie directed by Cassavetes. It's a hack, on the whole. Zero sense of synchronization, editing. Gena's performance reminds me too much of Dustin Hoffman's status in "Rain Man": technically, but entirely a note. As Tom Cruise stole "Rain Man," Falk takes the cake for this film. I was angry with Gena's performance, really all year round - seemed more appropriate for "Awakenings" (blecch!). It's not just her fault: it's a basketball case from the first scene to the last. I never see why? But Falk's character looks real and WONDERFULLY is made by Falk as a seriously flawed man. Give up at least an hour (a necessary editor!) And this would have been an artistic portrait not of a woman under the influence of a simple man, Cro-Magnon, who is facing a wife who does not work and yet can not occupies her three children and her husband's hours of work. Rather, I remember Cassavetes for "The Dirty Dozen" or "Baby Rosemary's". He would have been a better director if he had cut off his own overflowing tendency - as demonstrated by this film. grain
