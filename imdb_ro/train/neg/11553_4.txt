Francis Ford Coppola had a brain aneurysm for some time after directing "Revelation Now", which made him totally incapable of making a good movie? <br /> <br /> You have to ask yourself what the director "Na≈üul" and "Conversation" thought when he made the film bad. He gives Kathleen Turner a main vehicle playing a woman who moves in time and resumes her adolescence, knowing all the things adult life has taught her, and Turner, the band that is, does what she can but this movie could not be saved by anyone. He does not even have the style and, considering his director, one can expect that, even if he had nothing else, he would have that. <br /> <br /> Grade: C-
