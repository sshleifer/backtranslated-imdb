Another horror hit in which a bully adolescent fights with a madman and his supernatural friend who wants to take over! Yes, but the fact that it was from Canada gives her a slightly different feeling. The Brain asks Jim Majelewski, the upset teenager, in a treatment whose leader proves to be a worship leader, helped by a nasty big brain. Maybe Jim stops him? I think that since our northern neighbor has done everything they've done, they have the right to make at least one ridiculous horror movie. But still, they probably want to be known because they have a national medical care and all of them. Evil had a brain. Why did not the people who made this movie have done it?
