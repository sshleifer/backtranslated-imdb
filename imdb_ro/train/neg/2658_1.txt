Watching "Surrender, Dorothy" by CBS, I wondered why Diane Keaton would want to be in it (not because it's a television movie - with the lack of appealing roles for slightly larger actresses, it's no wonder why winning Oscar Award artists such as Keaton are returning to TV - but because they do not offer opportunities for Keaton to shine). A single mother, suffering from the sudden death of her 20-year-old daughter, is forced - and gradually becomes a friend of - the group of young people her daughter had approached at the time of the accident. Adapted from the novel, this teleplay gives us a group of self-absorbed characters that we should cross the street to avoid. Apart from being rude and dim, these fake people are incredibly unconvincing, as is the neat script and the bungalow near the beach where the children live (a young man wearing shirts to tell us he is gay, hears Diane Keaton saying : Teacher, Dorothy, "and actually asks," That's from the Oz Wizard, is not it? "" No, genius, it's from "Citizen Kane"!) Keaton Wanted to make this material based on the object of confrontation of death. She tries to turn this distinct woman into a shadow of her character (a lot of crooks), but she does not feel good to the viewer, since Keaton has always been full of heat and it's a crazy harp that does not teach many lessons about her self-discovery trip (the movie quickly forgets that it's a dead woman and becomes a odd for a mother's wicked wreck seems to be an exaggerated hippie that has not been pi she was never in love with her.) This is a kind of film actor who promotes talk shows with the warning "It should help many mothers who live there." I can not imagine anyone helping me, since it is inherently a downer, muddled and confused. She's upset.
