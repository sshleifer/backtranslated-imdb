Kid found as a child in garbage and raised to a martial arts academy has a talent for diving baskets. With the help of the man who found him, he enters college and is promoted in the championship as he searches for his true parents. Infinite Better in Piece Comedy Action is a real mess as a whole. Seems he is striving for a Shaolin Soccer driver's basketball version, but the comedy is shot, her concentration wanders more than a Chihuahua with ADD on the quadruple espresso. I wondered, "What I'm looking at." I've seen it from start to finish and still do not know what the hell happened. It's a shame because there are some great action scenes, some fun jokes and occasional moments, but nothing, none ever happens together, I would make a pass.
