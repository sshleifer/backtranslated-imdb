We had the misfortune to lose 10 pounds for buying a new SS movie on DVD: Forta Attack. Now, usually, I can suspend my faith by watching such films. A pinch of salt and a few beers on a dark evening on a couch watching a loud late night is perfect for a single alpha man like me. I bought this movie thinking of seeing wonderful martial arts and shooting them. Segal is old and swollen, the plot was ridiculous even after the SS standards and to cover all of Segal's act (such as from the beginning) is extremely terrible. So, in fact, half of his voice was called by a man who did not call anything like him. Whenever SS waist no longer acts (a point of interest) of the crew were so horrible in their work, they could not record the sound properly. The voice will move back and forth between Mr. Whisper Segal and the man who makes the voice for the Honda ads! Plot wise is not the problem because most action movies work along the same premise as this, nothing new there. The usual mix of characters who will die horribly as cannon fodder and bad guys waiting to be blown away. Avoid this movie as if you were avoiding a speed train or a H5N1 flu shot. <br /> <br /> This was a public health warning.
