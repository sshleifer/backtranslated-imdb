My husband and I are the parents of an autistic boy who lives in the same locality as the screenwriter of this film. I was very upset that JCC brings this movie to the Jewish film festival because of the portrayal of Frankie's mental handicapped character. We came to see this movie at the local theater when it came out. I asked for money back. We will encourage the screenwriter to donate some of the funds to the CCP's Achad program to apologize. We did not like to see Frankie - a teenager with mental disabilities and maybe even autism - as part of a joke in which he keeps something to look at the nannies breasts. There was no point in telling Frankie anything but saying "hey, being mentally sick is fun." Challenges like Frankie are a serious problem. Families like me are really suffering. The writer needs to explain. Do you know families with children with disabilities? Do families with children with disabilities see week after week at the JCC pool?
