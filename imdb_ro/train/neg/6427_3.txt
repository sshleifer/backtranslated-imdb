so I found this documentary strange and really useless. I know he received awards and things, but I personally did not enjoy too much. there was no humor or drama in it to keep you interested, just a bunch of wierdos and their jobs. some of those in the country are quite different, which is not a bad thing, it just did not leave a good impression to me. I was very bored with this film without any crime for my writing creator. the motif of the circus throughout the movie was pretty cool, but I did not succeed, and the robotics and tiling of the lion is certainly not my thing. working with green animals was neat, I really liked the flower gardens, but how did these four jobs connect? I just did not do well to understand why someone would make a movie about it. But if you are in such a thing, you can enjoy it. who must stand in your way. I'm only telling you about possible suffering.
