The premise of this movie is so simple and obvious that only a millionaire in Texas, who has a high level of smoke and whiskey, would have a problem in understanding if someone cried out in the proverbial parking lot. In conclusion, the oil business is in the shirts with the government (or Gummint, if you prefer), the Gummint is in shirts with the Middle East despots, and the CIA is a singular group of double-sided anger that deals to reach any line that comes in their path. The only ones who finish are the good ones, like Mr. Clooney ("Bob"). Oh, and terrorism is a result of the poverty that globalization creates when multinational wickedness leads to the world in search of a tasty takeover or three. This really fits with the 9/11 well-versed offender profiles. In Syriana, this delicate tissue of half-hearted political truths and Hollywood holograms is agitated in a repulsive vermicelli of twisted strands that twist, turn and rotate through the endless circumlocutions of their insignificance, until the poor poet is left alone with the conclusion that: 1. "the director" (good joke) should never be left near a room. <br /> <br /> 2. People like Clooney and Hurt might know how to act, but certainly do not know how to choose a scenario 3. If you want to see a movie that deals with corruption in big business and go to "L'ivresse du pouvoir" by Claude Chabrol, who is inspired, funny and brilliant. <br /> <br /> Empty, doom-shot piffle left at the end of the night-ruining length.
