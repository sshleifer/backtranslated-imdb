it's not bad, but it's not good. it's just fun. <br /> <br /> As a comedy that is supposed to be, it's terrible. not everybody likes that every joke in the movie was made a million times before. It's a shame that all the actors in the movie are usually big, but none of them makes much. and the end is shit.
