Buck's role as The Kahn brings to mind Bob Barker (from The Price is right) who runs a country in the same way he conducts his show. But there's more to chicote and snore in this turkey. Kurt Thomas, as a "hero" facing the child, has some considerable acrobatic skills, but not an actor's talent. There are some frightening moments (especially in the Crazies village) and some impressive martial arts. But any "Ninja" movie will give you much more fun and you will not feel guilty about laughing.
