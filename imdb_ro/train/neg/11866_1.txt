First of all, this film, according to slick, said he won the "best film" at the "Worldfest" Film Festival in Houston, Texas. Hmmm must have been a quiet year. It would not be called the worst ever movie, but it is certainly shit, it is just as awful as other Aussie B viewers "Body Melt", but at least the film does not seem to have been shot on the HI 8 video I think they are film makers, they've seen a lot of Troma movies, and very bad grade B films, thinking they might break into the business that releases this movie. Do not get me wrong, I like really low movies, Just the fact that some characters put fake American accents, almost would make more chances to sell it in states or something. Even the disappointing is over, the show might have been more interesting and a few good scenes of battle. You can fully see that filmmakers are trying to copy Bad Taste with all the explosion of cars, rocket launchers, and many people who have been shot, but the end does not have much humor or a bad taste style. If you like to watch really bad gore movies or are interested in shooting without a budget, watch them, or stay away.
