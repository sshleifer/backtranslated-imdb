This is one of the most ugly and cruel movies I've seen for a long time. Unfortunately, I was mistaken to stick it, since Donald Sutherland's presence misled credibility. [This is the last time it's going to happen.] Lesley Ann Warren's character was disturbing and stupid. There were more intelligent characters than hers who were killed in the movie. This is just one of the many things in this movie that made me wonder, "Where is justice?" Why is this cable so late, so full of sadistic litter, full of pathological chaos? Most of these films seem to have a particular problem with women and it seems they are focused on being terrorized and killed. This movie could have been as suspenseful, without being sick and twisted in this process. Everything that happens is to turn the viewer's stomach into illness and insult the spectator's intelligence. Distribution is misleadingly good. I think they were BAGGED Sutherland first and used it to lure others like woods in it. I struck the waste of time, giving me a shot at this garbage.
