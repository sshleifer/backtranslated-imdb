When I saw this movie on FearNet, I thought it would be a frightening movie. Apparently, it was not so. I have no idea how this movie was allowed to be featured on this site. FearNet is a site featuring scary horror movies. The actor is wonderful on behalf of all the actors. I forgot the story. The story was bad. The movie begins with a man with a scroll with a signature stamped on it. He breaks the seal and some disasters occur. The water turns into blood, the oceans die, the moon turns red, etc. The feminine character was annoying. Many things he did did not make sense. Like when he sees a piece of paper with a date. Incidentally, it is the date she is expected to give birth to her child, and she begins to scare herself and starts researching it and asking religious people what it all means. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler Alert * Two worst things that happened in this movie are the execution of a mentally retarded man who claimed God had told him to kill his parents and the end of Demi Moore's death after she gave birth to her baby and transferred her soul to him. br /> <br /> Here's what's going on. The mentally retarded person is shot and killed and apocalyptic begins. Demi Moore enters a hospital in the midst of a massive earthquake and gives birth to her child. She touches her baby's head, transferring her soul to her child, and then dies. Then the apocalypse stops. Why does God suddenly have a heart change? He gets angry when the governor allows the execution of a mentally retarded man, then does he have everything about forgiveness when a single woman transfers her soul to her child? <br /> <br /> * End Spoiler * <br /> <br /> The film is bad enough. It is another religious purpose of world propaganda. Demi Moore's actress, Michael Biehn and everyone else is excellent. That's all there is. I give this movie 2 stars out of 10. It works well with a lot of nonsense!
