This is the only question we have left with. Why did he blow this movie so much when he had such a big cast? Why was writing so bad, has the audience left nothing to do with the characters? Why did not it make sense? Why did the studio take a perfectly good premise and "Hollywood," the hell out of it, when all she needed was a good, smart story telling? Why? I never understand why movies are beginning to turn into a bunch of nonsense until they're released. I hope that for the sake of Freeman and Spacey, who are Oscar WINNERS, this is never released on the big screens in America. As someone who holds a bachelor's degree in journalism, the whole story is just ridiculous. I think the scenario had a potential, but the execution turned it into a clich√© and a terrible one. Just. Not.
