I would not say it's terrible, but nothing shines in this movie and it's made difficult by a very serious, unbelievable base plot development. It starts well, but once the main blow ends, it becomes a long sublot around a young woman who is not convincing, and some action scenes that are the theater of the unrealistic absurd. For example, there is a prolonged fire at the airport, where light is stroboscopic. There is no explanation for that. How credible is the fact that an airport storage area will have lights that turn on and off confusingly, and enough to let Snipes do its incredible escape route? This is one of the very few scenes of action, dotted with inexplicities, which fail to attract a belief of suspension. In addition, the whole premise seems to be that the CIA United States team pulls you up, but release it by saying "national security" to the British. This gimmick is based on a stereotype that is far from reality to be satisfactory. There are many better action movies out there. Better formulated, better executed. This is sometimes fun, but there is not enough meat on the bone and after a while it gets boring - something that should not happen in a good action movie.
