December holiday specials, like the original Frosty, should be rich, with quality music and a healthy yet easy story. It should have a mystical magic note of holidays. Practically, they should look, sound and feel ... Well, "special" and they should have a decent and appropriate subtext for the December holidays. So when I saw Frosty's Legend, the snowman on TV got my kids (6 and 8) pumped for it by telling them the story of the original Frosty and telling how much I liked the baby. As my wife and children sneaked on the couch to watch the movie, the expectations were high, but in 10 minutes my children got married, my wife and I show us the "look" and throw our eyes. After 35 minutes, my children even asked to sleep - I think they were beaten by insensitive language and unnecessary and disconnected segments. In fact, I was ashamed of the disappointment (and de) with this movie. Unfortunately, Legend of Frosty the Snowman is more like a bad episode of strange strangers, crossing an episode worse than normal Sponge Bob than a classic holiday film. Do not misunderstand me ... these shows are good and I like as much as the next guy, but when I see strange strangers or Sponge Bob, my low expectations (for the mediocre, off-color, zero, mind episodes episodic) are always satisfied. We picked some good books and spent the rest of the reading together. A much better choice than the legendary snow legend.
