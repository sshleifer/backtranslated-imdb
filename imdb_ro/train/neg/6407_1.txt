We watched this movie for 45 minutes and we counted 9 groups. This is a mullet every 5 minutes. Seriously, however, this film is a living proof that the formula works. If it is not broken, it does not need fixin. A streetwise-yet vulnerable hero, a martial arts master ex-overwhelmed with a golden heart and a serial killer with "trouble". Pure magic.
