Why every horror director wants to imitate "The Exorcist" is a complete enigma for me because William Friedkin's "classic" is a very overrated movie and, in my opinion, is not that tense or shocking. Still, here is another clean cleanup, this time Spanish, which repeatedly reiterates the story of a young girl who is possessed of pure evil and turns against her own family. Paul Naschy (who must admit it looks hot here) plays the honorable priest who addresses John Gibson because her sister Leila's behavior has changed drastically since she met her new friend. At first, the priest does not believe, but when John's body is uncovered with his neck twisted, Leila's demonic behavior becomes more visible ... "Exorcism" is not only very neo-original, but also an unbearably boring film! Here Naschy and director Juan Bosch have had an open opportunity to make a religious thematic explosion full of shock and gore and yet the result is a dreadful and total bloodless drama that will almost make you sleep! The last twenty minutes contain some atmospheric moments, though very stupid, and there are quite a lot of female nudes filmed and sleazy. The absolute lack of the budget is not a real excuse because Paul Naschy has already proven himself before he has enough imagination to compensate for the lack of money. This is just a terrible film, the end of the story. Other European rip-offs "The Excorcist" are "Antichrist" and "Beyond the Door" and suck them too!
