This movie should have never been done. What a shame of the budget. Please hire convincing actors and make a suitable movie. Very thin terrain and unconvincing lines. Almost hilarious, and that's a shame for a movie ... It's definitely not worth watching. They keep replaying the same "photos" of a Stealth plane flying away. You've seen them, and that's not worth re-running 3 or 4 times. It's time for Steven Seagal to step out of the movies. they become more and more bitter every time. Black Dawn and Submerged were already bad, but this movie is even worse.
