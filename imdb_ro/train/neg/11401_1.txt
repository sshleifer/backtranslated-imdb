The script was VERY poor, with no arcs enough to care a little about the characters or what's going on with them. The script is too talky and not enough gore or action to even call slow rhythm. The story goes to the point where you just want everyone to keep quiet and die as soon as possible, so you do not have to listen to them by speaking this very discreet and rigid dialogue. In a technical note, the musical mix is ​​much taller and makes it hard to understand what is said most of the time. Again, this could be called a blessing. In general, the same story could have been better said in a short film with a duration of less than 30 minutes. Those accustomed to Sam Raimi and "Evil Dead" would have been good if they were more subtle, but here they seem to be rather a bald bald. Hi, this kind of 35mm budget and That's the best thing to do? However, cinematography, lighting design and photos were really well done.
