I lost the beginning, but I saw most of it. A friend got it on DVD in the cheap room at FYE. The beautiful ones are all very short and yet most of them are still too long. Most of them seem to have forgotten to have fun! A lot of racist / sexist / homophobic humor in it, skits based on stereotypes or skits that use racist terms for people. I try to remember everything I thought was funny in it, and I'm having problems ... The Tunnel Vision Logo is a lipstick with an eyeball in it. The mouth opens and closes over the eyes like the eyelids. Kind of creepy. What a disappointment. Most actors have done better things, and it's fortunate that this bomb has not kept them back.
