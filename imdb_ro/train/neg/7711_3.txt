The heart of this movie was in the right place, no matter where it was. "Attack" is actually a spoof to "Airplane!" (two years ahead - nice going) of what happens when vegetables, or in this case fruits, attack. With any kind of movie magic (stop motion, paper mache on red skateboards, reverse movies, people watching red off the screen, people throwing basketball tomatoes at screen actors), tomatoes really attack everyone in their understanding of the leaves. Then it is up to Mason Dixon (Miller) and a group of spies I would not want to save on any part of the government. Of course, there is a reporter who intervenes (Taylor), who appears in the worst moments, dancing and singing army soldiers, Japanese scientists with double voices, a guy pulling around a parachute and a samurai sword ... and Oh yes, San Diego Chicken before doing great. <br /> <br /> The bands here are not so great. In fact, you may be able to behave better after seeing them. Some of the dialogues are useless bad ("Please pass the ketchup" - there is something to say in front of the tomatoes.) And in terms of "Puberty Love" goes ... well, I can not blame the tomatoes for sparks hearing it. What's good about this? Well, I liked the theatrical song and the early credits, and it was a four-person scene on the phone as soon as it was pretty well executed. ... it's about that. Three stars. It's not a "Killer" comedy, but it's trying. Rock on, Peace.
