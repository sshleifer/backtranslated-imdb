I'm easy to have fun. I liked "Hot Shots" and "The Naked Gun" and their many sequels, even when most people considered them unbearable. I even managed to enjoy most of Pauly Shore movies. There's only one movie I've seen and that I can honestly say was bad ... and that's it. It's been a while since I saw it, but I remember staying in theater thinking, "It's a bad movie, why did I see that?" It's just the only movie I can not recommend.
