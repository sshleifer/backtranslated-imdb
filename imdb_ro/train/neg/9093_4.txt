I saw this movie today for the first time and never heard of it before, probably because of its weak message. <br /> <br /> First, the direction itself is pretty good, the actors played well and the CGI (I'm not a fan of CGI) is magnificent. But that's not just a movie. No story, no message behind some nicely exploited talents. Or I have to make people remember, the art of a director is not just your vision, but you know how to tell a story. And this is what is missing for the whole 7 minutes. <br /> <br /> There is a simple rating of 4.
