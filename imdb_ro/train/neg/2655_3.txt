** 1/2 for this farce Diane Keaton. Someone should tell Mrs Keaton, enough with Annie Hall's philosophy and hat. This move is just too much Keaton's daughter, Sara, dies in a traffic accident, while her boyfriend survives. Keaton, who could not get to the phone at first, as she was in the bag with her buddy and pulled out the phone's connector, was grieving in a new way for the grievers. <br /> <br /> She retires to the summer place where all Sara's friends are sitting. She cleans the house, sleeps two days and then begins to reveal things that would be better not to be revealed. It looks like the cute Sara slept with her girlfriend and the guy who eventually married her. In addition, he had an abortion due to this guy. We've all put ourselves on this guilty journey now. Her only hope is to find the elusive diary Sara kept. She also hopes that Adam, who is a playwright, will not include all this in another play. When the journal is found, it was written in Japanese. Sara had a PhD in this language. There is no wonderful news for Mom when a piece of the diary is translated by a Japanese chef into a Japanese restaurant. Naturally, everything seems to be fine in the end. <br /> <br /> The title of this shmaltz comes from The Wizard of Oz. Every time Mom and Sara talk, they will say "Surrender Dorothy." As if this is not enough, during this bizarre extravagant mourning, Keaton tells Adam to be no longer another Woody Allen in his Interiors movie, where he tried to imitate Ingmar Bergman successfully. Mrs. Keaton also tries drugs with the group. Come on, folks, can we realistically believe anyone in the right mind could cry like that? <br /> <br /> Fair to mediocre the best summary of this movie.
