When I look back at my college days at Ohio University, there will always be an event where I will remember with pleasant memories. Channel 23 is a local access channel for the OU, and until the last few years, they have played pretty much something that has been sent. They included many DIY movies, from a small type of microbotage on Peeps, and then scanning their images online to a Macbeth version of the 8th grade who just learned how to apologize. However, the king, in my opinion, of the 23rd channel was the Midnight Skater. The first time I looked at it around 2:00. I should have studied. Or sleep. Or watch TV regularly. But not everything for pussies. My roommate and I watched Midnight Skater and when it was complete, I do not think any of us believed that a movie did not happen. But pretty sure it was a few nights later, and we had to think that this movie actually existed. I could go here and how terrible it is, but it is a terrible thing that makes life worth living. The plot is dislocated, the terrible acting, everything that blows in the scar, but by the god, if others look with you, it is impossible not to look well. It's like the first time you hear "Guts" by Chuck Pahalniuk. You have heard, you are disgusted and agitated, but five minutes later, everything you want and your desire is to make someone else experience the abject horror you have just endured. Short short story, Midnight Skater, for all his epic flaws, makes for some fun night very late. Besides, I desperately want the theme at midnight skating. Kudos to those who wrote and sang. Sweet God I love that song.
