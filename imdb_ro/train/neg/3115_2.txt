I rarely write a negative review for this site, but this time it felt compliant. The night listener is undoubtedly one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. Nothing happened in this movie - I did not care about a character, I did not buy the whole mysterious plot, did not care how it ended ... nothing. There is no comedy, no action, no emotions, no suspense, nothing. Among the most important things are (without spoilers - nothing to spoil): a man climbing through a window, a barking dog in front of a hotel room, a car that crosses a rough terrain and a truck emitting a horn. I really liked "One Hour Photo" and I hoped for a similar role in Williams, but unfortunately he was disappointed. What's more disappointing is that I'm sure there's a good movie out there - the idea was interesting and I should have felt sympathy for the characters but it did not work for me. <br /> <br /> I may even be given 1/10, but that score is reserved for the Producers remake
