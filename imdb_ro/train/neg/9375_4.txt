It's time to see a film that remains impartial to these old Indian traditions. Sometimes it is clear how most "doctors" are charlatans, even liars, about how they do not perceive their customers. While wearing gold watches, the "donation" box is mandatory. Notice that there are only a few people who "heal" while seeing a few cases. Keep in mind as you remember that the ingestion of mercury is not toxic and that the lowest banknote in India is 5 rupees, while the average wage in India is 1,700 ru / month.
