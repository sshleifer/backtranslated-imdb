I grew up with the original Disney Cinderella and I always loved it so much that the tape is a little worn out. Consequently, I was delighted to see Cinderella 2 coming to TV and I would have been able to see it. I should have known better. This movie joins the sequel club that should have stayed alone. It absolutely holds NONE of the super cool charm! It seems to me, quite tough, and almost brutal, even from (not) Sing-to-wish characterization. While I remember character telling a story through a song, the soundtrack of this movie was placed over the top and did not seem to fit. Transforming Jaq into a man is a prime example: if he was walking around eating an apple and adding some small chips here and there, he should have danced around and singing about how great it was to be high! And in the ballroom, there is old country dance music. It is as if the writers have forgotten where and when this story was established. The optimistic fiddles certainly did not fit. Even the artwork and animation from Cinderella 2 does not rise to zero. The artwork of this film seems rather crude and less detailed. And we see some of the Cinderella skirt that does not feel good. The movie itself could have been a story of its own, I think it should have been so. I would not say I hate her, but I think he had a lot of shortcomings. It seems to have dropped significantly from the original Cinderella girlfriend.
