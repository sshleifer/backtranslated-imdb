This was the third remake of SLEEPING WITH ENIEMY After YAARANA (1995) and AGNISAKSHI (1996), AGNISAKSHI was the only one to work and was a better film. DARAAR is directed by Abbas Mustan, who failed hard in their attempt here, the story was good, but the maneuver was not so good, and the heroine was too regressive, and the climax was disappointing. Direction is bad Music is good < Rishi resumes the role of YAARANA (strange who was also a remake of SWTE) and looks too fat for the lead and is ok Juhi is decent while Arbaaz tries too hard on his debut and he's doing it in many scenarios to cool the audience, but his voice was terrible Johny is too loud
