This unpleasant movie does not have much to recommend. Dolph Lundgren offers better performance than this scenario or the other action movies he has allowed. And there are occasional fragments of dialogue that suggest that the film would have been able to provide insight into a bizarre subculture. But no. The motives are either turmoil or cute. Most of the act is sub-par. Script creates unnecessary confusion. And the unnecessary fascination of the director, focusing on gore, is fun. It's hard to imagine who the audience is for this film.
