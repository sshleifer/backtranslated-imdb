This is the first Horrorfest movie I've ever watched, and after I think I almost have to see none of the others. I was told to be a "horror film about men" and I must say that if I had to make myself think that I was closing down to think about what the splash / gore films would be in the collection. Do not get me wrong, not even the gorilla in this movie deserve to stand. The plot is very much washed with too much art for art. Camera effects and music are out of place most of the time, and the characters are banal to say the least. Some characters and scenes seem worthless in the end when they begin to reveal some of the "Hamiltons" hooks. I figured who Lenny was in about half an hour when I realized the movie. I was so visibly under confused and confused by Lenny, revealing that I felt completely broken. I waited for what I received, but it could have gone on, in fact, all the gorilla collapsed completely. With movies like "Hostel" and "Saw," you have to come a little bit better for a movie that is "considered graphic or too disturbing to the general public."
