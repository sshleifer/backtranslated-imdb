This is, literally, the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. It may be the worst possible movie. Some movies are so bad they are good; this movie is so bad that it passes the past of the pleasant camp and simply becomes incredibly unwanted. It's anti-enantiodromy. I bought it with the intent of groping, and all my family gathered for a funny night of intelligent remarks; Instead, I stood in amazing silence complaining to poor Peter Sellers. This is worse than the animated Lord of the Rings. It's worse than Matrix sequels. It's worse than Krull. It's worse than any Batman movie. Under no circumstances let this film get closer to ten meters from the TV.
