So, I was wondering while you were watching this movie, the producers of this film managed to save money on Sandra Bullock's closet by dragging Miss Congeniality's "pre-owned" clothes? Mrs. Bullock has also come to sleepwalk as Gracie Hart's "forward" channel? As several commentators have noted, the film is very formidable. Add to this the already-vu visual experience with Cassie Maywether's character as a slightly darker Gracie Hart, with more story behind and quickly becoming a snooze event. The two bad villains in the series were made before (and better) in other films. As observed before "the good type partner who tries to protect his partner despite the evidence". In fact, none of the characters in the movie ever exceeds two dimensions or tries to be anything but strange stereotypes. A last sentiment - using the term serial killer is false advertising. Killing a person - even if it is a premeditated crime - does not make you a serial killer. You may have the potential to become a serial killer, but you are not a serial killer or even a spying killer.
