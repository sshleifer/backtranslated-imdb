STAR RATING: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning The US Army has just launched a new new stealth combat aircraft that can avoid detection unlike any another. A renegade pilot (Steve Touissant) steals him and acts to keep the American government redemption with him. So are they obliged to send the best man, John Sands (Seagal, who else?) To stop him, in exchange for his freedom from a detention center where his mind should be erased by all the incriminating information which he has learned over the years. <br /> <br /> I jumped the Force Attack because I could say from the cover and all the post-production tampering that happened to be shit and when all the negative comments and the low rating of the user came pouring into it only confirmed what I believed. But I decided to give her the FOF because Shadow Man (by the same director) was not bad and, what the hell, Seagal was a favorite star once and maybe maybe he could do it again a wonderful movie. Oh, what a crazy I was. Dubbing, the terrible movie of stealth aviation airplanes, horrible work of the camera, cheap production values, erratic, unreliable battle scenes that have become Seagal's trademark and a boring sleep induction a plot that does not it's going nowhere. Fortunately, his next film, Once Upon a Time in the Hood (which I'm going to jump), seems to mark the end of his contract with Sony in these awesome European action films and his next "Prince of Pistols" could mark a return to theaters. Hell, he did it before, and Stallone will make it to him (Rocky Balboa.) This is not a rage. It's not even a fun flight. It's a flight that can not even take off the ground. *
