** WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILER ** If you can get the very unpleasant subject, this movie offers a lot of help with the scandalous campy melody. Surprisingly, this film has been copied and destroyed many times over the years, although it is hard to understand any director inspired by this trashy drama. None of the women in Hemingway can act here (although Mariel has improved over the years), Anne Bancroft offers the only touch of the class as a prosecutor, and Chris Sarandon is unfortunately hilarious and unintentionally hilarious, the play. Veteran director Lamont Johnson can not remove a silk bag from the sow's ear of a screenplay that is filled with ugly and bad dialogue. For example, the final sequence, in which Margaux catches his gun and watches Sarandon after his latest shocking act, is meant to be interesting, but instead causes heart-filled guts. Add a notorious, spirited musical score by Michel Polnareff, and you have a real guilty pleasure, even if you are likely to feel dirty and need a hot shower after you see it. Do not say you have not been warned.
