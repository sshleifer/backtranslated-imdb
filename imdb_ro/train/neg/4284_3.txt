Jason Lee's jungles are back! If that's what you're looking for, do not look any further. If not, get better ... But about the movie. Clich√©s enormous, some poorly shot scenes, but quite exotic fighting (used JKD) and a lot of bad action and cheap effects. Poor Lee seems to be in pain throughout the movie, and no wonder. It's not a pleasant comeback. The film does not cut him even as a B movie - surely, there was a blonde blonde German Rutger-wannabe, but no free sex scene or even one pictures with pictures. No one. Zip. Nada. Even in Starship Troops 2 they had the common sense to include the mandatory nudity scenes (like the rest of my comments on the excellent piece of classical cinematic excellence, please refer to the future review of this mental continuation ...). I had the feeling that the writer is taking revenge on someone - so I will not go into the "plot" of the film or almost anything else related. Except that he had some heterosexual nuances, Nuff said. However, this film has one thing that goes for it - not Jean-Claude :)
