This is a really miserable movie. Of course, the sacred (holy) trinity was governed by the law of diminishing the return with the third, the "Final Conflict" degenerating into a ridiculous sub-plot about halfway through the film, apparently only to provide the necessary deaths now the whole raison d'etre for the Omen series. But then, to prevent this movie from jumping (beware of buyers of the Omen box set to DVD - do not be fooled by the widespread report of the transfer, this was and is a very small thing) on ​​the back of a series of demonic chillers in general is unforgivable, supported in particular by the producer and producer of the first three films, Mace Neufeld and Harvey Bernhard. I would show the plot if there were, besides ordinary death scenes (hopeless, toned for TV sensibilities) and some of the worst acts I've seen. All those involved in this project up to catering people should be ashamed of this travesty ever made on the screen, not to mention masquerading under the name of Omen. If a person is convinced of my review to avoid this mess, I will feel better about it.
