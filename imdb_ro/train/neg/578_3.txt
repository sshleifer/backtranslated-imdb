This is not a good movie. The act is remarkably rigid and unconvincing. The film does not seem to know if a real horror approach is desirable or the path of the camp and the kitsch goes down. I have never seen the first film, but it does not oppose its merits, there are many unconvincing twists of plotting and the viewer is never aware of the importance of the female vampire. It's not worth the effort to look
