Do not waste your time or money on this. Half the decent casting might make you think that this thriller-teenager, while you're not about to break any recordings, might have fun for 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> It will not. > It will not make you frighten, laugh, cry or even provoke your intellect. It will let you wonder how this film has finished production on earth. Yes, he is really poor.
