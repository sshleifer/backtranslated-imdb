... but a terrible movie. As Maltin says, this was Christopher Lee's attempt to make a serious horror movie. Well, it's serious ... Very serious! The plot is silly and slow (something about the elders who live in the bodies of young children to achieve immortality) ... the movie is all talking talking talking talking talking talking talking talking about the same things over and over again. In fact, I went a few times! The movie is so boring! This was probably a love job for both (often they complained that horror films are too violent ... well, that has no violence!). Avoid at all costs ... if you do not have insomnia ... this will make you sleep!
