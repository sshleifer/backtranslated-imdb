This is by far one of the most boring and terrible accounts of the early days of Adolf Hitler I have ever watched. Robert Carlyle is a great actor, but to throw him in the role of Hitler is simply wrong. For Liev Schrieber to be Hitler's old friend and help, Haefengstal must have sent shouts of despair and pain from the Simon Wiesenthal Center. A J-W playing a Nazi supporter, casting bad bad bad. It was not a pleasant family film, with a good historical past. It was the best Hollywood garbage, crowning the strength of a powerful (but very exploited) support of actors who seemed to have disappeared from the radar in action in the last 5 years. <br /> <br /> False German accents (vee vill are called lime) are insulting to the German people everywhere. My mother is German, and she rests at the sound of the voice that continues to change from American / English / German to the same sentence. The support bracket makes better cardboard cuts at the local video store than on the screen. Jenna Malone, in her capacity as Geli Raubal, was splendid, she captured the innocence and confusion of this young tragic woman, who eventually ended her own life to escape her future in the shadow of Hitler. If you want an extraordinarily fabulous and historically correct history of Hitler's first years of life that led to the war / holocaust, the rent "Inside the Third Reich" 1983 had Rutger Hauer as Albert Speer and Derek Jacobi as Hitler. It was good and it made more sense with that balloon. As a historical researcher of the Third Reich, I can tell you sincerely that this made me search for my books to confirm his countless inaccuracies.
