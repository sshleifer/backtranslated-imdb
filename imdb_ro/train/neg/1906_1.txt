They played this at the Twilight Zone marathon on July 4, and this is, with my hands down, the worst episode in the Twilight Zone I've ever seen. It is fully synchronized with the rest of the series in its tone. Even though the Twilight Zone is a fairly non-uniform series and many episodes are extremely predictable, it was completely out of place. Compare this to legendary episodes like "A Stop at Willoughby" or "Midnight Sun," and you realize there is no comparison. Buster Keaton did what he could with such terrible material and, frankly, I am surprised that someone in his stature of historical comedy would have leaned on this episode. Even if he seemed to make some effort, he needed money ... there is no other explanation.
