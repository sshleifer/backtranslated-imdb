The opening scene "explains" why Hurt is later "immune" to "contaminated man." Too bad he does not explain anything: How did he get what he got / what was / is what works so fast. Then we go to "Today's Budapest". OK, was the opener in the past or in the future? It seems to be the past, of course, but for a minute it would seem as likely to be moved to the beginning. Sorry, I should have been more careful, right? Or maybe it's badly done. Then there was a lot of confusion about the different jobs he had in the related fields, and finally a mention of how he would have to die from the original experiment he had done. Aha! So private and private industry gathered to poison one of their peaks to look at the effects? He was probably one of the top guys, he's a friend of chemistry, for God. Then there is the substance itself: from a technical point of view, a poison, but it moves into immune "carriers" so that we can have everything we want; a poison, a disease, an allergic reaction, all things very different in real life. Magic, it's not contagious from one dead victim to another, only from the bearer. How convenient. Then there's the emergency protocol: they're in a situation without having any idea what's in the store or how they're getting ready for it. Did the producers not have enough money to show proper washing after the crew just left the scene of an unknown substance of death? I always thought Hurt was going to die from a bad cleansing technique, and the open scene would be closer to everything.
