This movie is incredibly ridiculous. I like horror movies, but this is the worst I've ever seen. I'm a big fan of gore, but most of the dead in this movie are not presented. It only shows us the bodies already dead, and the only scenes of death they actually have in this movie are terrible. Graphics look so obviously false. And the actors are terrifying. There is no real emotion from any of them. Not only did I miss my time watching this movie, but I had to obey the actual footage of the beaten animals at the beginning of the movie. If I could figure out -10, I would. F * ck this movie. It's shit. <br /> <br /> Do not forget.
