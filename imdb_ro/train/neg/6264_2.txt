Nightmare Weekend is the positive proof that some people are so desperate to be "in the movies" they are ready to do almost anything. I'm not talking about the countless women who seem quite happy to appear completely starkers in this terrible garbage (after all, the naked female form is a nice thing and nothing to be ashamed of). No ... I'm talking about those who are more than willing to work with a puppet puppet, called George. Now this is embarrassing !!! A bio-electron creature created by brilliant scientist Edward Brake (George Meffert), George (who looks like a demented clown with green hair for hair) is an artificial intelligent interface for an advanced computer system that operates a revolutionary device a silver sphere on the size of a golf ball) which, when ingested, can reverse the character disorder. Edward's experiments of alteration personalization have succeeded in animal lab, but prudent scientist is reluctant to perform tests on human subjects, fearing that side effects may also occur. Her bad assassin, Julie (Debbie Laster), however, has no such doubts and uses three young women beautiful as guinea pigs. Inevitably, they all turn into killer killer mutants. With the underground special effects in black, an absolutely talentless cast and an almost impossible plot to watch (I got the notes as I looked at the movie, and even then I'm not entirely convinced that my synopsis is exactly) , Nightmare Weekend is a complete and complete disaster that even a few soft-core sex scenes and a touch of gore can save. also one of the most irritating characters I've ever seen in a horror film: Tony (Bruce Morton), a Walkman idiot who struggles to destroy music in the '80s in a way that makes me look like Justin Timberlake in comparison.
