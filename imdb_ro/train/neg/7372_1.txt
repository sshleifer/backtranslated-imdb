I'm so confused. I've been a huge fan of Seagal for 25 years. I've seen all of his movies and many of them dozens of times. I can describe this movie just as "bizarre." Steven Seagal shares the script and produces credit on this film, but I have a very hard time to think about taking his voice for many of his lines with a thin, cute voice, not less. What is not, if he had to occupy some of his lines, why does his own voice appear to others? I expect Seagal to grow old like us. But Seagal in this film absorbs only a fraction of the same buzz, trust, bravado, charm and sex appeal that he has so easily shown in ALL his previous films. What I felt most of the time was his attitude of confidence, self-understanding, and his vengeance that moved so easily in that adorable smile. Where is that attitude and charm that made you so great? I hope that this film is not an indication of what Seagal has allowed us to offer - if so, its lifetime fans will have to admit that Seagal, which we all knew and loved, disappeared.
