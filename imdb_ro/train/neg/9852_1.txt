Discovery Channel / Animal Planet must be ashamed of themselves. This fantasy is modeled after the "Walking with Dinosuars" series. Even though this is a fantasy of 100%, it is presented in the same factual and archaeological way. Even blending the fantasy dragons with T-rexs and the disappearance of the dinosaurs. Added to being shown on an educational channel instead of telling Sci-Fi, he provides an air of factual authenticity for this show. On its own, the show is about 7.5 / 10, just as fun goes. But the way it is presented I have to give it 1/10. Do not misunderstand me. I have no problem with fantasy, but the way they have this is so wrong. I can really see little children and slow adults, thinking they found a dragon and that this is real. I also think this weakens the big series of "Walking with Dinosuars", because now you have to see this with a mind of how much fantasy is on that mini-series.
