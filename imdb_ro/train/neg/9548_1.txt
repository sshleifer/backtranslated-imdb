I can not believe I looked at this more than I expected. Start OK. This movie pushes the limits of reality away! At least the first one was somewhat realistic. She gets rid of the first film and even mentions the Joshua project. Anyone who knows anything about computers will hate this movie. Has a good message in it, however, WANT TO BROTHER BIG! The movie makes Big Brother seem bigger than it really is. It was very aggravating. Even the makeup of the actors was completely bad. Some of the actors are pretty good. Some of the actors are really bad. The scenario was OK at some points and completely disturbed elsewhere. This movie runs comfortably every five minutes. As I said, I can not believe I have seen more waiting. I think I will go out in the original to get back to earth ... Q
