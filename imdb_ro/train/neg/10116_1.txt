I really want the last 30 minutes of my life back. The only person who is right to watch this movie is Helen Keller, I kept telling myself that this has to get better, this needs to be improved. </ ref> <br /> Then the zombies finally appeared and had raccoon paint on their eyes. They talked about the ordinary people. One driven a car. <br /> <br /> Some voodoo women have asked what one of the "zombies" and "zombies" wanted to say (I want to dance) <br /> <br /> can I take that I can sue for half an hour of my life ?????
