The Second Renaissance, Part 1, to show how the cars have revolted for man. It all starts with a single case in which cars claim to have the right to live, while people say that a robot is something they own and therefore can do whatever they want. <br /> <br /> Although an interesting premise, the story has become very bad since then with riots (violent!) Between robots and humanity. Somehow, it does not seem right, as another commentator shows, is a bit too clever. Animatrix stories near the matrix core (especially Osiris) work for the best. As far as the second part of the Renaissance is concerned, I would say it is too violent and too bad. 4/10.
