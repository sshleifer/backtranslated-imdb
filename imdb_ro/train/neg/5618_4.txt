In fact, I am surprised by the number of good evaluations obtained by this anti-Christian pseudo-documentary. Now I respect the respect and faith of the guy, I myself do not believe in this state the faithfulness of the Christian doctrine learned. However, anti-Christian propaganda is to some extent another issue. This film has valid points, but these are very few and are represented in a very biased context. I do not recommend not to see this. Actually, I think everyone should see it and decide if they believe it or not. And this is more a chance than the one the director gives to Christian teachings. Rather than an interrogating approach on the subject, it seems that a personal vendetta on Christian school has affected its childhood. He is also mistaken for Christians, most of the times, either incredibly naive or fundamentalist, without moderation among them. The director uses the film scenes from the Passion of Christ without permission, sets up an interview with his former school principal and presents almost only anti-Christian historians and writers. In fact, I found that the director is the lowest person in the earth and I think his attitude was fully justified. I also doubt that any of the Christian Christians interviewed has been consulted in words or even said before the interview the purpose of the investigation. In view of this, there are certainly new and interesting facts to be found here and some very original thoughts on the issue of Christianity. But the way he thinks this whole is often offensive, extremely unprofessional and terribly biased.
