With Adam Sandler. It's undoubtedly one of the most idiotic movies ever made. This is Shecky (Sandler) waiter who wants to be a comedian on the cruise ship. First of all, there is no funny or intelligent line in the whole movie frankly. It's so unpleasant it's pathetic. Surprisingly, there is not much gross or sexual humor, but the word is abundant. The budget is really low and also ruins the movie. It takes place on a cruise ship, but it seems they only had money to rent a small boat and they only had money for 10 extra ships, one of which is Billy Bob Thornton. Opening credits are profitable and are pathetic. I hate this movie and everyone else who sees it will hate it. 86 minutes. R for the language.
