I lost my time and I gave a chance to this show. This must be one of the worst new shows. If they gave a prize show that sucks THIS should sweep the category. The act is weak and the story line is done. Now dinosaurs were a little weird, but at least it was fun. The show lasted three seasons and was eventually scraped. This new show, based on ads by insurance companies, is not funny and has nothing to do. Perhaps the original ads and the number of times that have been and are still being repeated is what is wrong with this show. It just came to TV and we're already tired of seeing the "fishermen" characters.
