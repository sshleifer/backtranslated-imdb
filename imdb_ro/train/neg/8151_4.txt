Leslie Sands, "Deadlock," becomes a promising vehicle for Bette Davis and Gary Merrill, right after their joint success in "All About Eve." After killing her husband, a schematic woman is visited by her husband's best friend, who moves away from her husband once others start to stop by the house. Irving Rapper, one of Bette's best directors at his peaks, is unable to pick up this ridiculous material, in which Davis is curiously defeated and detained until the end of the outrageous (where, fortunately, removes all stops). Production and support strictly second; only for Bette Davis completists. * 1/2 from ****
