A decent animation and development of functional character keeps this animated animated frog from DreamWorks at least visible ... yet it remains somewhat slow and the story is a bit foolish. It's interesting to see a reversal of typical cowboys and Indian roles, but here it just seems like a clue for political correctness rather than a fair story story. Grade: C
