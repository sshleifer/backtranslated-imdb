The music that eats nerves like an angle on a board, acting so zombielike, was a shame to lose its distribution by making a second film; throwing everyone in it like real zombies --- with the distribution of Sabrina the Teenaged Witch as heroes ... a movie so terrible that if "stoners" were still around it it could be considered a worship movie --- but , so amateur, the scriptures could have been worn by actors, and their lines read as they gradually return through the movie - banal, illogical sets modeled after LA subdivisions, props directly from ToysRus! Was it a movie ever made so complete and totally intact? The logic flies to the wind in this fruit, meaningless, meaningless, and with a monster so mad and uncoordinated that it can not catch a turtle in an icebox - a small blow, a little bit and an amazon! He kept my attention all the time; the way in which a terrible accident, in the fog, involving several vehicles, keeps someone from looking to the end ... for after a ridiculous rocket battle in a prison on another planet, an air-disadvantaged reward hunter, pursues a retarded extraterrestrial fugitive --- THE EARTH! Do not let anyone see your popcorn, you might be enjoying it. It's so bad!
