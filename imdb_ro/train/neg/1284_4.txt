This film was a long, no-climax construction. People who refer to the struggle of the sword must ultimately be either far from their mind or have none. Too often this movie has become soft. I'm not saying soft movies are bad. But no matter how much sugar you are, you should not have space on a T-bone steak. This movie should have been aventive for crimes committed against a culture, but it has come to be a beating. And it was just one of them who actually knew what a sword was; The character of Tim Roth (and yes, it plays well). Rob Roy was a weak "hero," without knowing how to use a sword, and the way he "won" was a shame. As a drama, this film has had periods, but the best performance in this film has to go to the nature of Scotland. This is a short tad breath to be called "soap" in my book.
