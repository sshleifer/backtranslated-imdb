I saw the first time it was selected as a suggestion from my TiVo system. I like Danny Elfman and I thought it might be interesting. In addition, I am a fan of Max Fleischer's work, and this began with his 30-year appearance and animation. With both of them, I thought it would keep my interest. I was wrong. Just a few minutes inside and I had the scroll button before. I went through it in about 15 minutes and I thought that was it. After that, I read some of the other reviews here, and I realized I did not give it enough chance. I recorded it again and watched it. There are 75 minutes of my life I do not come back. I can not believe there are no worse comments. Personally, I think it's because it's hard to get to the 10-line commentary minimum. How many ways are there to say that this is a waste of time? The movie happens as if it were made by a few inferior children ready to defeat the world and thinking that I can with my breasts, profanity, and jokes rifle. Characters are flat. The parody of Swinging the Alphabet is a blade, in essence, damaging the song, going through A-E, hitting the obvious "F", and then having no idea where to go. The journey through the intestines to the expected landing does not work for the first time, not to mention the following. <br /> <br /> Along the board, the whole movie is what you would expect from someone who is trying to "park-out South Park" Stone and Parker without the ability to determine what it is and is not funny . It could be fun if you're big. Otherwise, it is not.
