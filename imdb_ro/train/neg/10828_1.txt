It's not just about my verdict on this movie, but about most of what was written about it. Now do not get me wrong here, I'm not a total philistine, I did not hate my movie because it was not enough like "police academy 9" or something else, I'm enjoying more than my righteous side of high-head or arty stuff, around. <br /> <br /> "Magnolia" is poor, and I am sincerely deceived by what is apparently so appreciated. Long lasting, self-indulgent, silly, from the beginning to the end, there is just as little that could be credible what people love so much for the movie. There are some high-caliber actors fairly accurate, and none of them turns into average or weaker performance. In addition, my wife (a witness who testified to Tom Cruise hater) tells me that it is the best performance of his far-fledged career. But the plot is so completely unrecognizable, proud of the stories of several freely connected characters at a solemn pace that even when significant life-changing events seem to be so unnecessary and uninteresting, you find yourself crying for someone to run away or something <br /> <br /> It does not help that none of the characters is very easy to identify or empathic (I do not really think, but I do not like most people). They all sing more of their lifeless life stories, demonstrating their character flaws and emotions in such a complicated detail and playing deep and meaningful relationships with the ninth degree with many soliloquy on the wheel. Yadda yadda yadda. The soundtrack is also strident, with that irritating quality that suggests the marrow that I have once thought unique to Alanis Morisette's music. Overall, she was just as pleasant for three hours as being repeatedly forced to watch an episode of "friends," while being intermittently on the ribs by a disgruntled goat. The frog with the frogs is good, though.
