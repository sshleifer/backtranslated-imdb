Yikes hit the movie. Characters were weak, weaker. I realized it could not be too bad because Christoper Walken, oops. He must have done this because he was bored and needed money. The characters had to be Irish, but nobody had an Irish accent. I'm desperately trying to find something beautiful about that, I can not, except Walken did a good job with a wood character. Find something to read or watch the discovery, never see this movie.
