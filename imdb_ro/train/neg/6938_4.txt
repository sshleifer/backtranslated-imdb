In this film, the old Amitabh Bachchan falls in love with a much younger woman. Meets him in his restaurant. The younger woman, Tabu, flirts with him. He does not know what to do and asks. Her reaction to her invitation is quite strange. It must be funny. And that bothers me about this movie. It was not that funny. Jokes and scenarios were terrible! The only jokes I liked were related to a waiter's teeth, but after a few times that even began to wear. Amitabh has a little girl named sexy. It was a strange relationship! A little girl with an old man's mind! It was scary! I know someone can be attached to a child, but this man has adult conversations with this child. It made no sense. Tabu's father is Paresh Rawal. He has to give Amitab a hard time, but we all know Paresh, he can not do that. So even the conversation at the end, when they sit around the table, even that should have been fun. I only like movies that are really funny. I suppose I will never see this movie again.
