Imagine pulling back the mask of a deadly assassin and finding Barbara Cartland there ... this is happening with this movie. The opening has shown a promise but soon drops all the claims of being a thriller (or even a fantasy love story) and the only reason they made this story is becoming clearer: to fill a gap in the market their viewing of women, creating yet another residence of a "bad boy" (Andrew), capricious beauty "(Paula). Rather than waste time in creating an original premise, the film went directly for the money shot: a bad boy being tainted by the capricious beauty said, followed by a series of unhealthy and very strange love scenes, sprinkled with pseudo-philosophical / poetic fluff. "poet" is divided into the perceived qualities that a Byron hero should have - but even when we are told in hard writing, highlighting who and what he is, it is still hard to believe it For a Byron / antihero hero to work, the story needs subtlety, style and innovation - all of which are completely absent here. This is not a ghost of modern work, it is exactly what happens when a weak and stupid woman (elastic pants) encounters a bad man who, when he meets her, seems as dangerous as rabbit slippers. <br /> Performance might have saved this movie if it had been good: the female leadership is concerned about the sexy and "strange" aspect, no matter how forceful or ridiculous; and the poor Dougray Scott seems to have been drugged while he wipes his side. This is not his best work. Lights of interest were brought by JÃ¼rgen Prochnow as "Vashon," and Andrew Lee Potts as a young photographer / brother. A better film would have dismantled the sister and kept the brother.
