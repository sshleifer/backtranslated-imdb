Words can not describe how bad this movie is. I can not explain just by writing. You've seen too well to catch yourself as horrible as it may be a movie. Not that I recommend you to do this. There are so many cliches, mistakes (and all the other negative things you can imagine) here that will make you cry. To begin with the technique first, there are a lot of mistakes about the plane. I will not list them here, just to mention the coloring of the plane. They have not even been able to show a plane in the colors of a fictitious airline but have used a 747 painted in the original Boeing model. Very bad. The plot is bad and has been done several times before, much more, much better. There are so many ridiculous moments here that I lost my seriousness. I was also on the wicked side all the time in the movie because the good guys were so stupid. The "executive decision" should undoubtedly be a choice in this regard, even the "turbulence" - the moms are better. In fact, any other film in the world is better than that.
