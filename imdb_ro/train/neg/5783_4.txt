Ah, sex and gore. It's too bad I do not do it anymore (unless you live in Japan). But if this has been proven, it is not a bad thing. The film consists mainly of the two wonderful vampires who squeezed "johns" along a rural road, taking them home to their castle, having crazy sex with them and then eating them (except for the first victim, which keep it around for no special reason). Things are complicated when a woman who rests with her husband becomes too curious about these mysterious women he always sees. It's really ugly from here. Eventually, the two vampires are in such a blood that they eat everything in front of them and manage to leave the captive victim to escape. Oops, so much for that secret existence. The fact that the two vampires do not bother to take their clothes and fool each other is the only thing this movie has. Otherwise, it is a bloody and confusing mess (why is their tomb so far from their castle), just watched for a few minutes by the vampire game time. The only thing I got out of this movie was these two useful tips: Lesbian shots will not kill them; will turn them into vampires, and do not pick up prostitutes along a rural road; they are probably vampires. Besides, I really did not deserve the time.
