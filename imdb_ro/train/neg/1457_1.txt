I've been watching this movie a few times, and I can still say that this is a low budget garbage and has nothing to do with a reality of history. The performances of the actors are very weak, but are the result of limited possibilities for action. Anyone who watched this movie now thinks of Hitler as a mad crazy madman who runs a pistol like a Chicago gangster. I can only say that in those years there are much better movies about Hitler and Germany and that Rise of evil is far below average. I can recommend the German Downfall movie in which you can see the brilliant performance of Swiss actor Bruno Ganz in a role of Adolf Hitler.
