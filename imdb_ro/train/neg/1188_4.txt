Kurosawa really blew this. Each genius is allowed a failure. The concept is fine, but the execution is very blurry. There is a fancy air of this movie, making it an art movie. Tokyo's poverty is worth a more accurate and realistic portrayal. Many of them have interesting stories to tell. A very disappointing film.
