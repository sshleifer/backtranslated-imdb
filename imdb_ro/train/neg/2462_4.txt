Well, I like the genre in this movie - it's really unsetteling. Anyone who was at the dentist will know why. The story really is not that bad, the motivations of Corbin Bersen's character make much more sense than most horror films. I've seen worse acting, I'm directing, scenario, etc. But at the end of this day it's still a bad horror movie. So if you like this kind of thing or not. I tried to follow the sequel, but it was exactly the same thing as this movie. Remember if you enjoy the fact that people get tortured at the dentist, then this is the movie for you!
