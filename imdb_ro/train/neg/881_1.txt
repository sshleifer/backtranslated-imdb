Thanks to an infamous home distributor who brought the so-called German Independent Series, Four For Venice is not only terrible, but even terrible. So terrible that I put it in the garbage at the second-hand goods store for extra money. Nick and Charlotte are a married couple who came to an agreement to have sex only on Tuesday because of their busy schedule. Eva and Luis are a pair of couples who live by hand, where Eve works as a waitress and Luis, an artist. Nick makes Eve lose her waitress job. Luis and Charlotte had an affair with Eva and Nick. Luis cheated on Eve, thinking he had flown to London to do something about his artwork, but in fact he flies to Venice with Charlotte for an adultery holiday. Eve kidnapped Nick and dragged her two children to Venice for confrontation. The trip to Venice ends as both Nick and Eve fall from each other. The presentation of the trip from Germany to Venice between Nick and Eve marks the failure of comedy. Not only would it make sense, but also love. In the film, Nick tries to seek help in a number of ways, but it does not end at all. It's either the strangers around him who behave like morons, or they're just stupid. Comedy also had the tendency to add unnecessary scenes to prolong the story. While some of the issues that can be resolved with common sense, nobody in the movie uses common sense to solve the problem. They prefer to go through a big round to solve the problem. It fails so badly that even the beautiful landscapes of Venice fail to raise the reputation of the film.
