Funny how many of those who say this is far superior to the Romero version tend to be very young (judging by other posts). What we have here is an action-packed action movie, gorilla and "Whoopee," which has filled MTV video for two hours. Enough editing, pop-video camera, cool music blah blah blah In fact, it's not bad compared to other recent remakes (The Chainsaw Massacre was a total disaster) round, predictably totally in the "dead" stakes and a total of cash in the name of Dawn Of The Dead, which will generate a lot of income only from the fans of the original who will go to see it out of curiosity ... <br /> <br /> Does not the classic remake get on your nerves? Can not they really bring something original? Why Dawn of the Dead? Things that created the special original (the middle segment that kids think is so boring should be slow to show how, when you get everything you ever wanted that you are not happy) is totally lacking. This is an action movie, simple and simple. The sooner, the better. If you're in action (and so the 2004 version is well done) fair enough, but for anyone who likes a little substance for their movies ... get ready to sigh (again) ... <br /> Watch the cinemas in the next few years as we receive the Godfather remodeled by anyone who is the most fashionable pop director at the moment and the remodeled Star Wars, all children saying how the new version is smaller than the old version is slow and boring and holds a camera shot for more than 5 seconds ... It's not bad, but in 10 years will still discuss Romero version, not this pap
