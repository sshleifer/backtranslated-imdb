Where to Get Started ... Yes, Bad Boys Message: When you first find the person you followed (to kill) who saw a crime you committed, do not spend time talking to her, so she still has another opportunity to escape. Message to the victim: When the bullies talked to each other and argued, take this opportunity to "GO BACK", do not sit there and look at them until you make a noise I hear. Message to the director: if someone has a start of 5 or 10 minutes in a vehicle or on foot, you can not take the bad boys to your heels or bumper immediately! time and movement do not work that way. It would also be nice to think that a woman should not brutally kill (4) men to be empowered to give up an abusive relationship at home.
