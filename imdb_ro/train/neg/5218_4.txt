All the elements for a bad night in the movies are: biological dialogue, chintzy sets, balsa-wood, a horrible Casio score of the late 1980s, and a general appearance that suggests something on the Channel Channel Sciences, circa 1993 "While Metamorphosis begins with a lot of promises, the film unfolds in gentle idiot and MST3K style cheese, while Clark Kent," Dr. Peter Houseman "(Gene LeBrock), is pressed to release information about his secret projects. But when he tests his vague experiment about himself, he turns into a vaguely defined creature (which has more than a passing resemblance to Dr. Freudstein in the Cemetery House). The FX work is good enough for a low-budget production (although I suspect that most of it is kept in the shade for a reason), but overall, "Metamorphosis" leaves a bad retro feel, despite its hopes of influence otherwise. I can not disagree with the final remark of a character: "(It was) A nightmare ... of the past!"
