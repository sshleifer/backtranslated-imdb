This film starts quite terribly with a woman being tied and tortured psychologically. There is complete masculine front nudity, dead animal parts, licked dogs in the nipples, the woman losing control of her bladder. All shot in a gray, cool color. Effective, but a little too much. Then we continue to see the youth of the BTK killer, but also his present and his history of crimes. The tension is entirely psychological, and the scenes of the killer entering the victims' homes and talking to them last long enough and it is creepy. Here we do not see fancy or good pictures, it seems shot with your home room. It does not seem terrible, but somehow seeing a killer hiring his victims for some time before killing them is quite unusual and cold. What this movie does not have is really a drama. There are some police scenes from time to time, but there is no emotion in finding the murderer. There is not much arc in this story. This could have been an effective psychological thriller, a study of madness. Unfortunately, the film is filled with real images of the slaughterhouse. It is dispersed throughout the movie and suddenly comes again and again. Sometimes you do not know he comes and he does not have enough time to look away. And I have to reject. It's all about horror movies, but I do not tolerate the suffering of the animals. It was useless, excessive, and comes without warning. I'm glad Lionsgate releases things that no one does, but it should have gone over this movie or changed the animal's gore. Stay away from garbage.
