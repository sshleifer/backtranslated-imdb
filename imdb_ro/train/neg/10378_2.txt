While the premise behind the house where the dwellings of evil can be interesting, the execution is pathetic. I'm not even sure where to start, because I have a lot of problems with this movie. I suppose I will only count a few of them: 1. Actor? When you see that Edward Albert, Doug McClure and Susan George (and her teeth) are the stars of your movie, do you know you have problems? It does not really matter to me, but they are hardly named A-List. Susan George may have been in some of the movies I like, but I have never considered her the greatest actress I've ever seen. And in this movie, her act is embarrassing. As for the other two, the less he said the better. <br /> <br /> 2. Ghosts? The ghosts or the spirits or whatever you want to tell me have reminded me a little of the ghosts in the haunted ride ride.at Disney World. And, they are just as frightening. And why should they be so obvious? Subtlety is not a feature of the house where evil dwells. <br /> <br /> 3. Plot? How predictable can a movie be? The result of this movie is painfully obvious when you meet the three main characters. If you do not see where this movie was based in about 15 minutes, you have to watch more movies. <br /> <br /> 4. The convenient priest? What are the chances that the haunted house you buy happens to be across the road from a group of Japanese monks? Not to mention that one of them knows the history of your home and comes over, knocks on the door and asks if you need help in removing evil spirits. Absurd is a word that comes to mind. <br /> <br /> 5. Anything else ?? It is very difficult for me to think of any positive that I can write. I suppose I'll give a point for the opening scene and a point for the house architecture. Is this a sure sign of a winner? noticing architecture as a climax of any film does not say much about the real movie. I'll stop. You should be able to get the idea of ​​what we have already mentioned. And I have not even mentioned the annoying little girl or the Crab Invasion or a myriad of other problems. Be warned, this is horrible.
