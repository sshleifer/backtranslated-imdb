Good pain! While still claiming that Manos: Hands of Fate is the worst mental torture available, Hobgoblins came very close. This ... this insults the audience at any occasion. At least movies such as Space Mutiny and Future War can be enjoyed on mst3k, this was a struggle to go through. We were literally joking on the couch in pain. This has managed to be embarrassed - alone! Even if you're a tough MST3K fan and you've made your mission to see each experiment, think twice to see it. <br /> <br /> It's so bad.
