There were very few movies I could not stand. I managed to make a problem through the Earth battlefield. But this, this is one of the worst EVER movies to be made. I understand that Whoopi Goldberg tried to behave in it. I'm not blaming her. I would be ashamed to be this on a CV. I think it's a rare occasion when almost every gag in a movie collapses on his face. Well, it's happening here. Not to mention SFX, look at the dino with the control cables hanging from it the end of the end !!!!!! By the middle of the movie, I was looking for another plot. I never found one. Save your problems renting this and saving you 90 minutes of your life.
