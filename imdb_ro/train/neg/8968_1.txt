The writing on the screen is so bad that it bothers me that I wasted two hours of my life. I never come back (where I heard this before). The actor is like that. Things change quite often to keep you up to date and wait for something awful to happen. However, there is no single thing in this movie. While the first Cube was a terrible horror film that did not make much sense in the end, the zero cube took that and tried to redo the exact same story, except this time when it makes a point the inconvenience of trying to explain the explanations for every detail the first film did not answer. The comic thing is that the director recycles the exact scenes of the first film that were somewhat weird and tries to explain them. But the scenes are just copied, there is no coherence. This script is useless. I can imagine it was written by about half a 15-year-old, with a baseball cap and a beer package for a class project. The best part is ultimately, they "good" cripple wunderkind, and he gets retarded in the first movie, and you see him when he finds him ("this room is green ..") in Cube 1997. Goodie gooodie, beat flip, turn. First of all, what if you did not see the first one, it makes no sense to give your director. Another great idea: instead of the numbers to identify the x, y, z coordinates of the camera (1997 cube), this time there are 3 letters, each offering one of the 26 possible coordinate values. Spirit. Except now, permutations do not make much sense anymore ... so he lets the letters disappear before anyone can use them. I want my money back. I think I had to write this because there are just so many bad, incoherent or bad ideas in this movie. Directors / writers must have a talent.
