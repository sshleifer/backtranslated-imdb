I had no knowledge of this movie before I bought it, but it seemed cool to me and I wanted to see a Viking movie right now ... unfortunately this film was not what I was looking for. We were hoping for the best, but in return, a northern work of dull soap seemed to be delivered that seemed to pull too much despite the 84-minute running time. The premise of the film is quite interesting: it is a viking warrior defying his God, and Odin is so angry that he curses the son of the warrior, called Barek, to death and rebirth as a berserker. This guy Barek is forced to live alive, crazy and violent after life. The film is filmed quite competent with some rich cinemas and quasi-good performances of the actors, but again, I woke up bored and wondering when this dribble will end. The directors had the chance to do something rather fun and semi-unique, but they missed the ball. Perhaps it could have been improved by cheap exploitation tactics thrown into free nudity and a lot of gore ... I mean, we're talking about Berserkers here, are not we? The Vikings should have been pretty BAD, with all rape and robberies, so should the Berserkers not be even more extreme? Generally, if you are not a fan of The Young and Restless (etc ...) or, in fact, you are, in fact, a mad Berserker who likes self-torture, I would probably have avoided this piece of celluloid.
