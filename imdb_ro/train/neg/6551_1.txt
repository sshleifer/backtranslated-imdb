A bad study. Bad is acting, bad music, bad scenario, bad editing, bad direction and a bad idea. Pieces of chicory do not come any cheesier or more funny than this ... thing. By the end of the movie, you were wondering why they bothered in the first place. Poor Malcolm McDowell, did he have money or something? Are we still thinking about seeing this? * SPOILERS AHOY *: If you have not died of laughter in the first thirty minutes, until you see the cyborg population city, you will do that. Avoid this, my friends who love the movie. Avoid.
