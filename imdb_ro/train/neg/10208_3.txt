There's something frustrating about watching a movie like "Murder By Numers," because somewhere inside that Hollywood formula is a good movie trying to get out. However, until the credits roll down, they are not saved. The whole thing is pretty much blown by the "police part" of the story, where detective Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin's characters are wandering through an inconvenient sexual adventure that gets more and more trivialized as the movie continues. Although Bullock is strong in her role, it is not enough to save the laziness-free scenario and lazy rhythm. Ben Chaplin's talents are wasted in a forgetful role (he did much better at the beginning of the year in "Day Girl") as well as Chris Penn, who has such an uncertain role that you are sorry for a talent as he. However, the plot is not even a factor in this movie at all. The two teen killers played by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt are the only real reasons for seeing this movie. Their talent and chemistry work pretty well and play pretty well each other. It's too bad they were not in a better movie. Barbet Schroeder crosses a place too safe for such a director. Bottom Line: It's worth a rent if you're a fan of genre, but anyone else will live a fulfilled life without ever seeing, except maybe on a TV set with convenient commercial breaks.
