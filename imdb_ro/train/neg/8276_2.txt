I knew this movie would not be amazing, but I thought I would give her a chance. I'm a fan of Luke Wilson, so I thought he had the potential. Unfortunately, a lot of dialogue of the film was very fake sounding and cheesy. I think Aquafresh has provided some money for producing the film because they have given up a few suggestions seriously. There's a shot in which the Aquafresh mark is on you that you can not figure it out. Perhaps we should have focused on writing and acting more than we can ever get rid of Aquafresh in the movie without people getting upset. The movie had moments, but I'm glad I did not spend $ 9.50 to see her in the theater.
