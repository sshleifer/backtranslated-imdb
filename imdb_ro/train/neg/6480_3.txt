It was nice to see all the familiar characters again, but the story disturbed me. I loved Ariel in the first film - why is the second centered around her daughter? The new characters were annoying and I did not like this story. Worst of all, Christopher Daniel Barnes did not return as Eric's voice! Disney, please stop remodeling classic movies with these inappropriate imitations.
