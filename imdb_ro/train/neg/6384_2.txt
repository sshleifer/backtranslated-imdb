Recently I was online searching for a site that contained public domain movies. In their long list of films this movie was and I thought I had to make hallucinations of such a title and an offensive premise. But, no, that's what it was. And since the movie was only 27 minutes, I decided to try. If it turned out to be a porn movie, I would have stopped looking. Instead, it turned out to be the most bizarre movie I've ever seen. The Danish production team has tried, with a budget of about $ 49, to make a Star Trek movie about a team of very homosexual men traveling around the galaxy, wiping out women's oppression by killing all women - as they did Earth! And in any case, they were greeted with gratitude and thanksgiving to the homosexual men of the planet. Subtle, this is not. With some of the most obscene and minor names of the characters I've ever heard, I do not even think I can write them to IMDb without deleting my review! However, in spite of its total bitterness, it was strange to watch and worth a look. But, as I have already mentioned, because of gross names and strange subjects (although I'm not nudity), it's just a movie for adults. <br /> <br /> By the way, this movie left me 1001 questions about who she would do, why to do it, and who was the wanted audience ?! Maybe it's not the worst absolute thing I've ever seen, but it's probably the weirdest and perhaps the most offensive!
