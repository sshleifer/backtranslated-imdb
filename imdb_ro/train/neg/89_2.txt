I've seen all four movies in this series. Each of them is increasingly moving away from books. This is the worst yet. My problem is I'm not following the book she's called in any way! Directors and producers should have called it something other than "happy joy of love". The only thing about this movie that resembles the book is the names of characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). Children's names / ages / genres are wrong. The whole line of story is not where in the book. It seems to me a great disadvantage for Janette Oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title, which is not fair in any way. Music is too loud. The actors are not convinced - they have no emotions. If you want a good family movie, that could do it. It's clean. You do not look at him, though, if you say a condensed version of the book. I hope this will be the last movie in this series, but I doubt it. If there are more films made, I would like Michael Landon, Jr and others to get closer to the original lines and story. The books are excellent and, if followed closely, would make excellent movies!
