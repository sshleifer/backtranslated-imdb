Amazing. That's what you said if you were in this movie. Simply, incredible, amazing. It's actually so astonishing that someone was stupid enough to throw money into doing that monstrosity that you just can not believe what you see. That, buddies, is what's really scary about this movie. Someone thought it was a good idea to do it. <br /> <br /> Well, here's another amazing original story: the high school student (occasionally looking like a college), has a slut for a mother, lives in a trailer park and is an "artist "which is ridiculed because" it is different ". Of course, this poor ridiculed boy is finally killed and, here is the original part, his soul lives in a scarecrow (under which he is killed by the last John of his crazy mother). Then he comes back with the standard killing of all the people who hurt him. Awww. <br /> <br /> Here's the breakdown: <br /> <br /> The Good: <br /> <br /> - An amazingly funny movie, even if that's not what the creators of the movie clearly <br /> <br /> --This and continuing on a Wal-Mart disc $ 5.00 bin ???, so it's just a little overestimated. It did not hurt, t Help: <br /> <br /> - Violence and gorillas are a kind of sub-standard. One person is stabbed with a corn. <br /> <br /> - They seem to have put some effort into music, but they do not really fit the movie and it's not that good. /> <br /> <br /> Bad: <br /> <br /> - Terrified, terrible. <br /> <br /> - Another yellowish weakness with sexy women; none of them remove the clothing. When it stopped being a capsule of low forehead slasher ???????????????????????????????????? ??????????????????????????? Arnold Swartzenegger blush. <br /> <br /> - The standard love story does not go anywhere, and it's badly done. - Some people killed seem random? you never know who someone is and then you are killed. And you just suppose he has to come. <br /> <br /> Ugly: - Extremely high price slasher fare, just with a scarecrow scarecrow instead of ?? Well, all the other shit. - Otherwise, as interesting as Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, Pinhead, Chucky, or Angela of the Sleepaway Camp series, all better than this atrocity. <br /> <br /> - The absolutely worst dialogue I've ever heard in my life. The script is loaded with a level of delay that I have not imagined that might exist. I'm serious here, it's a complete step beyond terrible. Do not get me wrong, though, it's funny like hell, but I've never heard more banners even in Slumber Party Massacre III. This movie makes "Jason X" look like Shakespeare. - The man who kills the boy who gets the scarecrow: the hardest wig ever. Dialog that fits. <br /> <br /> A memorable scene: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Huh huh. "Action: 3/10 Story: 3/10 Atmosphere: 2/10 Cinematography: 1/10 Personal Development: 2/10 Special Effects / Makeup: 5/10 Nudity / Sex: 1/10 (Nudity, Mother is a girl, girls do not wear bras) Violence / Gore: 5/10 (Poor quality, mediocre amount) Dialogue: 0/10 I'm sorry but I do not know what to do. <br /> Overall: 3/10 <br /> <br /> Another for only people like me who enjoy stupidity. Or complete the Slasher movie. This is not a good movie, not at all. Dialogue and the characters that go down do not prevent it from being really boring. Www.ResidentHazard.com
