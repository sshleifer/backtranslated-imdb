This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I can not remember when I saw something worse. I thought it was an investigation of an airplane crash. What really was a soap opera, and a bad thing about it. They have overstretched the "conflict" card to the extreme. The first hour or so seems to be a crying match, with some implausible scenes thrown. <br /> <br /> * The possible spoiler * The 40 or so memorial scene (with the necessary black umbrellas and rain) to the victims of the fictitious accident was lame and I thought it will never end. <br /> <br /> Avoid this at any cost, unless you enjoy "conflict". <br /> <br />
