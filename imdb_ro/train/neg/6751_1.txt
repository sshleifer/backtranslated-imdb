My friend and I rented this because I thought it might be a good "Halloween" take off. A terrorist murderer, a white mask ... you let me go. We were bad dead! He did not want any money. Not only have we discovered one of the worst movies there, but it's also a classic cult! It fills with holes and makes no sense. The actress who plays Maddy is beautiful, but that's all. I give you credit for being shot on a very small budget - I always support films like this. Just not that special. This movie might be good to see if you're drunk or high; otherwise do not bother. If you do not want to lose your movie privileges like me!
