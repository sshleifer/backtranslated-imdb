The debut film was the best thing about this movie, because it gave you hope that you will see an independent, passionate and well-prepared film. Hell, this opening to fill my hope. As the "movie" progressed in a slow, frugal way, my thoughts varied in connection with this "movie": was too much butter in popcorn? Do actors have to pay the director to be in this movie? Did I receive my valid Box Office ticket? Yes, dear reader. I saw this movie in the Theater! This is the only exception I will make to see a movie at home, because at home you can disable it. Have there been ransom values? Peter Lemongelli as standard college "nerd" had his moments, especially in a dog collar. Apart from the fact that this "film" has gone from trying to be a comedy, to a family drama to a spiritual revivalist. He did not manage on any of these fronts. Oh, and the girlfriend was badly rebellllllly. Her performance was the only comedy I found.
