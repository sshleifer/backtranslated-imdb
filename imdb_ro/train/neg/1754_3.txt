Why do the stories of Mary and Rhoda have to be so bold? Women divorced with indifferent daughters. And why very little reference to the original show and characters? The daughter's characters were silly and uninteresting. Why can not they be daughters who would love my mother on television? Does it make sense that Mary leaves Minneapolis and Rhoda returns to NYC, but why could not Phyllis or Sue Ann Nivens be seen? It seems to be a moving way to remember such wonderful characters. It was good to see Mary and Rhoda, but it could have been better, much better. Well, there was a Mary Tyler Moore show meeting, a Dick Van Dyke show, we hope Mary will do better next time if she returns to the old Mary Richards again.
