... because it was simply terrible. 101 Dalmatians were fun, even if they were forms, but this is nothing more than a shortening of the chickens. The same plot, except the story excluded from it; the most intelligent and terrible macaw in the world; Tim McInnerny proves that he really can not make comedy (anyone who remembers Percy in Blackadder, but that was his high point - it's been down since then); a direction so bad that if a group of students did that, they'd throw it in the basket and tell her to do it again - right this time. Ieuan Grufford returns better to Hornblower, while Glenn Close and Gerard Diepardieu should be hiding for a few years. Maybe I would be too harsh; after all, I did not manage to stay in the whole movie. Receives 1/10; just because I can not give 0.
