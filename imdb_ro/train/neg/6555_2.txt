So last night I decided to follow the Hollywood Hills stories: Natica Jackson. Or Power, Passion, Crime as it is called in the Netherlands. When I bought my movie, I noticed that Michelle Pfeiffer had a role in it and I thought I had to say something about quality. Unfortunately, he did not. 1) The film is very confusing. There are two story lines that run simultaneously during the movie. They just have nothing in common. Throughout the movie we are currently waiting for these two story lines to meet so the plot is clear to me. But she has not done it yet. 2) The title of the film says the movie will be about Natica Jackson. Well, sometimes. As the film said, it covers two different stories, and the part about Natica Jackson is the shortest. So another title for this movie would not be a wrong choice. To finish my story, I really recommend that you leave this movie where it belongs, on the shelf in the store in a place that no one can see it. Doing this, you will not lose 90 minutes of your life, as we have done.
