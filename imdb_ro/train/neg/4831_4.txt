I hired this movie on Netflix after winning all the Oscars to see if it was so good. Hurt Locker is a very realistic (mostly) portrait of a soldier's rotation group in Iraq. The film focuses around Will James, a ruthless soldier who gets adrenaline to take risks and defuse bombs. If this film seems to be missing in my opinion is Plot and Direction of the film. This movie does not have a clear plot, unlike other movies, such as Black Hawk Down. What this movie is trying to do is focus more on characters and their different attitudes about war. Bigelow does a good job of focusing on characters, but there are many points in the movie where the dialogue seems to be pulled. Hurt Locker has a length of 131 minutes, but feels like a 3-hour film. A scene in the movie that was particularly awful and ruining the perfect credibility of the film was the sniping scene at the middle of the movie. It was both unrealistic and very long. Generally, I thought this movie was OK, but the reason I gave it a 6 instead of 7 was because it was a great disappointment for winning the best Oscars image. I felt like this movie could have been much better considering the private rescue Ryan lost the best picture, but it was much better than this movie. Another notable mention is Black Hawk Down, who only won 2 Oscars. Frankly, I do not know how he got the best picture. If you are looking for an action-packed warfare, hire Black Hawk Down. This movie will be forgotten in a year or two.
