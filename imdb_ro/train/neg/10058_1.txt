I was fascinated by how bad this movie was. Should the visionary have to learn something or reflect on something here? What happened to the pumpkins? Did I have to be impressed with the photos at the motel? Does it matter that there are some trash bags on a hotel roof? Why does the narrator unsuccessfully mock the interviewee (it is so obvious that he edited the really informative parts of his interviews to get mocked). The best part of the film was the interview with the film professor who tells us how bad this movie will be before it's over. I am really amazed. I think the creator strives to become intellectual or trying to impress the intellectual community.
