I watched this movie recently on DVD and I have to say I was not impressed. I know it's taboo to beat independent movies, but it felt unattractive. The premise was interesting, but execution has fallen. I woke up thinking "well, they just get into it, the story will soon take over." Before you know that, the movie is over and the story never took it. I can not say I found everything that's impressive. It was pretty bad. It's not bad, but bad of the Star Wars trilogy, but bad though. I'm not sure what the running time is, I'll take two hours (because it's a safe estimate). Anyway, when the movie was over, I felt as if I deserved a kind of recognition for the power of the will I exerted in not stopping the movie and walking halfway up the road. Again, I was completely imprinted, and finally bored with my intelligence. I'm not one of those guys that needs quick action and explosions in a movie, so do not start in me as a reason they do not like.
