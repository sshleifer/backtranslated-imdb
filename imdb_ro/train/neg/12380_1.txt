The creativity of this film has been lost from the beginning when writers and directors have left a good story line just to replace them with horrible special effects. This movie seemed to focus on funny kids, but it did not even do that. Many low-budget movies have the potential to become great movies, but this movie is not where it's close. Fortunately, it will be another easy-to-do movie and slightly forgotten. This movie was probably a chance for the actors to make a little money on their side until their chance came along for a real role in a good movie. Anyone who has a movie respect, should avoid watching this movie at any price.
