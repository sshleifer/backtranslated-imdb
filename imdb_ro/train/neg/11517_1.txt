I really wanted to like this movie because the critics were dissatisfied with him (at least) ... but it was terrible. Very terrible. You were acting badly, a mindless scenario, a roving cock ... Watching this movie was like seeing a car accident - you want to look away, /> <br /> because you want to see how disordered will arrive. Well, the car is destroyed and there are no survivors. On the plus side, the cinema was nice, made me want to go on holiday if I was just cleaning myself out of this world
