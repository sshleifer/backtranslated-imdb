I was curious to see this movie. Many people seem excited. I have my beliefs too. I believe in Jesus Christ, but I am open to any kind of opinion or opinion. It does not matter to me if Jesus existed as it is written in the Bible. If Mary was virgin or not, or all the other similar pagan coincidences. What matters to me is the idea of ​​salvation, the idea of ​​love as the only way to find peace in this world. What made me angry is when someone takes a sentence, presents it as a fact, but without showing the context in which it was written. For example, they have shown in this film the following words: "Those my enemies who did not want to be king over them - bring them here and kill them in front of me" Jesus (Luke 19:27) tells you it is context. Jesus said a story about a bad king. There is no passage in the Bible where Jesus sustains the killing. He is love! When they misinterpret the Bible, they make us cry out hateful people (pseudo-Christians). Most viewers do not check the information presented, so they begin to think about Jesus = hate = not good for me or anyone else. This is pure manipulation. Please use your brain. Do not take everything as a fact they say in this movie. We are destroying our own base, our civilization, if we begin to dismantle Jesus in this way and the message he has brought us. You saw from the branch where you stay.
