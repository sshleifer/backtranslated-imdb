### Spoilers! ### <br /> <br /> What does this movie offer? From editing and control cinema that fits a terrible plot. It's sad to see that Denzel Washington's talents are scattered in trashes like this. We are certainly understandable how Mexicans can not save, the necessary foreign forces, possibly militaristic, American. And we know the father is a shadowy character, yet he is a Mexican, unlike the wife who appreciates Creasey for being American. He killed everyone thinking he died. And did he do it? Of course, she will not, she is a young child and you should not hurt her sensitivity to Hollywood fans. The compromise scene was the only thing that prevented me from classifying it as "impossible to succeed" (as a critic pointed out) "Taken." The nausea of ​​such films will take time to go. It's in the ratings of such movies that we have to doubt the credibility of IMDb.7.7 for a movie like this and 7.0 for My Own Private Idaho. Realize! The mine will be in the 3.5-4.0 range
