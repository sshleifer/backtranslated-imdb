I have seen a lot of movies in my life, but not so many bad ones like this. It's a movie that makes fun of fat people, it does not have a real story, it has bad actors, it's not funny and much more. Is it a movie you want to see? I think filmmakers are trying to be original and creative, but they seem to have been made by a 12-year-old child who had no cinematic skills at all. The so-called funny parts are as fun as the plates that pass through people or the wind. For turkey, if this is the kind of humor you like, then this is the movie for you! Do not waste money on this movie!
