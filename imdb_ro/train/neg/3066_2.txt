This is a terrible remake of a marginal, but very pleasant film from the early 1970s. I've seen the original at least 6 times. The 1997 version is a 20-minute movie "crammed" in 2 hours or whatever it takes to run. Brief history, which, by the way, is completely different from the original. Major government involvement has been removed. There are no streams from one scene to the next. In the original, you can go for a drink or a bath and keep up. <br /> <br /> It took only a few hours of film to change the oil tank in the car. It often lasts longer than in real life. Car machines observe these things. Also fools or madmen who chose to destroy the 1968 charger and abuse a 1970 Challenger should be shot in the heel with a boring bullet. The fact that they are not "carmen" is painfully obvious, and their passage will not be sad. <br /> <br /> The actors had no emotions, everything was cut and dried. A step over a monoton. A barmitzvah is more exciting and energetic. Last but not least, DJ Radio made the statement that Challenger hit bulldozers at 180 or 185 (?). This is total garbage. Can you say aerodynamics, or lack of it? Hahahaha !! This movie is a joke. Do not waste your time watching this.
