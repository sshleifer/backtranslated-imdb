Tierney is a tough, authentic type, but this twist of RKO's normally normal film underestimates its impact on every turn. The script is as plausible as OJ Simpson on a ten-cement dinner. Just count the moments when the incredible companions of Tierney's car swallow one another for his evasive and violent acts. The old clich√© about this "just happening in movies" is applied here in a hurry. Then the guy plays the master, who seems to have strayed from a comfy comedy with the Fields Field, destroying the state of threat in the process. Static sets in a single room do not help the same or the obvious lack of the Feist director of material. Then add a follow-up to the final car that does not have both imagination and salary, and the results are fairly flat. In fact, the film is taken only in the scenes of the house where the hard-to-bark cops discover the hidden powers of the companions of innocent gas stations. Too bad that Tieney's career has never been gelling. I've noticed that it's largely due to the fact that it was as big as a heavy guy on the screen as on and to get lost in slumber after another. His cool ice and clarity of emotions sometimes remind me of Lee Marvin at his toughest guy. However, this project could have functioned as a radio show, but as a movie with a noir promising title, it's a disappointment.
