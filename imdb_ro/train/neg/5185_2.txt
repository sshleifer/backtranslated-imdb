A total loss of time <br /> <br /> Halla Bol is a complete loss of time. The script and the dialogues are badly written, the direction is blurred and the borders acting on the hammy. This movie was clearly for the purpose of crowd Rank Basanti, but it is much smaller than the mark because it does not even have one of the elements that made RDB connects with the audience_great script, a terrible action, a good direction, and a strong social message that has never been predicted but shown. Compared to this close-up masterpiece, Halla Bol takes a step back by resorting to scenes as a hero who slips on the rug of the villain's villain and the mentor of the bullet-looking hero in a truck no less! All this could have been acceptable in the 1980s, when there was a slowdown in the quality of the movie, and bad movies such as DivyaShakti and Phool Aur Kaante have become big hits, but the film has become subtle and more attentive late. <br /> <Rajkumar Santoshi is a capable director and I appreciate that he wants to give a social message in every movie he does, but maybe he just does not know how to do it! He uses the sermon without taking care of the public's intelligence in understanding what he is trying to say. Maybe he should just focus on entertainment and leave social messages to Rakeysh Mehras and Aamir Khans. Even if you disagree with everything I say, you will agree that throughout the screening you will be thinking that Rang De Basanti was much better and that Mr. Santoshi should have left the industry at Om Shanti Om. Industry-bashing? Santoshi described the industry as a back-biting place, bitching and casting sofa that the hero happily enjoys with a starlet called the curious Sania. There are some people who will think that these portions show the true face of the industry. Do not believe everything you see! In general, raise your voice against such films and do not spend your hard-earned money on this bomb. <br /> <br /> * from ****.
