WARNING! Do not even think about watching this movie in any form. It's not worth downloading from the internet. Every foot of pornography has more substance than this piece of lost cellulose. The so-called film makers have absolutely no idea how to make a movie. They could not say a good joke to save their lives. It is an insult to any human being. If you are looking for a fun movie - go look somewhere else. Hopefully this Mr. Unterwaldt ("Jr." is a good clue for lack of obvious experience and intellectual childhood) dies a slow / painful death and NEVER ever make a movie again. In fact, it's just a waste of time to NEVER scream about these nonsense, so I'll stop now and see a good movie.
