I do not know much about filming, but good movies have to say something ... your characters have to start and finish their journey. At the last exit to Brooklyn, they can not be satisfactory and do not mean a happy ending, whatever the end. The last exit to Brooklyn, set in Brooklyn in 1952, a brutal strike of work, sets a series of strands of storytelling on the move. Most involve some of the most inappropriate characters to ever go to a movie screen. But the last exit to Brooklyn fails to bring these stories to any conclusion ... let some of them endlessly spin or break into a certain bizarre stratosphere for an "artistic" ending. Two cases in place and spoilers. A sad travesty character (an important character in the movie) is hit by a car and killed. And that's for him in the movie ... he's gone forever, he's been blotted out of everyone's memory ... no reactions from his friends, enemies, lovers ... nothing. In another thread, stupid, flawless and homosexual strike leader who was dismissed by work, his gay lover and learned of neighborhood thieves, he was hit by thieves. The beacon scene shows the streets of Brooklyn, and the street light is very, very similar to Nazi extermination camps ... and the scene is shooting on and on and ... and the room is tuneted up to the leader's body labor, and was crucified ... ppppuuuulllleeeeeez. And, of course, that's for him too ... brainwashing ... gone. Bottom line ... no matter what the reviewers initially said in 1989 about this movie .... this film is a piece of depressing mud. Avoid it. And if you are not warned, it really deserves a NC-17 rating for massive amounts of physical, emotional and sexual brutality ... do not even allow adolescents to see.
