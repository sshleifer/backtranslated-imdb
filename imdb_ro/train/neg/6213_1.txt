This movie has become one of my first 10 worst movies. Horrible. <br /> <br /> It was not a continuous minute if it was not a fight with a monster or another. There was no chance for any character development, they were too busy when they ran from one sword fight to another. I did not have any emotional attachment (except for the big car that wanted to destroy them) The scenes were obviously stolen from other movies, LOTR, Star Wars and Matrix. <br /> <br /> The phantom scene at the end of the year was stolen from the final scene of the old wars with Yoda, Obee One and Vader. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The spider at first was exactly like Frodo being attacked by the spider in Return of the Kings. (Elijah Wood is the victim in both movies) and waiting ... ... hypnotizing (victiming) the victim and packing them ..... uh hello ???? <br /> <br /> And the whole car vs. the theme of man was the Matrix ... or the Terminator ..... There are several examples, but why are you wasting time? And someone to tell me what the Nazis were? ???? Nazi <br /> <br /> It was a story line for minors who rushed to reach a juvenile conclusion. The film could not decide whether it was a children's film or an adult film and it was not too big. <br /> <br /> Only awful. A real disappointment to say at least. Save your money.
