This is the kind of film that wants to be good, but sucks. The first thing, what the hell are these punks trying to do with school? I think the children do not seem to realize the gravity of the situation. Deker tells the girl that they are under his responsibility when he asks why he wants to come back for them, but immediately afterwards gives a pistol to the wheelchair type and wants him to go to repair the phone line himself. Where is the responsibility there? I understand that poor actors have to pay for their food, but why not just give them the money they take to make a bad movie like this or to give that money to a charity. Yes, and no one knows how to target. The bad punk guy is shooting nowhere in the cafeteria like a madman. Everyone wants to look professional, but they all suck. One more thing I do not think there is an emergency exit in school, the kids try more gates, but they all shut down. What happens if there's a fire and the security guard is dead? It is illegal not to have an emergency exit at school. However, there is much to say, but it would be too long. I spent some time in my life seeing stupidity.
