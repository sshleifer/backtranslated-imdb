Another product made for pieces of television! This is an island of a war movie (I use the word movie in the worst possible form!) I thought Telly Savalas's career hit the bottom of the rock when she made the voice during her visit to Birmingham video which was presented on Tarrant on TV on a semi on a regular basis, but I forgot that he was involved in this! I tried to push him into my subconscious memory, but the cable television brought the memory hitting and screaming from me! <br /> <br /> I like the bit (sarcastic laugh!) in the movie that claims to be a scene in Liverpool in the forties, but it is obviously a hit of the Zagreb Cathedral in the late eighties. Also, Commando's steam train trains on the JZ (Yugoslavia Yugoslavia or Yugoslav Rail Rail) logo on the side of the locomotive quite clearly, even though the manufacturers tried to eliminate them. Why not just film in the UK, where is the place where most of the movie is set? <br /> <br /> Inferno rubbish, and a waste of celluloid!
