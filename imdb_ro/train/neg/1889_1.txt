This film is not fun at all, but rather a deep look into the depths of the darkest part of human behavior. The loose connection between half a dozen stories about the worst kind of depravity, perverted sex, greed, violence and intolerance. All the action takes place in a few very warm and sticky days during a heat wave in Vienna, and heat can be responsible for some of the rage and hate in the film. For me, the treatment of the retarded girl by the security equipment vendor was the worst episode, followed closely by drunken and perverse scenes in the "slag" apartment. You will be captured and I hope I am terrified of this movie. I hated him, but I felt compelled to see her. 1/10 for "fun" 8/10 for displaying "man" as it is sometimes.
