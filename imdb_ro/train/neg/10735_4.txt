Perhaps I was a former Moscovit and having a sense of elastic humor, prevents me from throwing this film into the "arthouse / festival carp" trash. It's not the biggest film in 2005, nor the complete garbage. It has only a lot of problems. I also sincerely doubt that this film was forbidden because of any "ideological fear" or "conservative taboos" or for any other reason, this film could invariably be invoked "courageously" and "without compromise" abroad. It was forbidden because censors knew that 99% of Russian participants in the film would be offensive because of the inappropriate taste exerted during the filming and editing of this dull film. <br /> <br /> So we have a strong kick opening. Wonderful sound design, great premise - loaded with meaning and symbolism. The use and placement of the symbols will consistently represent the strongest aspects of the film (not that number 4 is a daunting visual challenge). In the next 40 minutes we have an equally strong configuration. An amusing and well written conversation between the three main characters and we feel pathetic to these people, the great country of Russia, the human condition and all that. Then the movie starts to slow down. We start wondering what's ahead of us. The rest is pretty boring, just put. Sure, the guy in the village tosses his hearts and there are some fun moments. Sound nice, sure. But the joy of this film, not to mention the plot, is seriously compromised by stimulus issues. And this lack of a payment for a stay through all the misery and misfortune is what will eventually make people upset about "offensive" stuff (personally, the main scene of the bizarre offensive, innocent beggars may appear and harmless). If you want to watch a nice movie where the Russians are wasted for long periods of time (the whole movie), watch Particulars of the National Hunt. More post-Soviet things much more rewarding. So yes, 4 out of 10 for 4, nice and symbolic of my post-mediocre condition.
