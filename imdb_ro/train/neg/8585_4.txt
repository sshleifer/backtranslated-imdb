Well, I think I'll have to be the one to say, "The Emperor has no clothes." When I saw the show for PBS last night, I was both hopeful and worrying. I liked "Morse" (even going so much to buy the full DVD set) and I felt that although I always liked Kevin Whately's Sgt. The character of Lewis, the WAS John Thaw show, period! After seeing the new Inspector Lewis (as billed here), I'm more convinced that when I was right ... Really good (even if it looks terrible (so old and too fat) does not have charisma to carry the show as Thaw did, and in what for his "friend" Fox, well ... maybe the reviewers here in England can understand what he says, but I for one of the most could not . <br /> <br /> As for Mrs. Innocent ... all I can say is I miss James Grout. I'm sorry to say that I should have the left "Morse" rest in peace .
