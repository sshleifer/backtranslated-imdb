I've been watching many cartoons or cartoons because I have a little girl who likes to watch TV. I started to watch this movie to see if I wanted my baby to look at her ... and not. At first I thought it was a movie as cute as the Bambi movie, but it was as if it were insinuated to be a homosexual. Information says he was having fun because he was not good at sports, but it was not the case. It just seems like a movie made for children to learn to be gay. It was also very sad, as far as the ducky father and all. I do not know, I think if you're gay you want, but I do not think I'll look back with my little girl.
