Awful! Very awful! No plot, no point, no purpose. Apparently the director started the room and then the whole crew went to lunch. Every day. I'm trying to give this video away, but no one will take it. I give it a 2 instead of 1 because I like Benigni. Roger, I'm going to have to say that for nothing
