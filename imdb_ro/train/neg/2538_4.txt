Between 1937 and 1939, Twentieth Century-Fox made a ton of Mr. Moto's films. However, towards the end of the series, it was obvious that the studio "jumped the shark", so to speak. This expression indicates that a TV show has exceeded the threshold and the responsible directors have decided to revive the show by fundamentally changing the formula. For example, with "The Brady Bunch" they introduced "Cousin Oliver" annoyingly and with "Family Ties" they introduced a strange child who grew up six years in one season! With Moto's movies, they jumped the shark by introducing a comic amusement because they believed that these smart movies had to be re-modeled. In the previous movie, Warren Hymer played an annoying fighter. And, in this film appears the character Archibald Featherstone. Featherstone could be one of the most annoying examples of comic relief ever, while you hoped someone (preferring Moto) would just kill him to shut him down! Although he should work for the famous Scotland Yard, he showed all the intelligence and the pursuit of a deadly cake of the brain. Again and again, his scenes were disturbing and useless, and Peter Lorre looked painful as he stood there and watched this act of bufon. It's so bad that it really destroys what would have been one of Moto's best movies because of its intelligent plot. As for the plot, Queen Sheba's crown is discovered in the opening scene. Moto, now more than an international policeman than the amoral character he originally had, is at hand to protect the precious element of being stolen. In a big turn, a few thieves try to steal the crown from one another. Generally, the movie is being watched, but it's also ample proof that the Moto series should have ended here. With the approach to World War II, the movies could not have survived much more, as a sympathetic Japanese character would not have been accepted in the US or in the Allied countries.
