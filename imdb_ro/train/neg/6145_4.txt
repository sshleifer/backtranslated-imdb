Although I had seen Gymkata in a theatrical way in the '85s, I could not remember anything in the plot except the vague images of Kurt Thomas unfolding and struggling with a wall of stone walls and disappointment about at the end. > <br /> After reading some of the other reviews, I took a copy of the new DVD released to go back to the Gymkata world. It looks like this is one of those movies produced during the '80s that would go directly to video today. Kurt Thomas was recruited from the blue to infiltrate the "Parmistans" nation to enter and hopefully win the "The Game," a Khan-sponsored bloodsucker that encourages his people by shouting what seems " Yak Power ". The purpose of the mission involves the Star Wars defense system. Jonathan is trained in the martial arts of Princess Rubali, who never speaks or comes out of the house. Once trained, she tries to mingle with the locals, wearing a red sweater lit with blue and white lines. Needless to say Cabot feels running and struggling for his life along the stone streets of Parmistan, on his way to a meeting with destiny and play. Star, Kurt Thomas was badly served by director Robert Clouse, who seems to have never been on stage. The so-called script is just this part of the incompetent. See other comments for the many monks throughout the territory. The city of madmen has some good moments, but it is finally ruined by bad editing. Ending ... meh. Still here is the germ of a good action adventure. A Hong Kong version with more visible action and faster rhythm could be quite good.
