The monster of Enemy Mine has somehow entered a mountain community where he lived. He is hunted by a female doctor, turned and vigilant, who will exterminate him. This female assassin, who looks like a kid in a Motley Crue video, walks on a motorcycle and tries to save a bunch of kids who chose to have a Big Chill weekend in the middle of the monster lawn. The decapitations and a lot of blood are in the first place to draw attention from the story that turns like a bad version of the island of Dr. Moreau (and yes it is worse than Val Kilmer).
