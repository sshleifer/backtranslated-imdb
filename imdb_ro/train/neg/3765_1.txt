I've always been interested in something about Bigfoot, so when I was looking for a movie for rent, it caught my eye. It was the best $ 4.50 I've ever spent and I want the money back! Please do not waste money on this! This was one of the cheapest movies I've ever seen. The whole movie was so incredibly boring and I found myself twisting my eyes very much and I did not even look. I just got tired of this. The act was horrible, the effects were horrible, everything was very bad and tasteless. Everything brought a very bad, boring movie and a total waste of time and money. I hope one day to make a good film about Sasquatch, but until then I will have to sit on countless cheap scenes like this to find the true masterpiece.
