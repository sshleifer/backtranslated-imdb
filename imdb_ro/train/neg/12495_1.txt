OK, I like bad horror. I really like dread enough to have fun. Demonicus or the House of the Dead - they were bad enough to have fun. I did not realize. <br /> <br /> It was worse. <br /> <br /> (spoiler - who cares?) <br /> <br /> My friend and I stayed throughout the movie and I have a number of comments both in the style of "this is shit ", as well as in the field of current criticism. Plot (a Kind) - There is a guy in this city (probably Seattle, see Comment below) that runs around and cuts the heads. He has done this for over a year (I do not go back to get exact numbers - thank you very much), possibly two or three years. One week's head. And the police are immediately called to a "specialist" (who refers to himself as a psychic, but who never comes again). Schya well! The federations take after what, three links? After almost all the similar assassinations, we will be under an exorbitant martial law !!!!! However, this "specialist" consults the voodoo puppies that the police always ignored, and the two of them come to the conclusion that he is the Baron Samedi, a voodoo spirit who cuts his head to gain enough power to turn into a body (and probably taking over the world - or maybe just going to Disneyland). <br /> <br /> <br /> Setting - where does this happen? Well, if you are not from Seattle, you may not realize that at the bar / rave (occupied by about ten members of the film staff and their family members) there is a poster for a local radio station and that entertainment, dialogue "Pulp Fiction" (as IF) between the two cops (yes, those who lose their head for about 15 minutes in the film) are talking about the "new stadium" that could still be a problem when the movie was made. <br /> <br /> Being from Seattle, I apologize for the film's name and hang my head in shame. OK, here's where she gets very critical - being a horror writer (not published, do not look for my name in IMDb), I'm doing research. A lot of research. And, unlike the writers of this film, I know that Baron Samedi - while a Voudon Loa who kept the cemeteries and who has traditionally been associated with "Satan" by the Christian oppressors - is a trickster "God In addition, much of the Voudoun religion is that Baron Samedi can have a body whenever he wishes. "His religious ceremonies focus on the possession of various members of the congregation by loa. Not to mention, if he already possessed someone, why is he making a new body? If Baron Samedi had a body, he would not go around cutting his head, it would be he took some rum and good cigars and might seem! In short, the only thing they have done (surprisingly) is that in the totally useless reading of the Tarot card (used only to show that the voodoo chicks are "scary") did not mislead the interpretations of the books I would like most films do. Again, I did research. (Anyone who remembers the late night late telephony announcement in tarot readings - "Lovers - you will soon fall crazy in love ..." and all that nonsense?) If you have done this away from my comments, I congratulate you. And I'm sorry again. I'm sorry if you feel the need to watch the movie for me, so do not worry.
