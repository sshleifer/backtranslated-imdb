The acronym "F.P.1" means "Floating Platform # 1". The film prefigures the construction of a "FP.1" in the middle of the Atlantic to be used as an "air station" for transatlantic flights. Based on a contemporary novel by Curt Siodmark; was filmed in German under the name "F.P.1 antwortet nicht" (1932), in French as "I.F.1 ne r√©pond plus" (1933), and in English as "F.P.1" (1933). Soon, technology has made the non-stop oceanic journey much more preferred. Stars Conrad Veidt (as Ellissen), Jill Esmond (Droste) and Leslie Fenton (like Claire) find love and sabotage the Atlantic platform. Karl Hartl directed. Mister. Veidt is very fun to look at; but it is not convincing in the "triangle of love" with Mrs Esmond and Mr. Fenton. Co-younger stars were the wives of Laurence Olivier and Ann Dvorak, respectively. Both the concept and the film have not aged well. <br /> <br /> **** F.P.1 (4/3/33) Karl Hartl ~ Conrad Veidt, Jill Esmond, Leslie Fenton
