To defeat his wife's death, an old man does what someone does in his / her position (at least in a movie by Peter Greenaway): he and his son populate their house eight and a half years old (one does not have feet) and embark on a sex odisee. This being a Greenaway movie, there are a lot of pretentious and uninteresting whims and of course there is useless masculine nudity. In fact, father and son share a bed sleeping in the nude. Crude. Besides, who wants to see an old full-frontal guy? For those who are not in a homo-erotic scene, one of the women likes to make the ugly horses. There is no story - just a random collection of dull scenes.
