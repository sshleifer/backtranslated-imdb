I was when I could not see this when he was seen at the Philly Film Fest last year, so when I saw he was going to be on the wire tonight, I told him to remind him as soon as I could. So it was worth the wait? Well, let's get out of here, because I'm not going to give you the plot yet. Sean Crawley is a young man who does not know what his way is alive. Enter Duke (George Wendt), who introduces his boss Ray (Danny Baldwin). One night, Ray, totally hammered, asks Sean to disappoint the guy they were following Sean. And it goes from there. Which leads me back to the question. Was it worth the wait? Yeah, no, the accumulation was pretty good, and George Wendt stole the movie for me. He took the ball and ran with him. But it's not nearly as violent as I was led to believe and somewhere along the shooting time running the ball is not just thrown but fumbled and taken in the opposite direction. I know exactly where this happened, but I can not say without breaking the movie. But useless to say it happened. The end does not save the movie either. Poor Stuart Gordon nothing can be good as "Re-animator" or "Castle Freak". <br /> <br /> My class: C <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Showtime Extreme <br /> <br /> Candy Candy: Kari Wuhrer shows herself in a fantasy and then in your next go and pour down and ...
