this movie is simply one of the worst movies ever made and is a condemnation not only for the British cinema industry but also for today's hacking talents. Not only did the film have a mass distribution, but also a good distribution of British actors, so what happened? I do not know and I just do not care enough to engage in the debate because the movie was so terrible that it does not deserve the thought at all. be warned and stay away from this garbage. but it seems like I have to write ten lines of text in this review, so I could also detail the plot. A nob of a man is set up by his evil friend and co-worker in his father's company and thus leads to a meeting with Russian mafia and dodgy accents and nonsense, very stupid plot behaviors / devices. I should have asked for my money back, but I was probably still shocked by experience. if you want a good crime film to watch ordinary suspects or the godfather, how about blocking, stock ... this is the tip of contemporary contemporary British film .....
