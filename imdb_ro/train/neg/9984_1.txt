It was a night on Sunday and I waited for the TV commercial. They said it was a comedy! The film started after 10 minutes after 30 minutes and I did not laugh even once. The fact is that the movie is over and we have not even gotten to laugh. Please, someone guess me, I lost 90 minutes for nothing.
