I loved Rock School and Jack Black. We could not wait to go see this movie. It was the only time in my life that the movie was so bad I wanted to go. And my husband hated her. The only funny parts were in trailers. My husband and I wanted to sit outside the cinema and tell people to save their money. The writing was terrible. It had all the dreaded stereotypes of the Hispanic people, who should be totally offended. The film was not that long, but for us it seemed an eternity. The people in the theater were so anxious and quiet that it was as if they had seen the dry paint. I made my husband to stay because I was sure there could be some redeeming parties, but they were not. Save money and time.
