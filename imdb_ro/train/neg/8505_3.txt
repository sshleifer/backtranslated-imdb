"Semana Santa" or "Angel of Death" is a very poor film. Mira Sorvino plays a detective trying to find a killer who throws arrows in people. Mira has an Italian accent that turns away from time to time. Can not speak English? All other characters have a forced mexican / english accent that distracts attention. Dialogue is very bad, and delivery is made of wood. Cinema looks beautiful, but that's not enough to save this shit. THIS PART OF THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> During the climax, it seems that the villain will escape, but then he turns back on the stairs to be shot and makes a cold waterfall on the railing. This shows that this scenario has no originality. AVOID!
