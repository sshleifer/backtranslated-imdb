"Triumph of love" does not triumph over anything. It's a 4-hour torture. In fact, it's a little less than 2 hours, it seemed much more. It makes me even think of the amateur performances of such actors as Ben Kingsley and Fiona Shaw. The players who support are not so horrible. Maybe they were trying to be so high to be hot, but if so, I did not see that. Mira Sorvino does not make an impression in one way or another. She (he) is there. I think the play with the same name, written by Marivaux 270 years ago, is much better. It could not be worse. Clare Peploe, the writer and director of this film, was inspired by a recent production of the play. I do not know what he was thinking when he created this bomb. <br /> <br /> Maybe they were lost in translation.
