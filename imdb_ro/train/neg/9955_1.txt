The whole thing is very nice to look at ... photographing the European location was a good idea. The main actors are attractive. The score is serviced. <br /> <br /> DAR FACED! And non-plot developed! And everything was down there. Pacino is sleepwalker and Keller continues to talk about how bored he is ... no, dear, you are not alone. When you make an imitation from Mae West, it might be possible to hide your face, which is painfully traceable. I can not imagine how an actor or director was involved, Sydney Pollack, Question, why did he get so bad? Because death is represented in almost every scene, one way or the other, maybe you should be a little enjoyable here. Perhaps he should feel so cold and cold as death. But I still can not recommend it.
