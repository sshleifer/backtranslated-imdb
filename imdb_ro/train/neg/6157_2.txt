Yikes, was definitely one of those sleepless nights where I navigated the canals and got into this filter. For some of the distribution names, I was expecting a much better movie. I'm almost embarrassed to see Oscar Winner F. Murray Abraham being reduced to such a horrible side. I hope the money was worth it. And the students spoke about the enclosure as if talking about survival in a war or horrible disaster. I mean, I was fenced, it's a fun sport, but I've never been that intense. The only reason I even looked at this movie was that the distance fell under the sofa and I was too lazy to get it back.
