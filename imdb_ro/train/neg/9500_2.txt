This movie is very bad. The act is terrible, except for Michael Ironside. I do not understand the story. Richard Grieco is the only survivor after a fight between two Mc groups. He comes to a city and suddenly he is chosen to fight the evil Indians who want. On the cover he said he was an Indian himself who returned too to his home town, I did not hear that in the movie, if it was not clear. Richard Grieco was a fuck a bad actor. Stiff and ugly. He also said his lines like him. And I'm not talking about Sean Young, it was not one of my favorite actors, but in this movie she plays an Indian woman who falls in love with Bolt (Grieco). She's terrible. When I rented it, I chose between this and the Subterfugi with Amanda Pays. I chose this because of Michael Ironside, who was in the cast. Maybe I should have taken Underground. You do not see this unless you think Richard Grieco looks tough on a motorcycle with sunglasses. I got home. I wrote it after I saw the movie.
