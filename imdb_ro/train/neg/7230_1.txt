I like fictional science, I'm fascinated by Egyptian mythology and I appreciate the digital animation. I realized that a movie that combines these three would be at least pleasing. I could not have been worse: the story (or, in fact, the lack of it) was completely uninspired and has no imagination - while imagination is usually the biggest component of any science fiction story. Dialogue and acting are even worse than in an average porn movie. Especially Thomas Kretschmann gives a new meaning to the term "bad performance". The unpleasant action would not have been an enormous problem if only the "director" Bilal did not get so seriously; all the lines sound like they should be poetic, it seems Bilal really thinks he made a piece of art here. Well, there is no art or poetry to be found in this piece of junk, just pretentious! This man should really be keen to make comics because he does not manage all the possible accounts as a director. The worst of all is the terrible digital animation, which is so ugly that it turns the film into a physically painful experience. Graphics show so fake that even the Van Helsing werewolves look like live actors! And since half of the characters are animated by CGI, it's quite a problem that the CGI effects look so fake. If the Egyptian gods really exist, then Bilal is a dead guy, because he will undoubtedly take revenge on him for the way he interprets them in this disastrous evil film.
