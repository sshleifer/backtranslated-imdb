This movie really started a wonderful beginning. She had the potential to turn into a romantic love story with cinema that recorded the love of "Harlan" and Tobe in long, poetic and idyllic scenes. It really did not have to be more than that, and for a moment I was delighted that someone finally made a beautiful film for herself, another classic endless, a modern myth, maybe. Why, then, mess up to the middle of the road, making the main character (Norton) another psychopath? Perhaps I miss the point, but do we really need another movie about psycho? Or does this need to be done in Hollywood to describe the sick part of human nature that indicates a general malaise in the cinema industry? For a moment, I was going to make a mental note about the director's name; now I remain indifferent. At least it should be added to the film's defense that all actors seemed to invest in their roles. Also, Evan Rachel Wood is really delighted to look and a good actress with plenty of potential.
