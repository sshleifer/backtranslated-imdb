I've read some good reviews that have defended and criticized the different aspects of this film. One thing they see, always and quickly, is unpleasant with Megan, the idealist politologist, trying to change the world. I loved his character. Maybe because I'm a student of 23 years of political science and I think I'm going to change the world, so I mean Megan. Besides, she's nice. She is not a super model, but rather a pretty girl next door. Okay, so he shouted and screamed a lot. Is it really dramatic and seems overwhelmed, but does not fit her character? She goes to that show with the intention of sacrificing her life to prove a point. She believes that people who enjoy such a show are sick. I think he did his argument very well. Of course, being a na√Øve young girl, she is frightened of what she is going to face. I think by acting a young girl who shows moral courage despite her overwhelming fear. In addition, I think he maintained a certain dignity throughout the film, despite the desperate situation he was in. As for the movie in general, other than Megan, it was just what I expected. She had excellent scenes with micro-budgeting standards. The plot can have a quick thought, hardly any contemplation. In principle, it's just a humorous, humorous, meaningless film that the name implies. I like doctor's sadism. He continued to chase Megan's shirt, not just for the sore cause (albeit for the most part), but to torture her before he killed her. The chain match was hilarious. For the filmmakers, he was probably the best character. I gave this movie 4 out of 10. It had a good decoration, almost no plot and a mixture of good and terrible action. I would recommend it for a cheap, but hardly hard diamond, which is micro-budget horror.
