I find it sad that Christians (and I am some) feel that we have to make movies like "Left behind". We have much better stories to say that it should not be so preaching. I was very disappointed with this movie. As an aspiring director who believes in Christ, I see this film as a perfect example of what I am not going to do with my career in the movie.
