I think this is one of the weakest of Shakespearean works Kenneth Branagh. After such great efforts as Much Ado About Nothing, etc. I thought this was poor. The distribution was weaker (Alicia Silverstone, Nivoli, McElhone ???), but my biggest influence was that he went with Bard's work and cut some of the piece to put on music / dance sequences. > You just do not do Shakespeare and then play with the song. Sorry, but that's just wrong. I love a fellow Porter just like the next person, but he is, do not rush with Shakespeare. Omit this and watch "Prospero's books" if you want to see a brilliant adaptation of Shakespeare's Tempest.
