Alan Alda plays the role of real life writer George Plimpton, "Sports Illustrated", who was once invited to join the Detroit Lions football team as an honorary member. Rather an unstoppable drama, dramatically unmoved by fantasy. Director Alex March takes an interest in this material, shooting him in a quasi-documentary manner (with a macho commentary) and still giving the story a touch of Capra's whims; however, by revealing the cinematic shine in this set, it turns the main narrative into a mess. Alda's uncharacteristic truth is another handicap, although the support is full of real-life pro-athletes (and sparking Lauren Hutton as Alda's girlfriend - how's that for a fantasy?). * 1/2 from ****
