I had the feeling that after "Submerged" this would not be better ... I was right. He has to search for champagne money and not care about the final product ... his voice is repeatedly called by a stranger who does not sound like him; editing is - well - just a note above amateur. It's nothing but a B or C movie with enough money to hire a pair of talented cameramen and a sound designer "OK". Like the previous poster, problems appear to appear in post-production (... doubling of voice, etc.). Sin, because the plot is actually OK for a SG movement. I will never rent another SG movie if I do not send an email asking for forgiveness. <br /> <br /> Too bad - I miss Kelly LeBrock ... - jimbo
