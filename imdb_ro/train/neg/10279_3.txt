This movie was so terrible that it was almost good ... almost. We love his musicals, but not that. Even with superb sound quality, bad cinema and many actors who can not sing or dance, Anthony Rapp has actually managed to perform well (especially to the end). The character of Marjorie, a drunk lady, was also pleased to look at her. <br /> <br /> The park is very unexpected and it could have been fun without singing frightfully and singing piano music. Admirably, some of the melodies (fantabulous) are quite appealing (but not in a good way). Open House is a funny movie to watch because it's awful! We think it could be good stage music (with excellent actors).
