Terry West had a good idea with this movie. Not exactly. There are endless shots of scary school exteriors that go on forever and probably to fill the time of the movie. There are only 2 students at this school. Misty Mundae is good as usual, but this movie will always belong to Ruby LaRocca (which is the only reason she saw the movie at first). If the script will focus on its exciting character, we will have a movie to watch. She is so GREAT !! Good news for DVD buyers, Terry West's earlier (and better) film "Blood For The Muse" is a special feature. One thing I would like to say is that this movie feels like someone who is not good at delivering the punch line at the end of a long joke for the end feels the same way. Then just watch this for Ruby LaRocca.
