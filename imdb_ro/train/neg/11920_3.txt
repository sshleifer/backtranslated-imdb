Oscar Wilde's manicure comedy, perhaps the most savory piece ever written, is nevertheless destroyed by the hand of a secondary distribution. Sanders is, as we would have expected, as usual, undoubtedly brilliant in the role of Mr. Darlington, but the rest of the cast makes the whole procedure a waste of time. Jean Crain attempts a scenic accent in alternative sentences, and the other members of the cast seem to think this is a melodrama and not a comedy; Indeed, all production has reserves that reduce it to tragedy - no doubt insists Hays office. Preminger's line-up seems to be mostly to make sure there are a lot of servants, and even music seems trivial. Stick to the silent visual farce as Lubitsch directs, or even the 2004 version of the Helen Hunt screen as Mrs. Erlynne; or try reading the song for the pleasure of words. But skip this version.
