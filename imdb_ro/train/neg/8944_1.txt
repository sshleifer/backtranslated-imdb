I saw this movie last year in the Media class and I have to say I was very ugly. I was in year 10 (and aged 15 years) so it may have something to do with it. But for English this year, 11th, we had to read Animal Farm, also by George Orwell. Apart from the fact that this book is based on the Revolution, my opinion is that it is a terrible book and I also hate it. But 1984, I think it was the most disturbing movie I've ever seen and I think George Orwell is one of the most disturbing people ever living on this planet. I'm sorry for all those who loved her work, but unfortunately I did not. The themes in the film were well illustrated, but the way the whole movie was set and the events that took place within it were not up to my standards. This is just my opinion and I'm sure many other people have enjoyed this film.
