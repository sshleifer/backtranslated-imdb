I think I was attracted to this film both because of the sound of the story and the main actor, so I gave her a shot from director Gregor Jordan (Buffalo Soldiers). Practically, Ned Kelly (Heath Ledger) is set up by the police, especially by superintendent Francis Hare (Geoffrey Rush), forced to flee, forming a band, and preventing them from releasing their own name and family name . That's all I can say about the story because I do not pay the most attention to being honest. They also played Orlando Bloom as Joseph Byrne, Naomi Watts as Julia Cook, Laurence Kinlan as Dan Kelly, Philip Barantini as Steve Hart, Joel Edgerton as Aaron Sherritt, Kiri Paramore as Constable Fitzpatrick, Kerry Condon as Kate Kelly, Emily Browning like Grace Kelly and Rachel Griffiths as Susan Scott. Ledger performs pretty well for what he deserves, and the movie has amazing moments, especially with a gun battle to the end, but I can not say I liked that I did not look at everything. Good!
