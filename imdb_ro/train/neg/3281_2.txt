I had suspicions that the movie would be bad. I'm a Duke's fan off the road. You have three years of TV series on DVD. I was right. He took the family to see her. I really wanted to see the general jump again, and some of the Chase sliding scenes were good. But to summarize, the movie was a bad version of the TV show. Jessica Simpson was pitiful. While I can honestly say that Daisy's original outfits were just as revealing, Jessica Simpson's interpretation of Daisy was just terrible. Sorrel Booke and Denver Pyle have to roll in the graves. <br /> <br /> Do not lose money. If you are an old tried and true Dukes fan like me and my three children you will be very disappointed.
