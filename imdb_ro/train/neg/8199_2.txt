I'm very glad I did not spend money to go to the cinema :-). It's nothing but a compilation of the elements of some other classic titles, such as The Thing, Final Fantasy, The Abyss, etc. framed in a rather boring and meaningless scenario. I really do not know what the purpose of creating this movie is - it has nothing new to offer in its story, which is also meaningless. In addition, there is nothing to be noticed - FX'es look like they were taken from a second-hand shop in general, you've seen them all in other movies. But it is certainly a good song.
