Because "cruel" would be the only word in existence to describe the intentions of these filmmakers. Where did you start? In one piece of beating, I'll start with the terrible accusation of everyone in the movie. Scratch this. Almost does not belong to that sentence. I can not even think of a character who was portrayed well. Although, in all fairness, it would be almost impossible to portray these zero dimensional characters in a successful way. However, the girl who played Katherine (whose name it deliberately does not include - I pretend it does not exist) remains one of the worst actors I've ever seen, just eclipsed by the guy who played Sebastian. The story was terrible of God. He tried to reflect the brilliance that was the first but failed in many ways. Pretty much, every part of it was useless - though I admit (with patience) that the breath of the plot was good enough, it is her surprise. And the end was at least a little humorous. But this movie is there with the worst thing I've seen. You do not look at him. Just not. There is absolutely no value in watching her. No one. It just takes the fun of the first one.
