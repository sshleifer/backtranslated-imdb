Thomas Clay mixes with the wrong types. This is the problem with young people nowadays, they have no respect. Seriously this movie should be avoided at all costs. The action in the main body of the film is slow and rather striking and goes to the mad drug, as if, like the director, there is no room for it to go any better. We are introduced into the main character of the title, which is a bit of an outsider, we see it at school and at home, which does not fit perfectly, feeling strange in itself, as do so many teenagers. Robert falls with bad guys and starts losing his school and taking drugs and before you know him is a raping psychologist. The film is really about Clay's total failure to understand the links between violent images and violent acts. Clay seems to think that a generation of crazy young people are being wrought by war scenes on our televisions. nevertheless shot the most disgusting part of SIMULATE violence. Is this real guy? If Clay did not see YouTube maybe he is naive and does not know he will be doing the scene of the brutal climate in his movie? All those who want to see is the most hideous scene at the end of the movie and I'm sure it will be what happens to people. The rest of the movie is useless to commit such violence to shoot Clay not only blames young people who are actively involved in preventing war, he blames himself as the perpetrator of extreme violence for no better reason than his personal status as a celebrity. <br /> <br /> Shame everyone involved.
