This resumption of Anthony Shaffer's classical play did not last long in cinemas. After having recently suffered from cable, I still congratulate myself for not wasting money on a ticket. Director Kenneth Branagh, writer Harold Pinter and producer / producer Jude Law, have been mistaken that their only prestige could have sustained this transvestity in an uninterrupted 93-minute period without the fun or class of the longer original. Michael Caine has increased his reputation by playing the second role in the wonderful 1972 movie. Now seems to intend to destroy it by trying to drive, played in that version by Laurence Olivier. (Both were nominated for Best Actor Oscar, but they lost Marlon Brando in THE GODFATHER.) Looking fluffy and washed, Caine glides through the deeper side than looks like Batman's mock-ups. He had already descended on a guest appearance in GET CARTER's atrocious remake. What's next - ALPHA II, or SON of the man who would be king? But then no one benefits from this inert adaptation of Pinter, who believes that the frequent curse and added sexual angle can compensate for the absence of Shaffer's character interaction. Branagh's direction is based on blue illumination and a soulless design that could not resist a second-generation nightclub. Neither the umbrellas nor the nearby, too broken, can help the Law to overcome the character of the screen. The result is a failure both as a straight theater and as a detective thriller, it almost makes you forget the purpose behind the title. The original stage production fans (with Anthony Quayle and Keith Baxter) and Olivier / The movie with the film "Caine" would do well to consider this enterprise as a bad dream. Later, Mr. Shaffer, who wrote the screenplay of 1972, as well as Hitchcock's FRANCE and some adaptations by Agatha Christie, must return to the grave, wishing to be able to plan a real or two crime!
