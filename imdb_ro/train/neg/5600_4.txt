Experiments with scientific expertise and failure. usually in his non-horror films, we still have a big gore, but not here. Arrange very fun scenes, such as when the prisons are forced to sit on a bar for 12 minutes and if they fall they are released. the guy fits and has some sort of match on the floor for about two minutes until his friends struggling to keep him anyway to lift him off the floor. The city is an obvious but not a bad model. and the end explosion is at least ridiculous. And do not get me started on terrible battle scenes. 4/10
