This production has absolutely no story. The acting is embarrassing. The promising Dutch television star Sophie Hilbrand should not add this movie to her resume. Her act is far from perfect and I personally think she has crossed the border of the decade; in connection with the way he is exposed in this film. This film contains too much unnecessary nudity, vulgar sex scenes and rude language. It also shows a wrong image of the Netherlands (as most movies do). Do not worry about watching this movie: a waste of time, a waste of money, and an embarrassing record for Hilbrand, which proved to be better with her on the screen.
