After seeing about half of this movie, I noticed something strange ... I've been constantly awake through TV channels to see what else is - it's not even a good feature of the movie. being in a series of genres, and I have to say that most of it has failed in each of them. 80% through the movie I've changed to watch an old repeat. Bottom line - the whole movie felt that those who did it did not know exactly what to do and came into a mix without discreet taste.
