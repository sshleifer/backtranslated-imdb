This story had a different angle that intrigued me, enough to buy a previously watched, previously viewed by VHS. It was a mistake. What could have been a very beautiful story about people injured in a hospital and their different personalities quickly turned into a very profane soap opera with inappropriate characters. /> <br /> <br /> We have Blossom (William Forsythe) the white racialist stereotype who says the word 'f' in any other phrase and is so desperate that they did not give him a name in the movie. It's really fun to be around. Then there is "Raymond Hill" (Wesley Snipes), a fast-talking female. Snipes must have liked those arrogant "hip" roles, talking fast, because he played in several of them, as in "White Men Can not Jump". Then there is a sweet Helen Hunt who plays "Anna" that wonderful loving who has adultery with the main character in the movie "Joel Garcia" (Eric Stoltz). is an unimaginable thing that feels good. It just makes my heart melt by looking at these cute people. But if you are one of those who loves the unhealthy characters portrayed by unpleasant people in this disturbing movie ... ... you might like it a lot! Add a dose of political fairness to Hollywood and go there! What more can someone want?
