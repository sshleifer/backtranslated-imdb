I could not help laughing! This movie is incredibly funny and stupid! But, it does not matter, it's really fun! In this movie, you do not have to pay attention! The actor is the same - LAME! Dinosaurs are the same - Rubber (Oh, I saw the stick that holds the T-Rex head for a moment.) The ramps are the same from Carnosaur 2, T-Rex is also the same, but ... in some scenes the head his looks quite stuffy and it seems like some kind of project failure at kindergarten. The action is fast, sometimes too fast, actually talking about quick editing, editing it so fast that we can not see rubber dinosaurs, but OOPPS! until late, I'm rubber! Well, just the interesting things here are to see Rick Dean in this sequel. What can I say ... do not rent it ... watch it on TV, with friends, it's much more fun!
