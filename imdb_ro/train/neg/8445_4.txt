For me every piece of art must be judged by these criteria: Form, Function and Meaning. Guernsey seems to be dedicated to shapes: beautiful and sometimes interesting photos. Nearby close lines suggest a feature that the viewer can fill alone. Because of the lack of texts, the story becomes a test. An introverted person suggests to have depth, but sometimes he does not seem to have anything to say. This film acts as an introverted person. If you have not read the synoptic, you can not see that it was suicide (and the question unanswered? Why?) That changes Anna's vision of life and makes her suspicious. - Why are not you talking to me? Sebastiaan asks. Anna does not respond, she begins to look at him for a long time without saying a word. What is the function of the photo? What does it mean? My question is as if Sebastiaans: What can this movie say? What does this movie mean? The answer to me: shows us a handful of people with the passion of a glass of water. The story of their lives is simple and boring. The reasons behind their actions are not presented. The rest is: skins, dwellings, landscapes. Beautiful and artistically made, but meaningless without having "instructions for use". In my opinion, this film is made for other artists, not for ordinary audiences.
