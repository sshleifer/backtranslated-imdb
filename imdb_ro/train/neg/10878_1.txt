This movie is so much a ripped-off masterpiece "demons" and that's the only thing that makes the movie worth watching. The action is terrible, the action scenes are accelerating, the scenario is almost painful and the budget does not exist. If you think this movie is good, then you have not seen a real horror movie, skip this and get a copy of the movie's demons.
