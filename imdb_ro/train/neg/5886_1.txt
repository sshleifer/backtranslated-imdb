I would have left the movie halfway up if I had not been with people who liked it. The film is based on real incidents, but it is so high that it did not feel real. I have a psychological background, I have a lot of psychotherapists and I know crazy people, so I do not think people like this exist. But in the film, the only characters that seemed constantly human were the father of Augusten (Alec Baldwin) and the young Augusten (Jack Kaedin). (Although Evan Rachel Wood was an intriguing diversion - very sexy, with a sense of bad fun). There were some funny moments, but the overall tone of the movie was grim, bizarre and ugly. What a loss of a remarkable distribution! As I watched them go, I felt I was looking at an acting class. This was brought home during the credit, when a couple of people were shown just standing there, not acting, not talking. These few moments were more fun than the previous 2 hours.
