This movie had what seemed a good premise: 9 people who face their fears to win a million dollars. Unfortunately, it did not turn out to be a good movie. There are several scenes that are too long and really irrelevant as the dance scene. Several scenes are just an excuse to move the room to the feminine body. The act is bad, but some of the lines are fun in their horror. What is really strange is that towards the end of the movie it turns into a minute of 5 minutes in the West and finally the overturns, many of which make no sense to the rest of the film. It seemed that the director had just added things because he thought it would look cool, conveniently ignoring the script of the movie until that moment. It simply did not make any sense. The only creepy thing was that the elders danced in the hallway, but that did not even come close to coping with the rest of this misery.
