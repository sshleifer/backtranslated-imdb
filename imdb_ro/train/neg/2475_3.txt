I was disappointed. the movie was a bit predictable and did not live up to hype plastered over the box. That being said, the characters were well developed, the windego myth was used in a unique premise, and the house was pretty scary but missed just for me. I have always waited for that great AHHHHH or BOO! But he did not come. In addition, the film has been plagued by bad footage of some weak special effects. It shows so much harm, without using the atmosphere and imagination of the spectators to create horror and suspense. Try movies like Session 9 or Cube if you're looking for a low-budget but well-designed horror film.
