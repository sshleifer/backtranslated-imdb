A very small police procedural film about homicide detectives trying to solve the killing of a woman whose band is back in a car stolen in Central Park and their only idea is a tattoo on her arm. Although released by RKO, it has the appearance of an independent production that was taken by the studio for distribution. The cast and crew, with a few exceptions - of which a young and unbelieving Jack Lord, director Edward Montagne and cameraman William Steiner - are composed of unknowns and shows. Performances are universal sub-par and should not have been involved in a high school film, the direction is bushy and agitated and, as mentioned above, there is no chemistry among the main actors. However, despite the many shortcomings of the film, it has some good points. The location in New York City and the ultra-low budget of the movie give it a similarity to the one of the "Naked City" superior, a shadowing in a dark basement is treated in a decent way, and some of the investigative procedures are intelligent. Otherwise, there is not much to write about home. However, it is worth looking at the New York City seam sections in the early 1950s, and old car fans will be ecstatic to see the laws of the 30's and 40's in the street. <Br /> <br />
