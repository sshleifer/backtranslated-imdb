This clunker of a movie sets a new standard for bad shooting. Jared Rushton offers the proper performance of a badly created character in a bad movie, creating a net effect of a very bad movie. The film has as its main objective that a boy's temporary trip to Canadian wildlife, after surviving a solo plane crash, allows the disgruntled teenager to deal with his pain in discovering his mother's extramarital affair. Unfortunately, it turns into a bizarre collage of "survival events" (including two very special hockey scenes involving the fight with a bear) and strange hallucinations that make you wonder if this kid is not just sitting in an alley somewhere on the pot dreaming of this whole movie (and what a nightmare!). Moreover, despite the fans' fan predictors of the film, there are several scenes that are not suitable for young children or family viewing, including a graphic scene of the underwater pilot with one of his eyes, apparently exploded. > <br /> In total, a terrible movie that no one should be subjected to, much less innocent children.
