This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I was deceived into thinking it might be good because some of my favorite actors are in it. Now I want to hit Jason Schwartzman in front of this role. I was physically ill after watching this movie. I really do not even understand Hollywood. There are so many people trying to break that I'm sure you can get rid of the top and get the best results. In this way, the worst film you make is the equivalent of Ferris Beullar instead of this sludge. The bands like the hairy doll and the gaunt torn from the jeans, added to the humor of the movie. I'm glad I avoided this movie and watched it on TV. This proves that you should avoid releasing from January at any cost.
