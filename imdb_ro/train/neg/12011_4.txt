John Pressman (Micheal "I should call him Ditech" Lerner) works in the doctor's office as being ordered. His mother (Zelda "Poltergeist" Rubenstein) hypnotizes him from people who see he thinks I'm wandering him. But this turns out to be a movie in a movie, but the lines fade soon as John goes to a movie theater to kill. Promises a guy watching the movie do the same. Lerner is properly above the top in this sense, but Zelda repeats the dialogue lines again and again. That gets annoying quickly. But not as annoying as the two girls watching the movie in a movie. Like a horror movie, it fails, it's too busy trying to be smart, trying to convey a message, and seems to forget that a slasher movie must evoke a sense of tension, or at least a jump or two. No, what we have here is the worst kind of blow: a house of art. <br /> <br /> My degree: D +
