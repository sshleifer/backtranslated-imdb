This movie was terrible. The end was absolutely horrible. There was no plot for the movie of anything. The only thing that was decent for the film was the act of Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones. Their performances were excellent! The only problem was that the film did not perform their performances as justice. If the scenario was about to capture a decent story halfway, it's worth watching. Instead, the shows of Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones are completely wasted on a terrible story of the god ... or their lack. Not only have we gone all the way through the movie so that something happens to make the movie ... a real movie ... not just a complete dialogue between characters for what has become absolutely unreasonable. It was nothing more than a common dialogue that had taken place at that time. There was nothing special about any of the characters. The only special thing was how Robert DuVall portrayed an old, senile, drunk man. Nothing will happen during the whole movie, including in the end. When the movie ended, I was amazed ... amazed that I stood in the whole movie, waiting for something interesting to watch the movie in time. It never happened! The characters' distribution began suddenly, making it obvious that the movie was over and I realized that I just lost 2 hours of my life watching a movie without absolutely no plot or meaning. It was not even a story. The whole movie takes place over the course of time. That's it. It was a day in the life (and death) of some welders on a plantation. How long can a story take place in a single day (except for the Film Training Day)? The current performances of the entire cast have been excellent, but they have been so scarcely shed by such a film disappointment ... if you can even call it a movie.
