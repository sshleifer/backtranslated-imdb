If you want to watch a true "quality" movie, get Formula The Eden. This wonderful movie must have cost all the $ 50 to do. It features a slim scenario, pathetic evil sets, illumination and camera and a stop motion, a monster of hack-paper that is absolutely ridiculous (it seems that sometimes they used a guy in a costume of rubber and / monster - but they were all just as terrible). <br /> <br /> The actors speak all as if they have never seen it before and read a teleprompter. The special effects are much worse. The only sad thing is that they have renounced the original title truly "Tyranasaurus Wrecks", which sums up exactly what you get for all 90 minutes. That's what happens when you scrub the barrel so hard that you get to the crumbling underneath. <br /> <br /> I liked every minute.
