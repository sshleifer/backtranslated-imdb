The director tells Behind-the-Scenes that he loves horror films. He loves so much that he dedicated the film to Dario Argento, as well as other notable directors such as George A. Romero and Tobe Hooper. In fact, dedicating this film to the great directors is like giving your mother a piece of shame for Mother's Day. The first thing they did wrong was casting. CAST PEOPLE WHO ARE ACT. Also, do not throw a 40-year-old person to the role of a wrong 18-year-old relic. That's right, he's been in high school for 22 years. The reactions made by people while watching their friends who took their hearts were fun. Or to one side when a guy is stabbed in his ear with a corn ear (haha get it), and his girlfriend just goes, "Oh .. my ... God?" Scarecrow itself is a pretty character. Making the cars and calling the missed. The movie has a redeeming factor ... oh, wait, do not you. If you MUST see this movie, just watch the Rock and Roll trailer on the DVD. It covers everything and has a really gnarly melody.
