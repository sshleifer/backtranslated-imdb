No scenario, bad actors (poor Melissa Gilbert) ... Beurk Beurk Beurk ... Grant such a budget to do it ... In Belgium, we make ten films winning all the Cannes prices with that. The last time I saw such a NULL movie was Hypercube. But the script was better. Does anyone know if the director was a graduate of a school movie or a policeman? The better things in this movie were the word "End" <br /> <br /> Why do you authorize to sell this? 1c is expensive. <br /> <br /> We have paid ten dollars to buy this. <br /> <br /> For me, you pay for this was my great MISSION for the millennium. Sin. <br /> <br /> Next time I will break my arm, but I will buy this type of sh * t.
