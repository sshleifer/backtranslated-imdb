Power Rangers, the totally terrible children's show in the 1990s, continues to upset young children with complete joy and a terrible situation. This show was not fun, it was an excuse to teach children's violence in presenting children to fight each other to resolve their differences. The toys were still demonstrative in promoting a violent television show and the like. I have never been able to figure out what the purpose of this ridiculous show has ever been. As such, it remains one of the worst performances ever made.
