Any movie that begins with a cowhand shagging a female calf can not promise much. As for the kibbutz stereotypes 50 years ago, I was there and it was not like that. OK, every kibbutz had only a small piece of something in the movie (like the young guys who run out of the kitchen at night), but you can not show the whole kibbutz as full of all - let's say - nasty traits. Each kibbutz had its own problems, but almost no kibbutz did not have it all. The views of Israel were wonderful. I still remember my youth in that garden of Eden called Emek (valley). Yes, and the act was good, too, you see that it was not all black - just a wrong portrait - probably for purposes too.
