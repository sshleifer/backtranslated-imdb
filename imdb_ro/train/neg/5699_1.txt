WOW, this movie was so horrible. I'm so glad I do not have to pay for seeing this terrible movie. it was like a nutshell going on a coke-cola! the previews he made did look decent, but they were REAL negative. I'll say the idea sounded decent, but it goes on. it was very bad. If you sat down and thought about it, you would realize it was UNREALISTIC. come back to the day u think they had all the things to work with. It was not like Ben Franklin sat down one day and made a misfortune. it was totally ridiculous, and you want to see a bad movie, then by all means go see this. ALL and ALL HORRIBLE could actually be my first top 10 movies I've ever seen.
