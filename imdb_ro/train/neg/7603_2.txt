I will be dull. I'm not one for politically correct films, where the woman plays the bad ass, which will not take anything from anyone. If any of the casting members wanted it, she could have gotten her out of a heartbeat. It was fun on MST 3K but did not rent the real version. Trust me. Have I ever lied to you?
