Fox's true story of Jesse James (1957) is a remarkably remarkable remake of the prestigious Tyrone Power / Henry Fonda 1939's "Jesse James". I'm not sure where the mistake lies, but pouring into this version of the two central characters, Nicholas Ray's non-uniform direction, and the bacon scenario certainly have something to do with it. At the end of the thirties forty, Tyrone Power was Fox's principal leader, but in the 1950s his star began to collapse, and studio head Darryl Zanuck began to lure him Robert Wagner, newcomer, to take his place. This was a major mistake for Zanuck because Wagner turned out to be less than a suitable replacement. With the possible exceptions of "Broken Lance" (1954) and "Between Heaven & Hell" (1956), it's hard to think of Wagner, which differs in everything! Also, Jeffrey Hunter was nothing more than a Fox player before being commissioned to play Frank James's Jesse Wagner in The True Story of Jesse James. Borrowed from the studio the previous year, this actor was a distinctive sign of his excellent and revealing performance in the classic "The Searchers" by John Ford. But his game here, alongside Wagner, as the second half of James Brothers, is nothing but boring. No player brings personality or color to their roles. It lacks the brand, lacking the charisma and appeal so lively exposed by Power and Fonda in its original. The film is also affected by too many flashbacks and with all of Wagner's script scenario, like Robin Hood in the West of America, meets like a twisted introverted twist that you can not feel any empathy for anything. The supporting film is not worth mentioning, but it is a shame to see such a great actress as Agnes Moorhead, who barely looks at Ma James. The best aspects of this Western disadvantage are the great cinematic cinematography of the great Joe McDonald and the excellent score of music by the underestimated and little-known composer, Leigh Harline!
