Written and used by amateur amateurs, produced by some exploiters, this is boring and hard to follow. Not the worst film ever, but at least the schlock like Space 9 in space cos had usually a real or two actor. I would recommend a thief in the night just for hardcore hardcore hardcore and hardcore dispensationalists. I am never. Do not you believe me? Watch it for free (though coming from poor VHS) here: http://www.archive.org/details/Thief-In-TheNnight <br /> <br /> Relevant links have been added mainly to reach 10 Minimum IMDb lines: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispensationalism http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/3199/thief-in-the-night-se-a/
