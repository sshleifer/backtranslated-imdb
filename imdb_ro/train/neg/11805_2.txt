Watch the original title in 1944! This made for the TV movie, is just terrible god! Although it uses (as far as I can say) almost the same dialogue, it does not work! Is the drive, the weak direction? OK, so it's done for the TV, but why watch a bad copy when you can get your hands on the gorgeous original? Especially you will be spoiled at the intrigue and you will not enjoy the original as much as it would have seen it first! <br /> <br /> There are a few things that differ from the original (it's shorter for one time), but all are in bad shape! The actors playing here do not match the bill! You just do not believe them and who could interpret Edward G. Robinsons from the original? If you want, watch it only after you have seen the original and even then you will be very courageous if you follow it! It's almost sacrilegious!
