In fact, what we have here is a bit more than a remake of the hilarious Kitsch horror of 1970, "Death Line", which ironically was like this cobblers, also partly filmed at the unused Aldwych subway station. Jubilee Line platforms now with Charing Cross as well as Aldwych, this movie contains essentially the same plot - killer zombie killer in the tunnels that feed on lost passengers who have lost the last train - originality is not a powerful movie . Indeed, strengths are without sadness. Gore ranges from the poor to useless over the gorilla while the sub-Gollum walnut is never fully fully explained, because it seems little more than a device under the developed parcel. Franke Polente has little to do with a slim scenario than running down a lot of tunnels and screaming every time so often, she really was like almost everyone else in this movie, out-acting by a dog and a pack of rat rats. London Underground movies are your bag, or you just want to play "spot tube location" that you take on DVD when it hits a scholarship. If you are looking for a classic horror, go and fill a copy of the Death (aka Raw Meat) line. If you are looking for a well-written and actionable movie, you will have to change the trains .....
