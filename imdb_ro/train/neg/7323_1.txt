Well, unlike other comments I wrote earlier, I have to say that the only good thing about this movie is that a guy in it seemed a bit like Jason Donavon, who reminded me of my youth. I have no idea how he won awards, and although I'm convinced that a great effort has been made, it was all helpless, because the end result is one that shouts from foreign soaps in the 90's. The plan was nonexistent, the cinema was hopeless, and the act was on par with one level performance. Unfortunately, it was long and the sub-parcels were incredibly unrealistic .... for example .... if your best friend slept with your ex boyfriend for 6 years after just 2 weeks of breakage you did not stay all the best friends. It was fantastic. That's all! Oh, yes, and the strange 90-year-old indie has been lying!
