Dragon Fighter is the first original Sci-Fi movie (although I suppose it's now called Syfy?) Original movie I've ever seen. But I've seen one or two others since then, and I can tell you they were stupid, but that really makes the bottom of the barrel really worse. CGI is getting weak, the act is bad, the script is ridiculous, and what happens at the end is unexpected and out of place (if you saw Dragon Fighter, you probably know what I mean, I did not want to put a spoiler in my review ). In addition, it was a musical song that was used in almost every dangerous sequence. It was really bad; they have always played it. And certainly not original; I know I heard that somewhere before (I do not remember where). This is one to avoid.
