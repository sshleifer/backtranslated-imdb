As this movie wins a rating of 6.7, it is beyond belief. It deserves nothing better than a 2.0 version and should be clearly among the worst 100 IMDb films of all time. The National Treasure is an affront to national intelligence and just another assault to the American Hollywood audience. Critics have said about the plot holes that you could drive on a 16 kilometer car. I like the justification for this movie being good ... "Nicholas Cage is cute". Come on people, no wonder people around the world think Americans are stupid. This movie must be the most stupid, insidious movie I've ever seen. If you wanted to see a decent film this season, consider Kinsey, The Woodsman, Million Dollar Baby or Sideways. The National Treasure, unfortunately, had much more advertising than those great movies. I bet most of you who are reading this have not even heard of them because some have not yet been widely disseminated. Nicholas Cage is a terrible actor - when he's in the right movies. Over time, I saw Cage scatter his terrible talent in horror-like movies like Con Air, The Rock, and Face-Off. When his talent is used as the adaptation of Charlie Kaufman, he is an incredible actor. Bottom line - I'd rather feed my hand with a wood chipper than be subjected again to this visual atrocities.
