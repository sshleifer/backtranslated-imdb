I watched Phat Beach on the cable for a while and I enjoyed it. The type of fat is the best character because he seems to be a great guy. The rest of the characters are just different stereotypes of young and young black people. I like to watch these low-budget movies that take a while because I'm almost like a documentary of the attitudes and fads of the year. Phat Beach is also funny because low-budget babes in this movie are strictly house girls. Most low budget movies have that "local" quality, and you can tell the children in this movie that they were the local strippers and underwear models for JC Penneys. Some of them had so much bikini-wrapped cellulite that it was fun to watch how the "youngsters" were savage over what was, in essence, a big mileage scandal. There were also boxes. This is the charm of these low-noise movies. You will see a lot of dogs and some real boxes! I checked some of them at IMDb and seven years later, Phat Beach is their only credit. Sin. It would be interesting if someone ever managed to make a book "Where am I now" about all the cuties that appeared in the history of the movies and then never came back. What happened?? There are probably one or two young people in almost all the movies that seem to have a lot to do for them, and years later, when you see the movie again on TV, you wonder "what happened to X?" Anyway, this movie blows but has some fun moments.
