This movie was billed as a comedy and a mystery. She fails badly at both. The only mystery here is why someone would do such a poorly built film. The only comedy is the laughter I received when I saw how tall the readers here were. Could there be two movies of the same name? The movie I saw played a pretty blue-eyed girl and a plot that was not there
