There are millions of people who think they are fans of Cary Grant, but I can not think of one reason to recommend this movie. I do not understand the distribution of Betsy Drake and it seems that no one else did it, judge from the small number of films she played afterwards. Most fans will agree that Katharine Hepburn was great at tracking and catching Cary Grant in Bringing Up Baby. Here the director or writers are trying to rebalance the idea, but he does not succeed at all. I read the comments about how Drake was "creepy," but I thought it was a too easy description. Franchot Tone went through it as if it were hungover. A casting disaster is one thing. This movie is a total disaster. It does not deserve 10 comment lines and I do not know why this is a requirement. Very badly, this has been preserved when so many valuable films are rotten in vaults. If you do not want to torture someone, give him a big place.
