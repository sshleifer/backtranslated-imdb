This movie goes around the circles, and the spectator does not know where they are. At first I thought .. mmmmm, it could be a great movie, this, but just pull on and over, and finally you do not know what's going on. The lively woman is a good actress and she played her role well, and the psycho-child is creepy, but after a little you do not care what's going on, because this movie just pulls. Shame indeed, this would have been much better. However, it is said that the lively woman and the psychologist will have a good career ahead of them, but they will remember this movie because they have made them known, or to be the movie they regretted.
