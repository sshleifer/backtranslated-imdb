Anyone who saw the children of Tammuz knows that he is a director who can do better. Hopefully it was not a case of too many hands in the pot (Telefilm anyone?) And that was a case of jitters two features. Characters are dimensional and are used everywhere. The scenery is extraordinary and has beautiful northwestern Pacific. The cinema is wonderful. Shot almost entirely out, the pictures are clear and beautiful. You can almost smell the wind blowing through the leaves. From a technical point of view, this movie is as sound as it is - it does not have a heart.
