I'm a Batman movie back and TV fan. I liked the show (new and old) and I loved all the movies. But this film is not as big as some people hoped to be. In my opinion, it is a great disappointment. I think the problem was that it has no drama. Batman: Fantasy Mask and Batman Beyond: The return of the joker has had a lot of dramas. and Batman & Mr. Freeze: Sub Zero also had a drama. I also think this movie is in light for Batman. The only scene that seems a bit dark is the big fight with Bane at the end. Anyway, it's a Batman movie. But I would hire him.
