I bought a DVD of this movie for my girlfriend sharing the same name with ghost girl in this movie and enjoying movies about paranormal. The movie was filmed entirely on the video, so it has the appearance of a special PBS in connection with it. The special effects are in the false search, but there are, in fact, some scary moments in the movie that made us crawl into our chair. There is a particularly effective scare involving a statue of the Virgin Mary. However, the act is bad, the "plot" scenes are long and very dull and I will tell you that I have no idea what happened at the end. If you get the movie, rent it, if you buy it, make sure you pay less than $ 5.
