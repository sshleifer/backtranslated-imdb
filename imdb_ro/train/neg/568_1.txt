This "debuted" today on the SciFi channel and all I can say is "I am speechless" I recorded it today to be able to watch her tonight after work. I had great hopes, now I'm breaking up the closets looking for a rope length, so I can hang myself. Maybe the worst movie I've ever seen. I wish I could say something like, "It was fun to have fun with this movie," but this movie does not give me anything to work on. I know you should not post spoilers here without prior warning, but I go anyway "This movie sucks" That's where I told her! They should show this movie to film the students to show them what they should not do! My nine-year-old granddaughter could make a better movie. The only decent thing about this movie is the sound and / or sound track. OH! I just found a rusty C clamp in my old toolbox. I'm going to put it on my left thumb and gather it until the pain clears the memory of what my eyes saw. I could record this VHS, but I think I'll burn it in the hole. I could wash with soap, but I'm afraid I will never be clean again. Christmas is coming. Buy this movie and give it to the people you want. -Mike
