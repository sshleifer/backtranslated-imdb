I just do not have the big premise of this episode - that Miranda is so remarkable and there is something so ugly that it would make you crazy. Someone has made the observation that maybe it is the frequency of light waves or something, rather than being an ugliness. Miranda is just a bastard. The episode is slow, inconsistent, and too talkative. I also do not quite understand why Kolos is an ambassador - why the Federation just does not leave those cursed by Medusa? It's a part I want when Kolos talks through Spock about the loneliness of human experience. Overall, I like TOS and even to the slightest extent, I will always come in. These episodes - mmm, I would not buy it except for a baby used under $ 3.
