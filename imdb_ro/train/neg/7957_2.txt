Wow. In twin cities, we have a station that shows a "Big Bad Movie" from Monday to Friday. The song tonight was a film with Carrie Fisher, called "She's Back," about a very annoying woman who gets to be killed when the elders enter the house. Bea (Beatrice) returns to haunt her husband. He wants to revenge her murderers, so he's "back." And he will not let him rest until he does that. It irritates him indefinitely ... and the viewers! This movie is really one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Hey, I like bad movies though (my movie is Xanadu). I just shook my head across the entire movie, asking me who would have been a good idea for a movie. Drink is so annoying. The plot is silly; the act is bad; the story ... well, you let go of me. Anyway, if you want to see a really bad movie - a really bad movie, check this out. You will not be disappointed. Heh.
