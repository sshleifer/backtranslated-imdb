This movie probably had potential for something; my astonishment is how these absolutely non-functional prosaic themes continue to turn into theaters, it's as if ideas are being recycled just because they are generations. Indeed, those who live behind most of the movies are like dogs, they return to swallow their own vomit. Well, I'm now $ 19 richer because of me. It was not at all imaginative, there was no moment of redemption, nothing remarkable in the trailer (and nothing amusing was in the trailer), performance was tense (especially Molly's, totally unconvincing). What theoretically was supposed to be a comical relief was the homoerotic friend with a plea for Disney movies; none of his analogies hit home, his little moral speeches were full, literally waiting for them to say something significant, just to find out that it was done. The so-called "tough 10" is the most insidious plastic creature that exists (apart from having a face like a horse with a strange smile); I honestly discovered that her girlfriend, Patty (called Hamburglar), was much better than her. But again, gentlemen prefer the brunette;) Well, however, the whole premise is that society is superficial and if love is true, it goes beyond all the social facades; the way they showed it, with a guy pulling someone else's scrotum and the premature ejaculation routine millions of times mutilated and killed to death (with obvious allusions to American Pie and Happiness - the latter at the disadvantage of revealing the scene to the family dog ). I feel as if the movie were like ridiculous jokes in an unlimited infinite ball of sewage. Go to show the marketing can push something there, shine any terrible meal and call it gold, people will come (worked for me). Ended with the tirade.
