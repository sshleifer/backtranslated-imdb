I live in Ottawa where this movie was made, and I really would have liked it not. This is a terrible blow to God. I really try and support independent films, but there is this stigma attached to any indie and that stigma is: India Films Blow. Well, this movie does nothing to spill this curse. The actor, writer, director, Brett Kelly has little to do with genre, but rather has stucco clich√©s tired of past films. I am really tired of the threat of evil-looking characters who hide in the shadows and travel to those who do not wonder, too much. <br /> <br /> I can remember a scene especially at the very end of the movie, where the whole scene is lit by car headlights. Now, some might say that this was an effect used to create a mood and tension, but unfortunately it was to present the hottest budget of this film. Like a movie that dares to call it horror, a spectator will find it hard to find any gore, other than a few scenes of corn syrup and red coloring of food. <br /> <br /> The biggest thing that pulls this film down is the rhythm and the lack of character development, the basic plot is that children are kidnapped and parents have to pursue this Bonesetter man before a certain time in order for to bring their children back. Not that this concept bothers me, but I did not think it is true that when the two main characters, both of whom have lost children, can find time to discover each other. This happens in such a short time that it is impossible to imagine, my first priority would be to bring my daughter back and at least to know the lady before doing it with her. <br /> <br /> The last point I have is ... and I will not keep this against Kelly, but the movie is shot entirely on a boring and emotionless film and that really removes any tense moments who would just wear style on the film. Though if this movie was given a million dollar makeover and redone story and boring acts and blades everything could not keep this movie afloat. My only hope is that something is happening to prevent Brett Kelly from doing a sequel, which was reported on his website, a half-written sequel in one session. <br /> <br /> Lord to help us all.
