This movie is known to be one of the most horrible examples of propaganda ever produced. The insistent equation of the Jews with disease is simply pathological, and even worse, it becomes almost credible for a few seconds by its pure repetition. The fact that this crude thing, even briefly, is an object lesson in itself. You have to have a strong stomach and firm adherence on yourself to stay with it, and I would not recommend trying it if you do not have a good reason.
