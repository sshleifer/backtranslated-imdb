I decided to watch this because he was nominated for Oscar this year. I think many people here really wanted to like this movie, but it ended up bored and disappointed. The first scene was OK, but the rest of the movie in the camera mode "shaky hands" is very annoying. I think the main reason for making such a film and nominating for an Academy Award is: <br /> <br /> "The American Military Machine" (people who make money at war) urgently needs an excuse or justification for the war in Iraq , by burglind something (somehow) patriotic. the "heroic" efforts of the director and the main character to inspire his audience with an idea of ​​"love-war-like-a-drug"? .. Oh, please, come on! what the hell! <br /> <br /> Watch this to get an idea of ​​how low the film academy can fall ...
