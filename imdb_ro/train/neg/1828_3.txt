I watched Envy two nights ago, on DVD, at a friends house. The premise of this film is quite promising, Jack Black and Ben Stiller in a comedy with great potential, but fails to deliver. I saw her with about five friends and no one laughed for the whole movie. Jokes (which are few and far between) are NOT funny in any way ... the story line is shit, and they never answer the question ... Where does SH * T go? Of course, the answer to this is NOT NEVER. This movie has no comedy value and, as some other users have said, the only thing that makes it worth watching is Christopher Walken as J-man. None of the characters are developed, so thin plots are almost transparent - and is that the song in the movie should be funny?
