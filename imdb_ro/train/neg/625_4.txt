With all the excessive violence in this movie, it could have been NC-17. But the gore could have been pg-13 and there were a lot of vows when my mom had an original boyfriend with bad guys. There was a lot of development of the characters that made the film better to look, then, after the baby returned to life as a scarecrow, there was an hour of mind and ten minutes of killing people. The violence was excessive and I think the number of bodies was more than twelve, which is a large number for such films. Almost every character in the movie is slaughtered or takes his head cut, but the teacher who called it "white garbage" and "hooligan" (although the lester is nothing more than a hooligan, not even close, I know hoods and the hood is part of it, in the classroom, I sit there and throw things to the teacher). The teacher deserved a more terrible death than any of the characters, but he was just stabbed in the back. There were two tense scenes in the movie, but it did not take long to be scary. As I said, the killing was excessive and sometimes people who have nothing to do with the story line have their heads cut off. If the gore was actually fun, then it would have been nc-17. Two children describe a body they find in cornfields, describe it as much more dizzy than it actually was, explaining to the cop that there were worms that crawl around the boys' intestines. His stomach was not even cut open, so there was no worm in his stomach, although I would have liked to see that. The act was pathetic, the characters were defeated, and the scarecrow could do a lot of gym stunts. I suggest you rent this movie for death scenes, I will not see it again soon, but I enjoyed the excessive violence. Also, do not bother with the sequel, I watched for five minutes and got bored to death, it sounds good, but it is not. The original scarab has kept my interest.
