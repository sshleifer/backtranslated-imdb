The film is total stupidity. We have two good actors who are a miscast and a head of actor Salman Khan just to attract the female audience. The story is stupid. Slight sketched characters. There are no stories. We can not talk about editing. Ajay Devgan as Star Rock ... which is a dream in itself. The film shoots along the decadence point. The whole thing about Arjun's bringing Manna to London, letting her beat his girlfriend and not letting him play at Wembley (Vimbley in the doubling process) is absurd. Salman Khan is the one who acts or is forgery and is too painful to look. I remember seeing some good movies from this Vipul Shah producer, but this is not one of them. Apparently all the good directors collapsed in the box office mania ... that the Mormons of Mumbai created. This is still a bad movie in the "Wanted" lines with an idiot actor like Salman Khan, which does not take place in a Good Hindi cinema. He's good for Indian cinema, as Titanic was at the winter cruise company. On a positive note - I like the Asin character dancing Bharatnatyam when he changes into Western style dancing when the teacher does not look.
