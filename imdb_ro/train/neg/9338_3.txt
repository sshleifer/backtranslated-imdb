Pam Grier plays Coffy. She is a nurse trying to get revenge on the drug dealers who took her sister hooked by a bad heroine. Like any movie of the '70s, you can expect to see the bad guys get their desserts. <br /> <br /> There were scores of these movies made in the '70s, and they were really disturbing for both black and white audiences alike. This is mainly due to the racially hostile hostility in these films and the degrading, stereotypical character. Especially feminine characters. Other common threads between Coffy and other such films include brutal violence, corrupt policemen, car tracking, generous abundance of nudity and sexually beautiful women. Not to mention the urban ghettos populated by drug dealers, pimps, mobsters and other criminal waste. Pam Grier, was the indisputable queen of Blaxploitation heroines in the 1970s. It was magnificent, being both painful and beautiful. As in other movies, Pam hides the other characters in Coffy. In fact, Pam is so charismatic on the screen that these types of movies are undiscovered without her as the main character. <br /> <br /> If you like Pam Grier, it would be better to see other movies like Foxy Brown, or perhaps Foster Friday. These films have far less empty than Coffy. Pam's character in Coffy degrades too much to make the bad guys. Pam in the other Blaxploitation films, he does not lean as low as to take revenge, as Coffy did. <br /> <br /> I would say, just watch Coffy if you can not see any of Pam Grier's other movies. Otherwise, Coffy is a waste of time. Only Pam's talent as an actress sees Coffy bearable.
