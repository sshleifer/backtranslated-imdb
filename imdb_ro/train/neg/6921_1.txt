I went to a prescreening of this movie and I was shocked how tricky it was. It was a combination of every horror / thriller clich√©, trying to comment on many things, including pedophilia, Satan's worship, undercover cops, affairs, religion ... and it was a mess. the act was pretty good; the child and the type of Jesus were fine, but besides them ... Anyway. I admire the effort (but slightly unsuccessful) of trying to show the Christian people in a different way ... even if they did so, the way it presented the Gospel was a little scholarship and childhood. But again, maybe it should have been since he was talking to a kid ... no. in fact, I decided that everything was bad. music ... oh, my lady ... horrible ... too too dramatic. Good. I felt bad about those who made this movie to the prime minister; It seemed like a poor student project. We will stop fighting with this and say finally, go see this movie if you want to lose an hour and fifty minutes of your life. there you go.
