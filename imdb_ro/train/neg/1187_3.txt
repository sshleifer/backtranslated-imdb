No, I'm not going to go here. I refuse to continue the program. Did not you suppose maybe this movie is just a tad over-rated? Look at the reader's comments and ratings of their stars: Most are 6/10, 7/10 or better. I think this is an example where ratings can tell more about people who play them than the movie itself, which is unique. How many other sexual fantasies about simulated bestiality complete with horse couplings have become table hits as title titles on the DVD? I watched this movie with a sense of anticipation, waiting for fireworks, and instead I took someone to throw me a Gucci shopping bag. It looks great, but once the thrill was spent even the end did not do much to save it. The film's story tells everything: The director of the 25-minute film about the bestial fake sex for another movie, is informed that the film will not be right, leaves it aside, waits two or three years to get a critical appreciation to build , then builds a full feature around 25 minutes, filming about 70 minutes otherwise unrelated, boring recordings, and inserting the 25-minute piece into a dream sequence. That the 25 minutes of the film in question are strikingly strange, original and shocking in a deliberate way, no doubt calculated. But we are not here to evaluate just 25 minutes, we have to consider the entire movie and wonder why people are so excited about the film? Or are they just enamored by the historical story and the history of being forbidden by people who were stupid enough to be offended by it? Maybe it's an anti-allergy agenda that addresses them. The killing of Western religions by Catholicism and Christianity is one of the few socially acceptable social debris - it has just been revealed today that the BBC usually erases its broadcasts of anti-Christian and anti-Western feelings in promoting political correctness. You can say whatever you want about the Bible, the pedophilia priests, about the institutionalized cruelty of the church, and how many white men and their inhuman religions suck the skin cut from a golf ball ... But it says a negative thing about non-occidentalized religions, and you're toast. This movie was personalized for such a feeling, with an aged old priest who had an unmistakable relationship on the screen with two 14-year-old French boys, completely inconvenient, touching, walking, backsides. Ewww. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> to see horses, you know, do it, I'd like to go live a farm. Having the genitals in front of me is just as fun as watching someone use a bath. Is this movie just a kind of artistic entertainment for social deviants? Probably, although I grant the artistic execution of the majority, filmed in a kind of Euro artistic detail, which even has a pond of crushed forest even from a Monet painting, completed with an arched bridge. And the end (which I even managed to capture) packs it all up in a worried package, if not disastrous. But you have to remember that there are certain things that can not be deconstructed for their design elements and many artists are guilty of exploiting them in their work to give a kind of gravity that would not have been achieved without it. It's not fair and even Clint Eastwood has fallen prey to desire with his new film about Iwo Jima. Whether his film is good or not, it is a separate consideration of whether or not this battle was a noble cause fought by heroes. The problem is that most people will not be able to separate the two aspects of the film and will be prepared to give it Oscars because of the noble message - not because it is a particularly good or original film. <br /> <br /> While it may seem like a strange parallel, I see one with THE BEAST: How can one not see the natural beauty of nature in front of the two horses that mate? And who can not see the logical culmination of sexually repressed fairy tales in the explosive play of the movie, where Beauty and the Beast eventually do ugly? Somehow I managed to miss both points and I'm delighted to have seen the movie so I can eliminate it as what it really is: 25 minutes of opening eyes over the adult highscore images of fairy-tale surrounded by 70 minutes The Dragon Skull Dull Artisy-Fartsy Euro Trash dreck about a guy who gets a haircut, and a wonderful ending. Art is safe, but it's wrong. <br /> <br /> 3/10
