I was not as lucky as some of the others were commenting on this film: I have not seen anything else in ... we will say ... "Sarah's mind" fecundates. I agree with many: some of the actors who spend a lot of time topless and (go-go) dances are not very attractive. I liked Fraulein Crank (...) ... she was so familiar, she was cute! The act was quite outdated as well, although the delivery of lines in a second language could have been a lot of this problem. Trying to follow the plot was a major problem: was it really one? I agree with another comment: for a vampire movie, there is not much blood. Yes, if you want to make good movies, click on such classic Hammer as "Horror of Dracula" and "My Brides of Dracula". Most (unintentional) humor is where the lady takes her clothes torn by a cloud of bats ... that you never see ... Bats, that is. Good as a time saver if it happens to catch it in the North Sea North, but for God's sake do not rent it!
