After seeing the movie for this movie and discovering that Spike Lee was leading, I was delighted to hear about this event. I was not alive when I was not living in New York, so I was expecting a lesson of history more than anything else. What I received was an interesting action, a lot of sex and about 30 minutes of filming that actually had something to do with Sam's Son. I think the movie did not refer to Sam's Son, but it was a look in the summer of 77. Tag me disappointed. <br /> <br />
