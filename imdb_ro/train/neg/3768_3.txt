This is correct. A written, directed and produced by Fred Tepper and family. (Fred should have known better after the sets of "Titantic" and "Dogma" worked.) So the plot. There are some scientists, a few forest shepherds and a hot chicken, with huge giant breasts. Everyone is very bad at work, including hot chicks (who think she should be a photographer, but who cares about her wearing a bikini). One of the forest shepherds says that scientists are "professional people," which is good, because it would be terrible if they were professional grubus, jellybeans or Ewoks. It moves through the woods looking for strange bones, such as monkeys, and no one even mentions that the bones might be those of the infamous Bigfoot. They just wander around, and one of the directors hits the hotter. We all hope he will die soon (alongside his sister, who is meant to be the naive, but it is even annoying). Then, panting, I find a Sasqu ... I mean, land burying animals, like Waters. Of course, it is not mentioned that it could only be the Bigfoot bones with which they confuse ... I think the scientists and the shepherds of the forest do not think only of those kinds of things. Then let Sasquatch and his tribe be angry and kill all the people we despise, drive the other losers and kill Aunt Muriel and Cousin Josh (who died in an unfortunate trout crash) again. Insipid, boring dialogue (I've been zoning several times), a deadly plot, characters that can not be personalized, a bad CGI (a man in a monkey suit would look better), and acting that was not very good , all are added to make a movie, again. <br /> <br /> Check everything; it's good for some unintentional laughter.
