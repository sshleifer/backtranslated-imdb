It's not just a bad movie; not only that the four "best" Mexican producers are in this film; and not only that the script is terrible. It's just ... this movie is ... great. These people lose money in terrible scriptures. It should make a criticism of Mexican society, but we are fed by such films. Is it a bad language supposed to be funny? I do not understand. Mexican film faces problems if such films continue to play (and be written and produced). Please do not think that this kind of movie is well received in Mexico: they and they do not reflect us.
