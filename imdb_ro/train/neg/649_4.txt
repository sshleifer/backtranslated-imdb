OK, this movie was made for a reason and reason only to make money! Producers obviously do not care about killing a classic horror movie. I knew that this movie would suck as soon as a pg-13 would be as many pg-13 slasher films turned out to be good? Is it like asking how many women were on the moon? The answer is NO! Prom night 1980 was racing not a masterpiece, but it certainly deserves to be recognized as a film that remains true to its genre and since it tried to be something more than that. My problem with Prom night 2008 is how he deals with the killer and I have 3 major issues with him ..................... 1) how he escapes, he was imprisoned in a mental institution and he escapes through an air conditioning valve! WHAT THE HELL? why would an air-conditioning valve be in the patient's room? Do they want to feel comfortable during their stay or something like that? 2) his intentions are somewhat uncertain the killer wants all the main victims the family and the friends to die so he can have them all, he says he loves it but in the next minute he tries to kill her the same way he wants to kill they, love her or just a rape? 3) Is the killer too good, how did he develop all of his skills? He was a teacher, so in this scene in which he kills the main victim of the victim, while he is essentially almost asleep and does not notice, all 2 stars out of 10 terrible, stupid and silly horror movie trials
