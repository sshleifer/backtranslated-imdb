The problem with this movie is that it is shot on the poorest camera and the film is unclear and granular. Perhaps it's just that whoever kept the camera could not stay still because they had a crisis or something like that. There is also too much poop and vomit in this movie. Someone's coming in twenty minutes, and it makes me think it was made of a bulimic or something. It was disgusting. Then there is an uproar, exalted scream that continues and continues and does not stop until the credits roll down. I also did not like when all her friends were shot (or do not know), and she goes to the van and puts tape on the tape. It was really stupid to even have this in a movie. How much gas can siphon a person to get a van van? There must be a lot, because they do not get gas for the rest of the film. It was a terrible movie, and I would very much suggest that I never see it in your whole life.
