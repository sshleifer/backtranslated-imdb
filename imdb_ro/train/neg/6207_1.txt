This movie commits what I would call emotional rape to the viewer. The film involved a stir among critics in Cannes, but for me the final script was just a pathetic attempt for a newbie director to observe. Hardly a voice in the discussion on violence, drug abuse or juvenile delinquency (or any other matter, for example). The metamorphosis of the main character from a good but disturbed boy to the vicious rapist is almost inexistent, while the rape scene (being an exaggerated version of the racket scene in "An orange clock") is unbearable and refuses to comment on her aesthetic values. There are a few things an artist should not do to achieve their purpose. At least in my opinion. <br /> <br /> Wrap it: shockingly shocking, revolting, and do not waste your time. See, in turn, "An orange watch" or "Le pianist".
