I went for this film believing it had good ratings. First, it is ridiculous that they release a movie originally made in 2001, seven years later, in 2008, here in India. Everything in the movie looks dated. Even for 2001, the film seems to be on a shoe budget line. There is a scene where a taxi hits a man to figure out how much budget you can get. Anthony Hopkins does not seem to know what he's doing in the movie. He ends up giving a long monologue to the end. If the movie had sparkling sparkle during that scene, I missed her when I was sleeping on my chair. Nothing about Jennifer Love Hewitt looks like a devil. He's wearing frightening clothes and slapping random children. As for Alec Baldwin, there is no need to miss a scene he meets for the first time with Webster. What a loss of money! As Anthony Hopkins said, "Go home and write better!"
