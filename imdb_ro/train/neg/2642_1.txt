Slowly, slowly, slowly ... There is no mystery or emotion in this movie. If you can not figure out who's the "mole" in the first ten minutes, you have to be dead brain. The secret service must have been, too, because it took them all to put them together. There are no compelling characters in the movie (not the movie). The pace of the film is slow, there is no tension. The committed killer is an excellent chance if he does not go to Michael Douglas than anything he seems to be able to hit is a big bag of glass. The funniest scene in the movie is when the wife of the presidents tells the code word at the end of the anticlimactic. He laughs ridiculously. At least six people have risen and left the movie early. I would have joined if I did not sit in the middle of the row. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
