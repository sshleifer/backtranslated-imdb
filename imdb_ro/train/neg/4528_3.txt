This version was the cheap man's version of what NWA under Jim Crockett Junior and Jim Crockett Promotions returned in the 1980s on localized "Big 3" stations during Saturday morning / afternoon Fighting Craze. When Ted Turner got his hand on Crockett's unsuccessful version of NWA, he turned it into the World Championship Wrestling and continued to quit all the NWA references together. NWA World Wide and NWA Pro Wrestling were associated with the WCW logo and moved along the road to Disney / MGM Studios in Orlando, Florida and eventually became nothing more than the Nitro, Thunder and Saturday recaptures Night. Worldwide, it was officially the last WCW program at Turner, which led to the weekend of the acquisition of WCW by Vince McMahon and WWF. Today, the entire NWA World Wide / WCW video archive, along with the entire NWA / WCW video library, is generally in WWE's Stamford, Connecticut's vaults.
