I confess - Emma, ​​in my opinion, is the only one ever written ever. It is as close to perfection as any mortal creation can be. Jane Austen gets to the top of his art here. Unfortunately, this is the best palimpsest. The comparison with the Gwyneth Paltrow version is inevitable - this version is much higher than the spiritual spirit of the book and much more enjoyable to watch. There are some good things here - Kate Berkinsale (who previously played Flora Poste in Cold Comfort Farm, clearly Emma's smart spiritual twins) is a wonderful Emma. Raymond Coulthard makes a decorating Frank Churchill. The production is beautiful, but the interiors are too dark. However, there are some major issues. The first is Mark Strong - first, it does not seem right for Mr. Knightley. This is probably because he plays the role of a Victorian parson. It's really stupid. <br /> <br /> The second problem is one of length. Simply, the movie is too short - to get the right sense, it should be twice as much. Finally, and most significant, there is the quality of adaptation. Austen is the dream of an adapter - all the dialogue already exists. It just needs to be cut down and properly arranged. Andrew Davies seems to think otherwise. First of all, this is a rather grim movie, and the last thing Emma should do is bleak. Moreover, Davies considered it appropriate to rewrite finishing as a kind of bucolic feast. What is Thomas Hardy's minor planet or work? It is absolutely outside the style and spirit of the novel. And I think it is extremely despicable to try to make improvements in terms of perfection. Look at the Paltrow version or watch Kate in the Cold Comfort Farm.
