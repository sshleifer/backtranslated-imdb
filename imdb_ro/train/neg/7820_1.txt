Or is she a bird? Is it a plane? No, look ... It's a disaster! Or: You do not need to look into the sky. or: (... OK, that's enough.) If the singer tried to make a romantic film like a titanic film to collapse the record of the tape, he failed. The SR structure can not do this, the dark and restricted color scheme (I would like to say "wishi-washi"), the usual dialogues, the clown with advanced foreign technology, the fun and the lost magic, etc. completely disappointing. <br /> <br /> It just does not work. The main thing about a character like Superman is that he is a superhero. That's the core, the most important thing. The love of the problem and the depressed superpower lost in a sad way may be just a facet in a Superman movie of 2:40, not all the time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is like a social study (and in this case very bad and boring) in which every 30 minutes a person flies around. <br /> <br /> This is a big difference. a joke. Above Skywalker, this is Superman, so give us Supervillains, Superaction and the most important thing, Superfun. We want the ENTERTAINMENT! Singer, if you want to make a long love drama of 2:40 drama about lost people and unfortunately? Then take normal human characters and make a yentl remake. They say: Superman is coming back. And then, supersadlysotie is in the door. Maybe the singer tried to kill the legend without kryptonite, but a bad movie can not do that. Do not give up, they're planning a sequel ... After the singer (and Warner Brothers) will make a superhero movie, not a depressing soap or leave it. A superhero film means a colorful fantasy with lots of fun and magic. This film is like a very cheap chocolate box with a super cover. Yes, technically there are all sorts of ideas, yes, there are many small discussions, there are some jokes, action scenes, etc., but the only one that shares all these weaker parts is their poor quality. <br /> It's no more than a super-boring mosaic and one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. The ridiculous casting strategy can continue in the next 25 years) gives the rest. Kate Bosworth plays an old 22-year-old reporter, looks like 19. Superman was five years old, so he slept with her 6 years ago, so she was 16 (like 13) and a daily planet reporter, spend a night with the superman. "Warner Brothers is too much, Routh is not that bad, he plays a bit of wood, but the whole movie is made of wood, so ... The temporary good was marsten and sometimes posey The rest, look, it's just that it's not his field, Reeve / Hackman / Kidder was so easy and fun to wear, what's the difference, Jesus poses at the end, and it's ridiculous, what the hell should that be? The problem here is that it means a serious one, not a joke. The next time Spiderman or Batman or Ironman falls and rises like Jesus or the angels or talks directly with God Why not? They are superheroes, saving human lives in each So at least one discussion with God every week should be It's possible ... Oh, my god. Perhaps this was not the announced movie, it's from a parallel parallel bizarre universe. <br /> <br /> For warrior brothers, this superlative depression will probably be the biggest disaster in history. Not just because of the money. I understand how difficult it was (maybe) to create and carry some messages or feelings, but to show that lonely, lost and sad people are not new and thousands of movies or TV shows have done better, to the very old ones or us, such as magnolia. And flying frogs were more impressive than this flying supermoman, I'm sorry, superman, of course. Singer and WB is simply nothing. In fact, it's even more than nothing, it's like a black hole that destroys passion for movies (comic / superhero) and steals us three hours of our lives. Smilla's brother. (Very angry and green, like a hulk.)
