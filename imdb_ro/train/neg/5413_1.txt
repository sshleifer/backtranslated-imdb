After MASTI had a good success, which was better, Inder Kumar returned again with a comedy PYAARE MOHAN, based on Hollywood, DO NOT EVOLVE, NEVER REMOVE The film reminds you of HUM HAI KAMAAL KE ( 1994) where Kader and Anupam play blind and deaf The film is a boring exercise The film has jokes of such nonsense that you do not like to laugh like the head of Snehal Dabi who gets stuck behind the horse and all those comedies we do not laugh at now, but the defeat of the film starts in a clich√© manner and some scenes are unfortunately funny such moments not how long the story never moves in this half even the comedy becomes boring The tower is well manipulated and the second half becomes a movie action where deaf and deaf go to rescue heroines and we have all the scenes of OTT chase and fight scenes Direction by Inder Kumar is bad Music es make it right, a song stands out LOVE on my ANGEL Vivek is terrible in comic scenes, his timing is very bad and he's fine in serious scenes. For some reasons, he continues to make comedy and destroys his career. Fardeen Khan is better but too wooden. The rest of Esha and Amrita are heroines Boman Iranian angry here Snehal Dabbi is okay
