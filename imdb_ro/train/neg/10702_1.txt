Dialogue: stylish, cliché; It acts: hammy, clichéd; Plot: predictable, cliché. Just what do Christopher Plummer Nastassia Kinski do in this garbage "B"? Plummer was well established for decades before making this film, Kinski had masterpieces like "Tess" and "People Cat" behind her ... She must have been desperate. Bad guys have all bad-guy accents - * bad * bad-guy accents! (Especially Plummer! Where did he learn to "German"?) And most of them also have bad angry. Innocent blind people overcome their panic enough to make you laugh. Good things survive, among others: * a 5-inch throwing knife buried in his shoulder in the shoulder - just pulling him out and a few seconds later using his arm without any difficulty, someone referring to a .50) in the leg which sorts it by tying a bandage around his foot trousers and then barely has a limp; * several fist fights in which he holds several punches on his face and the running of the skull - a fall, which looks like the third floor on the pavement without the slightest sign of the twisted ankle or any other inconvenience so sinking The scenario has exactly three smart lines, the rest of the time is just as boring and boring OK is not all bad, Plummer brings a certain class to his role, and is undoubtedly the best actor in this movie, much, but he can do the bad bastard without resorting to the ham techniques most used by him the bad guys here have left their Ve Haff vays and meance beasts with a certain threat, but you're always aware that you see Christopher Plummer acting on the bastard. This movie is really a terrible waste of time. The actress, like, is a kind of 70 films of wooden wood delivery lines of wood meets Bruce Lee's battle scenes very obviously fake but is not even nearly as good as either a Roger Moore 007 or a Bruce Lee movie. Not disturb.
