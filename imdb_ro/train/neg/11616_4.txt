I did not like the movie at all, Joshua. Perhaps it's because I saw another much more similar movie, called Orphan, 2 days before, but maybe it's just because this movie was not very good. I'm going with the ladder. Sure, the plot of a bad kid is not exactly original, but that does not mean the movie did not succeed. It could have been suspense and fun and refreshing, but instead it was slow building, boring, trouble-free, and really did not let me think of anything but "not very good" when it's over. At the end, Joshua's motives are revealed. I will not give up on it, but the reality is that she has not really achieved her goals, since, despite the fact that Vera Farmiga, like her mother, Abby, disappearing about three-quarters of the film, all the arrows soon indicate to come back home. She was employed in a mental institution because she was losing her mind, but Joshua's husband / husband was accused of manipulating drugs that told the public that the institution realized she was not really a mental illness, rather it was medically dosed. So .. should not come back home soon? Will Joshua not succeed? Will not his mother live with him and his sister and possibly his father soon? I wonder the Father since his future is left open. At the end of the day, I did not care about the characters. The evil demon child, Joshua, was not really scary. The story moved slowly, and when it was taken it was still boring. The suspense fell smoothly every time. When it was over, I could not believe I was sitting in this whole thing. <br /> <br /> 4/10 just because the actor was good from parents especially Vera Farmiga as Mother, but if you want to see a movie about a bad kid, go to Orphan. Now, this is a movie that took a uniginal concept and created a brilliant film.
