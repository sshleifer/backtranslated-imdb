Synopsis: Hong Kong, 1966. Paul Wagner, the man who built the Victoria tunnel, is murdered with his wife by his associates. His twin sons, Chad and Alex, are separated. 25 years later, Chad, a Los Angeles karate instructor, and Alex, a trafficker who lives in Hong Kong, join forces to avenge the murder of their parents and claim the tunnel. that Jean-Claude Van Damme & Sheldon Lettich worked together, making "Lionheart" before. This is also the first of three films in which Van Damme plays dual roles ("Maximum Rise" and "Replicant" are the other). The land is a very simplistic story about the revenge story, the only feature of the movie's redeeming being Van Damme's interpretation as two very different people? the wealthy child, and the tough - and - tumble bastard, the tough asshole. As he goes, Van Damme does not do a very good job in any role, although Alex's pickup is funny. It is inconceivable that the brothers were confused with each other, wearing different clothes and different hairstyles. Bolo Yeung makes a damn for the wicked.
