I downloaded this movie yesterday through an internet site The quality was pretty good! I was looking at the movie with high expectations (although I knew it was a flop), especially because the movie has the superstar Amitabh Bachchan who plays the bastard. Even if at least the actors like him did something for their roles. unfortunately, Mr. Bachchan failed to impress the villain, this proved that no one can compete with AMJAD KHAN's magical Raj's process to re-establish the red-turned past! Sholay, the old one is a milestone in Indian cinema, with an all-star cast, a dialogue of worship, a stylish cinema and a brilliant soundtrack that is still a blow to current generations. A good actor like Ajay Devgan's TALENTS are wasted and his media performance.Prashant Raj, a newcomer does not know what actor is. Nisha Kothari proved to be one of the worst actresses we have Do not know how he is still in the crew of RGV Urmila & Abhishek seen in a song without enthusiasm and passion Mohanlal tried the best and Susmitha Sen's work was I liked somehow you worked in this movie It was a total notebook of the original Sholay
