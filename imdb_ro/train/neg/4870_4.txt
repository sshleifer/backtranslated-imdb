The film is bad. Nothing special - just a "baby" movie that has nothing serious about it. There is, however, a reason to look at this: it talks about animals. Some of them are so amusing in what they say, you can not stop laughing. So if you want to hear a dog in the dog saying "I am Keyser Soze", or another animal that says "You are a dead cat walking" or many other funny line, see. Because there is no other good movie to watch him. Vote: 4 out of 10.
