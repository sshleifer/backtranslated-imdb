I do not have much to say about this movie. It could have been a great tour for Peter Sellers, but it's one of the most tragic mistakes in film history. That the seller's final movie makes it even more painful. The terrific scenario, the stunning direction and spectacular woods come awful together to make this film one of the most undesired movies ever made. > <br /> I wish so much to find a snicker or a chicot buried somewhere in this pile of bloody blobs, but it is a lifeless, humorless disaster. Truth hurts. Peter, why could not you stop at WHAT?
