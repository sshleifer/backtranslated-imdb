It was a disappointment - none of the nuances of the original. The British seem to be able to make a truly anxious film without any of the most important stories of the American version. The original series combined both stunning stories and subtlety of performance, with great attention to lighting and settings. I've been watching the series several times and I'm still excited. Just another bad adaptation, in the sense of the terrible adaptation of Cracker. Get in touch with BBC America or BBC Canada and watch out for delights such as Waking the Dead, Spooks, Silent Witness, and Judge John Deed. Watch the original Touching Evil, then look for "Wire in the Blood" for Robson Green's stylish and stylish performance. Hollywood must look at this actor!
