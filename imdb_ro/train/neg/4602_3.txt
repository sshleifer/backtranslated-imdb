A movie without conscience. Drifter agrees to kill a man for a gangster for money. Then he doubles it. Meanwhile, he falls in love with the dead man's wife and, without knowing he's the killer, moves with her. Then "accidentally" kills her when she finds out. Then, in a kind of WALKING TALL type of heroism, he takes revenge on the mobs who doubled it. The first problem is that accepting to take the crime through employment, the accuser loses his sense, sympathy and heroism. We can not accept any kindness in him, and as a result, the rest has no moral center. We do not care about this guy. And the wife (played beautifully by Kari Wuhrer, Sheriff in Eight LEGGED FREAKS), a high-class lady who heads a homeless homeless mission, also loses some sympathy, even jumping into the bed with the homeless rider obviously weakened after her husband's death). And when did he find out he was that guy? What is she doing? It blocks it inside the house (as if all the houses have locks that you can not open from INSIDE) with it and continues to beat it. Stoo-pid. George Wendt, however, is awesome in acting as an elderly bully. Director Stuart Gordon did much better with RE-ANIMATOR and DAGON.
