It probably does not fit in the bottom of the barrel of mediocre Slasher films, but it's definitely a bad movie. The holiday premise has made it interesting, but after the first scenes the film demonstrates that the production values ​​and the stupid plot are poor. I mean, the sub-genus was at the moment all about an unseen maniac that gathers adolescents without obvious reasons, but this has taken it too far. There is absolutely no coherence in events or anything else to add. Clichès is more than boring, the gore is minimal, so is the mystery. <br /> <br /> This is a fairly mediocre entry that should not be hiped even if it has a nasty video tag. I am really disappointed with this overpriced piece of garbage.
