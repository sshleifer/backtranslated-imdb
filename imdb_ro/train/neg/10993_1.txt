Sure, we all love bad movies at some point or another and we really enjoy them. However, it was not even a guilty pleasure, it was just stupid. A guy, Vince's offer, which is terrified enough to become the main character while probably getting drunk / probably others - and thought it was a great idea to make a movie. Then he continued to show his screenplay to equally tall / good individuals. Overall, this movie was so bad, predictable and non-original that I could not get 20 minutes before stopping it. It makes you serve Citizen Kane. Batman? WTF ... A guy who walks with a beating, original original. Almost as good as calling him Fat Man, and having a kind of fat walk around a superhero costume.
