In a nutshell, this movie was boring. He did not lack life and spark. A big problem is with the two rulers. Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow had no chemistry. It was boring and it was annoying. <br /> <br /> The pictures were interesting, but they did not improve the scenes. If not, the images tended to detach the audience from what was happening on the screen. None of the sequences of action felt real, and therefore the movie failed to create any real drama or a sense of danger. The film had potential, but it needed a better script, better action and better director. I thought during the movie, you know, the movie would have worked if Harrison Ford was Sky Captain, Karen Allen was Polly, and Steven Spielberg was the director. <br /> Ignore critical appreciations for this movie. Critics think that they praise the movie because they * want * to like and want to succeed, even if it does not succeed on so many different levels.
