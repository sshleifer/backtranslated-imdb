"The Malcom display on FOX really does a killing ... can not we make our own version?" We speculate and paraphrase, of course, but in our hearts we all know it is true and that the only thing NBC added to the Malcom metric was sex. And, boy, they added sex ... Thirteen years old Tucker becomes a boner and covers him with his skateboard. Tucker accidentally enters his aunt in the shower and accuses him of looking at her and beating her. Spies on the pretty girl in the next house in the bedroom window and knows he wants to see her without a spike, but teases him smiling and closing the window. And that's all in the pilot. Take her from an uplifted man - the boy's puberty is so crazy and sexed by the testicles, it's impossible to make fun for a mass audience. The only time someone ever approached was in the movies and you can count on them on the one hand. So, it's no surprise that "Tucker" has the warmth and attraction of a bathing band. In fact, does the network think we'd like to see how kids fight at puberty? Are not the things people take in jail? If you doubt the depravity of the show, consider this: 13 episodes were filmed, but NBC canceled it after only four episodes broadcast; then they made the unprecedented "burn" movement of the remaining episodes, spreading them to MIDNIGHT so that no child can see them. Ironic because the children were originally the target audience. <br /> <br /> In addition to its general character, Tucker has a voice from the main character to reveal inappropriate writing. Even in 2000 it was horribly dated with incidental ska music and super-sarcasm. I did not like any of the characters enough to laugh at the jokes and the jokes did not come exactly one kilometer ... NBC's shame for this dirty spoil ... I'm better than that. <br /> <br /> GRADUL: C-
