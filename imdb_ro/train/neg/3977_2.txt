The twin sisters of the same nature, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, went to fame in sitcoms like "Two of a Kind," I never saw them before, but I had an idea of ​​what to expect, but it was much worse. Basically, sisters from Hunter Charli (Mary-Kate) and Leila (Ashley) are in Rome for a summer internship, but not long after they start working, they are immediately fired for a number of shortcomings. But the man who owns the company they work in, Derek Hammond (Julian Stone), gives them jobs back, and they turn out to be useful goods and talented artists (fashion) and help stop the takeover of a bad man. Leslie Danon also played as Jami, Derek Lee Nixon as Ryan, Ilenia Lazzarin as Dari, Archie Kao as Nobu, Valentina Mattolini as Heidi, Michelangelo Tommaso as Paolo and Matt Patresi as Enrico Tortoni. You can say that this movie was made to go directly to the movie, work on the camera is completely inappropriate and does not help you when you want to admire the sights of Rome. In fact, the background is the only thing to be noticed, the twin sisters are two of the most annoying celebrities around, I knew before I forgot that they would not interest me in any way (not so beautiful), that's awful taste garbage film. Pretty poor!
