This is not a horror movie, it's a boring film of sex. A very bad movie that must be avoided by any serious horror fan. No plot, horrible action, and annoying music. If you only watch the trailer that you will know enough ... It's a shame that such a thing is available on VHS or video, while there are not so many good movies unavailable. If you like vampires try Hammer Productions or Italian Gothic from Mario Bava and Antonio Margheriti instead. These are masterpieces if you compare this to this garbage. Rating = "1" is too much! And believe me, I'm not the only one who has this opinion.
