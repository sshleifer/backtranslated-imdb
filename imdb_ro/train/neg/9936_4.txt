I chose this for 50 cents in the flea market, was quite excited. I found it fascinating for about 15 minutes, then just repetitive and boring. Mick and the band in their foreground, I wish they had not been so over duplicating the dialogue, so I could hear what they say and sing. The skits are politically given and incredibly naive and simple by writing Monty Python on Acid. I spent a lot of time looking back at the late 1960s drops rather than what actually happens in silly skits. This movie is a good reminder that times are really changing, and what was important is quickly becoming simply stupid. Good song, but now it was played to death by this DVD.
