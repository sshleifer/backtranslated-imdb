No one would like this movie for its merit, but if you have a sense of humor and enjoy schlock movies for their MST3 quality then it's for you. It's there with "Road House" for its characters, sets, and stories. The bad writing really blunted me: "I want to dust those guys" instead of "the dust of those guys." The F-14s take off from the carrier, but when I get into training I'm F-16! Without any hint of anger or skepticism, Segal returns to work for the General who, just minutes before, was watching a Seagal secret "wipe out". Segal runs off bullets and resorts to a knife to kill the guards. So, of course, guards pull their guns and fight with knives! The hand grenade is a stick, but it explodes anyway. The little stealth fighter can fly from California to Afghanistan without being fed. Then Segal takes her back to California - the long road, that is to say through Europe - even though there is a carrier that offers 20 minutes of air support to the Arabian Sea. The CIC in the carrier consists of 3 black PCs, 2 flat-screen TVs, and calibration images and wall maps. What bad luck!
