Leap Years plays a few hard hitters in the local and regional film and television scene. And yet, they can not save this movie. She has so many things going against her - over acting, too melodramatic, poor script, inconsistent direction; and too few things to go - decent music, good cinema. This comment is mainly for anyone who throws all local movies in a basket after watching this movie and says all local movies are bad. Please do not judge the rest on this movie. This is a television digging that behaves like a romantic movie. My hopes were raised when I bought my ticket and my hopes were destroyed in five minutes in the movie.
