costume drama is badly expressed and without charm. George Sanders was a superb character actor. But he is completely implausible here, as a lead, an 18th century rogue, known for his philosophy and for a good look. His cost is, of all people, Akim Tamiroff. A Frenchman! Then is Signe Hasso, in a dark wig, like the virgin daughter of a wealthy family. Carole Landis knows best. The film opens with her in silhouette. She is a soubrette and a cheek girl at that. It disappears for a while, but it appears in an unlikely situation. But it's good. She was always an appealing actress. Here is the closest to her usual role. It's about a little nasty, a kind of ooh-to-la. It should have been a slight touch, but it's a lead business from start to finish.
