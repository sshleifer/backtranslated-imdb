I did not think it was possible, but I found a movie worse than "Body Melt". This movie is really really bad! And what makes it worse is that another Australian movie ... Shot on what looks like VHS, and with a 80 rock rock soundtrack, gets worse, which is hard to believe by seeing how bad is the beginning (the husband hanging up and down in a white tomato sauce pulverized someone's room?). And why do their accents keep changing? From badl drawl in New York to prissy english, then pure Aussie! And it happens with all the distribution! This film also claims to have won a film festival on the cover (I think it was the Utah Film Festival). This must be a lie because no one in the right mind would call this for anything (maybe the Golden Rush, but I think it's too bad for that). Come on! This movie must be number one at the bottom 100! It must be ten times worse than those movies already there. Well done for film makers in this trash to prove there's a reason not to see movies ... 0/10
