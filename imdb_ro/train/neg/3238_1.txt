Experiment of the Devil: 1/10: Hardcore porn movies fall into two categories, those who have a plot of plot (Gee that is a lucky pizza boy) and those without (Anal Amateur 36). Devil's Experiment fits firmly in this latter category. <br /> <br /> It's, of course, the horror version of hardcore porn. An almost complete plot, less than 43 minutes, waiting for the money to shoot. Recorded on the video in 1985, she is composed of three relatively unpopulated Japanese boys, torturing a pretty unattractive Japanese girl. The torment ranges from banal (striking it 50 times, hitting it with one hundred), stupidity (linking it in an office chair and spinning around it), the fear factor (a worm bath and sheep strands). (A well-executed piercing). <br /> <br /> That's it, no plot, no reason, just Blair Witch's weapons and torture. The girl seems bored and, except for the cry, "no one expects the Spanish Inquisition" to bore me during the office desk. Looking down on the screen, waiting for the money to be shot. Just like hardcore porn.
