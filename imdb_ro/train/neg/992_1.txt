This movie was disgusting. It should be a warning that an ugly sadistic writer is trying to make a name for himself before being held hostage for an hour and a half forgotten by garbage. What is garbage? Abusive use of people's time, abusive use of energy, and the loss of any type of educational system that teaches her how to read and write. Talia is a sick loser. Your psychiatrist must prescribe stronger drugs for your problem <br /> <br /> The act and the plot have given me no choice but to go into the garbage. We came to a scene that was not required. If you want to learn how to shock people watching a movie by Larry Clark. I lost all the respect for the entire cast of this movie, "I can not stand it anymore". How can actors or actresses sit on a set, while such abrupt representations of human behavior manifest themselves in the mind of a psychopath? I'm sorry for all the actors who participated in that scene. I think the devil now knows who the writer is; congratulations you gained attention.
