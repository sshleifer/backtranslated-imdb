After seeing the movie, the first question that came up in my mind was: Should it be irony or not? After reading some comments about the Doc Savage character and the comic book series, I knew this movie would not have been ironic. So the story tells us an American-American Super Doc that saves a South American republic. Sounds like a typical story. But it comes in so unrealistically that it becomes ridiculous. The mandatory final fight shows the worst show of martial arts we've ever seen. The movie might be interesting for low-budget movie designers as a bad example.
