Being the only movie I could see at LÃ¼beck's Nordische Filmtage this year, this year's festival will be remembered as a low all-time for me. This movie, which was announced as the thriller hero, is nothing more than a piece of sick shit! Excuse language, but there are no decent words to describe it. First of all, the actors are not the best. But the better actors would not save the movie. E.g. the story: after the first 15 minutes it was clear that John was sick, the neighbor's daughters were not real, and that she had killed her first girlfriend. The so-called "sex scene" was nothing but disgusting (hitting each other until blood flow to me has nothing to do with sexuality), but unfortunately they were not the only disgusting images that should be presented. Everything else has been copied by other executives like, for example, Lynch, but of course without their brilliance. So to summarize the whole movie and save other viewers time and money: guy loses his girlfriend, girlfriend returns home, man kills his girlfriend and gets mad after that, boy has very disgusting sex with one of them (or so he thinks) she finally realizes she is crazy and her girlfriend and new lover are in his apartment all the time .. a bad story, bad actors, pictures that make you want to vomit ... 1 out of 10 (1 point for the fact that you realize how well you can understand Norwegian if you have learned Swedish - at least one benefit of the evening - and you can not choose 0 points here).
