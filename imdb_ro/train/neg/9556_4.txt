This movie is mostly scenes of chase and special effects. It is very weak on the plot. Most of the conversations on the computer were just mumbo-jumbo. I looked at this because I was a great fan of the original warfare movie, which was based more on computer facts and on the actual terminology of the computer. This movie had nothing of it. Most computer scenes were not only impossible and very unrealistic for real computers and networks, but only lashes. It's like it was written by someone who has no understanding of real computers. The ripley game was blade and was essentially just an arcade game. No real hacking, so what was the point? The film was boring. Follow the Blade.
