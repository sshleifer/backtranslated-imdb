I can stay with this movie once, but I doubt we managed to make it a second time. Easy for fun, especially for Lindsay Lohan's physical presence. Matt Dillon's fun (think about something about Mary) and the re-emergence of a more serious act, Micheal Keaton. This is not fun, but the Love Bug has been, but it's being pursued. One of my main detractors in the movie was that Herbie has mostly evolved into R2D2. I was bored with the effects of the light of the light for the second time of the 30 times that they were used, and the front fender caused the same reaction from me. Go see this with young children, that is, "single digit children" and do not expect too much from this movie.
