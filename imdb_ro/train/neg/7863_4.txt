THHE2 is fun because you will laugh a lot and it will end and you will probably say "oh sh * t!" and "bring your face away from the hole that damn you are stupid" or things along these lines, but I do not know if it's worth seeing it - I was very angry throughout her whole, with horrible military characters that do not seem to to know the first thing about the fight. Yes, there was more violence, more gore and a larger number of corpses than the first one, but I'm still discussing whether this cancels my feelings throughout the movie about how ridiculous it is (and not a good ridicule like Dead Alive or Feast). My time would have been better spent watching Aja's remake for the 5th time. So go for some laugh, or go for some gore, but do not go hoping to get out of it pleased.
