If you liked to watch Mel Gibson in the Million Dollar Hotel, then you can enjoy watching Burt Reynolds in another such bad movie that it could never be distributed. I can only certify the DVD version, so maybe the VHS version is better wise, but the night scenes of the movie and the dark scene have been made so bad that everything looks red. I thought for the first time that my DVDs were tangled. It was not. If you insist on watching it, we recommend adjusting the color on the TV until it is black and white. If you never get through the movie. If you do, you will simply remember the poor film students who are trying to revise the Pulp Fiction style.
