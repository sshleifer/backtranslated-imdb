Notice that I gave this star with 1 star if it had given the option that I would have given this zero. Just as I put this DVD on my TV and sat down on the couch, I was expecting the worst shooting movies. I watched this movie on IMDb and I saw that this was the worst rated movie, so I think we got into it critically for every mistake. But they did not prepare me for the bullshit they were about to sneak off my television screen. The box makes this movie look good at best. DO NOT THINK YOU HAVE BEEN LOVED. This movie must be banned from all shelves around the world. The best way to describe this movie is like porn but no sex scenes in it. By acting (if you can call it), "plot" (so many holes must look like Swiss cheese), and the special effects are really terrible. Please do not be like me and rent this movie because you think it will be fun to watch. Finally, I'm not saying I can make a better movie than that, but I think.
