This movie was amazing. It's beyond the hell. I often meet a group of friends and go to the movie store to find horrifying movies to watch their comic value. My friend proposed this to me, but as I watched him, people began to leave. I really wanted to finish, just to say I had, but I did not. It's so bad. Horrible gangs, running blades. The main characters are an annoying dinosaur klutz and Whoopi Goldberg. I would prefer to watch The Postman 12 times in a row by Costener than to see a fraction of this movie again. I think they're trying to deal with some dinosaur discrimination issues, but the part of the movie that really stands out is that the dinosaur constantly beats things with the tail and then buzzes about it. It hurts. Take care if you are an aspiring masochist, otherwise leave it alone.
