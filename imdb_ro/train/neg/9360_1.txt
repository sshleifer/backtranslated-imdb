My score for this shit: 1/10 1 for the technique only. Everything else is very bad. <br /> <br /> Another movie that makes no sense. Clearly, it seems that creating a good script for film or television is almost an impossible mission. <br /> <br /> While it's easy to understand why politicians never tell the truth, they are among the biggest liars on the planet, it's hard to understand how to make movies so pathetic. <br /> <br /> We have to think we're taking people for the monsters. Perhaps it was a reason to believe, since 99% of the movies are nonsense. Because they are stupid and ridiculous and very bad scenarios. <br /> <br /> When we look at the price we award to the Oscars, we better understand why we continue to make movies more ridiculous than others. <br /> <br /> And strangely enough it has always been money for such nonsense. But it was not for education and health. <br /> <br /> If you still want to listen to this s ** t, press the Super Fast Forward (at least 20X) button.
