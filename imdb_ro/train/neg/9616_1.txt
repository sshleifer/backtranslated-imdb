First of all, I had my doubts just by searching for the DVD box and reading it saying that it's a bunch of teenagers who gather at a lake where they find something or not. Any movie that has such a premise has failed to disappear, even as a slasher film, except for the first Friday of the 13th. I wanted to get up and watch the movie at least 10 times, but I just thought I should feel better. She did not. Usually, I think every movie has something you can get from it. This has nothing. Do a favor and find something constructive to do for 80 minutes. Like, give yourself paper cuts or eat dirt.
