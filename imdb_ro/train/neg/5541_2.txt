Ever since the movie-loving universe has become familiar with a guy named George A. Romero, the word "zombie" automatically becomes associated with horror images of blood and non-stop sequences. It's safe to say that "The Night of the Living Dead" formed the zombie movie as we know it now. However, in the early years of the cinema, the premise of the reanimated corpses was used only in slow psychological thrillers, almost without action. Jacques Tourneur's "I Walked With a Zombie" is a perfect example and so is "White Zombie" with Bela Lugosi. This "revolt of the zombies" could have been another example, but unfortunately it is a failure across the line and one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. A very badly written script and a total lack of atmosphere and tension! The film lasts only 65 minutes, and yet the first half hour is totally squandered for silly intrigue of love and for unconscious monologues. Situation in the legendary city of Cambodia in Angkor could have led to a more convincing story, but everything we ever see is indoor photography. The lead actress (Dorothy Stone, the blonde hair and an ugly nose) irritated me enormously and hoped that an unscrupulous strigoe suddenly appeared from nowhere to devour it. Ready again? If you manage to fight for 60 minutes soporific, you will be rewarded with a fairly decent finish. However, this is too small to give this film a positive rating, not to mention a recommendation. Avoid! This is the type of movie you should only see if you've already seen everything.
