This is probably one of the most serious French films I've ever seen, among the over 100 French films I've ever seen. The terrible scenario and very mediocre / unprofessional action leads to impotent leadership. with everything that does not matter how beautiful the western French scene and luxurious music can add to the story. One of the key weaknesses of this film is that these two characters do NOT attract people, as an audience does not care what happens to them. <br /> <br /> I am amazed how this movie won the jury prize at cannes, man, I like almost all the cannes-awarded films, but not on this. Great disappointment for me.
