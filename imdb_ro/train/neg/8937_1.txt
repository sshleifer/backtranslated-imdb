Generally, I like horror movies, but unfortunately it has fallen from a one-liter ticket to my friends. We sat down to follow him, ready to be frightened, and we came to spray food wherever we laughed so much. The concept is not that bad, but why they decided that the number ten in the series would be lucky I do not know. The worst thing about the film is the actors. Room work has been poor, the special effects are not really bad if they are generous, but the story generally has failed to connect at any level since the actors were just as effective as a small piece of fluffy elm. They were wooden, above all, a young fopic actor who was fifteen years young enough to be taken seriously like any state agent. He seemed like a public school boy. It was a really funny scene where she looked like she was complaining about apples like a busty woman walking on it and later her expensive diapers were hysterical but then I remembered that it was not supposed to be a comedy. I was desperately entertaining the brain to find something positive to say about this film, apart from the occasional flash of breasts, but it simply is not. Hopefully ten was the lucky number and they did not do another, I'm not sure my ribs could take it.
