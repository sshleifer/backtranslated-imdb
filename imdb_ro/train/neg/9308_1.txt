this movie was certainly the worst movie I've ever seen in my life and I've seen some pretty bad movies. I did not like the way this movie was shot. all the actors are unknown and it seems that a bunch of friends have gathered and decided to film their own film. but it is absolutely horrible. I've never seen a worse movie. the story is so fake and I just discovered it took a long time to the end of the movie. there was no plot, it seemed it was not planned before it started filming. the story is too strange. I did not like how slow it was to get to the point of the movie. there was no point in filming this movie. if you're going to watch this movie, do not do that. you waste your time.
