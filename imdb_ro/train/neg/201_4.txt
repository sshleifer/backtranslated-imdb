Iberia is pleased to watch TV. But why do you see that on the silver screen? Many dances and music. If you enjoy classical music or modern dance this could be your movie. But otherwise half an hour is too long. If you like to see the dances on the silver screen, it's better to see the Bollywood movie. They know how to combine dance with breathing and long film. Director Carlos Saura knows how to draw the dance from the old experience. And from time to time it looks very good. but when the movie is one and one hour, it should be at least interesting at least. There are many kinds of art, not everything is bigger than life and this movie is not too big.
