For my life I can not understand the good comments on this piece of nonsense. It was useless. Matthew Modine was horribly miserable as a top man. Gina Gershon, well, others have said it, but I will reiterate why the bad accent? Totally useless. And her act was just bad. I do not know if it was thrown away by accent or what. There is no chemistry between the two. <br /> <br /> And little girl Modine was in love, she suddenly pushes half a head of salad in her mouth and acts in a strange way? Where did this come from? I think we had to feel sorry for her when I saw that marriage with a laborer began to collapse, but, frankly, I would not care less about any of these people.
