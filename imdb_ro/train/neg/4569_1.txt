I can not believe that the City of Muncie is so hard to be careful that they may be embarrassed by themselves, allowing this show to happen there. This show is like a slap in front of real law enforcement officers. I've never seen anything so bad in my life in my life. If he had done it as a comedy that would be a thing, but to say that reality is not a lie. I saw him once and I was frightened of what I saw. I wanted to see the little guy get into a puppy with a bad guy. What a joke it was. Nothing in the show was really close to the real world. The city of Muncie, the police chief, and all the officers should hang their heads in shame, and they would never want to admit they were coming from that city. No wonder he did not stay on TV
