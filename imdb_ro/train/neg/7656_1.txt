Alone in The Dark is one of my favorite role-playing games of all time. I remember spending the whole night with the PC screen trying to get rid of that mansion and actually was surprised by the moments when the monsters came in surprisingly loaded. Now, remember - I'm tired of "computer games" movies. I do not remember any single success story in this new Hollywood genre, though some are fun enough to be supervised. And yet, I'm a great fan of the game I could not resist. My reason was that if the movie had a plot that suited the game very much, it would be good. <br /> <br /> People, it was 90 minutes (which seemed like 300) of my life that I will never come back again. If I had the chance, I would have been happy to rearrange the sockets instead. This is not even in the "so bad is fun" category. You would think that even Christian Slater had more sense than to join this weird bomb. Now, Tara Reid ... I'm not complaining about her presence. However, if the purpose of putting this chick in a leading role is to have a sex scene - which I fully understand and support (hey, I am a guy!) - I have seen more of her body on press conferences. <br /> <br /> There is no plot to talk about. It will not waste your time to give it to you. The credibility of this story sinks under "I did not have sex with Mrs. Lewinski." The actress is just a few notes over Street Fighter, which, by the way, being one of the worst movies I've seen, I would recommend OVER it. Kids, I recommend Video Game. It has a much better story, an adventure and a lot more emotions. As for the movie, here's a spoiler - STINKS! Wait for the porn.
