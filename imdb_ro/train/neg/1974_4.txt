Some people have made a dising point for this film because they question the plausibility of black people in the Old West, Asian people in the Old West, or women with weapons during the Old West. Take a grip and read a book. There were a few Asian (Chinese), few black (free), and everyone outside of the Gentile class had immediate access to weapons; is the second amendment that you know. And, as far as the use of modern language is concerned, none of these Western people became nostalgic about the language used in reality, which was consistent with the era described. The Americans had different accents, they used different inflections, spoke at a very different pace and used a lot of words and phrases that could not be recognized today. Do not blame the historical inaccuracies for not digging it. Be honest. Maybe you do not feel comfortable with what you see.
