This must be one of the most serious movies I've ever seen. Actually, I was expecting a bad movie, but I was surprised to believe it or not. The story is traditional, all the clich√©s are included. Dialogue is so badly written that you actually laugh when other half-descent actors are trying to make it real. The picture is not very good, the music is so malpracate, actually it upset me, the actors never try, otherwise the script makes it almost impossible to expect more from the people who have been working for 30 years and the so-called action scenes actually succeed to miss the "action" itself. I do not understand why these kinds of bad movies continue to come, who finances this shit? Where is the screening? And why on earth are actors taking this mission impossible? There are one million Hollywood movies in this genre, not even the aspiration to reach theaters, but even the things at Straight To Video actually manage to look professional in comparison. I can not say anything positive about it, except the title explaining everything, I feel robbed of 2 hours of my life.
