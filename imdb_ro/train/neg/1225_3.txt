Well, let me start by saying how HARD it is this movie, I just could not help but laugh at this stupidity. Do not misunderstand me, it is well done especially by Bassinger, but the script is just fine, the mind really swells. The premise is good and until Della actually testifies to the crime he is involved in, but only goes down. In the middle of the movie, the protagonist pulls out his instrument box and, of course, instead of lobbing him at the head of the guy, decides to take out a screwdriver, a car, and eventually a flare (as in a sinking ship) <br /> <br /> Then there is the final line I promise if she does not get you in seams then I will eat my left foot. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie for those who want to laugh at some good old-fashioned, frightening movies. I might also suggest that you pay attention to the scene in the debris yard, with the guy falling off a big wooden leg, he gets me every time.
