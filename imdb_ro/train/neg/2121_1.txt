Very honestly there seemed to be seven hours of boredom. What is it? What is it about Will Smith that can not stand? I think it seems too much to be taken seriously and to get an Oscar. I understand how bad this is, but if he does not suffer new lessons, I can never see him winning. It is a huge name and is therefore generally confused with the fact that it is a talented and diverse actor. Just not. I give credit because I tried so much and I was able to cry at the drop of a hat. That's about it. Seven kilograms have been a sort of eieroller for me, right from the start. Suicide 911 did not intrigue me in any way. I was not curious to know why he was summoned to suicide. There were absolutely no surprises. The best thing I can say is that Will Smith and Rosario Dawson had decent chemistry on the screen. I also do not know her name, but the Italian woman did a great job with her scared and beaten wife role. Woody Harrelson had a very limited time, but I would say he stole the show whenever he was. On the whole, just an extreme run of the non-original plot of the dead. I could not wonder why I liked one of these people. I never really felt sorry for Tim / Ben. Did he commit suicide with a jellyfish? Was he the only survivor of an 8-person accident? Geewiz has not seen any of that coming ... 5/10 is pretty generous.
