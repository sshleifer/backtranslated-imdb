There is no entertainment in this movie. There is no scary, funny or even exciting scene in this movie. It is advertised as a horror, then continues to be called a comedy. I do not even have the humor. Do not even try to be scary. In order not to get bored of this movie, you should be one of the easiest to entertain on the earth. If you like this movie even a LITTLE BIT than you have no standard for what you look at all. I feel very hard to try to understand what the directors have been trying to do with this. It's not funny, frightening, shocking or intriguing. So it was supposed to be a drama? Because it really was not even dramatic. Please do just a favor and do not watch this movie. Life is too precious to lose 90 minutes.
