ALERT SPOILER In this generic and forgotten action movie, Lorenzo Lamas makes his habitual act of tough guy, and his next real life, Kathleen Kinmont, is a shot with the Alexa chicken. JOHN SIMPSON is a detective, travels over time, since a brilliant public figure has disappeared. Translation: cable TV filler. There is not enough leather to qualify this as a guilty pleasure. The script has some open holes. The best / worst moment: In a single offensive scene, the JO partner expresses his aversion to the morgue. The JO responds that some of the bodies are warm enough or words to that effect. This vague referral is sufficiently offensive; but in the light of the crimes committed shortly after the release of this film, it is really terrible and, therefore, entertains unintentionally, horriblely. I was so surprised that I laughed until the champagne came out of my nose. Now it's a pleasant pleasure. BC
