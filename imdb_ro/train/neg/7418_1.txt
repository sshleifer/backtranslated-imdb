God, what a terrible and horrible movie. It means being a comment on the state of society, it's just a reflection of the worst of the worst in the reality of TV. The interstices hosted by Jason Jones and Don McKellar are the most unpleasant part, written in a tone that can be reflexive and insightful. Rather, these moments are angry, talking to the room, with dialogue written by someone with love for insult, a condescending speech that pushes the "meaning" of the film into the viewer's neck. Also, a point of view: long and silent scenarios are not equal. Neither extreme angles nor logic extend to the absurd point. If anyone there is interested in watching this movie, please do not. Seriously. Please. You have better things to do.
