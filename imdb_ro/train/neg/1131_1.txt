A shame that no talented director, Desplechin, could find a decent performance from a dark actress, Phoenix, Esther Kahn does not have the substance to convey a very concise and clear plot. In an attempt to fulfill the concentric circle of an actor's situation, performance and presentation are too controversial and badly executed to attract any compassion from the spectator. In a too long execution time, the redundancy of Esther's struggle is too melodramatic to be effective and reduces the story in a fragile frame of a disastrous poster. Content is incoherent and free as Phoenix endeavors to meet Desplechin's instructions, just as Esther is supposed to do the same. I never feel a convincing victory against Esther's pain, we never feel a victory in Phoenix's talent.
