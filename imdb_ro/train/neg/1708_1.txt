OK, I really do not have much to say about this movie other than this: I've seen over 4,000 movies in my life and more than 2,300 of them were horror movies. While I have some difficulty in deciding what is best (as opposed to my favorite, which I can say is George A. Romero's Death Day), I can tell you without the slightest hesitation that ZOMBIE BLOODBATH from Todd Sheets is absolutely the most dreadful horror movie I've ever seen. There is nothing positive I can say about this movie. The actor, the dialogue, the direction, the make-up, the music ... Every aspect of this film is just as far from what is acceptable that it bothers me that this has ever been released. <br /> <br /> Even if you are a horror film or a zombie movie, please remember my warning and do not waste your garbage time. There is no pleasure in paying attention to this. You will not even laugh at the total inexperience of exposure ... Trust me. Please.
