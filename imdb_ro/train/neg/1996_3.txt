This little sad movie has little resemblance to 1971's Broadway revival, which was such a "nostalgic" blow. Keep in mind that when Burt Shevelove directed this rebirth, he renamed this book extensively. I have the feeling that the screenwriter has made a change since the original version of 1925 as well. I played in 1974 "Jimmy Smith" on the stage, and I thought this $ 1 DVD would bring memories. No chance. Even the anticipated joy of seeing Roland Young's "Topper" role, "my side," was a great disappointment. Three tracks of the song remain, and they are very stupid. Even the classic duo, "Tea For Two", is like a virtual solo. The many familiar faces of this 1940 fiasco do not feel proud at all, and the star, Anna Neagle, feels embarrassed. When I feel hammering spending a dollar, I know the movie has to be bad. Another commentator mentioned the "Doris Day" version, which is actually called "Tea for Two," and it's about making the stage piece (the original, of course), so those who are looking for the real "No No Nanette" could find a version easier to recognize There.
