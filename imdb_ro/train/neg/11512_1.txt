*** WARNING! THE SPOILS CONTAIN IN THOSE! *** This is a semi-autobiographical analysis of what might happen to Madonna if she ever was stuck on a deserted island. There is no challenge for Madonna in this role and looks. Only Madonna interprets Madonna and can not even be right. I know what you say, you say, "How do you know Madonna looks like this, you never met her?" Right, I do not, but we all remember "Truth or boldness", are not we? I know he's doing Kevin Costner. You would think in 2002 that Madonna could have learned something, one way or the other, from the crossover ladies who made their way through the silver screen. For kindness, Madonna did not see "Glitter"? Mariah Carey has shown the world of the movie HOW IT IS FOUND! Mariah hit Madonna on the road, in beauty, talent, screen presence, charisma, the characterization you call! All we see from this miracle in Madonna's world is that she is the only one in her. <br /> <br /> If there is anything to say about Madonna, it is that she is consistent. When she was loved by MTV, she put the world of fashion for women back in 20 years. Now in the film, she has set women's roles in the film AND society back in 20 years by glamorizing all the most ugly, horrible, condemnable, bold qualities that women have repeatedly put inside them, qualities which they have so desperately tried to prove they do not really possess. <br /> <br /> *** AICI SPOILERII! NEVER READ OUT IF YOU DO NOT KNOW ... *** This is a good thing I will say about this movie and I was even impressed by it. They did not go for "Hollywood Ending" - Madonna's character lives. In the typical Hollywood happy ending, the Madonna's character would have died on the island, and her long, suffering, whipped husband would have been free to finally settle with a decent, decent woman, a woman who would be the opposite of his deceased wife and both live happily afterwards. But in this extremely depressing conclusion, she is saved, and once again, this husband's poverty is again burdened with his wife's demon, and his life will again become a living hell. <br /> <br /> *** HERE SHOULD HAVE THE COUPLES ***
