Lulu (Louise Brooks) works as a typist and is missing something in her life. She enters a Miss France contest against the wishes of her beloved Andre (Georges Charlia) and wins. She leaves for the title of Miss Europe, leaving her boyfriend behind. She wins again, but returns home to Andre for asking her. Once she resumed, her life becomes once again mundane, so one night she writes a note for him and leaves to experience the fame that awaits her as Miss Europe. Andre follows it ..... <br /> <br /> This movie is a silent movie with a piano piece all the way. It's also rushed, so everything seems fast. The limited dialogue has been added later and is very false. Distribution is fine because it is a silent film. The best part of the movie comes to an end, but the story takes too long. After watching this, I do not really know what a great deal about Louise Brooks' looks - she has a terrific haircut that makes her face look fat. I do not have to look again.
