The comparison may be unfair, but inevitable. Those attracted by the intimacy and depth of the umbrellas will be slightly horrified to discover a musical American cut-and-paste - a strange and pitiful dialogue with unexplained numbers of song and dance. Gene Kelly's French sense was apparently so poor that it was replaced by a terrible work of doubling (as you recall, the doubling was virtually eliminated in the Umbrella). The French translation (and subtitled versions) leaves something to be desired, though this can not be attributed to Demy. The film also has several moments of self-consciousness that come from an unconvincing story, such as the references in LeGrand's own songs. And the costumes - well, the combination of tight pants / white boots and unusual colors, remind of a Austin Powers movie. . . But Demy rewards the viewer with alludes to Umbrellas; note, for example, Maxence's suitcase when leaving Rochefort - this is the same suit given by Guy when leaving Cherbourg. Also, note the "Convenient Resolution Brunette" - Madeleine in the umbrellas and Josette in the young girls. Generally, those who await the natural sense of the umbrellas (save the floating bicycle scene), or look for more in-depth questions and ambiguous endings as in Umbrella's script, should probably pass this. Those looking for a French version of a thin American musical from the 60s will be quite happy.
