I saw this pile of vignettes regurgitated tonight at a preview preview, and I was directly afraid of how bad it was. <br /> <br /> First of all, the film has practically shown the blind spots. Are not black clouds or lovers in love? Or who, say, knows the white people involved in love? I know that there is love Crash inclusion-keyboard included, but you can not pretend you have a film in New York, with widespread these members of society. In addition, you know that the people who created this ish thought Crash deserves that Oscar with ham, so where is everyone? Possibly worse than bizarre and deliberate ignorance of socio-economic offensive chapters were facing down (remember when you were in high school and people were openly disgusted with the young women in wheelchairs)? This movie has made a range of ways to be the worst. Bad acting, bad writing, bad directing - all covering all genres ever possible to handle rich white people who smoke cigarettes outside luxury restaurants. <br /> <br /> But thank God that Hayden Christensen and Rachel Bilson finally came to power for the Jumper meeting. And, moreover, Uma avoided a bullet; Ethan Hawke looks devastated. This, of course, is a thing in terms of its appearance but added an incredibly creepy vibration of extraordinary horror to its frighteningly scripted scene to the poor, wonderful Maggie Q. I had a terrible time my choice the most scenario but it must also be Anton Yelchin / Olivia Thirlby for the lack of taste, which makes me sad because I really like the two actors. I'm not easily offended count, but all I could do was apologize and look around with disgust as aunt 50 years someone. <br /> <br /> A second place close to this incredibly awful lot of terrible things is Shia LaBeouf with deafness of what it means to a former Disney Channel star to act against Julie Christie. I do not mean to say the opposite, I mean against. Against this is the only explanation. I realize now that the early sequence with Orlando Bloom is a relative record. HIGHLIGHT. Please note that when your brain starts to drain the ear shortly after the opening credits, which seems to be a sign to the first real world of New York. This movie is embarrassing, oddly dated, clumsy, ineffective, pretentious, and ultimately completely divorced from any real New York idea. <br /> <br /> (supplementary sequence star Cloris Leachman / Eli Wallach, it is actually quite sweet, but only a bright spot on what feels like hours of unnecessary pain masturbator.)
