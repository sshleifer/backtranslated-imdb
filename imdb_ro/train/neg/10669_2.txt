An ensemble of uninteresting and inappropriate characters twists and turns their way through a weak plot that might be interesting if only you can care for yourself. This "twist and twist" I'm talking about does not refer to the story (which contains all the suspense of a tape box), but to the director's inability to keep the faces of the characters even remotely centered in the frame. On the other hand, Angie Harmon has very beautiful nostrils and her left ear. The only real surprise in the movie is the big names they have convinced to do. When you think that this movie has never been released in cinemas, despite having a cast of all stars, you may be inclined to think of something smelly. And indeed it is.
