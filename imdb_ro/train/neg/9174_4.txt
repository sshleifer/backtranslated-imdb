Usually, I like zombie movies, but this was simply bad. Good parts: The uncloped bow with the bottom of the throne, the spikes of Sonya Salomaa of topless and Ona Grauer jiggling in a camouflaged peak when he ran away. <br /> <br /> The bad part: too many video cuts, too much slow motion of the matrix (pull action), lack of blood and courage, bad action and no story. The only person in the theater was intelligent and left immediately after the topless swimming scene. A total loss of $ 6 and time. I give 2 out of 10.
