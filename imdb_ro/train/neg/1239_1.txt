Being a great fan of the other films "PLANET OF THE APES", I rented this DVD, despite my aversion to all things, Tim Burton. Once again, he fails to disappoint his uninspired direction. Even monkey makeup appears to be the second rate, which is unforgivable, given the monstrous budget of this monstrosity. Mark Wahlberg proves once and for all that he is not an actor (as if BOOGIE NIGHTS was not enough proof). I was embarrassed for authentic talents like Tim Roth and Helena Bonham Carter. Undoubtedly, their salaries motivated them because it could not have been the warm scenario. I rented this DVD on a special night of $ 1 and I feel still broken.
