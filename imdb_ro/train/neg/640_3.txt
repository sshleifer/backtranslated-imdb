Chilly, alienating the adaptation of Rebecca West's book about an army captain who returns from duty during World War II with its memory affected (now there is an original idea!). Apparently he remembers the old flame Glenda Jackson, but not the current wife Julie Christie, which should be enough to trigger some emotional sparks. This extremely well-played concert brings together Alan Bates with director Alan Bridges and co-stars Jackson, Christie, Ann-Margret and Ian Holm, but the burners are all low. There are a bunch of good scenes (especially whenever Jackson is on screen), but Bridges' pace is not slow enough, and the overwhelming color of the movie is annoying. Long on the shelf, this "soldier" is best forgotten forgotten. * 1/2 from ****
