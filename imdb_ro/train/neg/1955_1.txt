This movie is so stupid that it simply goes around the corner and becomes ridiculous. I wanted to see "Darkness falls" in fact and thought it was the movie. Boy, what a mistake! I advanced as fast as I could, and I still could not get away with the dull moments. I will envy only those who have been paid to play or work on this movie. They actually received money for these nonsense. Is not that amazing? I mean in this movie a man is killed and cut into a small machine to grind into small pieces, blood and a few minutes later, mother and child talk calmly at the table without anything happening and drinking coffee. Please! Come on! Who gives money for such films? Oh, and the "fairy-fairy" was blades. He was not scary, and it was obvious he was a bored monk wearing a bad makeup.
