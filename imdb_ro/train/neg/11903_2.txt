Wenders was great with Million $ Hotel. I do not know how he came up with this movie! The idea of ​​giving the situation after spt11 and the opinion of American society is hopeful, which makes 2 out of ten. But it's not a movie. It's the best one can do with a great idea (West-East conflict). There are important things that happen in the Middle East and it is released only on the screen of a MAC * with the fingers of an American girl who is actually at the level of stupidity (because she is ignorant of the facts). they are not well modeled. And the most important thing is that the idea that is given to religion is somewhat amusing for me. At the final stage, Lana says she only allows you to be quiet and try to listen. And background music says "... you pray." It's not really about religion. But it ends with this. How will you see the truth if you close your eyes and please? The lights are already shining on the truth. He just does not want to see this. ps: "My house is not a place. It is a people." The only thing that has 10 out of 10 is that phrase. But he is wasted behind this film. (by the way, as "someone" mentioned below, the best young people in America are not the best, they are just the "poor" and "hopeless" who join the army that needs good salaries, government!)
