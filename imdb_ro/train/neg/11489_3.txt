In the US, very few films have been made about Rome that were not established in the time of Julius Caesar or shortly thereafter. Hollywood's sword and sandal epic have mostly a Christian theme, making it difficult to get into previous Roman history (Spartacus was probably the first exception to this rule and encountered some resistance to Hollywood because he did not have Jesus in it) . /> <br /> It is interesting to see at least one picture that does not take place just before Caesar's and Christ's time, but it is established when Rome was just one city among many on the Italian peninsula and it just removed the ugly king Tarquin has formed his republic. However, this is not a historical film; is peplum, and while the production values ​​are not down, the action and characterizations are cardboard. I can only imagine the dialogue in Italian, but with the English double of the wood is very camouflaged. I received some good laughs at first. I have not seen many movies of this kind, losing most of Hercules' 60s films. It's funny up to a point, but as the movie continues, it becomes somewhat boring. One thing is certain: if I had seen this movie when I was ten, I would have loved it. At that age, I went for everything with the Romans and sword fighting in it. At least, this movement has brought some childhood memories.
