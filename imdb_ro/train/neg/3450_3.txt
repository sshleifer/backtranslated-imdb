Someone here compared the movie in some ways with High Noon. Now this is a real stretch! I'm a big fan of Sinatra, which includes some of his roles, but maybe the only person who could have played this part would have been Don Knotts. First of all, as somebody pointed out, Sinatra does not have the construction of a wizarding Western wizard. He is too "easy" at this time of his life. Perhaps he was about the same height as Audie Murphy, but Murphy had a pretty solid construction. Sinatra meets as a small, small child who speaks, which no one should take seriously. The story is uninspired and really is not credible. I do not want to ruin it, but I think the end and the way people in the city react to this story does not make sense. Another thing, these people always let themselves be lorded by a "bad guy." This is just a small town, so I have no attraction and I do not understand why people would let themselves be dominated in this way. There is a "love interest" in the story and if I followed her right, she was upset when the main character refused to recognize who it was so another evil guy would not kill him. Now is the real love for you. "Get up for you Tell your name to kill you LAUGH OUT LOUD Stop, you kill me Unfortunately, the basic premise of the movie is not good enough and no matter how you tried this story they did not have a logical path to follow but in the trash can Do you want to know why it is not a video and it's never shown on TV Critics appreciated it in 1956 and they were right - this movie is pretty bad. be betting that Sinatra has paid someone to six things as much as possible You want to see a good West where a city rises against a bad guy Try the tension at the Rock Table or at Gunpoint two really good vestiges with Johnny Concho is Johnny Stinko Frank, you've been the greatest singer ever - but you did not belong in a movie like that.
