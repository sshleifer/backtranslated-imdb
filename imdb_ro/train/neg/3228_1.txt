I have seen other Guinea Pig movies as Mermaid in Manhole & Never Dies and while they are sick enough they have at least a sense of humor for them (however dark). Devil's Experiment, however, is nothing short of filming a bunch of punks that send a young woman to many methods of torture and violence and there is no plot or redemption value for that. It is not at all frightening, except for the possible set of minds, but it is certainly disgusting and I certainly would not call it fun. Now, I'm not a good taste in movies and I like my basket and sleaze, but that was too much for me, indeed. They are all worrying, in fact, I'm looking for things that are disturbing whenever possible, but that was a bit too much. The young man is beaten, beaten, beaten continuously through the headphones until he sinks, then throws raw meat and sausages and hangs in a hammock in the forest somewhere. If you think it sounds great, go to it, but it certainly left me to see other Guinea Pig stuff. 1 in 10, absolutely nausea.
