I suddenly wake up, aware that I blew on the cover of the plastic sofa and realized it was a warm afternoon. Why did I sleep? Did I hit my head? Or accidentally swallow all my grandmother's muscular relaxants? Could it be adult narcolepsy? <br /> <br /> No, I stopped at the cheap chairs while the surfing channel and the amazing lack of humor and talent drained my life force at a speed that I strengthened. swelling of the mouth, swelling of the mouth, swelling of the bad shoulder. But I have to give these moronic and boring twins the belief that they have sold this idea. Perhaps they had the same effect on the ESPN programming executive they had on me, and when they woke up, some horrible episodes were already in the canister and he hoped that, since all viewers will sleep, no one will be how awful it is and can keep the annual salary of $ 425,000. <br /> <br /> You have been warned.
