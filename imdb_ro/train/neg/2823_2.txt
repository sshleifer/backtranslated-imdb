Well, TiVo recorded this because of Angelina Jolie. It had 2.5 stars. It seemed promising. Walk down. Very much is happening, even from Angelina. He is 20 years old and is 16 years old. There are three characters that should be Italian. All the others are Italian-Americans. The Italian accents were good, I thought. Young men are nice, my wife says. Everyone in this movie is an Italian woman. Even men. I should have known that when Dick Van Patten was thrown like a rand physician, it was a bad sign. The two couples who follow their children around them are like the four Italian stoogi. My wife would not have let go of the remote. Let's hope she does not get makeup, clothing, or decorating tips. It was a sick and frightening combination. It was hidegarishous. Cutting the left ventricle was not enough to distract attention from the pain of watching this film. If this movie is displayed on the TV, do yourself a favor and turn your head over the TV screen. You will be glad you did. The only movie I've ever seen was worse than it was "Hamburger: The Movie". Or maybe "friend of death".
