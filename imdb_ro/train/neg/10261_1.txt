Wow, I just saw this on T.V. as one of the "frightening" films he presents around Halloween. Was this G rated? There was nothing to make this movie scary or worth watching. Also, other people say it's a doll, but I do not think. For a spoof, you need something called "humor." This low-budget carp-fest had no humor, and it made little sense. Normally, you have a rising monster (a man in a rubber suit) coming out of the cabinets, killing people, I think because you will never see the monster that makes violence to anyone or a bloody offspring. The spinning newspaper tells you that people were killed by the monster, so I think it's pretty good. The army tries to kill the monster, which is not much bigger than a man. They have a very bad purpose. Then the FLEES militants! Wow, this movie made the US Army to look pathetic or what? The monster, while it's hard to kill, does not do much, except mixing and revenge. Oh, and sometimes a second head springs from his mouth and shouts. It was a little interesting, but totally a strange rival. What was the deal with the scientist playing Xylophone to attract the monster? It was difficult to understand a lot of dialogue due to the poor sound quality. Also, why wore the monster around the main man for so long? Why did not the monster get in the closet when he had a chance? Why do I insist on trying to make meaning from those who are meaningless?
