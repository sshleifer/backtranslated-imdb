All the X-Men movies were wonderful. I also refer to all, including those who have long been hated by X-Men 3. They have solid characters (in my opinion, Magneto and Xavier) and a good story arc. <br /> <br /> All excited when I heard that this movie was in production, and my expectations grew and grew until I saw the movie. I was so disappointed. Hugh Jackman is not a bad actor (his best film is the Fountain, though you will not hear about this movie when he talks about the actor), and his actor is not what screws the movie up. The entire movie is affected by a lot of meaningless characters that add nothing to the plot (such as Blob or Gambit) that were thrown there to make fans believe the filmmakers had read the original comic versions. I'm a fan of XMen, I have read many, many of their stories, and this film did not respect any of them. No one. Not even continuity. Not respecting the Weapon X project or the relationship between Wolverine and Sabretooth or Emma Frost, the motivations for Wolverine are bad and seen in millions of films: Revenge for a boyfriend's death. <br /> <br /> Oh. What we expect the whole movie was a Berseker moment for Wolverine similar to the one he has in the X2 in the school when the Stryker people come and he decimates the enemy forces alone, but hey, this is Fox, this family leak and you will not see the explicit violence of the most violent and frightening Marvel hero. <br /> <br /> In addition, we had a constant feeling already in vu with this movie because Origins Wolverine is already explained in X2, we already know how he took his adamantium skeleton so it does not make sense to make a movie about something we already know. I personally think that Wolverine is one of those few characters that does not need a solid story because the mystery is the nature of the character. Do we really want to know how Joker takes the scars?
