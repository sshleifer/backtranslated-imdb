Yes, I've stayed everywhere, God knows why. It was a long afternoon, I had nothing to do, it was bitter outside, all right, all this is an excuse of blades, but it's the only ones I have. I gave The Darkling 4 stars out of a possible 10 - I saw worse movies, but it is definitely there in the old bad bin of bad movie - poor scenario, poor action, bad illumination and special cheesy effects. The story, which has no meaning, revolves around this simple family, father, mother and little girl - who suppose the spectator should be "identified" with, all three were boring and annoying. You just want the dark side to get each one of them. Daddy is a cook whose hobby is car. Daddy meets a rich named Rubin who collects cars and who also owns a being he bought in the "mysterious" Orient. Rubin keeps her in a pussy and refers to her as "The Darkling." <br /> <br /> During the movie, Darkling is explained as about 3 or 4 different things: a shadow without a person, the inner darkness that exists in us all and the devil. So choose any of these explanations that match your fantasy - because you trust me, it does not matter. Darkling's main problem seems to be that he wants to have a companion become a human fellow - and ultimately he is unhappy with the human being. This, of course, leads to immense wealth, followed by disaster, for the man who connects with The Darkling. And for the rest of us - it only leads to a very long and boring film. <br /> <br />
