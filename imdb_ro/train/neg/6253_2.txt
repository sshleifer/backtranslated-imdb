It is not a very good film, but according to the information it is quite accurate in describing the techniques of torture. The purpose of the film was to show the brutality of the NK POW camps and this was done efficiently with a surprising sincerity of time. Regardless of the existing technical defects (and there is a lot), watching this, you will see a forgotten corner of a forgotten war and some pretty ugly stuff - again, ugly because it is made north of the DMZ and not in the Gulf of Guantanamo . > <br /> I do not think any of the Korean veterans brought their torture to the office and watching movies like this and Pork Chop Hill compared to Vietnamese movies. I do not know if people in the '54s were caught in World War II concepts (boys tend to do a lot) or what war, but it's interesting to see this from the same system that 16 years later they would be movies like "Go Tell the Spartans".
