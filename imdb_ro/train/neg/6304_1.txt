Like a story of battles in the naval history of the Second World War, and someone who is not proud of the history of racial relations in this country, I was anxious to see this movie. What a piece of disappointing trick. I did about three-quarters, but I should have stopped him from attacking. The idea that a ship would trigger a torpedo in a DDE, as if it were a hope of striking it, and then "escape" from the DDE while it is sunk, is absurd. And that's just a little detail. The entire movie was badly written, poorly guided and inappropriate. I agree with others on this forum that this movie could have been a good movie. It's as if they had decided that, since all the propaganda films of that world war were made with white towers, they needed to be done with black people. And as bad as old movies, it's even worse. And he almost escaped fake advertising to the titles of Ossie Davis and Stephen Rea. They seem to have very minor roles. I have to believe that these two good actors have been embarrassed to associate with this film. I finished. I've spent too much of my life on this movie.
