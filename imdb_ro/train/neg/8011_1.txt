I really must have caught a movie different from the other commentators on this site, because at watching the movie last night, the public was so humiliated by the dialogue that (I do not even joke) came out. Viewed as though the director believed he was approaching a bold territory, presenting a homosexual story, the film uses visual inspiration inspired by David Lynch with a Fassbinder inspired adventure. The shows in this movie are so boring and boring that I imagined that one of the actors was going through how uninspired they were through the scenario. The worst thing is that it's colorful like a Miami Vice episode. I do not know who this director thinks; perhaps he has claims of surreality such as Bunuel, Jordowsky, etc. But the problem is that all the directors mentioned above have a level of erudite sensitivity that does not really exist here. I understood the meaning of this movie about ten years ago, but when we have masterpieces such as Bad Education, Mysterious Skin and Show Me Love, why bother with this movie tour? There is nothing new to see here.
