For those who would like to see this movie? I would say: go! No narrative could be a very good movie / documentary. But the music, the story and some of the story lines implemented make it very hard to look at a skeptical person like me. By watching more animals, their lives in more seasons, it becomes the feeling that it is an animal soap that we follow. But the melodramatic point just does not cut it for me, in addition, if a predator finally catches on a prey (an exception remaining there), the camera enlarges or passes over another scene. She asks me why this is happening, if she would show reality, why she cut the scenes that remains a melodramatic fairy tale? I think morale is important to the mass of the crowd, because it would be a waste to destroy this beautiful planet.
