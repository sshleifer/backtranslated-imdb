When I was a kid I was always babysitting and I always used a movie or saw a movie at the cinema. This is one of the movies I've watched. This is one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen, I think it could even be a Walt Disney Pictures movie! A Martian is thrown to the ground, transforms into a man, joins with a man and tries everything he can to return home. But he is distracted by the wonders of the Earth. The only good comment I can offer is the choice of actors, Christopher Lloyd back into the future as Martian, uncle Martin, Dumb and Dumber to Jeff Daniels as Tim O'Hara, Elizabeth Hurley as Brace Channing and Daryl Hannah as Lizzie. But besides that, it's a complete carp. Weak!
