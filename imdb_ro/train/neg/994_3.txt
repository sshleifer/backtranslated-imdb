This movie was simply and simply aspirate. Okay, so it's a girl who's raped, and to get revenge, she's got another guy to rape the rapist. The violator is a shower, but the victim is partly to blame. I mean, they both enter the mood and they kiss like that, but when the rapist tries to have sex with her, she does not allow her, so the rapist rapes her. And the thing is the scene of the rape for the girl is very short and it does not show or show anything, but when it comes to the rapist, it is a fairly long rape scene. In principle there is nothing in the story that deserves to be watched. 3.2 / 10
