He saw this piece at a film festival in CA. My God, what did the director think? Film teachers should use this film as a case study on what SHOULD NOT do when we make a short film. First of all, this project has absolutely no meaning. The film is part of The Waystation, a stupid ditch in the middle of nowhere where nothing really happens. The action is beyond harm. So badly that I almost thought it was a comedy. Leading actress Julia Reading is a step below the actor in most amateur porn movies. There are one or two decent performances, including the boys who played Jacob and Fenner, but it's as if the director had no idea how to work or use his viewers. The only worse thing than the act was the dialogue that clung to the absurd. The writer (who assumes that he is also the director) writes every character as if he were being auditioned for a comic book character. The total amount of production is pretty good, but to be honest, with such a bad movie it's easy to ignore it. The production design is pretty good, though the Waystation looks like any regular bar. Costumes and makeup are fine, and I understand that the production worked with a low budget. Only when the characters speak or try to push the plot in front, the film is unleashed in a stream of nonsense. As I said, this movie is terrible to God. It's as if the director / screenwriter followed a lot of SF movies and threw all the songs he liked in a mixer and came up with it. My only hope is that he used the money of other people for this, because if he uses his own, he is a total sucker.
