In an interview, David Duchovny said he could not even look at the very first hour of this film - and you should not even do it. The scene where he asks the owner of a house where murder has been done if he can look around - change the name he gives and he could have picked up his performance from almost any X Files episode. It's on the pilot automatic for the entire movie. Brad Pitt goes awry.
