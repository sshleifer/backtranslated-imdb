And when I look at Sarah Silverman, I get the same results. I like the weird and unkempt humor. BUT this woman is so daring B-O-R-I-N-G, annoying, and marriage-worthy. It also lacks any humor. The way he tries to get his lines is just dead on arrival, because it's not really funny. I followed two segments of her program and I was ready for Novocaine. Geez, my baby (aged 19) saw her promise on Comedy Central and said she was a "stupid chick". I thought it was a compliment. What she says "Watch my show or kill my dog," is actually credible. I know she wants to be comedic. She meets only as a stiff case. I just do not want to see it around my dog.
