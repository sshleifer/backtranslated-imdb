I did not see the first two - just this primary species in England. I do not think I'll bother to look at them. <br /> <br /> It's a terrible movie. Terrible action, bad dialogue, cheap rubber monsters. Everything about this is so ugly. The most sympathetic characters die really fast and leave you with the annoying ones, especially one called Polchak, who is an incredible villain. No one would survive in the army for five minutes. He lasted for centuries, but I was pleased when he managed to swallow his head - I had nightmares he was supposed to survive. The Colonel was also garbage - all the bastards and the cries without flaw. And the doctor looked and acted as if it had been started. I waited for her to remove her glasses, shake her hair and turn into a vamp, but she did not. Too bad, as it would have left the movie all the way. Was not Roger Corman making half-decent movies once?
