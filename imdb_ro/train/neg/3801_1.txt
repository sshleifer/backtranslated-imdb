Warning! Spoilers! <br /> <br /> This is your typical disney movie. <br /> <br /> 1.Polictically correct what with foster house that has a division of even breeds. <br /> <br /> 2.Insult the viewer's intellectual with its simplistic lines. 3. The slezy boy's father is almost directly taken from Never Ending Story 2. 4. In a world full of crime, disability, corruption, hunger, and other proverbs that need to be taken care of, only a team losing is worthy of divine intervention. 5. And do you know that the angels would not swear? Where the heck came from where they came from! <br /> <br /> 6.In helping the team, the angel causes pain and humiliation on the opposite team. Very angelic indeed! <br /> <br /> 7. The angel's helping team is called ... you can guess ... THE ANGELS! Disney at the worst! <br /> <br /> 8. "He just took his training wings." Brillent line! <br /> <br /> My conclusion: I did not like at all.
