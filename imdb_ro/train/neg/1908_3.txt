Another insult and a slap in front of homosexual men everywhere. This tortured attempt at a comedy has nothing to recommend. Once again, we have an attractive hero, who supposedly can not get a woman to be interested in him. Yeah sure! And we are also presented with the gay friend "attractive", who is actually an old fat, balding, ugly man that he is supposed to find appealing. Even I did not find it appealing and I am a gay, fat, nasty, old (but fortunately not balding) man! Any talent that could be present here was thrown on a bad scenario and a really terrible direction. Mister. Sneedeker should be forbidden by movies, but he is no other than countless hackers working in Hollyweed.
