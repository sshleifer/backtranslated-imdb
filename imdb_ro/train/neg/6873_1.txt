TV productions in the early 2000s were between weak and bad. Before the labels (Alias, Lost, Prison Break, Disperate Housewives or Monk), the TV did not have a good shot yet, which could capture the attention and interests of the 2000 viewer. The titles (Relic Hunter), (Mutant X) , (Lost World), (Sheena) or even (Baywatch Hawaii) were not encouraging for you to follow and follow, or at least have not been so exciting and interesting the time that preceded them. (Special Unit 2) was not an exception. In fact, black men meet the X Files spoofer! (As if they were special unit 1). But even according to this brilliant formula; did not work well. It was promising; at the time when the saturation of the "supernatural" has already gone by, after a decade of many X files, so the natural spirit will make it too much (imagine Mulder as a woman!). However (Special Unit 2) was not the strongest in this case, or a strong when it comes to making a comic show Sci-Fi. It was extremely ridiculous, where, for example, every sexy situation has to turn into a disgusting ugly. He enjoyed that bad taste. (Michael Landes) was non-charismatic and rather unbearable as a comedian. His chemistry with (Alexondra Lee), as well as any alleged sexual attention, was just powerless. Make sure the show has a funny look, but it was generally a dysfunction. It is clear that there was nothing more interesting than the main idea. Among other works by Evan Katz, as co-writer and co-producer (7 days) before or (24) later, this must be a low point! Despite his distinctive personality, he managed to be stupid for most of the time. Therefore, if this purpose was there, so they made one of the foolish ones! And indeed, it would be one of the most rare moments to be grateful for canceling a show after only 19 episodes!
