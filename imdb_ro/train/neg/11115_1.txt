A previous commentator called this film "pure visual joy". I wonder if he saw the same movie I did. "High Art" had to have the most depressing inner of "Seven." You can almost forgive Sheedy and Mitchell for the clich√© to go to a B & B for the first time. Of course, before doing so, you need to watch opium-day parties inhabited by people who are not apparently engaged in work, but they can somehow support a thriving drug habit. Not to mention the ice of those known movies, the girlfriend / friend at first, who are aware that they will be thrown over something in the next 100 minutes or so. The film also states that the Sheedy character has withdrawn from professional photography for ten years. What did he do, retire at the age of twenty?
