A badly misspelled script without any nice characters. As for comedy, I forgot to laugh. It's about two terrible frightening friends who make women dress up with them (there are no sexual scenes) and another friend (who is half-disgustingly strange) who sometimes deceivers, but especially is considered the guy who wearing masterbats. The three friends meet separately for the same woman (Amanda Peet). Somehow, this happens without a true love story. The three boys are no longer friends because they gave it a separate date. She brought them out of friendship because they cheated the women. - A bad movie
