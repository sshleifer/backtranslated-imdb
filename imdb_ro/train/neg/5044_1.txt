I look forward to seeing this movie after reading a positive review in the New York Times. In addition, I am also Shanghainese, so there was more than a passing interest in the matter. However, after seeing her, I was extremely disappointed. The pace of the film was extremely slow and monotonous. The director has praised some scenes for too long. There is no passion or chemistry among lovers. There were hardly any dialogues. Dialogue was extremely necessary to compensate for the lack of action. At the end of the movie, you did not feel any compassion for the characters. This movie was devoid of anything. The script was weak, the act was weak, and editing was non-existent. The director tried to emulate certain styles of noir movies, but he could not figure it out. A good movie is one that captures your attention, keeps it and manages to end without feeling your time. This movie felt like it would never end up. Do not waste money on this movie.
