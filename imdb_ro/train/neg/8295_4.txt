I tend to like my personal movies. I also think Hope Davis turns into consistent work, so I had great hopes for this film. These hopes were soon destroyed. The main fault with this movie is the direction. There are lots of scenes that are dream sequences. The film often uses Denis Leary's character as alter ego of character Campbell Scott. It does not work for me at all. This would work better as a piece than a movie. There are also problems with the plot. It is important that the characters in a movie make a trip and reach a place different from where they started. I did not feel that the characters grew up in the experiences presented in the film. Finally, editing was not done well. In the middle of the movie there was a very high height, which was extremely dull. With the exception of acting, which I have consistently felt, this film has failed in almost all aspects of cinema.
