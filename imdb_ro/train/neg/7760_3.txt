On the Fiji Islands, the greedy and unscrupulous owner of Valalola Resort Primal Park invites investors and guests to an opening party of his hotel complex and zoo with the aim of finding partners for his discoveries. When a bunch of small fellow robbers put a virus into the security system to participate in a scavenger hunt, the biggest attractions of the zoo? Sabretoothes from prehistoric age developed from DNA found in fossils? escape, killing hosts and guards for pleasure. Unbelievably cheap and cheap "The Sabretooth Attack" is one of the most serious movies I've seen recently. The characters are terrible and not fun or enjoyable, and the story is a terrible Jurassik park robbery with a collection of bad cliches. Virtually all lines and situations are weak and stupid, but the winner is when the guard explains that sabotage is bulimic and likes to kill for pleasure. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Ataque do Dente de Saber" ("Sabretooth's Attack")
