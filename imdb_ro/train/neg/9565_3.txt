I can not say that Wargames: The Dead Code is the worst movie I've ever seen because it had one or two decent moments, but I can easily say it's the most transparent movie I've ever seen . Never plotted a device without guessing it 10 minutes in advance. There is no subtlety for anything in the movie, no obvious intelligence behind the scene. Any written or written intention was so obvious that it was impossible to "get into the movie." I woke up laughing at the horrible thought line and attempts to recover the audience, much more often than I felt like enjoying the movie.
