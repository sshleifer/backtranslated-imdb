When I was a teenager watching this movie for the first time, I thought it was one of the best movies ever made. Of course, the reason why is Bo Derek and his various stripes in this movie. However, now that I am older, I can honestly say that this film is terrible. Keep in mind, Bo Derek is absolutely incredibly beautiful and she and husband-director John Derek make sure you see her a lot. But when you remove this aspect from the movie, it becomes a great walk. And Tarzan is muscular as you think he should be, but when he sees Jane (that's Bo, of course) for the first time, he does not know what to think. This, despite the fact that Bo wears a wet shirt, with her visible breast visible. Tarzan would be the only primitive man on the planet who would have that problem. If you are looking for a movie to slobber over a beautiful naked body then this could fill the ticket. If you are looking for a gorgeous, fun and worthwhile movie, go elsewhere ... almost anywhere else!
