I was expecting a very funny movie. Instead, I received a movie with some fun jokes and many that just did not work. I did not like the idea of ​​bringing down the descendants of Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty. He was confused. It would have been more fun if he had someone new, instead of Moriarty, resurrected. Some things were funny. Burt Kwouk was very funny, as always. McCloud on horse was funny. McGarrett from Hawaii 5-0 was not even McGarrett. Connie Booth is obviously very good with accents. She is from Indiana, but she played English and a New Yorker pretty well. Unfortunately, it was not presented too much in the script. I was expecting a more funny movie. Instead, I have a rather confusing film with a bad script. Rather ironic, because both Booth and Cleese were together. Maybe they were about to fall apart in 77 years.
