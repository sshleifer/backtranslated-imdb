This is absurd - apart from my Australian colleague who has reviewed this film, I can not believe that all the others who have submitted a review so far have been somehow involved in the production of Elektra, considering how generous they were with praise. Of course, I'm not a fan of comic conversions, so we did not come in with many expectations, but we still found Elektra incredibly overwhelming. What bothers me most was the fact that there was so much in this movie that it came out inexplicable, which let you think, "no, how relevant is that to the plot?" or "as did that character's appearance?" I can only hope that these things are probably explained to a certain extent in Daredevil, which I do not intend to see. In addition, the character's behavior in this movie seems to make a confrontation at random moments to fit the story, and I do not even begin to start with the totally useless romantic sub-plot. I'm also (still) scratching my head over the fate of Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa's character, who seems to have gone through inexplicable. If I can give kudos to this movie for whatever it should be the fantastic locations in which it was shot, but otherwise I won some pleasure from Elektra. I know we should suspend our mistrust of fantasy / action movies, but almost everything in this movie was so unlikely or confused (even by cinematic action standards) that it simply frustrated me. hell, at least Jennifer Garner looks good.
