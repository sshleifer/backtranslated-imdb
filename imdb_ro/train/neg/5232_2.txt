Becky Harris plays the female buyer whose misfortune is to be in the shop at the wrong time and obviously the purpose of being in this movie is to provide a reason to wear the remote! Miss Harris seems to me to be fifty or older when he first came to the stage. Once the red hair judgment is done, it becomes obvious that it is not the AARP queen. If these are not some of the best products ever displayed on celluloid, I want someone to convince me. Absolutely stunning in my opinion and I simply wore my VHS copy capturing her charm. I would like to know if this movie is available on DVD. The rest of the movie is not worth mentioning at all. I was hoping to see something quite convincing and intelligent, however I was disappointed in both aspects. God bless Becky Harris!
