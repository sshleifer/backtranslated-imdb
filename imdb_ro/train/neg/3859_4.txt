Jason Lee is doing everything possible to bring fun to a silly situation, but the movie fails to make a connection. <br /> <br /> Maybe because the character of Julia Stiles seems weird to be convincing and sexy soon to be cousin-in-law. <br /> <br /> Maybe because she and Selma Blair's characters would have to be thrown in the opposite direction. (Selma Blair seems more conniving than Julia would be). In any case, this film is another trivialisation of Hollywood's situation that could be real in the real world (which was caught with your pants at your bachelor party, your cousin), which while the promise fails to deliver . There are laughs to be sure, and the distribution (even if miscast) does everything they can with subclass material that does not go beyond its subject. So instead of getting a successful fame (Animal House or American Pie), we have a humorous and silly earth (Meatballs 2 or something similar).
