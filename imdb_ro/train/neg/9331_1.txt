Are we talking about the same movie? This movie is totally ridiculous, the plot is disgusting and completely logical. It is a typical DVD / TV movie that contains all the ingredients necessary for a horrific cinematic experience: The actors were actors, the lateral steps of the plot that remained unexplainable, THE GIRL SHOWS THER T * ts, why?), People it does not react to things as it would in real life. I will not even bother you with details, it would last all night. Well, well, only one: if two people were killed in front of you, as you walked out on the street, one of the victims almost died in your arms, with his blood thrown off your head, be; "Oh, he left the world and the last thing he saw was my angry face!" My thoughts go to Harvey and his career is lost.
