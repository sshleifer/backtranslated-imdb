A recent post here by a woman claiming a military context contained the comment "The life of a woman is not more valuable than a man's life." This mantra of political correctness is not true, both as history and biology. Companies have managed to recover from the heavy losses of the male population, sometimes at an astonishing speed. Germany was ready to fight another war in 1939 despite the 1914-1918 war in which more than two million men were killed. In the Triple Alliance war in South America (1865), Paraguay took over three neighboring countries until almost all male population was eliminated, but fought for a deadlock in the 1930 Chaco War against much larger Bolivia. No society has ever survived the loss of the female population. Only when the life of the nation is at stake, women are sent to fight. Israel faced this situation in 1948, but since then it has never considered fighting units in combat for its defense forces, despite the popular image of the Israeli soldier. <br /> <br /> "GI Jane" is a Hollywood fluff.
