I liked the sense of opening a few minutes, but in 20 minutes I applied freely with the button quickly. Too many photos of Stewart (Michael Zelniker) go from one room to the other, along corridors, through doors and on the street, and as many shots of his looking doubtful and confusing. It gave me the impression that the story was initially understood as a short (20-30 minutes), and then stretched into a feature as a love work between director Grieve and star Zelniker (they co-wrote the script)> < It could have been more fun if any of the characters had something to say that I had never heard before in many other movies before, or if it was not disappointing the one I had predicted for three minutes in the movie (atypical for a independent / small studio film). At least his heart was in the right place - it was not your silly standard of Hollywood manipulation.
