I admit that I saw only a handful of episodes, but each seemed completely different from the latter. It seems that after the first season, the producers decided to completely re-enter the show, introduce new characters, introduce new ones and rewrite the entire dynamic show. As you probably supposed, the show is about weirdness, the unpredictable Holly (Amanda Bynes), who moves with her sister Valerie (Jennie Garth) in New York City. Destined enough decent: odd couple + fish in water + Jinx height. While I miss the sitcoms of the past, this show, unfortunately, has repeatedly missed the mark, and is sad because it has a decent talent. Above all, they insisted on changing the show (Val lived with a regular bowl of a season, then left suddenly, so he opens a bakery and what?) When things change so drastically, you have the feeling that * show * knows that it is bad. I mean, completely new sets, written characters and new regulars show! On a side note (this is just nitpicking), I know this is a television show and not real at all, but Val and Holly end up living in a double loft space (there are stairs) with a terrace ... in MANHATTAN! Are you serious!?
