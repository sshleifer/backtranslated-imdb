God, give this movie three stars for ten of the following reasons. the final sequence is once again quite efficiently treated and it was absolutely hilarious. for this I get the three points. Besides, he was atrocious. it was not about being so funny, so obvious, but about doubling, acting out the blunt voices, the dialogue they said, often hilarious. actions taken and / or unfulfilled also lead to great hilarity and / or throwing things on the screen. like when the whole city is sacrificed and a small group of people sit on the balcony looking as if they were watching a glass of cooking or "tried" to escape from the church they are guiding. <br /> <strong> Primary Poor: I think something is happening outside, so you should go up and look out the window. hero: ok. Primary Bad: Now is my chance to make an idiot go out and cool around the fire, being totally ineffective and getting hacked up. insert the sequence in which this occurs. Primary Bad: Damn, wait, I'll take this little baby and she'll go out and cry the pappa apparently oblivious of the fact that these rotten corpses are not just scary strangers, but they are actually zombies without meat or leather or anything else and she will drive and I will run! insert the sequence in which this occurs. <br /> <br /> Hero (up): He tries to escape again, badly, and leaves the door open, it's bad, it's a beautiful sight. > <br /> woman: where is my daughter? <br /> <br /> Hero (Down Down Now): I do not know, I can not see it anyway and it was not out because I could not see it despite being out there and me having a view of of the entire neighborhood and she just stands outside, where on earth could it be? Needless to say, whoever threw things off the screen after 10 minutes of this. So watch the first movie with a few friends, having a few drinks and make sure that when you follow this, you are absolutely drunk and you can chuckle at everyone's stupidity. and there was not even a decent gore, such a shame.
