We offered this movie a high 2 star rating as they appear personally in the 42nd and 43nd minutes of the movie ... the scene from the Russian roadbike. In this scene, the director of the film gave me the immortal line - "50 dollars ... you drink and you talk," but I felt that my Polish counterpart could speak in a more convincing Russian accent than I could, so I refused to take this talk. I was slightly starstruck that this was my first film experience ... and who knows ... these lines could have gotten there with lines like "I'll be back" and "Pretty honest My dear, do not give it damn ". If I spoke a line, then my name would appear in Rancid Aluminum's credits as "Heavy 1" instead of Ryszard Janikowski's name. <br /> <br /> As time passes, I was fortunate enough to say that my name is in no way related to this movie. Even if I spent a whole day on stage in South Wales hot spot Barry Island, nobody could tell me what a real story it was. The cafeterias and the lady of the closet competed that they seemed to have a lot of swearing and nudity in it ... things could have certainly been worse if I had been stripped in the worst movies ... <br /> <br / > Still ... On the positive side .... I spoke to Rhys Ifans during a break. I had no idea who he was because "Notting Hill" was going to be released, and not a certainty that he could be Welsh. They made various inappropriate comments about what a terrible pit of Barry Island has been since my childhood was there in the '70s and' 80s. Only when Keith Allen appeared that I realized I was in a quality production ........
