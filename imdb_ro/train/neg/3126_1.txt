Mr. VanHook had a good idea and gave the kick. Unfortunately, he did not do this. The historical subject of the giants is a good one, but pour in milk and ends with a huge cheese wheel. Say, take this wheel and rotate it off a rock. I could not even watch the whole movie. That says a lot because I rarely leave any movie. I always like to give them the chance of last-minute redemption. It is impossible to redeem something so bad. Well, at least the act was good ... NO! <br /> <br /> The only thing that fits into this movie is the evaluation. 1/10 and sink into negative numbers!
