If you go see this movie, you will have a prey against the cinema, the director, the producer, the actors and the person who told you to see it! Shame on you, Sarah Michelle Geller, that you have put your name and face to this poor excuse of a movie. It would have been more frightening if Japanese actors had spoken only in Japanese instead of trying to "act" in English. I wanted to push myself when the movie ended ... a real disappointment with all commercials on TVs and movie trailers that promote this blade producer. Sarah Michelle did not have to act at all to make this movie ... she practiced her frenzy skills. Do not waste time or money on this movie.
