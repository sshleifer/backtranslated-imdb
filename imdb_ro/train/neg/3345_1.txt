"" Bad boy and a bad girl (immediately after the killing of two policemen and stealing a drug-filled van, they become hot and heavy): "So," how do you feel about shooting some innocent passers-by? " "You are sure you can show a good girl ..." "A generic child who fled for his life instead of helping someone, sums up his life and personality in this line -" I am a tiger! "(This was the US version) My grandfather was right, he left us ..." Boo-hoo. (Not really a spoiler) A bad guy (in the fire) shouts "Aargh! Yarn!"
