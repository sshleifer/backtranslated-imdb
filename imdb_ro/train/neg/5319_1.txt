The recipe for one of the worst movies of all time: a male bastard who shows he has escaped from WWF has a terrible purpose with a gun that has inconsistent effects (the first guy he shoots through fire but when he shoots someone else they just disappear) and take time to feed a deer. Then you have the characters that can not be identified, 30 years of college, a lame test at the end of a surprise and a lot, much more. Avoid at all costs.
