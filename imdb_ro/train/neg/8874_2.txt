but there are not many. Probably the worst "major release" I've ever seen in my life. Definitely the worst for this year. There is no point in commenting on plotting, casting or acting. The problem is beyond all that. It is in the absolute stupidity of the annoying genre (not of the amusing nature) of everything that takes place on the screen. I do not know why I gave it 2/10 instead of 1/10. Probably because of Steven Martini. He even tried. Bottom line - 95 minutes washed the toilet along with some brain cells. Avoid at all costs.
