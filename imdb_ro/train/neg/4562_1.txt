I did not feel as if I had been raped as with married christmas, but Belle's Magical World is still the antithesis of beauty and beast. Like CHRISTMAS, BMW hates the audience, though not at such an extreme level. It's ugly, uncanonical, idiotic, and writing is terribly bad. None of the stories work. These are not the characters I loved from BATB at all, there are a lot of people. I wanted to dissect it, but after a few minutes I gave up, because nobody in their mind would take that seriously. What we have here is three stories. The "perfect word" is an arrogant and weighted study of forgiveness. "Fifi's use" works only if you can accept that Babette's name is actually Fifi and that it's a James Bond sorcery and that Lumiere is an idiot about women. "Broken Wing" (or "Broken Wind" as I like to call it) is probably the worst in the group. Does the beast hate the birds? Since? Do not watch this shit - every copy of this video deserves to be cremated. BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is still a cinematic classic, a transcendental celebration of love, art, intelligence, and the human soul.
