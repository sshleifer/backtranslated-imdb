I liked it, I really liked it. Please do not think I'm an idiot, but I have to admit I was enjoying this movie. I expected to be shit, it was shit, but sometimes it's OK to relax and watch a bad movie that you do not have to focus too much, do you? I did not expect any hidden meaning or morales, and there was nothing, but it does not matter because I just watched for entertainment and enjoyed over time. Films like this are the reasons why Ben Stillers (excusing "something about Mary") and Vince Vaughns (anyway you said your surname, we could not be disturbed by checking) have jobs. It's ok to watch a shit movie as long as you do not expect too much from it, and I'll take a stand, jog, run, but do not drive because I do not have a car at Blockbuster Video, or even the Elections, and rent a bunch of humorous toilet movies and stay in one night watching them. Good day for your reader. If you do not say that this comment helped you then you do not like it, if you say it helped then the god bless you, you will go to heaven.
