I can not believe I wasted my money to rent this movie. I thought it was a start up when it started and was never better. The actor, the music that drowns the actors. Horrible. Save your money! You have to read the movie until you knew the music would have drowned the lines of speech. I have never had the role of a slaughterhouse or the need to continue to show that cows and pigs are eaten. What did this with the real "killer" "BTK"? I understand why there were no famous actors in this movie. The script would have let me go to the front page of the reading. It would be better to look at the dry paint.
