How the hell did they do that ?! Presenting as a goat comedy, "misfortune" is essentially two hours of people mumbling fragments of sentence. Warren Beatty, usually trusted, looks drunk and usually hilarious Goldie Hawn behaves as if he is depressed. As for Gert Frobe, his famous role - Goldfinger - was infinitely more admirable than his character here. Even the LSD champagne bottle can not save this litany of worthlessness. Do we compare this movie to "Plan 9 in outer space"? I would not do that even if someone paid me. "P9FOS" was made idiot but became hilarious; this has been done idiot and makes you feel how your brain has just melted from your ears. Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn did this when they played in Shampoo, but then played together in Town & Country. Maybe they should not work in the movies. Generally, I'd rather break my skin than see it again. That's great. Maybe I should remake him with Jackie Chan. Then I'd pay to see her.
