The film is very bad, the story is too simple and predictable and a poor act acts as a supplement. The story of the vampire hunter is the worst thing I've seen so far, Derek Bliss (Jon Bon Jovi) travels to Mexico in search of blood brothers, uses some interesting weapons (but nothing compared to Blade) and does part of Van Helsig vampire hunters? OK, but work alone. He is tasked with pursuing a powerful vampire queen looking for a black crucifix to make a ritual that makes him invulnerable to sunlight (it's almost a sequel to The Vampires (1998) led by John Carpenter and played by James Woods) Derek begins his quest for the queen with some new friends: Sancho (Diego Luna, really bad acting also), an inexperienced teenager, Father Rodrigo (Catholic priest), Zoey (Natasha Wagner) and Ray Collins (Darius McCrary ) another expert vampire hunter. So obviously, in this adventure he is not alone. You can begin to feel how this movie would just look at its main actor (Jon Bon Jovi); is a huge difference in actor's quality compared to James Woods, and then, if you watch the movie (I do not recommend this part), you will get involved in one of the simplest, completely predictable stories with terrible performances, effects very bad special and incoherent events! <br /> <br /> We recommend that you do not see this movie, rent a new movie, see another channel, go out with your friends, etc. <br /> <br /> 3/10
