Evil Breed is a very strange movie, which is unfortunately not good. The beginning of the movie seems promising, but it's a disaster in general. The dialogue is pretty bad, but it's not as bad as the act. The act is brutal and unbearable. the characters deliver horrible lines there, and even if that is the purpose, the method does not work because the characters become annoying. Some of the killings are innovative, but it took too long to reach them. After about half an hour through the film we receive the first death (other than the beginning) and then almost every other character is smoked in the next five minutes. The film has turned into a parody of ridiculous characters, unrealistic carats like fights and a scene in which a man takes his intestines out of his sscrack. None of them is funny, it's just ridiculous. The film then becomes extremely gorilla and ultra-useless. Most characters are clustered even for slasher standards and are as solid as a ter on the street for 5 days. The Eagle Race is not even bad shit, therefore, fails in its main task. Watch Texas Chainsaw Massacre, just before by Dawn, or see no harm for a true slasher.
