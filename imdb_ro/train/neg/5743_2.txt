Yeah, I know I'm one of the few people who want to make this film into the dust of forgetting. So let me tell you why I feel that way. In fact, if it were published as a Zombie movie or something like that, I might have enjoyed it. But right now, I'm totally speechless. SPOILER ... Although I'm not sure what to ruin * Let's start with the first thick defect. If I did not know that the movie is called "Darkness - The Vampire Version" and if I did not see some sequences in which some people seem to suck blood, I would not have seen vampires. I mean, FANGLESS ???? Give me a break! <br /> <br /> Second bad point: what about Metal? It seems that all the youngsters, and especially those so-called "vampires," find themselves in different types of Metal, judging mainly on their shirts! Do not get me wrong, I've been in the most extreme music for almost 15 years, but no one will scare me, showing me some ridiculous teenagers in Iron Maiden (from all the bands !!!) Shouting around, pretending are vampires! "Pathetic" is the only word I can use here. <br /> <br /> Third weakness: the actors. Wait a minute. What actors ?! I mean the director's wooden friends! Words would be a waste here. Yeah, all right, the movie is really bad, but what's the difference? It would have been a strong point and something to enjoy if the brilliant director would not have chosen to create an ARTIFICIAL vampire topic in this movie. I wanted to see Vampiri, but I was treated to stupid kids who would have liked to use my baseball stick. Movie makers would simply advertise the film by saying "cheap B grade horror without any plot, but a bunch of gore!" This film is blasphemy against the whole concept of vampirism. And it makes me die.
