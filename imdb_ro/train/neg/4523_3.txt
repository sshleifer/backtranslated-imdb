When this movie was released, it gave birth to one of the biggest movie reviews for the capsule: Sphinx Stinks. He does it, but in a fascinating manner. Casting is bad, from the beginning: Frank Langella and Sir John Gielgud as Egyptians? There is not enough makeup in Cairo for that, at least not while this movie was made. But it's funny to see them trying. Performances run the range of mummies (sorry, obvious observation) at the top, with very few stops between them. Lesley-Anne Down looks like she could not find Egypt on a map, much less exposing her archaeological treasures. This is due, at least in part, to very bad writings, one of the curses to be visited by each viewer of this film. In my opinion, movies that involve a curse or draw on a subject that is somewhat esoteric, such as egiptology, are ripe for a bad and overwhelmed dialogue. It does not disappoint, and convergence proves a double. The plot has a dramatic tension source: can it be worse and less credible? The answer is usually YES. Location photos are beautiful, and the design of the set is generally good, the only consistent reminders that it was not a low-budget production. This and the fact that there are so many well-known faces that serve in such unintentional lamentation. Inexpensive, no; cheese, yeah.
