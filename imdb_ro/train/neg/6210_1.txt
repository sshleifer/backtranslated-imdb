This is the worst movie I've ever seen since "I know who killed me" with Lindsey Lohan. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, I can assure you that you only have frustration and disappointment if you choose to see this. Hey, Tim Burton, I used to be a big fan of you ... did you really shoot this movie? I mean seriously, what is without giving up anything, here's the story in a vague black ... Nine wakes up, he does things, his actions and decisions are irrelevant. ... and the movie is over. Oh, wait ... here comes a spoiler ... <br /> <br /> A spoiler alert! Runner alert! At the end of the movie ... it rains. I think part of my soul died while watching this movie.
