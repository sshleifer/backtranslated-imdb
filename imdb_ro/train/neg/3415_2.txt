In the standard view, this is a terrible movie. However, he scores an almost perfect score on the unintentional comedy scale. I can think of some real comedies that make me laugh as much as I watched this movie. The ghost of Andy Griffith, dressed in American native dances, sends me every time in hysteria. I would not lose the gas or the energy that leads to the video store to rent it, but if it happens to sit on the couch at 3am and come to TV, check it out.
