The original exploitation, though not at all enjoyable at almost any level, as to some guys who turn cats into human meat eating monsters because their cat foods are made with humans are remodeling with added scientist elements. Cats can not be enough, and when the food that fades from the meat, the cats turn their owners back. Impressed at almost all levels, this is an example of the absolute bottom of barrel material that actually played in cinemas at the beginning of the '70s updated with foreign cat and dog breeds fighting for supremacy. Director Ted Mikel is a hack, but he's so loving a person (generally, I like man because of his smile that induces interviews and comments) that you can spare a lot for the garbage that's most proven. Mikels wanted to make movies and did not care how they turned out for as long as he was producing something. More power for him, but I would like not to obey our home movies
