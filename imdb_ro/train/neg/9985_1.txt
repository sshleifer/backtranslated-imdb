Have I ever seen a more shocking new movie? I can think of a lot of equality, but none that manages to overcome it. Distribution are all horrible stereotypes accompanied by a flat dialogue. I'm ashamed of all the people involved in doing this. Each one carries an expression of fear that was not generated by the plot, but the realization that this project could easily spread its career. Even many of Mrs. Diaz's charms do not offer a good reason to obey you. Avoid, it's obviously a movie style the Americans did not know. Follow the end result if you need to, and you'll see what I'm talking about, but I'm NOT saying I did not warn you ...
