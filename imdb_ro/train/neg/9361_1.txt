When I saw the preview for this on TV I was thinking "well it will be a good werewolf film," but it was not. it was not scary at all! the act was good, the plot was horrible, the military offer was simply bad. I think the SCI-FI channel could do better than this piece of nonsense. The film made it look like Arron would turn into a werewolf, but he turned into a psychopath and beat a doctor in his throat. If you've read some of my other reviews about other movies, it's all positive, but this is not just because the story was terrible. One out of 10 maximum. I'm sure you all would expect a werewolf, but I bet you do not expect that. Beyond Loch Nes was much better than this movie, heck, any film on this science fiction channel is better than this movie.
