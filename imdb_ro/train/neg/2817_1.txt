Hooper Hoops is quite likely the biggest fluke genre of horror has to offer. Like any other horror fan, I loved the Chainsaw in Texas, but I think you should have at least a few movies to put your name in front of a movie title. I can not think of any other film that Hooper did (he did not count Poltergeist on his own), which really made an impact on the horror genre or the movie world. And this movie, Night Terror, strengthens my point of view. Poor Robert Englund, I give him credit for at least doing a good job with the terrible material he has received. He did what he could. As for the movie itself? Clean clean. Unnecessary nude scenes every five minutes, a story that must have been written in a landscape, music and cinema, really terrible. Nothing in this movie can be reimbursed. Do not waste time. In general, 1 in 10. I'm sorry for Hooper, his career seems to have ended before he really starts. I hope he can pump at least a good shot so he can get a cult status.
