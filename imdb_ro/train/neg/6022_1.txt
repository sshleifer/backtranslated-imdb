I'm getting a little tired of people who abused God's name to perpetuate the vision of fanaticism over the world. Well, I do not reject the idea of ​​Armageddon or the coming of antichrist, I reject the idea that only certain people who really live a good life (They seem to be more white Christian children) will go to Heaven, while the rest of us must suffer through a militia of Hell on Earth, just because we were not good enough. God can be a judge, but I do not think He will measure every level of goodness. Give the creator a credit.
