I do not envy Barry Levinson, Rachel Weisz, Ben Stiller or Jack Black to make this film. It is, in one word, boring. Perhaps this is too predictable, Ben Stiller's prodigal role, more than exploited or funny scenes, make this film just forget. Even the appearance of Christopher Walken ends in a pathetic way. I was very disappointed. I like Ben Stiller's actor. I liked it very much in most of my films, the last one I saw before it was Duplex with Drew Barrymore and it was not that bad. About Jack Black ... Well, besides High Fidelity, I've never seen him do something good. How about school rock? Oooops, scary.
