I feel like I'm the only child in town who was disturbed by Branagh's show. He is a good actor by most accounts, but he just could not get the South accent. I mean, it was regrettable. It's like trying too hard to be a Yank. One of the previous commentators questioned the reason why US actors were not involved in this film. I have a second notion. It's great when actors / actresses want to expand their horizons, but it's another thing to try too hard so performance gets tense. Maybe it was Altman, but he's such a great director ... Well, I really do not want to knock Branagh too much for his absolutely hideous accent. Everyone deserves to sit here and there. But it's hard to look at something so annoying that you'd rather drown your chicken bones or eat a dumb bucket than sit by The Gingerbread Man.
