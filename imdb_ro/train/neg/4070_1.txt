Imagine the goggle children who get angry at college in a school movie, throw a story story and a lot of terrible actors, and you're still not nearly as bad as this movie. bad, bad effects, worse action. Tentative of shocking horror. Everyone I've shown is a little depressed looking at it. Sexual scenes are disturbing, not necessarily for their content, but rather because they are just something you want to conclude as soon as possible. The last sex scene is just a foul, just before you get to the guy. I'm one of those people who loves to watch movies that people hate, that's why I chose this. But for your own sake, save your time and avoid this contempt. It's so bad. I literally threw it into the garbage.
