American films about war and Nazis simply can not be good. They can not refrain from becoming an idiot and follow an agenda. All the Nazis are bad, crazy, too proud, and the Americans are so modest, yet capable, sensitive and human. Come on, stop this. The main character says something like "through this process, we have to make an aggressive war a crime." Is America a peaceful nation with a $ 420 billion global defense budget (China, with only $ 51b)? It is simply spent in this without any ... ROI? Why does America look like a peaceful nation when it is not? I deeply dislike films with an agenda - throwing art into hell and trying to convince us to believe something. Hollywood should put a label on movies, just as disc companies have that "parental consultation" tag. We should have some "shit", "advocacy" or "correct political tag" on some movies. This is one of them.
