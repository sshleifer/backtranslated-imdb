Dr. Fu Manjun's plot of Dr. Fi Man's plot of Peter Sellers in a character paradise created by Sax Rohmer is an injustice until the end of his vendors' career. The plot was very simplistic, and if it had been done it could have been treated nicely, but instead it was badly executed. Some of the reasons why this movie was not that good was bad dialogue, cheap laughter, aggressive targeting, and a strange feeling that the movie was somewhat incomplete. On the other hand, it was indeed the only thing that kept my interest in this mixed image. I found Sellers the brilliant portrayal of Manchu, with occasional lines to be remembered. For example, there is a scene in which Fu Manchu is confused, who is the henchman saying, "Ah, you all look the same for me." I do not like to admit it, but I laughed aloud with that line. Then, of course, a lot of strong supporting characters drew my attention with Helen Mirren as the backside counselor, David Tomilson Sir Roger Avery (and his latest film, not a way to end a career) and Sid Ceasar (who offers a rather capricious interpretation of Al Capone's relative who works for the FBI). These characters kept me also forgotten. The sets were also nice. Oriental drawings and English society in 1933 were gracefully illustrated in this dud-of-a-picture. With all honesty, my advice to you is to watch the movie if you are Peter Sellers or Sid Ceasar Fan. Otherwise, we recommend concentrating on the aluminum foil.
