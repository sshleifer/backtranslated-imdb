Terrible action, plot full of pain, stupid story and just around the terrible movie sum up this piece of junk. It was very hard to stand. Just terrible. Do not miss any money. Cinemas should feel stupid to put this movie there for people to look. This "horror" movie was not even scary, creepy or disturbing. He was not at all attractive. The act was so terrible by the actors that any attempt to engage in the film through dialogue is completely destroyed at the moments when the actor / actress opens his mouth. In addition, the whole story, I do not know why someone would make a movie with this story again. Do not waste your time or money. Even if it's a free ticket, do not miss a moment watching this movie. You will feel great seeing him.
