This movie was not just bad - it was terrible. After I watched him, I actually felt the need to take a shower to get my misery. It is "gag" with an elderly couple who does, it is not funny, but it is disgusting. The monster was cool, but that's all. Only continuity errors will upset you - I'm at least here. Editing is very poor. Almost everything else might be possible would be better than spending time watching this movie. Even if your group of friends is in "bad movies," this is exceptional in its ineptitude, I could not even laugh at it. You were warned.
