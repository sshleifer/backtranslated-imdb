Probably this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Jessica Simpson not only does not have any acting skills, but the script is incredibly superficial and blades. You will hear a serious dialogue that goes, "I love you more". "No, I love you more." I stopped viewing the movie (online) after the first half hour, I could not take it anymore. Her "South Charm" does not work and is even annoying; Her attempts to swell blooming crash and she offers lines as she reads the script right on the page. Poor Luke Wilson. Has he not read the script before agreeing to do so or fell in connection with the promise of the big profits of Papa Joe (Jessica's father and also producer of the film)? We hope he now knows better than to connect to another movie like this one. Luke Wilson is actually a good actor - I hate to see the painful appearance on his face as he suffers through the evil dialogue. I also think that the previous commentator who gave this film to 8 out of 10 was probably involved in somehow or hired by Papa Joe to give the film a better rating. No one in their mind would actually find this film hiring. Jessica has a lot of money, right? Can you buy some acting lessons?
