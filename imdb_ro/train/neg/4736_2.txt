The film deserves 2/10. 1.5 stars for the girl, (I'm sorry to be biased, I think nice girl is the only show of the movies) and 0.5 because it is shorter than Azumi 1. I followed Azumi 1 and 2 in 1 chairs. I was amazed to be able to sit by it. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about the plus points of the movie. Girl. Ueto Aya is nice. It's all about saving the whole movie. In fact, if the main character was a man, I'm sure most people (including me) would not have touched the movie at all. <br /> <br /> Now let yourself talk about minus points. First, it's real draggy, with lots of repetitive scenes. The scenes of Nachi and Azumi continue to return. It just seems like a way to shoot with drama. Love typical Japanese love flashbacks, and this movie too. Second, the movie is too unrealistic in a historical context. I do not mind the unrealistic movies. But this film is like a poor way of showing creativity by throwing in the ninja acting like bears and spiders, etc. ... reminds me of Shinobi, although Shinobi is a fantasy movie. Moreover, to describe what I do not know, the director shoots people who die with blood spray (literally) around them ... people who do not realize that their heads have been cut ... etc. .. etc ... etc ... Too many of them spoil the show. It seems that the anime influence is strong in this movie. It degrades the show very much. Third, Azumi should not be an assassin. She seems more like an army for me, it's just a woman. I do not think you see the assassins who are loading in the army camps. The only time I felt it was "assassin-liked" was when he killed Kiyomasa Kato at the end of Azumi 1. Finally, the plot was thin in both films. It's a linear plot without development and surprises in any way.
