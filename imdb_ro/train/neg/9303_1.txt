I write this review after watching it a few months ago ... the trailer showed me quite promising to buy this excuse for a movie. It is a total joke ... and literally spits it in front of the real classics of the early generation of horror, such as the Chainsaw Massacre (1974), which they really had the misfortune to compare with behind the cover. The producer who played Brandon should go with the burgers and serve the fat hamburger ... maybe he would not even be good at it! Enlightenment was a bad evil and a great annoyance through the film you could not even see the actor's faces. I do not even remember the rest of the cast members, which is sad indeed, that they never do anything to impress you to make them memorable. That's all when I lose this review PLEASE to stay as far as you can from this junk pile, even if you get it for 25 cents, do not buy your piece of gum at least it would make you fun! If you want good quality fun, much better than that ... then check out a Jeff Hayes movie ... because it takes talent to make it horror and the kid has it! <br /> <br /> I gave this one star just for the cover art ... this is the only thing worth to enjoy the so-called "movie" <br /> <br /> -Rick Blalock
