As a great admirer of Marlene Dietrich, I had to see (at last) this very loud image. It's Miss Dietrich's first colorful movie, and the most beautiful blonde in the world is a redhead! Begin bad. The story is an extraordinary glimpse, which involves a subject that, in my heart, makes me sick: religious guilt. (Who needs it?) Suffice it to say that perhaps from all of Dietrich's films (and I saw the most, including "Pittsburgh"), this is the only one in which her performance is hardly worth watching. The color photo is OK (this is a very early release of Technicolor) but without any purpose. Great casting: C. Aubrey Smith, Basil Rathbone (pretty much?). The only thing of interest is not John Carradine's extraordinary caricature of a spectacle like "The Divine of Sand", which predicts everything that's going to happen. Probably the "happy ending" is one of the most depressing ever conceived. Another example of David O. Selznick's extremely swollen reputation (did he ever make a really good movie - other than that?) And, for the ultimate annoyance, the soundtrack of DVD MGM is a mess with volume levels apparently randomized. Not recommended.
