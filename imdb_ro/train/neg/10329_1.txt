I'm trying to portray an image for Dark Angel. "I'm thinking about Matrix, I'm thinking about Bladerunner, I think that guy who plays Faith in Angel, wearing a bright black skin - or some guys like her, leaves it with us, I'll do it without a plot, dialogue, character, decent action or budget, just a few bolds and a hot chicken of shiny black leather that falls into a sad bike. "Fanboys dig bangs loud and hot chick in shiny black skin, is not it?" < <br /> <br /> Flashy, superficial, sad, formic, passionate, boring, boring, stupid, humorous, desultory, barely competent. Anime live action without any action, or even any life. SF, as Joe Fanboy really likes. :(
