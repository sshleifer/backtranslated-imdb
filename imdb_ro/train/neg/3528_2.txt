There are so many comments about this movie, but I found them to be deceptive. This scenario, in which a normal person becomes a crime partner for someone of the opposite sex, for no apparent reason. The boy meets the girl. The girl keeps the boy at gunpoint for something ridiculous. The boy is intrigued. <br /> <br /> Know the training: The antagonist turns out to be a wild, free spirit instead of a sociopath ... Take some wisdom from Alice Drummond in words and you have a recipe for Love. Sheedy is crazy or just needs a hug? the role of the breakfast club simply returns as a lead character. And all that remains is a really corrupt turkey of a movie.
