I had to write a review of this movie after I read another comment saying that this is Sidney Poitier's best film. Poitier has just returned from a fifteen-year break in film acting and is clearly groomed here. 11 of his films are mentioned on Wikipedia and do not include this. 5 of his films are on AFI's list of top 100 inspirational films, again does not include this. Berenger and Poitier, the ruby ​​and slicker city have proposed to hunt a dangerous psychopath before crossing the border to Canada. Some of the comedy attempts in this film are clearly failing, and Berenger and Poitier's ties have been cumbersome and unpleasant (they were not helped by a very gentle script). Kirstie Alley (as a hostage) was inadequately used and almost completely ignored when it was on the screen. Some suspense attempts are made, for example, when you want to try and guess which of the 5 men on a fishing trip is the killer (all of them are villains). I understand this is the whole appeal to most of the fans there. I guess who it was and I really did not try. If you are a Berenger fan, watch the Sniper (1993), you can even see Billy Zane strutting his stuff. It is much better. Generally, I would give Shoot to kill 3/10. It's not bold, and it's too simple for me.
