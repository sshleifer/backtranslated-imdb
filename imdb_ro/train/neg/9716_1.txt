This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... The plot is so full of holes, the story is like a bad remake of a bad suspense movie and actors sound like it is read directly from the manuscript for the first time. The worst of all is Steve Guttenberg. He plays his character as if he were in the "Police Academy" - the same furious female - and that is not suitable for a leading man in what should have been a thriller. It's hard to believe that Hanson does "LA Confidential" ten years later ... <br /> <br /> Avoid that like plague ...
