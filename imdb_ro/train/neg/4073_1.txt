NO SPOILERS. I like horror films, but that must be the poorest attempt ever to make. Calling "a movie" is also a stretch. This "random-by-obvious-false-and-sticky-violence-and-ugly-woman-trying-act-sexy-edited-weak-together" is not worth watching. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Watching this is as interesting to watch as some random family holiday photos, and it has about the same quality you expect when you send your son ten years to the forest with your new vacuum -cam, and tell her to make a movie. <br /> <br /> Terrible.
