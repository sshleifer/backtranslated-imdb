This moving movie was super smart. It's a rhyme theme with every horror movie ever made. Valentine attempts ZERO to be original. What is Valentine anyway? There are a lot of people who give each other the same blade messages that were given to the same people a year earlier. There is nothing original in Valentine. <br /> <br /> I only saw it once, and one of you seeing here are some of the movies she broke. 1.Prom Night 2.Carrie 3.Scream 4. Any horror movie in which someone kills someone. I know there are more, but my mind slowly turns into a silk pile, so it could not get them as soon as they came. Valentine had no chance of being a good movie. How is it that every horror movie has to have an "amazing" killer, people she does not care, because their emotions take life in every other scene. In a minute, a pretty girl turns into a B - ch evil, then she 's an insecure woman and so on a son. Normally, any horror movie (in my book) can be saved by the gore, Valentine does not have that again. It was like trying to make PG-13, but it did not, so they left the edition. <br /> <br /> You do not see this much inspired, unless you hate it, and you want to die. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (3) -J.Leonard Rollins -
