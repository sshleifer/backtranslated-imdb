*** SPOILERS *** Let's start with the "good" of this movie - the role of Cynthia Rothrock and Richard Norton. The rest of the act is terrible (this is not helped by the atrocious scenario). The worst guilty is the villain, Buntao, the head of an Asian crime syndicate (played by Frans Tumbuan). I laugh at my head as she expresses her "fury" of losing a lot of money; horrible performance. Patrick Muldoon is not much better, and his line is "a hostile takeover" (which is the rest of the title of this movie) was delivered as bad as you could. There are no other main characters, but no other actor / actress has distinguished himself in this film. Then we'll come to the fence. This should tell you everything you need to know: In the original "Rage and Honor," Cynthia Rothrock, who plays the role of Chris Fairchild, was a teacher in the central city. Now she is C.I.A. agent (or was another government agency - I'm sorry, but this movie was so bad that I do not even remember). Hmmm ... I can imagine what C.I.A. the application process was as though. Interviewer: What is your past work experience? Chris: I was a teacher. Interviewer: All right; You're hired! Just give him a "2" because of decent actions and a beautiful plot at the end (though we know that Tommy (Muldoon), the secret villain, will be caught).
