This is the most terrible movie I have ever seen, but with all fairness it is visible and rather funny. I do not think filmmakers wanted to be your typical Hollywood quality. It's just a stupid film about a serial killer who gets sucked into a token of toxic waste causing a reaction with him and snow (as it is in the middle of winter). Then he turns into a killer snowman, which is enough to make you laugh on your own. This movie is really bad, but it's funny. Killing is hilarious. I do not advise you to go buy it (as I did - the cover looked good!) But if you happen to be on TV one night and you're laughing, then keep it.
