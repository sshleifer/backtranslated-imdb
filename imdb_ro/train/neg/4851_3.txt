watch a team of experts on bomb disposal in Iraq, count the time before they can go home. That in itself seems boring. Each time the little legends appeared, telling us how long they left, it just caused this movie without any plot to shoot and continue. hurry and finish your time there so we can go home. I have to miss something. I'm a big fan of the war movies if they're well done. This has had the jarhead syndrome. A movie that was sometimes shot beautifully, but cinema does not stop him from being completely boring and useless. And you get over the slow cartridges that come out of the gun already shot, they could have saved money, and they've just taken pictures of any other movie with a gun in it ... We had no empathy for the main guy in it, we always hoped indiscretion he would actually kill the film, it would have worked much better if it had. I read some reviews, and it seemed like I felt that those who had been in the armed forces did not like it and everyone else liked it. I've never been in power and I'm with them. It's stupid, the three stars are for cinema.
