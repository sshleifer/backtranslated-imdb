Disgusting and irritating. The screenwriter has no real understanding of human nature, but in turn collects clich√©s in a disjointed way. Character is not explored in depth. These are the dolls full of down in a plot she confesses openly that she needs a dramatic element, her mother's affair with her daughter's lover. <br /> <br /> Anne Reid offers great performance, despite having given her particular situations and lines, such as standing passively, to allow her angry daughter to take them in the eye . The script plays Darren (Daniel Craig) as Dr. Jekyll / Mr. Hyde, with no suggestion of what, except he swallows cocaine in front of the big stage. <br /> <br /> A mature writer could have done much more with this subject.
