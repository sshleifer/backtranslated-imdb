The trailers of this movie are of interest to me in order to guarantee the rental of the DVD. However, the resulting movie is absolutely terrible! Of course, this is not the worst movie ever made, or the worst movie this year, but it's kind of damn it! The main problem is that the movie does not know what it wants to be: comedy, adult drama, thriller, teen-porn? The story is interesting because it deals with brides traps for mail orders, but the movie is a mess. What begins like a little interesting comedy (a word I use in the most freely possible conditions), then goes completely in reverse and degenerates into a very dark and disgusting misogynist thriller. Nicole Kidman should know better and Ben Chaplin is wasted! Like Matthieu Kassovitz and Vincent Cassel, whom I can only assume he did for money. This is a bad movie in almost every aspect. It's not funny, it's almost so sexist that you could almost forgive Benny Hill for everything he did, and the dramatic elements are just ugly. A movie to be avoided if you do not have to see Kidman or Chaplin in each of their films!
