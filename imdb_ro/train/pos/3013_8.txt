The talented detective Mr. Philo Vance (William Powell) cancels his trip abroad to investigate a seemingly cut and dry suicide case he has reason to suspect it is really much more, a rather delicious crime! <br /> <br /> As far as crime murder films are concerned, it does not work better than this. People with suspicious characters, all connected to a dog show and all with good reason to kill the apparent suicide victim Archer Coe, it's really hard to figure this out or to wrap your head around her but boy, it is fascinating to see what is going on before us. Even cops, forensic physician and district prosecutor turn out to be colorful, career characters adding a level of realism unexpectedly penetrated into this process and amplifying their general "fun" factor. I especially enjoyed the comic strip involving the forensic (played by Etienne Girardot), which always seems to be rudely and early interrupted by the discovery of corpses or injured men during this time of operation. Detective Eugene Palette Sgt. Heath welcomes, often liked later, humorously at his expense, a critical commentary during Vance's investigation. I can not think of any valid criticism to give this movie, in fact, except perhaps it did not work out well. It does not stop the movie from being just a simple viewing. Watch and see if you can wrap your head around the mystery. Highly recommended try!
