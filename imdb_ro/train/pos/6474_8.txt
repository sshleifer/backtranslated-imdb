I was totally attracted and I could not wait for each episode. The act has brought to life how emotionally a person is missing in the family, along with the effects he would have on the closest. The only problem I had as a family was how quickly it was "explained" at the end. I could not hear clearly what was said, and we do not know what Gary did in the whole thing? Why did Kyle call him and why did he go with him? After investing in a five-hour series we felt cheated that only five minutes were held for the conclusion. I asked around and none of my friends who saw that it was any of the wisest. Very weird, but maybe we lost something crucial?
