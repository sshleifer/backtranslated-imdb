A Give this movie a 10/10 recording because it's worth a 10/10. Two of the best actors of their time - Walter Matthau & George Burns collaborate with Neil Simon and all the other actors in this movie + director Herbert Ross, and all this makes this adaptation come true. Sunshine Boys is one of the best movies in the '70s. I like the kind of humor in this movie, it just makes me laugh so much. I received this movie on VHS 3 days ago (yes, VHS because it was cheaper - just $ 3). I saw her as soon as I got home, but I had to see it again because I lost some parts for the first time. The second time I looked at her, she felt much better and I laughed a lot harder. I will definitely re-do this on DVD because I will see the special features. It's really funny how this happens. Two people work together as animators / actors / performers. They wake up well on stage, but they really ask outside the scene, they can not survive for another minute with each other, then after 15 years, you want to reunite them for a special TV. You can find this in this movie. Matthau & Burns were great in this movie. It's a shame they died. George Burns deserved the Oscar. He gave a comic performance. It was also 78 years when this film was shot. So far, he is the oldest actor to receive an academy award at an advanced age. Jessica Tandy breaks the record as the oldest actress. Richard Benjamin was also fantastic in this regard. He won the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor. It was worth the Golden Globe. Though many people may not agree with what I'm going to say, everyone in this movie gave a strong performance. This comedy is a classic instantly. I strongly recommend it. One more thing: Anyone who hates this movie is a "Putz"
