I think the movie was pretty good, it will add it to my "classic collection" all this time. I think I have seen other posters that have reminded some of those who have chosen it to be a movie yet. Perhaps some of the most esoteric points defy "logic," but many religious things accepted "on faith" fail to pass the smell test. If you accept any belief you subscribe to, you can certainly accept a movie. It's just me or someone else noticed that Aja-Yee Dagger is the same knife possessed Lamonte Cranston had so many problems getting control of "The Shadow." No mention of this in the trivia section for any of the films here (IMDB), but I would bet a dollar for a donut is the same thing.
