In Budapest, Margaret Sullavan (in the role of Klara Novak) earns the post of a clerk in a gift shop; there she bickers with colleague James Stewart (as Alfred Kralik). The two do not wake up at work because everyone fell in love with a friend with a pen. Ernst Lubitsch's view of these stars to the inevitable is, in a predictable way, satisfactory. Better is a sublot that involves the owner of the Frank Morgan shop (like Hugo Matuschek), who suspects that his wife has an affair. Hiring a private detective, Mr Morgan confirms that his 22-year-old wife has sex with one of his younger employees. Morgan, acting painfully, "She just did not want to get old with me", and the characters who support this film keep it.
