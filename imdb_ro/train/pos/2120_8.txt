James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play co-workers in a gift shop in Budapest who does not like it very much without knowing that they are really love friends who are not yet meeting. A very charming, romantic comedy, very played by the two loving stars and a very eager support distribution. The story is well written, and the movie has that romantic innocence (it does not know how to explain it) that today's films do not have. This can clearly be compared to the recent "You've received mail", and the original wins in any way. <br /> <br /> This is a mandatory viewing of each Christmas, I can not think of a better way to start a Christmas feel this gem.
