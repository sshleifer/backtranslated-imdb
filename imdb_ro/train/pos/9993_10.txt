The most hilarious and funny movie Brooks I've ever seen. I can watch and re-watch the band 100 times. I laugh at me and weep in moments. It's a very good and funny movie, and if you like Brooks - this is a must! In short - Brooks (billionaires) get on the streets as homeless for 30 days to win the entire poor district from his competitor. Reality bites, but ultimately - it's about the warm relationships between people ... We recommend with high!
