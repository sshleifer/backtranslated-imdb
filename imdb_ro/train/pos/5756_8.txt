The anarchy and supreme rule of iniquity in the Elk Hills Podcast Village. The elders of the city are deputizing the tough veteran of Vietnam, Aaron (a very robust performance hired by Kris Kristofferson) and some of his fellow veterinarians to clean up their place. The plan is sour when Aaron and his cruel friends decide to take over Elk Hills after he gets rid of all the bad things. It depends on Aaron's good brother Ben (played amiably by Jan-Michael Vincent) to stop them before things get too big. Writer / director George ("Miami Blues", "Gross Pointe Blank"), Armitage beats an amoral, cynical and subversive evil delight, exploiting contemporary Western winners: he utterly creates an abundant, no-nonsense tone, keeps rhythm vigorous and unwavering throughout, and stadiums abundant action scenes with considerable muscle aplomb (reviving explosive climax is particularly strong and agitated). Victoria Principal's main feature film is Ben Linda's fabulous friend, fabulous Bernadette Peters, as a poor saloon singer, Little Dee, Brad Dexter as mayorless mayor, David Doyle as a slim bank chairman Andrew Stevens, the companion of a favorable gas station, John Carpenter, directed by Charles Cyphers, as one of the veterans of Nam, Anthony Carbone as casino manager John Steadman as an old owner, Paul Gleason, shakedown bully and Dick Miller as a piano player without talent. Morale: Do not hire other people to do your dirty work. William Cronjager, Gerald Fried's shining cinematographer, blue, harmonious and blue, and abundant gross violence add to the general fun of this small, unjustly neglected dose.
