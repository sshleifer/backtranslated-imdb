Outside the household is a different world, and the family struggles to cross the line between fathers' authority and their hopes and dreams. The period is captured; Bakelite light passes, Georgian floor, picture rails, wall paper, short skirts, scary boys, Mini van, brilliant modern mangle .... Location is captured; A wind hit the rock rocky cliffs, local stone walls, community, freedom. But there is much more; Childhood, happiness, sensuality, pride, values, liberty, authority, rebellion, violence (in the deepest sense), love, struggle, puberty, naivety, morality, trust, sacrifice, horror, acceptance, revelation, comedy and parents are all there. (And in no special order!). This film is a rich expression of family tensions that are as relevant today as never before. The fact that some of them are not directly addressed is a testament to the attitudes of the day, but the fact that they are all here is a testament to the quality of the act, the story, and the direction. <br /> <br /> If there is something wrong about this movie, it is that all these deeply entrenched and wonderfully adopted tensions are removed a little too easily to the end. Maybe my lack of understanding - doom and gloom felt by many adolescents really disappears if they deal with it (**) - maybe the movie is trying to even send that message too - it's worth doing. is the movie trying to say? Kids: Parents were young, parents struggle, all make mistakes, everyone learns, things change, battle can end happy. Parents: Do not try too hard! Try to remember that your support is the key to their welfare. It sounds simplistic, is not it? Sometimes the movie feels like that, but then you see how much it is challenged and discovered. The film is classic. <br /> <br /> (**) - Not the problems themselves.
