I just saw this at the International Film Festival in Vancouver in 2003 and it was funny as a hell and a bit surrealist. It takes place in Toronto, where these two losers live in this building in the middle of a highway system. David Hewlett (PIN, CUBE, CYPHER) and Andrew Miller (CUBE) are just wonderful as the two losers who want the world to leave. The actor, dialogue and writing are very good, and the whole movie looks good for such a low-budget move. Director / writer Vincenzo Natali participated in this screening and seemed so smart and down-to-earth. This guy is so inventive with these wonderful stories that work so well in small budgets, put some Hollywood nonsense from budget to shame!
