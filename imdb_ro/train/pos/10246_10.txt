This movie must be my favorite of all time. He should not have a plot because his producers wanted people (Charlie Sheen, I think) to believe it was a true movie. It was an exercise in visual effects and did not move away when the action happens like any other movie. The films of these days now refer to sound effects, leaving images to be made of computers, making it easier to handle CGI blood. There are still filmmakers who still can not get fake blood to look like a real thing. There is no scene of rape, because it was not the purpose of the film. Have you seen the hills with your eyes? The scene of the rape was funny, not shocking. Although I'm sure there are some producers of porn movies GONZO who tried to get married pornically with horror. But since he probably sucks on movies, he probably could not shoot him. The film "Baise Moi" has a disturbing rape scene because actresses are actually porn stars and show everything even if the movie is completely failed. It's too bad that a movie can not be done without thinking about the monetary aspect of everyone, especially when it comes to an AO or NC-17 assessment. I'm sure Eli Roth has the talent / talent to make his home movie series much better, but he pushed too hard to get the R rating ... or at least I hope his movies have suffocated because of these limitations. <br /> <br /> Watch the traces of death or more than crushed pumpkins unless you want real watermark images (accident & crime scenes / film). Do not forget that this film was made in 1985. The fact that this film can still resist most of the fools of today says a lot about this movie. That would be like someone saying Super Mario Brothers 8bit sucks because the PS3 has better graphics.
