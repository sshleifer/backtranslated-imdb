A charming romantic comedy. The plot is a little too complicated - I tried to summarize it three times and I can not. Suffice it to say that it is worthwhile to see. The movie is fun, beautiful - the plot is totally unrealistic, but it works. Everyone in the movie is so cute and everything looks so great - it creates a sweet and romantic feeling through the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The act is great - Robert Downey Jr. and Cybill Shepherd are in top shape and enjoy every second of it. Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson are just fine, but fine. If you are a sucker for good, sweet sentimental movies (like me), grab him. Also, Downey looks great in underwear! Extra bonuses - the title song sung by Johnny Mathis and another great melody "After All" sung by Cher and Peter Cetera.
