I have seen all the films directed by Robert Redford and I appreciated his love for the American people and the earth. In the A rivers, through him, Redford displays the lyrical romance and visual splendor of Rocky Mountains in Montana, as if he were a 19th century landscape painter in the style of Thomas Moran or Albert Bierstadt. This film makes love with the vision and word of author Norman Maclean and the stunning opera by Phillippe Rousselot (Serpent's Kiss, Reigne Margot). Redford's distribution is perfect. Tom Skerritt is Rev. MacLean, a man whose education methods include fly fishing, as well as the Bible, Brenda Blythen, his mother and sons Craig Schaffer and Brad Pitt create a family whose interaction reflects the same problems faced by all growing teen sons, and late, young, complex. Both Schaffer and Pitt are totally credible as brothers who love fishing fly and each other will bind them forever. The relationships between men, fathers and sons, brothers and their women in the outside world are based on a river that runs through a whistle of stories that is missing in so many Hollywood films produced in recent years. <br /> <br /> What makes these special relationships is, however, Redford's focus on the language spoken in the dialogue. This is a writing script, beautiful to hear and unforgettable when coupled with the amazing rivers and mountains of Montana. Words and settings are equal to the performances of a distribution that rises to their material. While the idea of ​​fly fishing may seem a strange device to center a story, it's not so unlikely in Redford's directorial hands. Given the material, Redford's odor at a time and a simpler life deserve to come back again and again.
