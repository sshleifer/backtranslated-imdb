Pecker is another John Waters main film, made on a lesser mother than the series. Pecker's character has a hobby to take pictures of what he sees. It does not matter if it is dirty or shocking when taking pictures. Soon, he uses the pictures he has made and puts them in exposure to his work. Pecker lives in a semi-normal middle-class family. His father works at a drinking bar with a claw, but does not make enough money with a lesbian strip strip on the streets. His mother runs an espionage shop and loves to put on poor people. His older sister, Tina, works at a homosexual bar where the specialty is trade. His young boy, Little Chrissy, has a habit of eating sugar, sugar and nothing but sweet food. His grandmother, Memama, has a small statue of the Virgin Mary and plays her with the ventrilock. He also has 2 friends. Of his friends, Matt is a chronic killer, and his girlfriend, Shelley, runs a wash carpet as if he were a dictator. Soon, a New York tourist buys his photos and displays them at an art gallery. The image comes fame, but the images expose the unusual lifestyle of his friends and the simple family life. For an R-rated film, Pecker is sure he was younger than most of the previous Waters R films and even Flamingos Pink. Another 10 out of 10!
