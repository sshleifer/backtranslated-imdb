This movie is a great power. The NWH rap group, consisting of Ice Cold, Tasteful taste and Tone Def, follows their unique path to rap, tall and back to heights. Through troubles with women, ego, policemen and whites, this group reaches the top of the rap gangster world, as this film goes to the top of the mocumentaries. I know each favorite person is Toak Spinal Tap, for a very good reason, however I think if in the right mood, this movie is simply better. Laughter does not end even for someone who is not in the culture of rap. I'm a white guy who has no interest in rap music, culture or anything else associated with her, anyway I like this movie. Rusty Cundeif, who wrote the script, the songs and played in it, showed great potential and it's a shame I did not see it from Fear of a Black Hat. However, I've seen it once more than you've had and that's the fact that I recommend Fear of a Black Hat for quick laughter. Remember, "Do not shoot to see the whites ... of their eyes ... Do not shoot to see the white." FYM and enjoy the movie.
