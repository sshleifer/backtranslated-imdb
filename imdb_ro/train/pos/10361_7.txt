Once you've got your top of the floor in the consciousness that they ... somehow ... managed to put this together so quickly that it was released in the same year that the case is over, you will find that it is not bad at all. The plot is interesting and interesting, and the pace of movement is fast, it covers many situations and therefore often jumps quickly to the next after a line or two has been spoken. If this really is true is the act. The performances are excellent. Neill and Streep are impeccable. It's also great to hear so much Australians talking in a Hollywood movie, and even those who do not naturally come to try at least an accent. Cinematography and editing are pretty pretty, but they do not really go beyond standard things. The story of this film is convincing, and the fact that it's authentic makes everything cool. While I did not read the novel or did not hear about what happened outside of this image, I understand it is quite close to the truth. There is moderate content to language and disturbing content in this regard. It is sometimes a great yard drama. I recommend this to any of their fans. 7/10
