I really enjoyed this movie and I went back to see it twice more in a week. Detmers attracted the performance - it was like a hungry cat on prowl playing prey. She sneaks into anger and lust, taking a "too young" boyfriend, and crushing hundreds of chunks of her mother's fine, terrible mother's china on the floor. <br /> <br /> The film was full of beautiful touches. Maserati, the wardrobe, the flower boxes along the roofs. I especially enjoyed the ancient Greek class and the recitation of "Antigone". He had a sense of "The Story of O" - that is, where the people of the means engage in an unhindered sexual adventure. As she walks through the fantastic flat of bafta, she feels good - and why not, what does it mean to stop a "devil in the flesh"? The whole movie is a real treat!
