What are the chances of a helium balloon "Mermaid" traveling from Yuba City, Ca. (November 8, 1993) and landing 4 days later (on November 12) in MERMAID, Prince Edward Island, Canada. miles). This is a great movie. It's based on a true story. This film helps not only the children to face the losses, but also the elderly. I hope everyone will enjoy it! Rhonda
