I know, I know it's childish. But I like this kind of movie. A bird that has suffered many "tribulations" and has not yet lost faith in humanity and sense of humor. What's special about this movie is that the main character is Paulie - the parrot - and is not used as a momentum for a human actor. In addition, I like the story: Paulie says his lifestyle is clean at the point where he hit the ass. (By the way: Jay Mohr's voice sounds almost like Joe Pesci!). And Cheech Marin, of course, man is humor to me. Since I've seen "Up in Smoke," I appreciated my naive way of playing, making me a simple hilarious person. I can not help.
