This great little movie has all the elements that made Spaghetti West so exciting and fun: GREAT music (by one of the few if not the only female composer to work in the genre Nora Orlandi) (and very vicious for today! ), and BEAUTIFUL DECORS and sets (all in Almeria, Spain, of course). It also has a very good story, with a beautiful story of tragic love. The actors do wonderful things - with remarkable shows from Lawrence Dobkin and Rosalba Neri (the most important role for a West Spaghetti woman outside Cardinal in Leone's "Once in Time in the West" movie) . Without posting spoilers, let me just say that this movie contains one of the best tips of any movie I've ever seen!
