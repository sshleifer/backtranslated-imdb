I married a Japanese woman 14 years ago. We're still together. However, in the 1950s it would never have been that easy. Life in the army has been mocked by action, drama and comedy for years through this point. Minus to death. Mixed relationships have given him a new ground to cover them. Is today the old hat, but then ...? If you married an Asian, then you meant that you gave something or you were a freak. This has achieved both possibilities with the third. Maybe it's love? <br /> <br /> Brando has done his usual job. Garner did a better job than usual. It's good, but that showed how good it might be. Umecki-chan had a hello debut here, and while he thinks he has won his statue, it has not really spread. It was a role that no one else would have recognized would not have been abroad, and the new aspect was a drum. The real steal of the scene was Red Buttons. Red was the best thing in this movie. Bank on it. And the Japanese lifestyle was presented in an admirable light. A classic.
