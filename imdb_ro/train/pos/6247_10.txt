Trailers in this movie can show scenes of violence or non-mainstream sexuality, but these scenes are only rare fragments chosen to attract the audience. These are, of course, showing the main message of the film: People who are constantly beaten in their heads in their jobs and lives, using the power they can have elsewhere, to repress the others. And at the bottom of the chain of oppression, especially women. A film showing this as brutal as Hundstage is certainly hard to face, but it has to endure such a life, it is even tougher. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, the movie resembles Short Cuts, but it consists of documentary episodes, with people like your neighbor, who play exactly as they are. No shine, and most disturbing, hopeless. His documentary style makes the movie even more disturbing, because you realize that such people are there and there are many of them, although our society focuses on the beautiful exterior. Some porn industry has to do its business, domestic violence somewhere somewhere has to take place, somewhere hopes have to break. Of course I know such people. If you want to see a movie without funny scenes (some might think that a disabled woman who repeats the top ten supermarkets is fun, but this is really happening) and without melodrama, watch this movie. However, it will lose when you focus on the subtitles you are afraid because subtitles can not carry the accent.
