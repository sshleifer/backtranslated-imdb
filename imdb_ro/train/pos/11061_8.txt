We also lost very painful personal losses (twice), and this movie presents very well the lived reality of this experience, Life out of balance, nothing makes sense, well understood relatives, etc. <br /> <br /> It was nice to see Ally again. She is one of my favorite film actors all the time. I laughed and wept when the story unfolded. Big story and distribution. Very good!
