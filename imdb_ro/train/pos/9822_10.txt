I saw this movie for the first time when I was a high school student, and the film stayed through me for years. It is not about the soundtrack or cinema, or even dialogue and a bad attitude, it is about the educational purpose, and the message behind it is the most important. It's not a pity to have a baby when you're a teenager and still high school and it's not really a bad thing, but it's a problem. The tones of girls I knew they had children now and I think they have never seen this great movie and if they did, they did not get the message clearly behind them. It's about not taking chances when you're in a sexual relationship. Every girl can become pregnant the first time. It's not a myth. You do not necessarily lose your dreams, but you have to take a back seat for the future, because you have a child to think about first. This movie has a clear message behind it: I SAY NO!
