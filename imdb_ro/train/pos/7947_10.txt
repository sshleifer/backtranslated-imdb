I've watched this movie so many times through my baby's hood that even today I can resume the dialogue quite a bit. And when I look now, it makes me happy and laugh surprisingly. I think it's amazing how they managed to train the animals, especially the cat, to the extent that they can play the leading role of a feature film. However, seeing it now, unfortunately, I also noticed that it is not the masterpiece I once believed. But I prefer to remember how I felt when I was younger watching the VHS on my fist, which would put the image in yellow. And considering it is a children's movie, that's why I would definitely give it 10/10.
