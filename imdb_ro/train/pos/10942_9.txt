I would give a show of ten out of ten, if it were not the jokes. You are so sensitive that it is inappropriate! So fast to highlight the "racism" of the show and the jokes, yet it's just as quick to say sexy, ridiculous pigs like "good, spirit, some of these other shows make these jokes so much better because they have at least hot women ". So disgusting. Abortion of joke is great because, indeed, who takes serious abortion anyway? At least I'm not a * born son. I have heard that Reba McEntire and Sarah Silverman are collaborating to make a movie about the sisters who make a trip along the way. Talk about a movie of the year!
