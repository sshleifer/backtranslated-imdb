We found this movie to be very good in all areas. The actor was brilliant with all the characters, especially Ms. Stone and Morrissey. Tramell's character becomes smarter and more psychologically twisted a minute. The film is interesting, even though this film is more about the mind that plays among the main characters and how Catherine continues to write with new paths and breaths for her novels. The setting was also fabulous, and the whole atmosphere of the movie was that mysterious, thriller masterpiece. Go see this movie now, it's better than what it received from the audience, which was mistaken for some terrible comments about the movie (before it even starts) ..... You will not regret if you go to see this ...
