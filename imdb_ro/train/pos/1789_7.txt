While on her deathbed, Ann Lord ("Vanessa Redgrave") repeats the name "Harris," and recalls her day in the 50s when she was an aspiring singer and traveled from New York to be a prostitute to her rich girlfriend Lila Wittenborn (Mamie Gummer) in Newport. Ann Grant (Claire Danes) is greeted by Lila's alcoholic and lewd brother, Buddy (Hugh Dancy), in the seaside cottage Wittenborn, and tells her that her sister is in love with their friend and servant Harris Arden (Patrick Wilson) in war and graduated medicine. Later, the bride would confess her true feelings about Harris to Ann. However, when Ann meets Harris, she has a passion for him and have a short deal during a night while a tragedy happens to Buddy. Meanwhile, Ann's unhappy and unstable daughters, Nina Mars (Toni Collette) and their happy wife and mother Constance Haverford (Natasha Richardson) are worried about their mother and have some differences. "Evening" has one of the best female towers I've ever seen in a movie with magnificent performances. The likeness of the stunning Mamie Gummer with her mother Meryl Streep is stunning and has a performance that honors her mother's name. Locations, costumes, decor, cinema and soundtrack are also great. Unfortunately, the plot is confusing and I did not clearly understand the message of this movie. Why maternity is so important in the story? Constance appeared in Ann's and Harris' nightstand and he would be her father? Why did Ann and Harris not stay together if the guy really loved her as she confessed to the occasional New York meeting? What issues did Ann Lord solve after Lil Ross's visit? Was Buddy Wittenborn bisexual or his love for Harris was a fraternal love? Why did Nina Mars change her thoughts about maternity in the end? It seems that the screenwriters or the director have failed because they could not have meaning and fulfillment for the beautiful love story. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Ao Entardecer" (In Eventide)
