In 1955, five years after he was released, James Stewart and Anthony Mann finished six other films together, four of them Western. Their report was obvious from the outset, and what was intended as little more than a universal programmer has become both a cult and a classic. Buffs of the period will enjoy the fact that the top ten credits were more than well-known - and that does not include Ray Teal or Anthony Curtis, later to become Tony. Perhaps ten years later, the Western "psychological" was well-rooted, but in 1950 it was rare to throw Ahab mixed with Cain and Abel, not to say anything about solving many problems along the way, and full credit for all those interested. One to add to the DVD collection.
