I liked this movie! Chris Showerman did a great job! Not only is he an incredible actor but he is gorgeous with a great physique! He did a great job in delivering his lines, plus turned George better than Fraser. A great performance for its first important role! This movie is full of hilarious scenes that every child will love. My kids have watched this movie several times since I bought the DVD the day it left. In addition to the movie, the DVD extracts are as hilarious. Two fingers on this! I highly recommend it to everyone!
