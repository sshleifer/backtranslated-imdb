This can not be a memorable class, but it is an exciting story with an important theme that emphasizes the importance of literacy in modern society and the consequences of the career and the devastating life for any unfortunate person who does not have this vital skill. The story revolves around Iris, a widow who gets acquainted with a colleague hired at her factory, an illiterate cafeteria worker named Stanley. Iris discovers that Stanley can not read, and after losing her job, she gives her reading lessons at home in her kitchen. Of course, as they might have anticipated, the two, although initially perverse, are developing their feelings for each other ... Jane Fonda is competently interpreting Iris, a woman with her own problems, lack of jobs, two children teenagers (one pregnant), an unemployed sister, and her abusive husband. However, Robert DeNiro is, of course, brilliant in his enormous portrayal of intelligence and resource, but illiterate, Stanley, bringing dignity to the role of respect. They are not your young, typical young yuppie, as it is generally depicted in romance on the screen, but a regular working class, a middle-aged pair, who is struggling down the ground. I will not end but it is a wonderful, moving story and a personal look at the troubled problem of adult illiteracy, though from a fictional perspective.
