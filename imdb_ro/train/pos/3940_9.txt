This film was not only one of John Ford's personal favorites, but also directors named Sergei M. Eisenstein and Bertrand Tavernier among his admirers. Ironically, I just caught up with Criterion's recent 2-disc set, after losing some original language projections on Italian television many years ago and again a few times on Hollywood TV! <br /> <br /> The film marked the first of Ford's nine collaborations with Henry Fonda and is also an essential example of Ford's American vein. A very nice piece of work and a poetical pictorial piece of work, the sequences in the court room (and a possible revelation) in the second half still have one more place, apart from the fact that Donald Meek plays the role of actor prosecutor Donald Meek. <br /> Fonda is, of course, perfectly expressed as a sinister, inexperienced, but rigorous and humanist lawyer who was destined to become president; Fonda will continue to portray other fictional politicians on the film - especially in Franklin J. Schaffner's "Best Man" (1964) and Sidney Lumet's "FAIL-SAFE" (1964) - and now it's surprising to find out he was reluctant at the time of accepting Lincoln's role because, in his opinion, it was "as if we were playing God"! It is interesting to note here that Ford previously approached Abraham Lincoln (tangential) in The Prisoner of Shark Island (1936), a gorgeous but perhaps little-known jewel that fortunately has just been released as a special edition DVD by the UK's Criterion stand-in, Eureka's "Masters Of Cinema" label. In addition, I have two other films by Abraham Lincoln in my collection of DVDs that I have just watched and at the same time both were directed by DW Griffith - A NATION OF A NATION (1915) and ABRAHAM LINCOLN 1930) We have not just received a bunch of movies that we have not been watching so far, I would have liked to have a rotation based on my extremely satisfying viewing experience with YOUNG MR. Lincoln.
