UC 0079, the one-year war is almost over. A neutral colony of Part 6 was targeted by Cyclops, a Zeon working group. Their target, a new Gundam being built exclusively for Newtypes (supposedly built for Amuro Ray from the original Gundam saga) in. When Al Izuruha, a Zeon MS fan, encounters a Zaku after the fight broke out in the colony, he befriends pilot Benard "Bernie" Wiseman. The two become good friends, Al is treated as an honorary member of the Cyclops team. Through the show, Bernie acts as a father figure of Al (whose true father always works) and seems to be taken with Christina McKenzie Federation pilot, but ultimately has to meet ... in battle. Soon he finds out that war is not the child's play, and Bernie has to choose to make the final sacrifice to complete his mission. For just 6 episodes, the Gundam 0080 is a good show. Mobile costumes are extremely well designed, and animation can look dated, but it really shows emotions in characters. If you liked 0083, then check it out, or if you're new to the Gundam world, this is a good start to play. If you look at a show of drama and character development, this is the one for you, it focuses more on that battle of a mobile suit. I would love more of a drama than action. <br /> <br /> Mobile Suit Gundam 0080, War in your pocket. <br /> <br /> Sometimes you have to lose to win.
