Spoilere !!! This film is based on the concept of What? Of course, Mr. Destiny will be able to answer this question. The main character goes through a bad day, like many of us, and asks this question. Chaos Theory asserts that a butterfly in China could have an effect on somebody here from a chain reaction. The focus of this film is based on an event during a baseball game. This event sets in motion the destiny; Just like Ashton in the "butterfly effect," except Mr. Destiny, she uses comedy about drama. The results make a fresh, somewhat original film. If a person's philosophy agrees with the Butterfly Effect, Mr. Destiny will probably enjoy it. I give a 7 out of 10. Amazing because I saw the first half of this movie three times and finally I ended up on TBS.
