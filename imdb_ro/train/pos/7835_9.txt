I saw this movie last night at a special theater show in Nuremberg and it was superb. I have to admit that the original musical composition of the cello player and the percussion player / xylophone influenced the mood of the film, but the film itself also had the power to portray the tragic Nibelungen saga. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in silent films or Nibelungenlied, I recommend this movie. The costumes were fantastic and creative, the sets were opulent and exotic, and the role was dramatic and astounding (as is typical of the tragedy of the silent film). Unfortunately, I did not see the first part of this film duo that refers to Siegfried. The story of the second film begins after Siegfried's death, when Kremhild (Gudrun in the Norwegian versions of the story) begins to plan revenge against her brothers. I also watched this film in German; I am a native speaker of English and I have a basic German knowledge. Was it difficult to read the subtitles (what is it called in the silent films?) At first, because of the old style German style, so I advised that if you follow it in German, it assures you that you can differentiate "k's", "f's "and" s's "in the old script. :)
