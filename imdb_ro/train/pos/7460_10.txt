I think a lot of people have just written this as one of Tom Cruise's weird movies (Magnolia, Eyes Wide Shut), but Vanilla Sky is definitely his own film. Many people said it was weird; it was not. It was different and confusing, but not strange. Strange is Stanley Kubrick or Pauly Shore. Different is the Truman Show. Confused is the Matrix or the game. And, unlike Kubrick, the film has a conclusion. Everything makes sense - maybe not immediately, maybe even today, but it will make sense. Vanilla Sky is confused because David Aames (Tom Cruise) is confused. That's the point. There was the so-called "oddity" that turned the critics. If he bothered to "open [their] eyes" as the first Spanish film in 1997, he would have seen that. And if there's not enough reason to see it, go see for music. Cameron Crowe offers a wonderful soundtrack; uses it to set "feel" - that notorious element that many movies are missing. With songs such as "The Good Vibrations of Beach Boys" playing at the dramatic and emotional climax of the movie, he creates a feeling of inconceivability and yet amazingly "right". A wonderful movie, in his screenplay, in music, acting and pictures, Vanilla Sky is unfortunately a superficial film that critics make it look smart. Excellent: A +
