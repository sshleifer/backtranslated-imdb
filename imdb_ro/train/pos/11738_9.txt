ELVIRA, MISTRESS OF THE DARK (1988) directed by: James Signorelli, Cassandra Peterson, W. Morgan Sheppard, Daniel Greene and Edie McClurg. <br /> Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) stops from the television show and heads to the small Christian town of Fallwell, Massachusetts, to gather the heritage of her aunt hoping to make big money to open a show in Vegas. Unfortunately, for her, all she receives is an old creepy house, a poodle and a magic cookbook. While in Fallwell, Elvira tries to make money, take a life in adolescence, earn a heart of a seventeenth (Daniel Greene), avoid burning at the hand, and keep the cookbook from her creepy uncle (W. Morgan Sheppard) who intends to use the book to end the world. <br /> <br /> My thoughts: I love both Cassandra Peterson and the Elvira alter-ego. She is a very successful, beautiful and funny woman, and, like Elvira, she is just as morbid and hilarious as he does, not to mention having an amazing couple of blows. In this film, her charms are put into use. I liked the whole movie "fish in the water". You have Elvira with her black dress cut down with her big black hair and her enormous "twins," and she is in a Christian city where most girls do not even have the right to wear makeup. This also makes her love story with Bob (Daniel Greene) much more fun. <br /> <br /> Morgan Sheppard is as big as Elvira's uncle / anthem, Vincent, to steal the book to use it for harm. He has a lot of presence, but he still does not get in the way and steals scenes from Elvira. What really makes the film is not the plot but many jokes. Everything from fun jokes to horror spy is here and makes me laugh much more than anything from a MOVIE SCARY sequel. I've heard there are about 56 jokes in this movie and any Roger Corman B horror movie fan will love spoofing in this movie. If you like Elvira, you like this movie. Also check HILLS ELVIRA.
