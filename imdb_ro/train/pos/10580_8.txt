This fabulous film has to be seen knowing that millions of people have scratched 10 cents together to see it and forget about the bleak daily economic conditions during the 1930s. Remember, 10 cents bought a bread loaf then, so it was a wonderful luxury for many people. It is a testimony of how Hollywood has done its best to make the United States feel a little better about itself. You will notice that with the Hollywood studio system, many actors and actresses have been cast in similar films, James Cagney, William Powell, Ruby Keeler, Frank McHugh, Joan Blondell and Guy Kibbee. And then, the branches of the American Army have always been respected with enthusiasm and patriotism, as well as the use of the precision military march by the great choreographer Busby Berkeley at the end.
