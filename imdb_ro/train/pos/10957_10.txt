This show probably will not appeal to everyone. Sarah does what she wants; she does not ask for permission and does not apologize. This is a zombie sitcom, robot dinosaurs, flying machines and a team of men cheering on the wallet. The star of the show is not a hero, it is a spoiled, bigotted pervert. If you can not appreciate the humor it offers, the show is probably not for you. Everyone should offer at least this chance. It combines the comedy style of Sarah Silverman, Brian Posehn (comedy comedy), Jay Johnston (Steaua), Steve Agee (The State of Bobcat Goldthwait) and the creative energies of Rob Schrab and Dan Harmon (Heat Vision & Jack, Monster House) . It also presents the best talents of the growing online community, channel101.com. (If you are in this show, keep an eye on the "Appropriate Media Department" on vh1 in March, it will be drawn from the same talent pool.) Watch Sarah Silverman's show. This kind of thing is the future of entertainment.
