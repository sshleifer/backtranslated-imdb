I do not agree with "ctomvelu" about Jim Belushi's talent. I really like Belushi. Of course, I was skeptical when he first appeared on stage because I was a fan of his young brother John. But Jim has a charm on the screen that has gone a long way - and he's been developing over the years. Curly Sue is one of his previous movies - his weight is a giveaway is not true for most of us?) - and I love the movie. Yeah, it's exciting and exciting, so if you're in cars, explosions, and free sex, then you'd better get over it - it's a hot three-foot movie that's lost to each other. Do not get me wrong, it's all for the three keys mentioned above for a successful movie, but I like a nice and solid story like this. And although Belushi and Kelly Lynch provide excellent performance, the true star of this film is Alisan Porter - which is absolutely adorable. I do not know what happened to her career, but who's responsible for dropping the ball?) Should be shot. You could not ask for a better introduction to fame than this movie, and yet you have not heard anything from her ever since. Another sad story from Hollywood ...
