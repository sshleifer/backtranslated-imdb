This movie started with the incredible opening sequence that tricked me into a complete reversal of the perspective, so I was attracted to the moment the title appeared. The theme of this film is that everyone is acting, trying to reinvent themselves, but not in a complicated way, such as the common identity or suspicion, but in the way we try to make every trivial life, we find ourselves a little bit more interesting. Chicken ware scenes are spectacular. At one point, Jorgen (who owns the chicken farm) attends a laughing seminar where he is the worst student. His discomfort at this allows you to see the depth of his desire to change. The film made me wonder about the hidden mysteries behind the most ordinary people I see every day. There's not much plot here. Guessing the old man's secret is pretty easy, but the fascination is trying to guess what all the other characters will do when they figure it out. This movie appealed to me as well as Sideways, although the characters could not be any different.
