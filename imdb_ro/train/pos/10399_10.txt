This was a favorite of my childhood - I remember seeing her on TV and I felt it every time. Now that I grew up and I have a child of mine, I wanted to present it in this classic movie. I saw her on Friday and I liked it. During Abu's fight with the giant spider, my son's hand slipped and took my hand - he was really scared. - Will the spider beat, Poppa? Just look, you will see. He does not have a historical reference frame to talk about (eight years), so Baghdad under Haroun al-Raschid's nephew could be just as well Oz Ozma. I think he liked especially how much the heroes and disturbances were committed by the boy thief and not by the elder emperor. In fact, if you deconstruct the story of the movie, the king is the nephew of the thief, not the hero - which must be very satisfying for imaginative and adventurous young boys. <br /> <br /> It is certainly a period piece - I suspect that by the age of eleven or twelve, my son will find it "tortured" or any word that the next generation will use until then. The love story is just one-dimensional - as a cynical friend commented, "Why Ahmad loves the princess? Because the narrative asks." Abu's willingness to endanger (repeatedly) the lost-loving king over love is equally unlikely. But to look for such things, while accepting flying mechanics, fifty-foot geniuses and Ovid's Temple's eye would be tough in the extreme. The satisfaction of seeing the prophecy at the climax of the movie is extraordinary, just like Abu's last shot, which triumphed triumphantly on his magic (stolen) carpet, looking for "finally a fun and adventure."
