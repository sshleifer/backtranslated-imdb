SPOILER ALERT! This film, Zero Day, gives an interior to the life of two students, Andre and Calvin, who feel resentment and hatred for anyone and anything associated with that school. They go on a series of self-Think about "missions", all going up to the immense mission, which is zero Day. Days Zero Days are not specified until the end of the movie. The viewer knows his series and is hateful, but he is never quite sure until the end. Now we all know if the film is based on the Columbine massacre, the conclusion is quite obvious. And the end is no different than any other movie about the attack, they go and kill many of their college students in the end. I've seen a lot of movies on this attack, and this Far Away movie is my favorite and most respected. It gives the viewer and the interior a look at the life of these two teenagers who hate life and sincerely gives the viewer some information about the deal and a closing of the horrible event. <br /> <br /> Being only 7 when Events have evolved, I never knew the severity of the draws until my English class was attributed to an essay or story of a defining moment in our generation. Well, I knew everyone was going to choose the Twin Towers, but I wanted to be different, because of course the Twin Towers were tragic and very defining, but I did not think it was the right choice for me because it was not really no way about this, because we were only in the third grade and had no idea that would mean everything. But the blows have also left the effect. I remember the interviews, the sky's visions of the school and the wound and the terror in the eyes of thousands of people. This film is an impetuous, downward and easy masterpiece, and I would recognize it to anyone.
