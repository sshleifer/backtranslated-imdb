Tsui Hark's visual artist is in his vision in this movie. Unfortunately, the terrible action of Ekin Cheng and especially of Cecilia Cheung (I felt the need to strangle her while watching this is so bad :) made it difficult to look at moments. This film is a true breakthrough in the visual department. When I saw it for the first time, my jaw repeatedly escaped and I thought I had not seen anything remotely, but that's what I needed to do to fully render justice to the mythical world of historical kung-fu novels Chinese! Undoubtedly, this is one of the most beautiful historical kung-fu Chinese epics ever made. Unfortunately, Tsui Hark has not improved much in the writing department, and the story and dialogue are rather juvenile (apparently obsessed with the silly and too long picture of the bad guys did not help). To make it worse, this movie is very badly expressed. They have decided to use popular idols in Hong Kong as decisions, but unfortunately both Ekin Cheng and Cecilia Cheung are not particularly suited to historic kung-fu dramas because they lack the nobility and mystique that such characters it should set it up. Adam Cheng Siu-Chow and Brigitte Lin in the 1983 version are infinitely better. I wish Zhang Yi-Mou and Tsui Hark one day to unite and produce a film that has Tsui's visual artist, but with Zhang's maturity and storytelling ...
