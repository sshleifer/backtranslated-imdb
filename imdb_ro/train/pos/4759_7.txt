The little episode played mainly for laughter but with a suspense dollop. In a way, a Martian sneaked aboard a broken bus on his way to nowhere, but who is the passenger (talk about illegal immigrants!). From Jack Elam with wild eyes (with a wild eye) with sexy Jean Willes (if Martian, then say to open the borders!) With John Hoyt (most obviously suspected)), together with familiar faces John Archer and Barney Phillips (and a pleasant return by Bill Kendis as a bus driver). It makes half an hour very fun, even if the action is limited to a single set.
