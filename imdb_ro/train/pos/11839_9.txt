This movie was really fun. The soundtrack (Bian Adams) is simply beautiful and inspired. Even more impressive is Brian Adams, who makes all the songs in French. The score is also exalting and dramatic. The film is made up of a mixture of traditional animation, combined with computer-generated images. The result is really amazing. I watch this film at least once a week with our children and we never get tired anymore. The story is convincing and well-related. I do not understand anyone who would classify this movie to less than 7. Definitely a shepherd in my house.
