Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais have a solid success rate with regard to their television business is concerned. However, their film work was far more placid (2008 The Bank Job was good, last year, Across The Universe, certainly weak). Still Crazy, fortunately, is a solid success. It has a great story, great performance, lots of humor, fabulous music and, above all, a real heart. Enjoy the "moments," and this movie has one of them - it happens at the festival performance featuring a pearl ... Extremely enjoyable.
