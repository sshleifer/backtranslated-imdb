Looking at how the two brothers interact and nurture each other throughout the film makes me happy to live in the countryside just as in the movie. I have watched this movie many times and I have the book right beside my Bible. After watching the movie, I agree that this is one of the few movies that makes a book of justice. I recommend someone who has the chance to go to Montana to fish or be outdoors to do so. It is amazing. I can not think of anyone else who could play the role better than Brad Pitt. Be right and watch one of the best films in the modern movie era. We strongly recommend and as a guide for fishing excursions in both Montana and Wyoming, do not try to learn how to fly fish from film scenes, because although it looks good on the film you have no idea how much fishing practice and of skill like this actually takes. Thank you for listening Watch this movie if you want a long sad movie.
