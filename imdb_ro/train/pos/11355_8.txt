I was surprised at how fascinating this movie was. The performances were extremely good, especially by Rea as the compassionate detective. Despite a low budget, FX cinema show or fantasy room, Citizen X manages to overcome some of the most similar Hollywood movies just through. Say. THE. Story. True stories tend to end with a buzz rather than a bang, and this is the case here, but besides, this is a highly recommended detective thread.
