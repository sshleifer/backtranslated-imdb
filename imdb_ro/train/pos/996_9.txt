This movie surprised me. Some things were "cliche" and some technological elements remind me of "Enemy of the State" with Will Smith. But for the most part, it's really fun - a good combination with Jamie Foxx and comedian Mike Epps, and with the two villains Julio and Ramundo (who offer a comic relief). This is a movie you can watch again - says ... Wednesday night when there is nothing else. I gave him a value of 9 for entertainment.
