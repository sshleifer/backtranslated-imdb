I just bought the DVD and I have to say (after seeing Brazil and Fear An Unrest in Las Vegas) Terry does it again. Also, as a fan of Monty Python, Terry Gilliam's genre continues in this SF thriller, which Bruce Willis plays a wonderful role in James Cole and also (perhaps my favorite character) Brad Pitt who played Jeffrey Goines' madness. A must have for scifi fans, or a fan of any kind of film indeed, because it includes suspense, drama, action, etc. in any way. In the future, 1% of the world's population survives a disease destined to destroy race human, which is unleashed in the past by the "twelve monkeys army." James Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent in 1996 (when the virus was unleashed) to find out about the disease, so scientists of his time can find a cure. Before going on, James Cole lives in an underground society, and the animals reign over the world because of the disease that will kill her. anyway, when sent back in time, it is sent back in 1990, where it is sent to a psychic institution because of its communications to the people about the virus. During his stay he meets Jeffrey Goins (Brad Pitt), who later is responsible for erasing the human race. He also meets with his psychiatrist (Madelein Stowe), who eventually joins Bruce's team to save the world (as he sees fit in his communications), is sent back and forth from his time in the past and eventually sent in 1996 where he then asks questions on his own sense, but later crosses to reveal a final quarter of the film and then builds up to the shocking climax where he tries to stop the man carrying the virus (not really Brad Pitt) and is shot by the police while the killer is away.
