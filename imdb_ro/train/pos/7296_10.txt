There is no connection between Fortier and Profiler, but the fact that both are police series of violent crimes. The profile looks crisp, Fortier looks classic. The profiles are pretty simple. Fortier's plot is much more complicated ... Fortier looks more like the First Suspect, if we have to notice similarities ... The main character is weak and weird, but he has "clairvoyance." People like to compare, judge, evaluate. How about enjoying yourself? Also funny, people who write Fortier show American, but, on the other hand, arguing that they prefer the American series (!!!). Maybe it's language or spirit, but I think this series is more English than American. By the way, the actors are very good and funny. The act is not at all superficial ...
