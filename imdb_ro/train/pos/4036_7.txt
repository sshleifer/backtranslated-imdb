Good luck finding this movie to watch even - is not yet released on tape or DVD. I saw it at the beginning of the '70s, it was lucky enough to catch it through the American cinematic conservation efforts and still has some tangible moments that have stayed with me for thirty years. There is no reason to repeat rwint's correct comments here. As a director who came out immediately after the growing success of the five lightweight pieces, Jack N was able to make the best of his budget effort and certainly point to the wandering and meandering that might have recourse to a new cut. But it is also a memorable pictogram for its time: all the very intense collisions of college sport in the 1960s, student movements, sexual revolution, and more. <br /> <br /> Why do you see this movie? It was probably a pedestrian in some scenes: the male link in enemies after the game; Karen Black's Tepper scene in the car will catch you a little, but it's the first use of a word I've never seen before in the movie; and the occasional and unexpected use of nudity in general. There are probably others omitting. Look for a pleasant surprise for a young Cindy Williams in one of her first movies; a thin David Ogend Stiers; Mike Warren fresh from the blue UCLA uniform and ready for a dark blue TV; Robert Towne - actor; and a lot of people simply play themselves. Now: Any connection between the name Harry Gittes, Robert Towne, and a certain character in Chinatown and Two Jakes? <br /> <br /> She has a "7" based on Karen Black. You will see why.
