Gung Ho is one of those movies I've never tired of watching. Michael Keaton has always been a favorite of me, and he is absolutely hilarious in this movie. Stepping up the step is Gedde Watanabe. The two are working awesome together. Although this movie is a comedy, I like how Hunt (Keaton) and Kazihiro (Watanabe) are fighting in their roles as leaders of their respective groups. They both try so hard to keep their peace, and then they finally end up in a fight (which is hysterical to follow). First, both are on the floor. Then Hunt jumps into a chair. Kazihiro jumps on the desk. Hunt jumps on his desk with him. The fight flies from office to factory. I like that, after being separated from the workers, you can say that they both feel bad to let things be so removed. There is also a scene where you can see Hunt's influence on Kazihiro. He is at his house and his boss in Japan arrives and says he would like to visit a factory tomorrow: Kazihiro: Tomorrow is not a good day. Sakamoto: Why not? Kazihiro: The plant is blocked and we do not find the key. Tell me you can not imagine Michael Keaton saying something like this! I think I really like this movie because it's really funny and it also shows how people who are radically different can not only learn from each other but also become good friends.
