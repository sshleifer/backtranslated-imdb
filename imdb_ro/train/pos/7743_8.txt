I went to see this movie twice, a friend of mine went to see him at the liberation party, and he told me it was so great that I was expecting a lot of the movie, Enjoy because I did not follow him in a neutral position. The second time I knew what to expect and I liked it more than the first time. After the second time, I felt so willing to have a party. I loved music is wonderful. If Tom Barman improves his talent as a director, he will be a director where everyone talks. If you manage to distribute this film as your first one, you have to be talented. The actor is made by some great Belgian celebrities (Dirk roofthooft) and a bunch of talent like Titus De Voogdt. <br /> <br />
