An amazing way to send to Romeo and Juliet. Do not hesitate, except to have a good time and enjoy this. A talented group of comic actors set off and had a riot in this lightweight vehicle. The wrong comments were due to a snobber about Shakespeare's treatments. Some people feel that the whole movie has to be "important" --- If you share these views, do not bother. The credits read Angeline Jolie's introduction, which is not nearly true, but she is amazingly beautiful as the Juliet character and, as always, her act is wonderful - and, given her age at that time, the dialect they are pretty good. Recovering this classic story with feudal Italian families in New York's catering sector results in great fun. See it in the right mind plan and you will laugh out loud.
