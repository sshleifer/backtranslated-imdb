I could not agree less with the evaluation of this film and I think this is a sample of how short the minds are most viewers around the world. Do you really think that Cinema was a kind of art before some tycoons try to just entertain? This movie is not fun, at least not so easy to entertain you in movies like Titanic or Gladiator. It has style, it is different, it is shocking ... That's why many of you hated it so much: because you do not try to be pleasant. It's just a story, a very strange thing I admit, but, after all, just a strange story. It's not a great story, not even a great movie, but I think it deserves a 7-star rating only for the courage of the author and the director to make a story that is not made to thank the public, selling billions of children and makes larger, even richer studios. This film is, for me, a European artistic film made in the US, and everyone involved in doing it deserves respect. Either for courage or for the only sense of humor.
