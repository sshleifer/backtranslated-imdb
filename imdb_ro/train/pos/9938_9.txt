I bought the DVD "Es war einmal das Leben" (German) / "Once in a while ... Life" (English) for bilingual children, because everyone loved "Es war einmal der Mensch" Once in a while "The man" (in English) (our parents saw him as children) and even surpassed the great expectations. The series is very well made, does not show its age, and our children from different ages want it At the same time, they learn things that parents do not know in the end. The series covers everything that has to do with the human body in organs, all senses, blood, infection, antibodies, and more in episodes animated 20-25 minutes. Subjects that some people find "sensitive", such as digestion and reproduction, are covered in a tasteful, discreet and child-friendly manner (the breeding episode begins to cover mainly where the child starts to grow), while in that (as a typical) informative and fun. Children are usually fascinated by the way their bodies work and by episodes they understand this in the context of their environment. The format of the episodes switches between the outside world (a family with 2 children) and the inside of the body. For example, in the infection-covering episode, the boy accidentally cuts, and the wound gets infected, and the episode covers how the body reacts to it. Similarly, episodes of senses, e.g. hearing what is happening inside the body in the context of the outside world, and the episode of breathing and circulating oxygen in the blood covers the complete life cycle including (short) where the oxygen (plants) originates. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best programs for kids ever - I would say you have to see for every family with children!
