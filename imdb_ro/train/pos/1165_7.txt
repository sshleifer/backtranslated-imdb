As another IMDB commentator noticed, this movie starts slowly, but it gets better as it goes on. Yes, it is released by Roger Corman, and yes, it goes over some of the same themed themes as the much larger budget predecessors such as FACE ATTRACTION and POISON IVY. However, juxtaposing her wife's career as a blues singer who opposes the loneliness of her husband's meeting and her almost Freudian need to fill the emotional and physical "gap" or "hole" while she is away, along with the smart use of the effects and fine set-ups. Using a very small number of locations and characters, and the use of water in almost every scene, both as a metaphoric cleansing and drowning symbol across the whole, this film, though clearly suffering from a tiny budget, reminds me, in many respects, a more recent scenario, namely the French film "SWIMMING POOL", which at least seems to me to have freely borrowed some useful ideas from "UP against AMANDA". With a smaller set of instruments, UP UP against AMANDA maintains its suspense with a rudimentary, fatal vision to surrender occasional temptations, but it does or even better than other films of that kind. The overthrow of Amanda's step-father abuse in the past (again, very freudian) is also very unique in this genre and interesting. I agree with other viewers about the unexpected and sympathetic reaction to Amanda's situation, this aspect of the story provokes. The distribution is excellent, I think. <br /> <br />
