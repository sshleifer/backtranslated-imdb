Life Stinks (1991) was a step further from Mel Brooks' other productions. He plays the role of a rich man who makes a mad bet with his "friends". Brooks says he can live like a homeless man for a month. His shocked and amused friends accept this unusual bet. During his "stay" in Bowery, he meets a bunch of homeless people, one of them gets their fantasy (Lesley-Ann Warren). They are hitting their friendship while teaching them many tricks they have learned while living on the street. Maybe Mr. Brooks survive on his own without the luxury of being richly dirty? Will this unorthodox bet win? Who are his real friends? Find out when you look at LIFE STINKS to find out! This movie was unkindly stunned. Sure it's not a classic like its previous movies, but it's still nice. I liked the way Mel Brooks paid tribute to Charles Chaplin in this film. If you watched Chaplin's written films, then you'll get humor. Recommended for Mel Brooks fans.
