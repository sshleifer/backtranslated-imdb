As a popular sport, many people enjoyed surfing. Immediately after I watched the documentary, I realized how dangerous it might be. In fact, surfers are afraid of big waves. Even someone was killed by her. But they continued to sail and enjoy themselves. Only brave people can do it. According to surfers, we can clearly know what they felt when the great wave came to them. You have to adjust to the maximum and avoid direct strike from the great wave. When you win it, it will surely bring you great satisfaction. Amazing cinema can not be overlooked. This is an absolutely visual pleasure. An excellent sports documentary. 8/10
