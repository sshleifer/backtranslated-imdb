Yeah sure. Sammo Hung has already played the lead role in "Zu Warrios of the Magic Mountain" since 1983. Now, 2001, he's doing it again with Zu Warriors. But this time, he is finally right. Rarely meet him in wuxia, more often in Eastern classics or murder. But this role simply fits it! The old Chinese legend about mountain zu is often not represented in films (as far as I know about the films translated westwards). Although the legend contains a lot of interesting stories and possibilities. Straight said: you have not seen a story yet in a modern movie! And that's what it does so well! And wow: all the colors plus the enormous depth story, directed to the heart, makes you ride for this movie in a moment. The first time I looked at her, I had to look at it instantly, and I did. OK, I did not understand everything for the first time. But that's just better! You know, you did not understand everything, because there is so much spice in it! It is therefore a pleasure for a self to look at it again and again. And yes, it becomes deeper and deeper in your heart, the more you look at it. Summary: A love story, characters you really cry with: a movie you never look at! - Publishers note: Well, I think I have to look right now again: D
