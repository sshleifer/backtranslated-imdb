This film resembles Will Will of the State with Will Smith and Gene Hackman in many ways, because we have an innocent man (black) pursued by the "government" with all the modern technology known to man. Usually, when the story is copied, the result is a disaster. This is not the case here. Of course I like everything David Morse does, so maybe my comments are not correct, but there were more good things about this movie. The main baddy played by Doug Hutchison was brilliant, and the story went out with great extraordinary talents such as David Paymer and Robert Pastorelli. Our hero, Alvin Sanders (played by Jamie Foxx), has irritated most of the party. He is so far from his place, cracking the bad jokes, evoking no sympathy from the audience. Or not to start, strange is that it grows about you (and its followers as well!). I did not expect too much when I hired him, but he was surprised by a good, action-packed action movie with comedy bits. 7/10
