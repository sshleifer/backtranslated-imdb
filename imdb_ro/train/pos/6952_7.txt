Jenny immediately falls in love with him, has sex and reveals his true identity with him, telling him he is the super-hero of G-Girl. After meeting his colleague and girlfriend Hannah Lewis (Anna Faris), Jenny becomes jealous, controlled and manipulating, and Matt follows the advice of his best friend, Vaughn Haige (Rainn Wilson), and escapes her by inducing her heart.

However, archenemy by G-Girl and Jenny's former high school lover, Professor Bedlam (Eddie Izzard), suggests Matt to get Jenny to dismantle his superpowers. "My Super Ex-Girlfriend" is delightfully stupid and funny. This romantic-adventure comedy has many hilarious moments and is very fun. Luke Wilson is great in the role of an idiot, and Anna Farris is extremely sexy as usual, and Uma Thurman is great in the role of a disturbed neurotic superhero that reminds Glenn Close in "Fatal Attraction," or Evelyn Draper in " Play Misty For Me.
