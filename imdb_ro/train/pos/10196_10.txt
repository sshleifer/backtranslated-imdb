Kudos to Cesar Montano to revive Cebuano! Panaghoy sa Suba is very good - it has drama, action, romance and scene that will make you laugh. While the story is not original (a triangle of love - or a love of four corners, Japanese occupation, rebellion, American as a lord), its presentation is cool, especially because it uses the original language - bisaya for the Philippine, nipongo for Japanese and English for American. <br /> <br /> This movie will be one of Pinoy's best movies this year. <br /> <br /> Go look at this!
