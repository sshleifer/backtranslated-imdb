Many reviews explain in detail the story and the characters in the "Opening Night", so I will not do that. I just want to add my comment that I think the movie is a wonderful affirmation of life. At first Myrtle Gordon recalls how "easy" he was to act when he was 17 years old when he had youth and energy and felt he knew the truth. Experience has left her emotionally fragile, wondering what it was for her, and indeed whether she can continue to live. A tragic accident triggers a personal crisis that almost overwhelms her. Almost - but not really. In the eleventh hour, she rediscovers the power of her art and reaffirms ("I will bury this bastard," says actor Maurice when she goes on stage). It seems almost sadistic when Myrtle's director prevents people from helping her when she is hopelessly drunk for her first performance. He knows, however, that he must have the courage to do it alone if he is going to do it. Some critics wondered if this triumph is just a temporary break on Myrtle's descending path. I think this is really the "opening night" - it opens as a flower to new possibilities of life and action, sees a way to go. It's moving a lot. The Rowlands gene is superb. The movie is superb. Thank you, Mr. Cassavetes, wherever you are.
