Masayuki Suo, who directed this wonderful movie, has a role to play. After the fancy dance "Fancy Dance" and the classic comedy (in Japan, anyway) college-sumo "Shiko Funjatta", Suo followed his own huge steps with a smashing success. The story is engaged. Both laugh many times (Naoto Takenaka is hilarious as it is in the previous two movies of Suo) and is really the root for the characters. But for me, the big bonus is the look of this film that gives the spectator in Japanese society - real life in Japan. Suo has a talent to show real-life activities with a fun atmosphere. The result is a movie that will attract, laugh, make you think and entertain and give you a perspective on today's Japan. Also, look for the main 8 actors from Shiko Funjatta, all of which come again in various roles, from supporting the characters (Takenaka) to the short (many) shorts.
