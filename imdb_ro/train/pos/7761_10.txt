*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERI *** Released in 1956 and considered quite shy at the time, Douglas Sirk's melody is a wonderful thing. The meeting is about going to a Texas Texas extreme dysfunctional family that includes the big brother Kyle, who is insecure, weak, wounded and very alcoholic, played by Robert Stack in a very emotional and vulgar performance, and his sister sister Marylee starred in Dorothy Malone. Mrs. Malone's performance is transmitted through her eyes, which she uses to show her emotions, which consist mostly of lust for Rock Hudson and jealousy (for Lauren Bacall). Malone is the only actress I've ever seen in the first-eye movies in the room. Now do not misunderstand me, her performance at least is an absolute hohot and one of the most important jobs in the '50s. But it's also terrible because, as pleasing and appealing as Malone, she is not a very good actress and she is not capable of subtle or shadowy. Her performance is a note. She gets to make a bad Mambo and in a very big fit, like a father in love played by Robert Keith, always good, falls to death, climbing a ladder, Sirk mixes it with a nearly Malone madman who makes an orgasmic dance when undress. Stack (who should have won an Oscar) and Malone (who won the prize, but should not have) are the real viewers of the film, those who have established all the hysteria, both sexually and in motion. The "true stars" of the film, Hudson & Bacall, are blurred in gray and brown, which are the colors they are mostly outfitted. Hudson, who was a better actor, then given credit for playing childhood and Stack's best friend, I love Malone's interest that sighs and grumbles over Rock for most of the movie. But Hudson does not want any part of it, and in return he is in love with Bacall who is married to Stack. No one is very happy and no one is happy for a very long time. Stack-Bacall marriage collapses a long time after a year, and Stack is drunk pretty much because he thinks he's sterile and can not give Bacall a child to prove he's a man. Sirk, who was a very clever man and had a long and fascinating career in both films and theater in Germany, ended his Hollywood career in the mid-1950s with a series of "intense "or melodies. Although adapted mainly from source material or medicine, Sirk's hands became masterpieces of the genre. Sirk had a wonderful sense of color and design that he brought to play in these films, filling the wide screen spaces with characters who played emotional life among strange color combinations and enlightenment, believing shadows and a lot reflections in the mirror. In the "written" characters are always peeking out of the windows, listening to the doors or hidden around. So, after a lot of violence, an accidental murder, a spontaneous abortion, and more, Sirk ends the movie with a final and stunning scene of a reborn Malone and reformatted in a customized suit, seated at an office that found a miniature oil tanker.
