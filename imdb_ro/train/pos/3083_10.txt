This is worth 12 out of 10. An absolutely invigorating show with real characters and real stories. This show has to come back, I've seen each episode and this is real quality. The exhibition focuses on a few New York yesterday, playing around the concept of the six degrees of separation and intelligently intertwining their lives. Bridget Moynahan and Jay Hernandez are amazing, as do the adorable Caseman. The scenery is amazing and the cabinets are refined. We need more shows like this, which makes viewers feel like they are intelligent, not mindless. If he never returns, six degrees will be missed.
