FORBIDDEN PLANET is the best SF movie in the golden age of SF cinema and what makes it a great movie is its wonder. As soon as the spaceship lands the public - through the crew of the human crew - it travels through an intelligent and sometimes terrifying adventure. We meet unforgettable Robbie, the mysterious Dr. Morbuis, his beautiful and innocent Altair, and we learn about the former inhabitants of the planet - The Krell who died overnight. Or did they do it? <br /> <br /> You can say that the planet is clearly filmed in a film studio with painted backgrounds, but that adds to a sense of threat to the claustraphobia felt by the electronic music of Bebe and Louis Barron adds the atmosphere even more <br /> <br /> I am shocked that this film is not in the top 250 IMDB movies.
