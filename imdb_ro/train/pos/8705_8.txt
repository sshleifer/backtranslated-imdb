Despite the title "The Sword Bearer" and DVD cover (The Sword Bearer's action / hero), this is not a superhero movie. Sword Carrier, who is cursed with a retractable sword in his forearm. You're bad, but no, that's real life. If you had this power as a child, you can control it when, say, a crazy man is facing or when your mother's boyfriend beats her. And if you do not control her, how are you doing with being a killer twice at the age of 12? This is essential if Sasha is when we meet. Wandering miserably after another killing (just like a Bout de Souffl√©). Then he meets Katya and the couple falls in love instantly, giving Sasha a real reason to live and try to change his ways. However, his past still follows him, in the form of two police officers. This is basically the story and basically there is no action on the screen, although a lot is suggested. <br /> <br /> I really like this movie. Unlike many movies from the Hollywood superhero, we have a very small story, there is no bad guy (if you do not count the sword carrier), there is a lot of heart and a good character development. <br /> <br /> It is worth checking if you can find it.
