**** Excellent <br /> <br /> *** Good <br /> <br /> * Slab <br /> <br /> 'Go ahead, do my day!' <br /> <br /> The fourth image of the series is directed by Eastwood himself (who was rumored to have directed most of the Magnum Force) and brings back the violent society of the first two films. However, the film still has no impact and credibility. This movie was released in the early 1980s, in the time of the Queen and the young Republican. The premise of a raped woman who has avenged her violator does not appeal to this time. This plot would have been better for Enforcer, which would have made it a good movie. What a sudden impact was a plot like Wall Street, but with Dirty Harry in the middle. <br /> <br /> RATING: 3 STARS
