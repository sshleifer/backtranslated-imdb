I really liked this documentary about Kenny and Spencer's attempt to play "The Dawn". It was a wonderful look at how aliens are trying to get inside to make it big. <br /> <br /> The story was put together and organized in an exciting way that made the movie run smoothly. It certainly deserves a watch. My only complaint is that they did not seem closed. Perhaps this is part of this point. We are expecting, but in reality it is not what happened (or usually happens). The film is also a great way to see Kenny and Spencer's personality outside their Canadian television show. You can see a little of what's coming. <br /> <br /> I look forward to seeing The Chase Papal.
