Wow ... what ... a whirlwind of wind. The 30's are a decade, with a lot of movies of any kind I can imagine, especially during the early talk stage. There were movies that were painfully static and dull, like "Dracula" with Bella Lugosi, and there were those that did not give her a rest, sometimes in a good way and sometimes not. This is one of the films that do not stop for a minute, and that's both a miracle and a sin. Lloyd Bacon, who also directed "42nd Street," must have been the king of Musicals since the Era of Depression, and was probably excited about the possibilities of sound to the world of cinema because he filled this image with her. There must be a minute or two without music or someone to talk. He's completely crazy! I thought the movie was worth a 5 (or a top 6) because the pacing was very weak because it was crazy for a while and sometimes I did not know what was happening and what to think. The characters seemed to run in the places where they were, talking about things that did not interest me and probably no one else. I thought I'd be rewarded with a little headache. I noticed that Lloyd Bacon also played the role of female in "42nd Street", Ruby Keeler, and "42nd Street" was a movie whose end was the best part of it. And you know what? The same thing happened as the "Footlight Parade"! The end is absolutely incredible! It has become, with my hands down, the most impressive music I've ever seen. The final part shows us some musical numbers, and these are, believe me, something that makes the rest of the movie worthwhile. The numbers are impeccable! There are three big bits, and the most impressive is certainly the second one. Suddenly, the screen was filled with wonderful and inventive work of the camera, beautiful people and simple entertainment that made me forget what little pain.
