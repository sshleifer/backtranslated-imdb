Butch, peace? Obvious. After the violent start of Spike, Tom and Jerry, who were spinning each other, Butch stops and wants to know why. It's a good question. "Cats can join the dogs, do not they?" He asks Tom, who nods his head. "Mice can meet cats, do not they?" Jerry nods "no," and then he sees it is not the right answer. They come in and Butch is drafting a "Peace Treaty" (complete with professional artwork!). Most of the others, and most of the cartoon, are the three who are extremely cute with each other. What a reviving rhythm change. It seemed fun to me to look. I can have one million of these cartoons in which every one of them is beating each other. Anyway, you knew peace would not last. A great deal of steaks give rise to the death of the "peace treaty," but on the way it was a nice change, and yet it was the usual humor of Tom & Jerry.
