Anna Christie (1931) In its own terms, this version of Garbo's Anna Christie, shot a year later in German with a whole new piece, is just toned and refined enough to work better than English ( both are American productions MGM). Garbo is whether something more commanding (or more beautiful as a presence on screen) and its action is more limited. And she looks frankly more easily, perhaps for several reasons, but we can speculate that she does not make her first story, so she was quickly adjusted. Without always matching a movie with another, Anna Christie is still the same O'Neill game with too many words. His themes about a woman who wants love without losing her independence are here, but anyway she comes as an old fashioned way. There are a few missing scenes - the Coney Island section is short and not as good - but it's generally a direct echo of the first movie. The director, Jacques Feyder (Belgian-French), simply repeats what has already been done, which I suppose must be a frustrating experience. It's interesting to see both movies successively because they are locked exactly the same way (not only sets but also pictures are all the same). There is an occasional high scene from the previous movie - part of the storm, understandable, but also a short scene in which Marie Dressler (English version) walks with her boyfriend on a plank over a canal, drunk how it can be. But they are just silhouettes, and when the next scene shows their faces, we see the German actors taking their parts. There is no Dressler replacement, certainly, but for me the German father is more credible and honest in his performance. Obviously, the themes - immigration, frightening parents, daughters returning to prostitution and the misfortunes of finding true love - have strong currents, especially with European wires (Garbo, properly playing a Swedish woman).
