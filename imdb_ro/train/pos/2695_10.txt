What keeps us - or at least what the writer felt we wanted to stick to at one point, is our desire to know if Martinaud did the dirty work. Without so much damage, of course, there is a red herring and a twist. But then we discover that this is the story of Martinaud's imperfections and his difficulty in coping. When revelation comes - we begin to feel it and to love it because as the story progresses, we are made to believe that it is the sick, perverted pedophile that we are prone to have in mind. One of the things he has to deal with is the gap between him and his wife, even if they live on the same roof. These issues, of course, gave them their names in the shocking end of the film. This movie demands your patience and has certainly tried those tense teenagers who are sitting behind. They were obvious heckling because they are not partial to the "central location" films. Although there is a little trip, when we get into the woods and the beach. And we realize that Gallien is not as intelligent as we are made to believe he is. The Inquisitor is 5/5
