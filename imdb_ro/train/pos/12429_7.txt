David Duchovny plays the lead role in this film. Now, a lot of people, to the fact that they would not even bother to follow it. Very unjust to say at least. David made his name on the x files and is a decent actor. Doctor Eugene Sands (Duchovny) is a drug addict who has been hit by malpractice. With a very big accident, he becomes a private physician for millionaire killer Raymond Blossom. However, the FBI has an interest in using Eugene to defeat Blossom. Angelina Jolie is expressed in the role of supporting the clear-gangsters moll.She puts it in solid performance. Timothy Hutton playing Blossom is gorgeous and deeply immersed in his character. Duchovny himself is not as bad as many people would believe and eventually assess his credible performances. The familiar monotone tone and straight face is present, but dosen't detract too much from the film
