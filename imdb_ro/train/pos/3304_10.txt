This film is one of the few Indian movies that will never disappear with time, nor will it make its mandatory appeal to diminish even if Indian cinema turns into the abyss of artificial culture of pop culture to enhance PT in a cinematic style. The cinema talks about Josef Werching's excellent skills, which emphasizes the monumental and cinematic effect on the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> An excellent cinema, when each scene had to be cut several times and resumed before finishing it, while meticulous attention was paid to crafting and editing scenes. Some of her lively scenes are filled with sublime emotional intensity, such as when Meena Kumari refuses to say "YES" as an approval for Nikah (Bond Marriage) and climbs up the hill while running berserk into traumatic frenzy. At the moment, Raj Kumar follows it and a strong wind blows Kumari's veil and Kumar's legs ........ Kamal Amrohi will always be remembered with words gold in the annals of the history of Indian cinemas because they have tried to complete this film in a record 12-year period. She had to shoot some vital songs without Meena being close because Meena Kumari, the lady in the lead role, was ill and struggled for her life in early 1971.
