I myself and my groovadelici friends for 20 years can not get enough of this Parker Posey wonderful CLASSIC! I tried renting this movie on DVD, but I do not seem to find it - too bad, because I'm sure the features would be "extra special"! :) We highly recommend this flickerino uber-cool comedy for a meeting, or even just a comfortable home alone! This would also be the type of movie to watch with your cat, or even throw a party-based party such as a Party Girl party like the movie Parker Posey loves, huggable , shining at the end. Oh, and be looking for a captivating surprise and HILORIOUS that's over ... go away, The Sixth Sense, you've just been overtaken by a radder movie! Sorry, no offense, it just sounds like it is! Take it from an old amateur motion, the comedy is no better than "Party Girl" with Parker P! Feels! Yours, Ronald Marie MacDougall (alias DJ Cyber-Rap)
