It must have been only 11 when Mr. Peepers started. It was a vision for the whole family, I believe in the Sun. nights. The rehearsal was Rob opening his closet (he had to use a pointer or an indicator to guide the right place on another wardrobe and do other things, eventually hitting the place where his door opened) and taking the needles a new shirt at the beginning of an episode, would open a packet with a new red shirt, and for the rest of the show to find a feather after another that she missed when she unbuttoned her shirt, the time was all, and the pins laughed very much.) I remember an aunt who ran a Rio as Jack Benny and always wanted "Sonny" to say something scientifically. He would think and come up with a "semi-permeable membrane" or osmosis, which will make her say how bright it was. (he should have been there). Marion Lorne stole the show every time he was on the screen. Why they did not continue the POV series when he gave up Wally (he feared it was broadcast but until then it was too late) I will never know. I saw somewhere that the first TV wedding (the big one anyway) was Tiny Tim at the Carson show. Horsecocky. It was Rob and Nancy (I've ever had a bang for her) and I remember that she made the cover of the TV Guide and got the press in all the important papers and magazines. A trip to the Broadcasting Museum in NYC years ago was disappointing because they had very few episodes then and they would have gone now. I still remember wonderful and I would have liked to be a little older.
