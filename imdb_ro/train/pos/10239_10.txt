I do not agree with anyone who did not do this movie. <br /> <br /> I used to love this movie when I was little and still do it. It is sweet, fun and warmth your heart. And it proves that love and friendship can never be destroyed. <br /> <br /> And even if it did not have a big story, it was still excellent, I give a 10 and two fingers up. <br /> <br /> Oh yes and prove that your deepest dreams and dreams can become true. (Tear, tears) <br /> <br /> I like this movie personally if someone says she sucks than I will say 'Shame on you'. Because it was a lovely little movie and I'm glad that at least PEOPLE liked it.
