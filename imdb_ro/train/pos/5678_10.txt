We could still use the Black Adder. Imagine that Rowan Atkinson resumed the role of assistant to the prime minister played by the wonderful Hugh Laurie. Hugh is sensational as Prince George and Edmund as a brilliant officer. I like the episode Kenneth Connor sees as a British guest. Every time, Edmund says Macbeth. The two spirits make a little silly act to avoid evil spirits. These are the funniest things you will see. Of course, none of these brilliance and comic genius could be without Ben Elton and Richard Curtis, who are also behind films such as Love Actually, Blue Thin Line, Four Weddings and a Funeral. Black Adder is fun and almost too good for television. Humor can be clever, sexy and funny at some point. We hoped last night on Saturday evening that Hugh Laurie would pay homage to his foundation in British humor. If the SNL group did some research, they would know what Hugh Laurie ought to have had due to their scene.
