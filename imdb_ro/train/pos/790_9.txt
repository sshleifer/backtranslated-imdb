Kenny Doughty as Jed Willis is more sexy in this role than any other male porn star even though she keeps her pants. The film broke my heart, reminding me of the intensity of the great love of the explosive life. I do not think I can think of another movie, except perhaps Romeo and Juliet's Zeffirelli, which surprises that giddy joy so well. The other draw of the film is the very eccentric English characters who enjoy the vicarious scandal. In this sense, it's the same appeal as Midsomer Murder or a Miss Marple mystery without chaos. This is a great antidote to the immense popular horror currently in the US and any relationship between people of different ages.
