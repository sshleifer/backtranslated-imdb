I thought this movie was really done, Heath Leger was very convincing and his Irish accent was perfect. Orlando Bloom and Naomi Watts were also very good and credible. How true is what really happened, I have no idea, but it has shown why people sometimes become what they do. Perhaps those in authority have always been corrupted, and I find it interesting that over 30,000 have signed a petition for Ned Kelly not to be hanged, so maybe there was more truth in this movie than at the beginning of thinking? In many ways he reminded me of Cold Mountain, which was another good historical movie. I would generally recommend this movie and I'm a little embarrassed why she did not do better in cinemas.
