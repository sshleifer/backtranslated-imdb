*** Possible Spoilers *** I have recently seen this movie with my 11-year-old son and was delighted to see that he laughed at the right places and was delighted with the action sequences. Ron Ely is right as Doc. Cold, calm, almost always in control (and occasionally in the eye). What else can anyone ask for? I have never read a Savage book, so I do not know if she is faithful to the source, but I liked the light tone and the disturbance. Many people compared this movie to the Raiders of the Lost Ark, which I do not think is right. The budget gap is amazing (Raiders must have at least 10 times the budget). Doc Savage does not have the extensive work the Raiders have. The special effects are also at a minimum, but come to people, the story is a lot of fun and humor is right. Sousa music is appealing (love that theme song - Every time I see the movie, I end up bulging the theme of the day). The best way to approach this movie is just to enjoy RELAX. Highlights include the exciting opening sequence in which the five fabulous and the Dock drive the Indian sniper along the rooftops of New York and the very funny fight between Doc and Captain Seas. Not so good is also the villain who sleeps in a giant bed (indeed!). Generally, a great movie to watch a rainy day. Give me 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Doc Savage, Doc Savage ... thank you he is here!
