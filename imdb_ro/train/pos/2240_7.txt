My daring love of Italian actress Lucianna Paluzzi, who helped me to start my puberty with the Thunderball show in 1965, led me to some rather unusual places. In this case, this British curiosity of 1959, "Carlton-Browne of F.O.", portrays Lucianna in one of his previous roles. She plays a princess in this respect, although the picture is actually a showcase for the talents of Terry-Thomas and Peter Sellers, both of whom have certainly been growing at this moment. In this cute, often very funny film, we find out about the nation of Gaillardia on the island of Madeira, which was a British colony until 1916 and then forgotten universally. Forty-three years later, however, it becomes the focus of international attention and international espionage when valuable cobalt deposits are discovered, and the Majesty sends the Carlton-Browne brothel from the Foreign Ministry to take responsibility. Terry-Thomas hides this beautiful part, as do Sellers in his role as Prime Minister Amphibulos in the small country. (This was Sellers' second film of 1959, referring to a small country fitting to intelligence with the world, the other being the "Mouse that revolted.") Ian Bannen almost steals the show here as the suave king of Gaillardia and my little girl Lucianna as appealing as in her minor role. The film has a very dry humor, although there are some belly laughs (reception at the Gaillardian airport, for example, and especially the Gaillardian style parade in May). And the prime minister of the vendors, with his broken English drops and seemingly perpetual, is another memorable character in the pantheon of this great actor. Despite the occasional situation or the two brittle stumps that are hard to understand, we found this image as a modest winning and well-presented entertainment on this Bay Anchor DVD.
