Trudy Lintz (Rene Russo) was a very lucky lady many years ago. She was the wife of a rich doctor and she had a lot of extra-curricular money. Her passion was animals, and she dedicated herself to offering a sanctuary for the blond on her property grounds. Trudy also raised two chimps in her home to be more like children. They dressed in clothes and had many facilities. One day she finds an abandoned gorilla. Knowing nothing about big monkeys, she is based on her husband's medical abilities and expert advice to save gorilla life. Once she got out of danger, Trudy decides she will pick up her gorilla as one of her children. This has worked well for years and Buddy, the gorilla, is truly a remarkably smart addition to her home. But Buddy is also a gorilla, and his power and curiosity are enormous. Will Trudy keep Buddy under control? For those who love animals, Buddy is a film to be seen. Based on a true story, Trudy and her monkey develop a relationship that is unique in the annals of animal history and tradition. Of course, Buddy is not a real gorilla, but a mechanical gorilla in the movie, but it is very close to seeming totally real. Russo gives a beautiful show like a lady before her time and support players are also pretty nice. The costumes are exemplary, as it matches the story of the story, as well as the remarkable production settings and values. But most importantly, animals are here abundantly, not only Buddy, but adorable chimps, ducks, rabbits and so on. For those who want to watch a movie and be transported to the skies of the animals here on the ground, this is an extraordinary choice of the film. All animal lovers, and even those who just want to watch a big family movie, will become "monkey" over Buddy.
