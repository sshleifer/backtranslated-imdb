This movie surprised me! Never hearing of Hyde de Gackt, I did not expect too much! The reason I wanted to watch this movie was because somebody mentioned that the film contained some serious scenes of John Woo's action! Normally, I am very careful when this is claimed! There is only one John Woo and so far there has not been a director approaching his brilliance when it comes to action! The fact that the "Baby Moon" would have a vampire convinced me even more! How can you be wrong with the vampires throwing the gun? Sounds promising and exciting! The first thing I noticed about this movie is that the rhythm was considerably slow! It takes time to set the mood! This movie contains some beautiful action scenes in Hong Kong style! But "baby moon" is not a movie of action! It's a drama about friendship and loyalty! The emphasis is on the characters and the relationship between them! Pop singers Hyde and Gackt do a good job in acting and are very credible as friends! The only problem I had was the plot! Sometimes the movie seems to be jumping in a few years without explaining what happened and why you had to skip! Example: When a group member dies (extremely dramatic moment), Alexander Wang sees Kei (Hyde) eating blood from one of the attackers! Without warning and explanation, the film is over 9 years old and most of the friends are no longer together! Also, without a proper reason, Son (Alexander Wang) and Sho (Gackt) have to kill each other! I know this is done to add a serious drama! Because of the actors it is very effective, but sometimes feels forceful! Apart from the defects in the plot, this film has an ambiance and a slickness that makes it hard not to like this movie! It's hard to explain why this movie is great! But it's just! The general experience you get is unimaginable and sincere!
