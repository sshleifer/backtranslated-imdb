A hilarious and perspective perspective on the world that is encountered is presented in this comedy off beat by the first writer / director Peter M. Cohen. The story unfolds as the four male protagonists meet weekly at the local dinner to give them their story. I meet Brad: a beautiful playwright on the street with a sharp and sharp tongue; Zeek: a cynical, sensitive writer; Jonathan: A wonderful sexual type with affinity for hand creams and masturbation; and Eric: the married man who values ​​his weekly meetings with his own friends in the hope of enlightening his married and banal existence. New York's unique tribulations and tribulations are funny, reflecting that of Sex in the City and HBO's new comedy "The Mind of the Married" and bring amazing scamming light. The story revolves while the three singletons meet Mia - whom I played with Amanda Peet - and all fall for her. It seduces everyone with their ability to conform to the personalities they expose. When they realize that they all met and fell in love with the same woman, they chose their friendship. Whipped is a realistic portrayal of the meeting world, one that the critic has failed to recognize. In simple language, they missed the point. The protagonist is here caricatures of real people. Exaggerations are hysterical, stirring satire and humility, and do not have to be taken as seriously as encryption suggests. See this movie, you will laugh from start to finish.
