This was one of those wonderful moments in T.V. which I wanted to capture forever on VHS. Will not there be air again? <br /> <br /> It was so creative and I remember it was broadcast once a week, and waiting for the next episode was aggressive. I want to see everything again. I want to buy it. I want what I can not do. Not even EBAY. <br /> <br /> So having quite a lot of rank, it was, by far, one of the best series of the '80s. It should be considered a classic, but it is lost in space. At least this website and Wikipedia mention it. Sob. It was completely appealing, fun, flirting and original. Perhaps I do not like Sherlock Holmes's original, I think Quintin is more appealing and has a better chance with his lady than Holmes, who could ever have done it.
