I've seen this movie a long time ago, but it seemed amazing to me until today that never stopped amazing. A wonderful film describing the story of a group of Australian orders that tried to sink Japanese Ships from the Singapore Harbor during the height of the Second World War. These commandos are caught in simple clothes and are considered to be spies by Japanese captors. But something happens that has not been explored in any Hollywood WW2 movie we've seen. A close and friendly relationship develops between captives and captives. They begin to respect one another while the Captain of the captured Australian soldiers becomes the best friend with a high guard in the Japanese prison. This is the most wonderful part of the whole movie and even draws your heart. Soon, one day when the two friends spoke, Captain Aussie learns that other captives will be tried and executed for the sinking of Japanese vessels in the port of Singapore. He mentions that it was his team and not others who sunk the ships of his Japanese friend, and after hearing this, the Japanese guardsman says he would be quiet because it could lead to the execution of his entire group. But the captain remains unwavering to confess this to the Japanese authorities. Finally, the Japanese authorities condemn them to death in the most respectful way, according to their rules. This is the highest honor given to the warriors captured in Japan. This is the most wonderful part of the film in which Australian soldiers await their imminent death and tense suspicion of friendly Japanese guard who is not yet ready to believe why his Aussie friend testified that he was guilty. I will not end here. But it is more painful than can be imagined and can move easily into tears. In total, an underrated movie, which probably did not get the recognition that it deserves international attention. Get a copy today and be fascinated.
