This is the latest addition to a new wave of educational documentation such as "The Corporation" and "Fahrenheit 9/11". His commentary is clear and unshakable, as is the amazing cinematic style of this well-built feature. The film succeeds in imposing a strong sense of how our world is insecure as we hurry to an ecologically unsustainable future at the speed of lightning - while showing terrifying beauty in our quest for progress. <br /> <br /> Indeed, a remarkable achievement that must be seen by all those who care about the world we leave to our children. Bravo! NB - this is also the only movie (8) at the theaters in Varsity (Toronto), which boasts a label that reads ... "To arrange group views, please contact ...". .. Another testament to the popularity and importance of this jewelery. My bet ... an Academy nomination for the best documentary. OB101
