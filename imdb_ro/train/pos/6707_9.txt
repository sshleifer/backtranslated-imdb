I know sometimes it's really corny ... But the act is amazing and Melissa Joan Hart is just as cute as a button. I really enjoy this show and I'm almost embarrassed I'm doing b / c the show has a rep. because I'm really a horn, but it makes me feel good. My only problem is that sometimes it can be a fairly low budget - sometimes the actors change and you just have to deal with it ... As Sabrina's father there are two different guys along the movie ... I mean, they could not just saying he's an uncle or something? However, I can only love this show. Harvey and Sabrina make a very cute couple, and Salem is absolutely hilarious. I definitely recommend it if you are looking for some fun and funny fun ... My favorite episode is "Pancake Madness" ... a HILARIUS episode. The best season is probably 3 ... I'm not a fan of a seven season twists ... Once you get to college, Morgan joins the group and its dialogue is painful and badly acting ... Plus she is ugly, so the jokes about how she did not survive than her good look were lost on me ... But I think it was created to have a very good eight season and I was really sad to see one of my favorites canceled!
