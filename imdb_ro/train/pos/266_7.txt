This story has never been among my favorites in Christie's work, so I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy this adaptation. The motivation of the mouse has been effective if it is a little bit upset, the bones of the story exist, although a greater emphasis is placed on the subfield of "past crime." The students were all I imagined, although they did not seem to be a more cosmopolitan bunch - maybe the thirty-revised setting did not allow this! I thought there were some very bold risks with filming; maybe because I did not read the book a lot, but it seemed quite obvious to me who the killer was since their appearance in some photos broadcast early enough. Humor was more widespread in these early Poirots. Sometimes it works, but I found a lot hard to handle in this episode (although I smiled at the launch line of "Lemon"). However, a solid entry into the series, though not one of the best.
