Red Skelton was another important star who made the transition from movies to television easily. His performances have certainly brought a laugh to US households years ago. the show begins with an opening monologue. After that, we would have a variety of characters. Do you remember Gertrude and Heathcliff in monologue? How can we ever forget San Fernando Red? I remember an episode in which, as a king, Red introduced the queen, referring to her as a fat. Go to know that Red uses his comic talents to really hide from his tragic life. He lost a son to leukemia at the age of 11 or so. His wife, Georgia, died of suicide.
