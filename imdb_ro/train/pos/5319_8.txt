Look, this is a "B" movie. Forget it is overcome in many ways. Instead, you give writer-director Ida Lupino a worthwhile merit to address a subject that at that time (1950) was taboo in Hollywood. As far as I know, this was the first film to address the subject of rape, as well as the emotional and psychological effects this crime has on its victims. Although much of the cast is best pedestrian, Mala Powers, who at the age of eighteen or nineteen, offers an excellent performance across the globe as well as the traumatized woman, Ann, who is trying to escape her "shame." Based on her work in this film, I'm surprised she did not have a better acting career. Tod Andrews also has some wonderful moments as a minister who gets to help her. Mrs. Lupino, who obviously worked on a limited budget, has still managed to create some memorable scenes, such as tracking the streets and alleys leading to rape, and the range of police pursuing it. And it created a bitter end that let me wonder if Ann could have a normal life again.
