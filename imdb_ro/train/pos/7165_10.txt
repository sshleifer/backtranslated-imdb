I registered this age ago, but I came to look at her today. I was sick, so I came out of things to watch! I'm so glad that I saw her and I could erase my memory and I could look again for the first time. This movie is so great! He reminded me very much of Green Green Tomatoes from Whistlestop Coffee. <br /> <br /> The story goes back in time, and at the end of the movie we see what it has to do. Some people said that this is a movie for children. Disagree - Disney can be done and many characters are kids, but I'm 23 and I loved it! There were moments in which the corner of the spine cleansed me. The story is different from any other movie these days, full of adventure. I just ordered the book from Amazon, I can not wait!
