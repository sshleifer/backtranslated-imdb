Produced in the same year as "Vertigo", this is an equally fascinating film, though in a much easier vein. He is in a beautiful New York City in winter: Kim Novak is a witch who casts a spell on James Stewart, but is trapped in it in return. The interesting side is that Novak's rival is played by Janice Rule, who created the Madge side in "Picnic" on Broadway (the part Novak will make famous in the film).
