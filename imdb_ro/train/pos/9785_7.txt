Let me be the first non-Australian to comment on this :) I got the film for Hugo Weaving and I saw it all the way. It is one of those "drama of life" films, as my mother used to name a movie that describes a real story without extraordinary events that is largely descriptive. I liked the light and the girls. The rest was without too much blame, but without too much merit. I wanted something like Interview, or at least a matrix element here and there, but nothing unusual. The story teaches you to confront your own destiny and free yourself from the environment that others build for you, but this happens when the peach plant that gives life wants to close, so it does not take too much effort to to change things. <br /> <br /> The "smart" song of American sound beauty in the background could have been part of a larger soundtrack, but only a piece of play became annoying again after 100 minutes of movie. > <br /> Finally, I think he did the job of presenting part of Australian life, but it did not seem to be Australian (it could have been placed anywhere) and did not seem attractive as a story. I think you have to be in a mood to like the movie.
