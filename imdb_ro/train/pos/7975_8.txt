I love Malle's documentation. They are so easy and simple, but still so fascinating. I have no idea why this documentary works. It's about Glencoe, Minnesota. 5000 people live there and nothing really happens. But still Malle manages to make it fascinating and interesting. His love for mankind, even for racist or homophobic people, is so overwhelming that you can only help but fall in love with them. <br /> <br /> Malle shot most of it in 1979. He returned six years later to see what had changed. This would have been a good film without the material 6 years later, but this little plus makes it great. It might sound like Malle did just what was done in the Up series, but it really is not. The Up series is about people. Malle does not emphasize both what happened to every person and what happened to this community. And the change is wonderful. 1985 is the Reagan era and farmers suffer. Once a proud community, nobody sees much of a future now, and parents hope that they will educate themselves and do more than make agriculture. <br /> <br /> This documentary is quite relevant today. Our financial crisis began today because of what was happening then. Just take a look at these final words in the film, expressed by an older lawyer in the city (in 1985): "Well, I have great hopes for this country, because things that are happening right now can only be characterized in my mind as an obsession of greed and a nation does not live long with this obsession and especially a democracy that ... There is good - it's good - a lot of good in this country and a lot of good people and they will not. .. they will not subscribe to this philosophy of greed that is happening now. It's horrible. "Unfortunately, it took more than 20 years and a hell of a headache before it happened.
