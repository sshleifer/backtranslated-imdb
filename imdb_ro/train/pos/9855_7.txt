This is my first animated CG movie I've ever seen. Typically, the look of other animated films made me reluctant to see them. It was not the ice. I wanted to see her when I saw the trailer with Scrat, the hilarious sabertooth squirrel. The Ice Age was sporadically funny and a fun movie to watch. The story is essentially an animated version of Three Men and a Baby, set up 20,000 years ago. The visuals were great. Simply beautiful. It's one thing to create a convincing statement, it's something else to create oppressive things and Ice Age is wonderful to look at with its stylized visuals. Blue Sky Studios is a company to take care of the future.
