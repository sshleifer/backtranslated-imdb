We gathered at least a few people who watched on TCM on September 2. If you knew that Hedy had to change her name to avoid being associated with this movie when she came to the United States. It was a huge scandal, and I found that the initial release in the USA was so married to the censors that it was virtually unintelligible. I watched because I just saw a documentary about "bad women," actresses in the American Premiere Censorship Board set up in the early 1930s. It seemed to me that they sank much more than the most "sensational" blows of Hedy in "Ecstasy". In fact, Hedy looked positively innocent in this, according to today's standards, and it was nice to see her early beauty. It was a beautiful, lyrical film to relax. I loved it for what it was: a simple story. I watched her after I first recorded him in a first early sleeping state A.M. I would love to see the first version released in the US for comparison.
