This is a familiar story in Tom and Jerry's drawings, especially in the 1940s, the only difference being that two cats instead of one are threatened to be evacuated if they do not catch the mouse (Jerry). Tom has an amateur friend ("Butch?") Who lives in the house with him, so this really suffers from "Mammy Two Shoes" who can not believe they have a mouse despite two cats in the house. /> However, the one who catches Jerry can stay while the other gets the boot, so the competition is in progress. Even though it's a familiar territory, I enjoyed it because the cartoon had plenty of original gaggles to make fun. Not only were the cats competing against each other but also Jerry in the equation, so there were plenty of good gags to recommend you if you're a Tom & Jerry fan.
