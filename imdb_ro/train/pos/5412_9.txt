As a fan of Pokemon I liked this movie very much. It introduces new legendary Pok√©mon (as every movie does) and adds depth to the relationships between its characters. However, I do not expect those who are not Pokemon fans to enjoy (this includes most adults). Some of the lines were corny, but this may be somewhat inevitable when doubling the movie in English. The animation was beautiful, although there were some parts that did not look good. And although the villain is a kind of root, I think movies have done a good job of cycling through various types of villains and I guarantee that not everyone is like this. Those who did not like it, I tell everyone, but the Pokemon fans will love it.
