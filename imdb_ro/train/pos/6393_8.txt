This is one thing you have to see for independent movie fans, but it's also good against mass movies. I think we have the factors of the next Woody Allen or Trentin Tarrentino here. The budget is painfully low. There are no special effects and it seems to use ambient lighting (shot in digital video.) - Still, this movie takes hold of you and never leaves you. The script is somewhat bizarre, yet the actors and the director are really realistic. It has humor, it has intrigue and it has patos and everything works together. There is no point in describing the details. If you want to see an independent masterpiece, a virtual lesson on how to make a low budget blow that actually works, see this. Very fun. <br /> <br />
