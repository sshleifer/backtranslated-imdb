I am a college student studying levels and needs help and comment from anyone who has all the views about mothers in the movie, at the mother. If you went through something similar or just want to comment and help me research more about this movie, any comment would be appreciated a lot. Comments will only be used for exam purposes and will be included in my written exam. So if you have any opinions, I'm sure they can put them to use and you could help me get an A! I also study "About a Boy" and "Tadpole", so if you've seen these movies, I'd appreciate if you could leave comments on this page. Thank you.
