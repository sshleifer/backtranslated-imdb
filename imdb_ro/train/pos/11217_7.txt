Being an otaku since Robotech's days, I can still say that Gunbuster is one of my favorite favorites all the time. Considering when it was made, the animation is of superior quality. There are no loops and sequences in which art decreases in quality. Although the final episode is black and white, it does not have the pleasure of watching the movie. Although it has been described as "sappy," it should be borne in mind that women do not react in the same way as men. Because the main character is a woman, it should be obvious that she does not necessarily have to resort to "macho-man" tactics to win the respect of her colleagues. Seiryuu for Noriko, by accident, also plays Akane in Ranma 1/2. Noriko is just as three-dimensional as a cartoon; her personality surprises the essence of a spiritual girl who seems to be completely helpless at first, but eventually succeeds in the power of her will. The only complaint I have is that mecha looked like plush bears. Even the Gunbuster uses a "Homing Laser" and "Buster Shield" quite dubious (which is nothing but learning the car with a velvety giant cloak around her in the true Dracula style). I doubt the scene should have been fun, but I broke. However, I would class Gunbuster in the top 20 anime of all time.
