Titanic is a long story, but well-done, love-tragic adventure that takes place during the wrong voyage on the clean ship. Writer / Director James Cameron has done an excellent job of making this film about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining this with the true Titanic event that sank after it hit an iceberg on April 15, 1912 claiming thousands of lost lives in the free Atlantic waters of the North Atlantic. The two leaders of the film are great in their role, including Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. They make a good couple on the screen. DiCpario and Winslet also had authentic chemistry that had made romance, which eventually bloomed between them more credibly. They both showed a real talent when it came out and they both continued to show them even in their latest movies. The other participants, including Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Jonathan Hyde and Bill Paxton in a small role, are just as impressive as their characters who help them bring them to life in this film. The story of love, action, suspense and special effects are wonderful made especially for that time. The horror of the situation where the characters were felt so real because it really happened, making you want most of them to survive this life and death. Pacing was a little slow and it was a bit long, but the rest of the movie was made for a few flaws. Titanic makes for a great date film that is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they look at it. The fact that this really happened was certainly added to the movie that makes you feel sorry for all the lost lives when the Titanic sank into the Atlantic after it hit an iceberg. In general, Titanic is a tragic story about two people who fall in love while on an unspotted ship that has brought to life the exceptional performances of distribution, especially DiCaprio and Winslet, which certainly make this movie worth the time to watch .
