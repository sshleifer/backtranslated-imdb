I just looked at this film and I'm still unhappy with the number of cynics I reject as a New Age parrot. A wonderful movie that makes its time to grow, continues to get over the edge, but never does, and ultimately is meditative, affects and fends life than most of the movies people can see I reject "coincidences". I was upset when the movies like "Prince of Tides" and "Bugsy" (although I liked the last one) were nominated for the best film that year (not to mention that "The Silence of the Thousands" won !) And this was completely ignored except for a best screenplay nomination. When reviewing it, I think history supports my initial reaction!
