I'm sick of people complaining about Ewoks! True, they are not the best thing that ever happened to Star Wars, but they did, so do it! Besides, they are nice and I do not care if they're sold. Yubb Nubb! This film always leaves me in tears. It's perfect. The end could not be better. I'm excited by "The Phantom Menace," because he will suddenly throw the whole story from Luke to Anakin. I like how it is revealed at the end - it would be too unresolved in any other way. Those of you who complain that Vader's helmet has been removed, take a moment to think about it. It's very effective. Vader, the man hiding behind a mask for 20 years, is finally discovered as a sick man. He is not entirely a machine - he is vulnerable. I do not know how the casting director managed to choose such good actors in New Hope. Everybody does so well. They are credible characters. Hamill does an excellent job with the development of his dramatic character. Fisher does a good job of being a female model (that is, come on! He killed Jabba even when many others failed!). Harrison Ford - Should I say More? Music is brilliant again. It's so exciting and meaningful when you can pick character themes in different parts of the movie. The best climax is when Luke shouts "NOOO!" and breeze against his father in the final battle. John Williams has nothing to do with genius! An amazing man! The movie already has much more significance for me because of Episode I. I can not wait to see it in cinemas (I can wait ???) and then watch the original trilogy once again. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
