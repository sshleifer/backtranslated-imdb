I saw this very dark comedy about 2000 times on cable television. What a surprise and delight! Everyone is armed hidden in this movie! Dreyfuss plays a "mental" don (remember the New York donor who should have been schizophrenic? Does the art imitate life or vice versa?). Diane Lane and Ellen Barkin are the most beautiful and do not have to be played! So proving that beauty and hardness go together! Then there is the big shit scene between Barkin and Jeff Goldblum (Rita and Mickey) where they verbally play the world "shit." This film is both subtle and bald. For all the photos, it can be a very quiet movie. And you have the opportunity to see more actors in their final or close roles. Joey Bishop. Richard Pryor. Henry Silva. It's not a movie for everyone. But if you like a movie that has a lot of word play and moves without blowing everything in sight, this is the movie for you. Roger Ebert takes care of this movie. It's badly wrong. This is a beautiful, beautiful movie! Maybe it's not one for Ebert. I think it's a 10, because of how good it is and how fun the script is, but it's not really a kind of comedy movie. I like so well that I bought it on DVD because it does not look too much on cable television. Now it's all mine!
