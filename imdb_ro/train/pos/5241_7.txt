Excellent film by Thaddeus O'Sullivan, with powerful performances from a number of British and Irish actors. The film fits well with sparkling stuff and effectively captures the bleak and bleak atmosphere of the 1970s in Belfast. Surprisingly realistic, he does nothing to glorify any party in this conflict. On the one hand, it shows a young Catholic father who is trying to raise his family without being tempted. On the other hand, it deals with a Loyalist band that intends to propagate violence. Very interesting and, fortunately, fun. Do not expect to laugh, though. 7 out of 10.
