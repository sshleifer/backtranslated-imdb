Liam Neeson describes the Scottish legend Robert Roy Macgregor from the early 18th century. He's a real actor. He captures the audience with his charisma, as he does in all his roles. Jessica Lange is excellent as Mary's wife. Maria is such a beautiful woman. It's her love that makes Rob Roy the legend, but his passion makes him love unceasingly. They need each other. Tim Roth as evil Cunningham is perfect; In one way or another, watching the movie, you'll find Cunningham disgusting. The Scottish landscape is beautiful. The environment and the conditions in time are illustrated quite well. If you love history, romance, passion and love, you will enjoy Rob Roy. There is violence and blood, but it is inevitable to say this story as it should be said; no free violence. And you have to listen carefully if you are not accustomed to a Scottish accent. An important point that makes this movie so good is that no actor or actress is glamorised; are dirty and, in fact, look unattractive in different scenes. It's their ability as actors that attract you, it's not based on the name of marquee, popularity or sex sympathy. It's something special.
