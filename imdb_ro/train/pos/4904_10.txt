Beautiful in all ways, this movie is perfect if you feel like feeling good. If you like jazz music, you have to see. If you love to see love characters that make you smile, you can bring a tear to the eye and swing it is no longer tomorrow This movie is for you. If you are looking for an intense, deep and hard piece to be dissected and analyzed, you probably feel the best with Darren Aronofsky (in other words - the reviewer djjohn lights up, you do not know when you see one!) My only complaint is that the movie was too short. I think I'll have to look a few more times to fill myself.
