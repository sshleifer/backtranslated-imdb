I was at the same screenwriting conference and I saw the movie. I thought the writer - Sue Smith - made a very clear summary of what the movie was. However, the film did not need explanations. I thought the themes were very clear and inspired. A film that addresses the ability to dare, to cope with fear - especially to the fear of parental figures - and to overcome it, and thus to embrace the possibilities of life, is a film that must be cherished and enjoyed. I liked much more than "Somersault". I also think Mandy62 was a little rude for Hugo Weaving. Like a guy about his vintage, it should look so good! I agree that many Australian films have recently been unclear, but "Peaches" are delivering the goods. I'm glad I saw her.
