Anyone who thinks anime is nothing but sex and violence will be silent forever after watching this movie. This is a wonderful film that tells Tetsuro's mission to avenge his mother's death, but he is also growing in this process. Train travel is a journey of Tetsuro from childhood to man. The musical and visual styles of the film are a bit short (you can say it's a 70s movie) and the animation is just a little bit better than your average "Star Blazers" episode. But the story and the characters are so powerful that it does not matter. A must-see for any animation fan!
