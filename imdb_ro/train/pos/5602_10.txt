Roman Polanski plays Trelkovsky who rents an apartment in France. The previous tenant is in a hospital after a suicide attempt. She goes there to see Stella (Isabelle Adjani), Simone's friend. He and Stella are getting close enough. Later, Simone dies. Trelkovsky begins to think that the owner and neighbors are trying to change it in Simone so that it finally comes out of the window. Le Locataire in 1976 is the latest film of the trilogy of Polanski's apartment. The previous ones were Repulsion and Baby Rosemary. Roman Polanski does not do good work just as a director, but his action is also superb. Isabelle Adjani with her big glasses is great. The owner, Monsieur Zy, is interpreted by the great Melvyn Douglas.Jo Van Fleet plays Madame Dioz. Fantastic Shelley Winters is The Concierge. The tenant is something very scary from time to time. It gives him a lot of psychological scuffs. This movie is not the easiest to understand or explain, but it does everything so fascinating.
