An excellent and accurate film ... McGovern makes great efforts to research and document his writing and pays. He is not afraid to tell the truth, although he may comment and unfavorable comments from some who like stories to be clean and sweet and glossy. Once again, McGovern brings to Christopher Eccleston, though not in the same profile, a role he played in Hillsborough. We found this film as accurate, well-behaved and well presented as Hillsborough and McGovern applause for its unfortunate writings. Very well my hat is outside the writer, the actors, the production crew. A great movie!
