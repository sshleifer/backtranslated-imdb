He was lucky enough to be an extra in this wonderful movie and loved every minute of filming. I went to the Premier of London and had an excellent conversation with Phil, Peter, Martin and Jon, and with my wife. Fountain after the party. Then a few weeks later he had a movie tour with our bike club members. What a brilliant film deserves to be there with all the best biker movies. Now we have the DVD Sue, my wife can not get enough of it, nor the kids. Take a bit of stick from the club, who seem to think I'm a movie star now oh, well can only dream. I think I'm just jealous. The only downside to the first part of the film was weather, rain, rain and rain, but we were in Wales. We hope it will be a sequel, so keep me posted to Jon. Danny Beck
