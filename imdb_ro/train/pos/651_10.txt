** Possible spoilers ** I like this movie and I have no problem staying awake for that. It reminds me of me at 20, except it's even better. Like Veronica says, two chicks at a time. She pulls out of me redness, casual conversation, these two real chicks, rather than prostitutes, teasing us every step of the way. And I'm in talks. Even if I'm totally b. Sometimes, so what? Every guy I've ever talked about and that is tall is usually full of the same buzz, no reason, philosophy. It's just a bunch of nonsense, and as sensitive as the other bs.s. chickens of philosophy are often in: astrological diagrams. The only deal with this movie is the guy is almost as feminine as women, he is in the same b.s. and moodiness. The brunette chick is actually the most masculine there. I think it's kind of funny that the brunette chick gets so obviously started by Veronica. I would love to shoot the little blonde from Alexandru, but Veronica plays it all the way. It's genius. She becomes the brunette believing that there is something between them, and then she steals the boy-child / man, which is only fit because they seem to be from the same age group. The brunette knows she had it all over when she crashes her face in the palms of her hands, while Marlene Deitrich sing in the background that paraphrasing there is a million couples in Paris tonight but I only have this refrain. /> <br /> But do they finally marry Alex and Veronica? Mmmm? I can only imagine a super-tumultuous relationship that ends in a divorce before marriage. They are too selfish to be something to each other than the crossing stones. But I liked the movie. I've been having fun, having a nice look and being sexy.
