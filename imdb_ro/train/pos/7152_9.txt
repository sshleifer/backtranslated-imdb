"Holes" was a GREAT movie. Disney has made the right choice. Everyone I talked about said that they loved them. Everyone was right for the role they had and Shia Labeouf really has a future with acting. Sigourney Weaver was perfect for The Warden, just like I imagined. anyone who has not seen it, I recommend it and I guarantee that you will "Dig It".
