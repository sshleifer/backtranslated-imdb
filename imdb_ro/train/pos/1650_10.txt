A great, action-packed and directed, but ruthless (I am told) Mr. Deighton and withdrawn from him after a single presentation. Now it can only be seen in private collections and the British Film Institute at special request. Very regrettable, as Ian Holm portrays Bernard Samson's portrait, tired - but determined - he is superb; one of its best performances. The supporting songs, including young Amanda Donohoe and Hugh Fraser, are great. With Mel Martin playing the conflict and treachery wife, and Michael Degen as Mercunter Werner, the story feels positively with the tragic and fatal personal consequences of the great game.
