This movie is one of those nostalgic things with me and I never expect anyone else to "get it", but I'm happy when I recommend it and somebody enjoys it. My late father at HATED by Arthur Askey, but this movie was one he really liked and his consistent enthusiasm for "The Train Ghost" and "Old Ted" Olmes "was transferred to me as a child. I'm always wondering if it will not be the same but I'm never disappointed with it Many things can be enjoyed The train sequence is really inspired when Askey and Murdoch continues to disturb the arrogant male passenger, then the whole section of the station is amazing, so much happens that you have to keep up the pace. Yeah, it's dated and brittle in wartime in accents and plot (based on Arnold Ridley's original piece from the fame of his father's army!), But full of wonderful characters - including Kathleen Harrison as a spinster. The atmosphere is really as close Dynasty as a vehicle Arthur Askey could get. It's available as cheap UK tokens on DVD so you treat yourself. It's a perfect morning on a Saturday / Sunday morning or any kind of easy fun afternoon afternoon. Thank you .... <br /> <br /> MORE FILMS MAY BE GOOD MOVIES!
