During the Second World War, Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a fantastic fun adventure for children, with Angela Lansbury as an apprentice witch who, with the help of three evicted children and a "witchcraft teacher," prevents a Nazi invasion. <br /> <br /> Naturally inventive, with lots of laughter, this movie will delight kids of all ages with their extraordinary characters with exciting story and appealing songs. Lansbury is perfect as Eglantine, the no-perfect witch that takes the three children into the adventure of a life, and her three young co-stars (Cindy O'Callaghan, Roy Snart and Ian Weighill) are just as impressive as Cockney rascals that help fight the nasty Hun. <br /> <br /> Special effects are somewhat dated, but let's face it, kids do not care much about these things as long as they are entertained. And have fun, they will be. With some impressive scenes that brilliantly combine live action and animation with a great effect and a more authentic film magic than a hundred Harry Potters, it would be hard not to enjoy this wonderful piece of cinematic escape. In fact, only a musical number drawn in Portobello Road marks the perfection of the film, but so much to enjoy, which can be easily forgiven. In addition, any UK movie legend Bruce Forsyth as a "Flash" Spi style Harry is guaranteed by a good rating from me.
