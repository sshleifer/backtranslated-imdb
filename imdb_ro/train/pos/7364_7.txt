It's not always easy to explain what a movie is, but this time I think I found it. He reminded me of two films: Trainspotting (the little time criminals who make some drugs and do silly things in Schotland) and the Blair Witch Project (due to the shooting style). It's about loyalty between two friends, one of them gets out of jail, the other is not caught. With a stolen vehicle, they drive through the Scottish countryside, but they do not go out of gas. As they try to find some fuel, I find a farm in the middle of nowhere. The farmer thinks he wants to rob him and shows a gun to one of them. Everything goes wrong. One of the friends accidentally shoots the farmer's daughter and has to run. What follows is a man hunting through the fields and forests of Schotland. The two friends literally have to go to life. Apparently, this movie was shot in only 12 days. Ok, it's not even unbelievable, because most of it is always in the same place: the Scottish countryside, but still think it's pretty amazing. Especially because it's not a bad movie. It's probably not the biggest movie ever, but they can still be proud of what they've got. I had a pleasant time watching and generally liked the movie. I give her a 7/10.
