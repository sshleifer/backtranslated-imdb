The more dramatic the drama, the better the film of sister rivalry! This jewel was promoted mainly as a comedy after her release in Sweden, so I'm glad to find out that it was not the case entirely. Amusing boys on harassing small towns are there to enjoy, but drama is on the central scene as the story progresses. And not just family drama, it also raises questions asked about the observance of the differences in lifestyle choices of the peoples. Large character set with many dramatic, gorgeous and moving scenes that mark credibility; and I'm not just scuttershot, but keep everything in place. It makes me assume that if Ingmar Bergman had done this (drama would be right for him!), International attention would have been immediate. 7 of 10 at Ozjeppe.
