"Zu: The Magic Mountain Warriors" was and is an impressive classic! You would never have guessed that it was done in 1983. The use of the special effects by Tsui Hark was very creative and inventive. (He continued to do so in the Chinese Ghost Story trilogy and subsequent productions.) Even now, it can be measured up to other films of this genre. "Legend of Zu" is connected to warriors "Zu" from the magic mountain! ", It is not necessary to have seen this film to understand the plot of this. It is a little hard to follow. But to be honest, I asked always what Tsui Hark would do if he had given his hand on CGI Now we know he made this movie Maybe sometimes it's too much but the overall result is so beautiful I will not be critical about it. There is so much going on on the screen, she just will not believe it! I think it's a big shame that this movie was not presented in the theaters here in the Netherlands. The movie screams in time in cinemas This film can simply defeat large-scale production at Hollywood like "Superman Returns" or Xmen 3. The only thing I have to remember is the lack of humor In most of Tsui Harks' fantasy, martial arts and humor, somehow is missing in this movie, and I will not be abo these little problems. "Legend of Zu "offers on the action the most beautiful special effects you will see. A true classic!
