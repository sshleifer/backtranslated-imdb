Full Moon High (1981) 3 of 5 Dir: Larry Cohen Stars: Adam Arkin, Ed McMahon, Pink Kelly <br /> <br /> Tony (Arkin) is an ordinary regular high school student. Prepare yourself for the big home game, trouble with your girlfriend and growing hair in strange places? But hair in strange places gets little controlled when a trip to Transylvania with his father (DA! McMahon) leaves him with a bad furbal case. Now condemned to go the world forever younger as a werewolf how will Adam receive any girls? "Full Moon High" is not often talked about, but it is a stupid and funny doll. Larry Cohen ("The Stuff") incorporates as many gossip as a screenwriter / director. Arkin (H20: Halloween, 20 years later) shows a pleasant moment in the lead role. If you happen to be a fan of spoofs such as "Airplane" and "Student Corps," I think you'll have fun with this chuckle-fest.
