I liked Long Way Round and I did not even know about Race until Dakar until I saw it on my local supermarket shelves. I bought it after an easy episode, I decided it was. Charlie Boorman was great as other crew members. I'm glad to see him again with Ewan. It was a little oath in her, but that did not bother me. Regarding the fact that nothing is mentioned on the package. This is more about the stupid exception of the BBFC classification certificate. She should have given her only 15 for the language itself. The highly recommended series, I want more!
