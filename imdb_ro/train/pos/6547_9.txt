I took my daughter for 10 years to see Nancy Drew over the weekend and woke up very amused. First, it was clean and I refer to my standards. The majority of today's children's movies are full of raw humor of grooming and gross joke to provoke cheap laughter from the pre-adolescent crowd. Nancy Drew is smarter than that, but humor is subtle and intelligent. The role of the title is played with a refreshing virace by Emma Roberts, who is agitated and polite without becoming annoying. Unlike The Brady Bunch, where anachronistic characters are ridiculed and ridiculed, Nancy's style is treated with respect and dignity. It's a wonderful time when the girls in Los Angeles, with their conscious style, with their Paris Hilton clothes are rejected by the owner of the boutiques, while Nancy, in her velvet costumes and Butterick dress, is embraced. This movie avoids the need to clarify - this kind of healthy little girl who takes many Hollywood movies. Nancy remains true to herself and her values ​​throughout her life. The mystery is sometimes tense enough to be hired. There were some tense moments in which my daughter nervously grabbed my arm, but there were no free shock scenes. Everything is based on tension and mood and is very fun. The support distribution is good, especially Marshall Bell as a creepy caretaker. There are some great cameos of Eddie Jemison, Chris Kattan and Bruce Willis and many moments that will make adults smile. This movie deserves better evaluations than they did. Not only was I glad not to be dragged to another animated animation movie, where the animals were talking and had to go all over, but I was also very entertaining. If I were there without a child, I'd still enjoy the movie. This is a DVD that will have my daughter's name on it under the Christmas tree.
