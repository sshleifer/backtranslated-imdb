I'm American black and I loved this soap opera. I saw he was called in Spanish at Telemundo, almost 5-7 years ago. The story was a true story about a black slave who has a love affair with a white commander who led her on the lead and a way to be capricious, capricious. A lot of us could learn a lot from XICA. She took what she had, nothing, and she saw her possibilities. Many would claim to have sold - but she was trying to secure the future and future of her children. It was an excellent soap opera that I thought it would be released on DVD, but it's not released. This soap opera was the best EVER soap opera. We need to be released on DVD or broadcast on TV again. Play Azteca America right now, which is only available in Mexico or the United States with pay-per-click. We need the release again at Telemundo.
