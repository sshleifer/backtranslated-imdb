Dudley Moore is fantastic in this unknown classic. This movie is a very spell movie that relies heavily on the talents of the actors. Without Dudley Moore, John Gielgud, Liza Minnelli and others, this movie could have been a disaster. He is not always well shot and sometimes has a very stiff music that tries to force a mood (the "psycho" music to the wedding fight), but the act goes beyond it. The character of Arthur is hilarious, with his drunken comments. But he grows well in a more mature, well rounded character as he learns to live by his free will. The end is pretty corny, though. I will not give it, but it could be improved. It's worth seeing many times.
