Jane Porter, the former lover of interest, Harry Holt (Neil Hamilton) and his friend Martin (Paul Cavanagh) come behind the hidden hide of Tarzan's jungle in search of golden ivory mines, the "Elephant Cemetery" for the first time in TARZAN , THE APE MAN ... we just find out that both men have hidden intentions ... that is, Jane. Will Tarzan remain that? It is not possible (in fact, Tarzan will not bear any disturbance at the "Elephant Cemetery") and knowing that Martin is trying to take Tarzan out of the painting, he is later in a world of the problem later he and his party, including Jane, who leaves with them after believing that Tarzan is dead) is captured by a native tribe who intends to feed their lions ... will Tarzan be willing and sufficient to reach them in time? This film is an adventure full of countless scenes involving Tarzan and other people who face wild animals and a climax that takes care of the spectator's interest and does not go up. Cruelty to animals and the portrayal of native people can upset some today, but everyone has to remember that this is basically fantastic adventure entertainment and should not be taken so seriously.
