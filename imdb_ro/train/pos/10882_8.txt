This is not a bad movie. It follows the new conventions of modern horror, that is, the movie in a movie, the well-known actress, who carries out his life in the first scene. This movie takes the old convention of a psychic killer he loses, managing to do something new and interesting with him. It's also always nice to see Molly Ringwald back for the attack. So this could be an example of what the genre has become. Cut cuts down all the signs and, in fact, is scary in some parts. I loved giving him an eight.
