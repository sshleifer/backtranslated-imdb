A number of posters commented on the unsatisfactory conclusion. This is always a problem with long, complex dramas. The offense is basically trivial, so salary is always anti-climatic, while detailed exposure lowers dramatic human drama. The writer used a number of smart devices to try to get it, but he did not succeed entirely. Answers to exactly what happened and why it can be provided, but if so, they are well buried. Inevitably, the viewer feels a little deceived. But in a sense, this does not matter. Drama has never been about crime or even about the investigation, but about the impact of events on the lives of those involved; family, investigators, witnesses, the press. And as such, it collapses. Writing was a significant reduction over the drama round for the first time, and the performance was pretty good. In an overall piece, it's hard to focus on individuals, but Penelope Wilton deserves a special mention for an extraordinary exercise like the mother-wife-daughter daughter, and Janet McTeer was in a cracked form like a tough old policeman. > One of the most interesting aspects of drama is manipulation of the race, like the elephant in the room that no one is ready to say. Subtle, powerful work.
