I liked this movie. I saw it for the first time when I was 20 years old (which was only four years ago) and I liked it so much, I brought my own copy the next day. Comedy is well played by everyone involved. I always have to come back and come back to the scene where Mr. Tsanders explains why he found water at 6 feet in one area and 227 meters in another area. Also look for Jason Robards' father who plays Mr. Retch. Talent has fled to that family.
