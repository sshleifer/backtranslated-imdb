One of the precious stones of the 1980s, the scenes ... show sharpened satire and Arnetia Walker's remarkable performances (how did he get a ton of roles after that?) And Wallace Shawn. It is a delightful reference to class war and people in these classes. The writing is hilarious and the characters, while not subtle, are tinted. And, I'm sorry, but the Asian gangs (if you can call a Japanese guy that scares one of the other characters a "band") have not been put for "sociological value," as another revision should be. The value here lies in what makes the movie have fun and in a brilliant way it does. I found her creative, funny and idiosyncratic.
