I was ready for a turgid tour, but he was delighted to find a quick scenario, a moral and excellent interpretation from all actors, especially Peter Finch, amazing special effects, suspense and beautiful cinemas - even a big Buddha blow recently destroyed by the Taliban. Not to mention Elizabeth Taylor to her most beautiful and sympathetic, before she gave up frightening hysteria that affected her later work. All the support players round it up and I wonder who trained all these elephants. Speaking of the Buddha-stone sequence, you can even see that Vivien Leigh is in long strikes. Her form and how she moves is different from Taylor's. The only thing that marks that sequence is the bad pictures made by the process, if the background moves too fast for horses for a walk. If you want a challenging movie that is nice to watch and never boring, spend a few hours with the Elephant Walk.
