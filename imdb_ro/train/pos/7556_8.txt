Okay, it was a pretty good episode. Much better than the credit he gets. Working with the camera is splendid. The best yet. I like the final shot. The atmosphere is fantastic, the costumes are wonderful, and the guests (except helpless victims) are strong. <br /> <br /> What I do not like about this episode is that many things have been unexplainable. why change sex? What is the purpose? and are strangers? what kind? why did they never show up in later mythology? I give this episode a third of a big one. One of my favorites, but the holes of plot are bothering me. Still ... it will not ruin my fun.
