Here's what I knew about "Atlantis" before watching it: - It's officially Disney's first sci-fi animation adventure. I'm not sure how precise it is (I like to give it a little bit), but it made me curious the first time I heard it described. - The preview seemed, for the most part, bad. Clearly, it was also "too cryptic", after some critics after the fact. - It seems so bad that Disney said, "Screw, re-launch" Spy Kids ". So with all that he said, how is the movie? <Br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> Hello-cool I am a sucker for animated fantasy that involves mixing music and special raffant effects anyway but "Atlantis" goes all the way.It is a return to all CGI eye-candy photos in "Beauty and the Beast" and "Aladdin," so much that it's almost a "Best-Of-Show" animator. The characters may not be memorable (except perhaps for the ship's medical officer), and the plot is a bit boring, but it (as in "only" it took something like five hundred million or something, I know animators who would kill to see fifteen dollars in this movie), but it is not a movie that you watch for plot. , compared to the popularity of "Shrek" and "Monsters Inc." was seen as a proof of the death of traditional animation I do not think that's true. How do you explain the movie "South Park"? What's with "Final Fantasy"? Indeed, story and art are everything, not the method. I do not know how Disney's movie will be, but I do not think they got out of the picture.
