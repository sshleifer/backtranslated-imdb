When I watched this movie, I began to feel very nostalgic. As a child growing up in a rural area I felt like I was a child again! Swimming pool (called "reservoir" in Central Texas), running through the country as a wild wild spirit! The story was very credible and I lost it completely and I cried out to the end. Through the pain we live in ... life continues and there can be forgiveness.
