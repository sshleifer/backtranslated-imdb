While this movie will not come down in the big movie theaters, it's a fun way to spend an hour and a half with the family. The movie is finally released in the movie, where it should have debut first. The film is about an eclectic group of friends who gather for their meals called "The Hungry Bachelors Club." Jorja Fox plays a woman who serves as a surrogate to get a prepayment for the restaurant she wants to open. Bill Nunn plays a mystery man who loves Cadillac, who becomes her boyfriend. Fox offers subdued and exciting performance, and Nunn is reliably talented as always. Micheal des Barres is a hohot as a top lawyer. The set of movies - made up of familiar faces - works together nicely to bring this group of strange characters to life. This is a good rental and one of the few you can watch with the whole family.
