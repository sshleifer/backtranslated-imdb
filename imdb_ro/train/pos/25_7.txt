I did not see this when I was a kid, so she was seen with fresh eyes. I've never heard of her and rented it for my five-year-old daughter. Besides, the idea of ​​singing and dancing by Christopher Walken made me curious. The special FX is cheesy, and singing and dancing are mediocre. But the story is wonderful. My daughter was entranced. I liked to see Walken in this role, thinking about what the future had for him. Very fun to see him dancing! And if the songs were not great, at least they were not sweet Disney Sugar Sweets. The scarf scene at the beginning was a little frightening for her, and she was a little nervous when I saw it again at the end, but it was largely benign. Interestingly, I recently read "Puss in Boots," and I wondered about the implausibility of the story. But, as he stood true in almost every aspect, Walken's action made it credible. Big fun. I would look again with my daughter.
