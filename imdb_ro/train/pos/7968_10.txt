I saw this movie for the first time when I was 6 or 7 years old and I did not think it was something special. As I continued, I followed him several times and began to grow as I began to understand the morale of the film, which I will come later. For a while I left this movie alone and I have not seen it for a while. When I was looking for a classic old movie you would watch a few weeks ago (15 years ago), I dug the VHS home. After I looked at this, I stayed on a natural height I could not really explain. The movie offers an overwhelming sense of joy that you never expect. The nature movie of three completely different animals that work together to find their way home sends a true message at home that no matter how different you are, you can always find a common ground, something you all need. The way the characters' personalities are chosen is really fantastic. By having an old wise grateful wise gold, seek or guide the "chance" of loving fun if it is a light young American bulldog, with a sassy clever, vulnerable but sure cat. The movie follows these three friends or companions on a journey that is so realistically impossible that it creates magic by starting to think that this trip can happen. <br /> <br /> I do not want to sound like a soft tissue grabber when it comes to movies I assure you I am exactly the opposite, but the most upscaling part of this movie is undoubtedly the return of the shadows when the shadow desperately tries to escape and chances and sassy, ​​painfully telling him to leave. When both animals return to their loved owners, there is silence until the shadow swells over the horizon towards the venerability of all. There is a fine line between the garbage of the heart and the horn, but this film is pure magic even at the age of 15. This movie may not be Lord of the rings, but for Disney to produce a fantastic movie using animals and to rise as she does at that age, she deserves 10/10.
