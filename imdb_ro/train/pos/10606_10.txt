I just finished watching this movie and found it very enjoyable. It's a small, quiet movie that does not overwhelm you with special effects or "big" shows. It simply takes you to the lives of people living in a small hamlet in the North Carolina carapace. <br /> <br /> Henry Thomas offers a good performance like Raymond Toker, a young man who finds a child abandoned in the woods. Toker's search for the child's parents leads him on a journey that will have a profound impact on his life. David Srathairn plays Truman Lester, a glorious conman, for a later reason. And David interprets the evil one to perfection. <br /> <br /> There is much more to this movie than the eye first encounters. Filmed on location in North Carolina and with a wonderful piece of traditional music, it's worth watching.
