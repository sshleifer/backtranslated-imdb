gone in 60 seconds is a very good comedy movie that made over $ 100 million, but was hit by most critics. I personally thought it was a great movie. The story was credible and probably had the biggest cast ever for this type of movie, including 3 academy winners, nicolas cage, robert duvall and very hot anjolina jolie. other than the lamella helmet at the end, this is a perfect blend of action comedy and drama. my score is **** (from ****)
