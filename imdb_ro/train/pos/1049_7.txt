The law sisters will be broadcast theatrically on March 24th in Sweden. A good opportunity for our Nordic friends to discover this original and attentive documentary. It was presented in GÃ¶teborg along with a retrospective dedicated to Kim Longinotto, the "focussed director" of the festival. She offered a highly acclaimed master class, telling her documentary filmmaking method and told the public about the special circumstances that led her to sister twice: the first version was lost forever, the film turned out to be different finally. A rather terrible problem happened in this case to create the possibility of a very powerful movie.
