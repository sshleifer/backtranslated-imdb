This movie was amazing, it's kind of a movie you're watching, and rather than looking at other actor's movies that you look at other director / writer films. Sandler did a good job by working a character outside his comfort zone, and Cheadle always did a good job. This movie is great for a mature intelligent audience. The act was fantastic and can only be overcome by writing and directing the film. This film focuses on true Americans, past generation, stereotypes, or racism, only those who have gathered and realized the true meaning of life. This movie is about loss and coping. Instead of choosing Psychiatry, it defines it, not as someone who is magically healing, but rather through the need to talk about your feeling of an impartial person in whom you can trust, it will not judge you, but will guide you through your thoughts. This movie is amazing!
