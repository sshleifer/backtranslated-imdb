I've seen Zu: Warriors in Magic Mountain. In this film, decoration takes place in the mountains of China, Legend Zu looks like another dimension! I thank Tsui Hark for the extensive use of CGI effects. He is able to express his vision of the mountains that float above the clouds, a country in which the beings fly freely and powers ranging from sharp wings, from swords and from the ultra-cold blind moon. many characters in this regard, the emphasis is mainly on King Sky and Enigma. The romantic look is there, although the film seems much darker than its predecessor. Cecilia Cheung is beautiful and her presence on the screen makes this movie worth watching. At first, I like the likeness of the Countess (Zu Warriors) and she does the Enigma well when dealing with her past life. By the way, did I mention that Cecilia is very eye-catching? In fact, Zu Warriors had more comedy elements and his special effects were limited due to his time since 1983. Tsui Hark takes him to a whole new level and sets a new standard in cinema.
