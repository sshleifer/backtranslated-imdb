Love Rosario Dawson, you think she is one of the most beautiful actresses of the modern age. The descent seems to be more about empowering than anything else. It is consistently subtle in everything in the movie. Dialogue is flat, the characters seem intentional and one-sided intention. The only consistency is the representation of self-empowerment in characters and Rosario's journey from empowerment to loss of empowerment and again. <br /> <br /> Pitching as a classic rape is not appropriate and that's probably why so many people do not enjoy the movie. Standard "violated" audience would not particularly like this movie, and maybe that's the point? The film puts more questions than answers and faces the target audience, whether they like it or not. There is a convincing relationship between the characters and the target audience, and while the movie does not shoot the audience alongside the face with a self-contained boldness, it engages the viewer for what may or may not be, for all the wrong reasons. > <br /> The descent is a good film that IMHO does not give too much.
