Orson Welles' first film is a triumph to the third man with Joseph Cotton. He is also wonderful in the touch of evil. See them all! He tends to get a pompous and self-serving job in movies like F is for fake, really waste film. Do not waste your time watching you. is really ignorant. Orson Welles is a movie icon and anyone studying the movie should see everything filmed. All his leading ladies are extraordinary, but Welles eventually became drunk, like his character in "A Touch of Evil"! For some reason, Orson Welles had a way with women, I see how he might be considered attractive in his youth, not like Gary Cooper or Joseph Cotton, or Cary Grant, John Wayne, I could go further, but I deviate. and because I am a woman, I see the attraction towards him. He (Orson Welles) is one of the last true producers of films and if you do not count on those who made the film today: Tarantino, Scorsese, Spike Lee, most of the filming does not measure up to those who shot Forties! I know there are many more today's filmmakers, but in such a short time I can not call them all. No offense to any of the great filmmakers of this millennium! August 21, 2006. Please remember some of the current and future film producers, I do not want to be stuck in the past! I love some of the movies, but rarely there is a list of "the best 100". "Hustle and Flow" was great, so it was "Fargo" and "Oh, Brother, where are you," from line on Sullivan's journeys; another great movie of the forties! Can someone give me a best list for the 90s and up to 2006? I'd like to know who to watch! Thank you! Also props to this site! Where else can connect a movie or a boo it! I like to realize the laughter of ordinary people like me who can say what I want and I promise you not to ruin a movie for someone who has not seen it yet!
