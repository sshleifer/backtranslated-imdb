Charleton Heston wore one, James Franciscus wore one, but Mark Wahlberg opts not to tattoo his traditional cloth. I hope nobody throws him like Tarzan. Linda Harrison wore a bikini in the first two Planet films, but Estrella Warren does not look devoid of hair - her hair is always in her way. Tim Burton could have sex with this simian saga and would have given adults in the audience something to look at. Even the inherited Helena Bonham Carter never comes out of her suit, which looks like a big curtain. It's nice, but all love stuff is limited to anxious looks and a little kiss at the end. As in Artificial Intelligence that discusses sex on species between robots and humans, but never offers - The Monkey Planet alludes to romanticism in species between humans and monkeys, but only suppositions. Lisa Marie is the only monkey who dares to be sexy. This film has three great actors, Tim Roth, Ms. Carter & Paul Giamatti, who chew the landscape like a trio of monkeys and are fun to watch. Superlative make up (a certain Oscar) costumes, sets, music make this movie a summer movie since 2001.
