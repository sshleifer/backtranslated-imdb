Yes, I did, as I sit here with the red girl, reminding me that I felt almost guilty when I watched him a few weeks before, while my wife chose to see something inconsistent (in comparison) like Mommie Draga. <br /> How do we explain the "Batman and Robin" call - the only ones ever to count, Adam West and Burt Ward. It was a terrific show, with terrible plots and terrible actors - and, yes, it was great fun! And the same applies to this movie "reunion" and "flashback". Adam and Burt are invited to an auction where the old Batmobile will be sold for charity. But it's stolen, and our friends (like themselves) are jumping in the characters of their old characters (if not in their costumes) and heading to find out what's happened. Along the way I remember the series and see how they all gathered in flashbacks, with Jack Brewer and Jason Marsden playing young Adam and Burt on the TV series. In fact, it was quite interesting for some behind the scenes to look at the old series, and Adam and Burt just turned to character (even if they were not really in character - you should have followed him to see What I mean.) It was also great to see Julie Newmar and Frank Gorshin. If you're not a fan of the old series, you'll hate it. If you forbade the sky - you thought Michael Keaton and George Clooney made "acceptable" battles, then you would hate even more. But if you grew up with Adam and Burt and you are still willing to admit that you have never lost an episode - well, that's for you. Yes, it's true - 9/10
