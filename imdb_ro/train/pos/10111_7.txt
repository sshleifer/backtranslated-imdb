The haunted world of Edward D. Wood, Jr. is not a particularly good document. From an aesthetic point of view, it is unclear and inexpensive, the people in it are tangent, which makes it very unfocused and incoherent, but this adds to its charm. I say this because it is a documentary about a freak who made strange shots and surrounded himself with other colleagues and as such there really is no other way to document the life and career of the man and his crew of corpses. There are a few minds of understanding both in genius and in Wood's inertia, and the portrayal of both qualities is a credit for the documentary's authenticity. Generally, it's worth a watch for the fan of wood and the cinema in general, but do not expect the brilliance here. Wait for a documentary made by Wood's heart.
