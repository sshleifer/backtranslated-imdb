I saw the first movie at a festival. There have been many good movies, but some have kept me thinking a lot about that, and one insomniac's nightmare was certainly one of them. Tess is certainly a talented director. The photos were great. Casting was perfect. Dominic shone in the role he has done perfectly. They did not have much to know about his character, but she wrote the story so we cared about it. And Ellen ... I can not wait to see where it's done! She has a lot of talents and I hope she does some other movies too. With all the millions of dollars that are trying to get a cheap emotion, Tess shows that everything is not necessary as long as there is a good story and actors. Kudos to everyone involved in this movie. And thanks to Tess and that. for DVD distribution!
