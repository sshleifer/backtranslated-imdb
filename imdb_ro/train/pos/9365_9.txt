I saw that on a last night's visit. I was completely upset at how much better this movie was than what I expected. Not too many movies can combine the dark comedy with the current drama of the event and can not separate it in the end. I do not mind too much to see the plot, because I think the less you know about that movie is doing so much better. But I will say that Adam Sandler's performance was really refreshing and real. It was fun and much more fun than his latest comedies. Don cheadle was credible as always. This movie is not funny like Borat or Billy Madison, but it has a good rhythm about it. I would say that 90% of the audience laughed for most of the movie. Midway through the film slows down to tackle the end of the drama of things and makes it a very nice job to tie them all together. I also thought it was really cool how instead of playing the whole black friend / white friend who chose to ignore it and focus on relationships.
