The most anticipated film of 2002. After three and a half years of hibernation, Rajini starred in this film. Hype for this movie was toooooo great .. This is not a typical Rajini movie, in this film he also offers some spiritual messages. But it also includes typical Rajini actions, style, songs, etc. It's a good entertainment film and it also offers good messages. I will evaluate this movie as Good instead of Excellent because of the scenario. You have to watch her. Do not miss!
