I really enjoyed this movie. it's dark, it's not a bullet-escaping, car-watching cushions the action film of the brain. many backgrounds and motivations of the characters are quite vague, leaving the viewer to come to their own conclusions. it's nice to see a movie where the director allows the spectator to make his own minds. Finally, motivated by love or revenge or the desire to repent - makes what feels to be "right". "Will God ever forgive us for what we have done?" - is not a question that mortal people can answer - so it does what he feels he has to do, what is good at what he has been instructed to do. Denzel Washington is a great actor - he honestly can not think of a bad movie he has done - and he has a strong cast. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
