This supernatural thriller Peter Weir is truly one of the most haunting and fascinating films ever seen. Richard Chamberlain has the best interpretation here as an Australian lawyer who defends a group of young Aborigines accused of murder. As he approaches the case, he discovers more about the main culprit, Chris, and last but not least about himself. Chris tells him it is a Mulch, which seems to be a race of supernatural beings who lived in Australia thousands of years ago. At the same time, the extraordinary high precipitations confirm the Aboriginal prophecy of LAST WAVE, which will drown the world. Dream sequences and supernatural effects enhance this movie and make it a spectacular experience. Olivia Hamnett and David Gulpilil are solid in supporting roles, as well as a difficult-headed head that portrays Charlie, the old Aborigin that can turn into an owl. The climax and the end do not disappoint, unlike many other supernatural thrillers that collapse after a promising hour. However, this can not be called a pure thriller. It is also a drama and talks about spirituality and spiritual identity in the modern world. A gorgeous work by Peter Weir, the master of stunning drama.
