I saw this movie when it was released when I was 12 years old :) And I still remind you of the wonderful scenes of how the hero / heroine escapes every time you face danger :) And the best feature of the movie it was portraying the villain! I think many so-called action movies have copied many "scenes of escape" in this movie! And it's not only that I never feel impressed when I see such a copy, it always increases my appreciation for this masterpiece! :) The main actors acted wonderfully. The slow and realistic development of chemistry without a heroine and heroine was extremely natural and marvelously portrayed. Like children, I felt that the love that she developed was very natural. The way they face and overcome all their trials and tribulations together is something that can even make children realize the value of love, sacrifice, and true care. I recommend everyone to see this movie when given a chance! --Vijay.
