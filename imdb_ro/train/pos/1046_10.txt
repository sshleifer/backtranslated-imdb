Probably my favorite movie, a story of altruism, sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause, but it is not a preaching or a boring one. She never ages, despite having seen him 15 or more times in the last 25 years. Paul Lukas's show brings tears to my eyes, and Bette Davis, in one of her really nice roles, is a delight. Children are, as their grandfather says, rather "dressed in cats" than children, but that makes them more fun to look at. And the mother's slow awakening to what's happening in the world and under her roof is credible and surprising. If I had a dozen fingers, everyone would be "up" for this movie.
