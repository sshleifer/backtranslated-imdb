I absolutely love this movie and really want to have it one day. It's just a fascinating legend about an eagle wearing a turquoise necklace, I liked it and I would like to see it again! I do not remember much about this, but a native American boy lives in a beautiful village with his family and I do not remember what's going on, but he should go to the wilderness alone. His sister packs some food and leaves. While they are there, other Indian boys leak out, put some feathers on it and turn into an eagle. The legend says that if you ever see an eagle wearing a turquoise necklace, this is the boy. I have always been fascinated by legends, especially the legends of American natives and I would love to see one day on a DVD, ANSWER, anyone who is concerned!
