I do not think a movie like this would be released today. It takes time to show the depth of the characters, and the plot is not full of twists and turns to keep you on the edge of the chair. But what does this film have: an interesting study of how families deal with pain. How, when the language for healing and extraordinary loss left us mute, we rely on gross emotions. Sadness without motive and patience is anger, even hate. And, unfortunately, the main character (a boy who accidentally shot him and kills his brother while hunting) in the film is given more than the right side of it. He finally leaves and moves with his grandfather (Wilford Brimley), who clearly tells him it was an accident. I have the impression that this young man knew this in his heart, but he had to hear these words from his parents and receive his forgiveness. What I liked about this film: lack of dialogue. It was an extraordinary focus on the physical reaction, the facial expressions. And the slower pace of the movie allows you to truly watch the actors' reactions. Something we do not have to do with today's movies. <br /> <br />
