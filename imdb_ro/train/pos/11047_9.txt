We were waiting a few years before this movie was released in England, but in many ways it was very pleased when I finally saw it. There are a lot of great things for the movie, for the beginning of the act. It's not something I need a lot for a horror picture, but the people in this movie have all set things right. This scenario and exciting and exciting scenario, Lovecraftian's beautiful love, gives the film a real solid backbone. Add to it the doses of surreal nightmare imaginations and occasionally great gore and winning movies. He also has my favorite type of gore, supernatural, and splattery. Also, Marcus's characters, furious transsexual bodybuilding and Daisy, his lover / mentally retarded toy are really weird and sometimes disturbing and giving away, any sense of increased morbidity, madness that works well with frequent Freund's accents. This is one of the most impressive horror movies, more shocking or more than anything Hollywood can produce. My only flu was that I wanted the end to be darker in tone, but it still works, so I really would really recommend this to serious horror directors.
