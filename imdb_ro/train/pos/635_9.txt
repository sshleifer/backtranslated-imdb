I went to a small screening in advance of this movie on July 19, knowing not more than the name of a few actors and it was a fantasy / adventure search of a kind. It really is nothing like the ones I've seen and a unique story is certainly appreciated with everything that is present or soon coming into the theaters. Despite what can give the first impressions, it's not cheesy, weird, sticky or ridiculous, and it's really fun and funny. The flow is pretty well done, nothing seems to be repeated or dragged. The soundtrack, for lack of better words, is magical and adds much to the film, as opposed to simply filling silence, as is often the case in movies or television. And even if I knew what was going on in the points of view, I could not bear to stop seeing the screen; to my knowledge, no single person left the theater during the entire movie. My only flu is that there seems to be almost no marketing for this movie, and how brilliant it is that you can not find out why.
