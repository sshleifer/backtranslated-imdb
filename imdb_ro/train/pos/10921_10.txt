After reading many good reviews about this movie, I decided to take it for a move (I bought it on the DVD, hence the spin game ... I'm a dork). The beginning was everything I had hoped for, a perfect set (along with some quotes I heard on various Wu-Tang albums) about what should have been a good movie. But the plot I heard was so great, it was so predictable. Every time I saw a character (except Soparla), I guessed who the Venom was. In addition, the only cold character gets killed in the middle of the movie. Okay, so the plot was not very good, but at least there was a good kung-fu right? Wrong. The battles were very short and very few. Granted the different styles were pretty cool, but I wish the battles were longer. I was hoping to see the Lizard running and doing something crazy on the walls, but it never happened. I was hoping to see the Centipede make a short ish, but it never happened. I was hoping to see Scorpio in the movie for more than 7 minutes, but it never happened. In short, there is not much going on. Fighting is quite routine. Do not be fooled just because this movie has a plot, it does not mean it's a good one.
