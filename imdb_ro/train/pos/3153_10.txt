I will do this short and sweet, because I do not think there are many things you can tell somebody about the show that has seen only its hilarious, funny and unique one, probably the most funny for me show ever. <br /> You have to really look at understanding your humor, and I've had some episodes to really come into it, but once you've been in, do not retire. For example, in the way Hyeds's character always wants to see his friends feel like a problem, the more it happens how funny it is to become. His classic classic I mean distribution, writers, director, is just a recipe for success. An actor who thinks it's always hard is Ashton Kutcher, but I mean he's great in this show. I do not think it's possible that the Kelso character has been played by anyone else, someone else is really smart to play someone stupid. All the main characters are wonderful and would not be worth while reviewing unless I mention the cold stone fox Mila Kunis, now this is a spicy meet a ball ha ha all the jokes aside spectacular show.
