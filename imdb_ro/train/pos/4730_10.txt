The story relates to Jet Li, who has to fight against his old friends. But there is a problem, friends are super-combatants. The movie is full of blood, super action and the best stunts forever. And Lau Ching-Wan is a great co-actor. Of course, the movie has a typical HK-Fun. But I like it! In Germany, the "Black Mask" is not cut.
