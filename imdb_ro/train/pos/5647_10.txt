I do not want to attract everyone reiterating what has already been said, but this is one of the best series ever! It was a big shame when it was canceled and I hope someone will have the common sense to take it and start the series again. The good news is that it's OUT ON DVD !! I rushed to the shop and got a copy and I'm happy to say it's as good as I remembered. Gary Cole is a wonderful dark and creepy character, and all the actors were very good. It is a pity that the network has not continued. Shaun Cassidy, this is a masterpiece. Anyone who enjoys the genre and has not seen it must do so. You will not be disappointed. My daughter who was too young to see her when she was on television (she's 20 years old) gets very interested and will soon be a fan. She finds "very twisted" and enjoys the episodes she has seen. I can not wait to see episodes that have not been broadcast. This spectacle of stones !!!!
