There is a bit of trivia that should be highlighted about a scene at the beginning of the movie in which Homer follows the attempt of December 6, 1957 (at least this was the movie used on the TV he was watching) that showed the attempt to launch Vangard, which failed. He is the next to point out or dictate a letter to Dr. Von Braun who has condolences about failure. Von Braun was at the Marshall Flight Center in Huntsville for the army. The Vanguard project was made by the early NASA team, which soon became Goddard Space's flight center. The army rushed with Jupiter-C, which was essentially a US-produced V2 technology, but worked to launch the satellite in response to Russia's success with Sputnik. This mistake was actually made by Homer, because of the notoriety of Von Braun, but his team did not try to fail. In fact, Redstone underwent a flight of 52 years and was the first American man to use for Shepard's orbital flight, as well as Grissom's. That's why this movie is so good, we hope it will inspire people to read and see these fragments of trivia, and in this process let's see what has been done and inspired to do more.
