Why this movie has disappeared into the shadows is an absolute crime. "Conan" is perhaps the only Sword and Sorcery movie better. The brutal violence, cool character designs and good rhythm make it one of the best fantasies around. It's definitely the biggest animated film targeting a more adult audience I've ever seen. This is not similar to Bakshi's usual frenzy. It is a departure for Bakshi and, in my opinion, his best work. I hope this movie gets the recognition it deserves.
