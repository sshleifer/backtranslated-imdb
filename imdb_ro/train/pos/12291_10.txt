A real classic. Pretty filmed and acted. Discover a Paris area that is alive and full of comedy and tragedy. Although the "Hotel du Nord" area and the hotel itself exists, it is not as homosexual (in the original sense of the word) and joy as it once was. The film makes an anagnise for the past, which has been lost, with a sigh and bitterness.
