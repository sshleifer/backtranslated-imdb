While the movie feels a bit long sometimes, it's well worth it. Gordon directs in a style that reminds you of Vonnegut's writing styles. Unfortunate, thoughtful, ironic, weird and dark, this is a movie that will stay with you for a long time, asking for answers to impossible questions. Nolte, Goodman and Arkin are incredible. Sheryl Lee is also wonderful, in a role that will remind us of Lynch fans of her days Laura / Maddy. Do not miss this!
