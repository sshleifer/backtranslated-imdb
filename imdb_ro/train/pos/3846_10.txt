in fact, I like Verhoeven because in his film, I enjoy a story full of pschoseosexual that I saw in "Basic Instinct". It's a wonderful thriller that I really liked. So it's obvious for me to watch this other Verhoeven movie is fine, it's its previous direction before its blocker hit the "Basic Instinct" block and that's why I was really curious to watch the movie and yes, has fulfilled hope and hope. <br /> <br /> This "Fourth Man" movie is a brilliant drama of psycosexual, which is a small lighted complex for an audience. the story of this film is about a gay writer called "Reve" (Krabbe), an alcoholic who lives through his own moral values ​​and sees many visions that can warn him of a future accident. After completing his lecture, he introduces a seductive woman named Christine, who has a mysterious past she does not want to reveal. Have sex with her because she is a boy. The following morning he watches her sexy, macho face on her table, the person she met at the station. She's curious to meet him and tell Christine to invite him to her. I do not want to reveal the whole story because it's a Verhoeven movie, and the end of the movie is really surprising! Especially, I like the character "Reve," which is brilliantly played by "Krabbe". He looks like he is being identified as a homosexual person with his character and yes, I like his charming face. I would like to thank Mr.Verhoeven for making such a black comedy. br /> <br /> I rate this movie: 10 out of 10.
