I hired it a few years ago, the video store had only VHS at that time. Straight to video has been hit by his footsteps (you know, where the covers cover using the same fonts and color schemes of successful films). I did not know what to expect except printed ones. The first thing I thought while I was watching was "what the hell is wrong with the sound?" - Obviously, there was no doubled dialogue. The words rushed, so I stopped eating everything I needed to pay more attention - you think there is no Shakespeare here! The story is pretty simple, the boy meets the girl, etc. What seemed humorous and hearty to me was that people in the film did not look like cartoons written in the story, but rather non-actors who temporarily withdrew from their real places included). At the same time, you begin to feel what the producer does, then see that there are no attempts at cheap humor (people hurt them privately, using vulgarities, this could not have affected marketing.) There was something honest about to stay. if they had a bigger budget then it would have been better, which I'm sure they considered daily, but they did it and they did it. That's how I felt the film about the independent film. "Indy" is thrown around as if it were a Gen..Ha! ... that's funny!
