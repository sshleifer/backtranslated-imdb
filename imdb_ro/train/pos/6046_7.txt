I was pleasantly surprised by the movie. Let's face it; the premise does not seem particularly attractive when it had to surrender money for a night night, but it was a light nature that won one. There were no moments I found disturbing and I doubt I will remember the next day, but that does not fail as a beautiful diversion. What seemed funny to me was watching her here in Peking with my Chinese girlfriend who never understands anything I like. I told her he had a plot - three guys have to get some weeds in London. She does not satisfy her too much. There is no problem going here for the room, which I expected after reading some comments. However, they make exception to comparison with Andree and Withnail; not in the same league, and I doubt it intended to be. www.imperialflags.blogspot.com
