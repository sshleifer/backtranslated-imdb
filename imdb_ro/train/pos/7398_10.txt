Xizao is a rare movie. It is simple and undemanding and at the same time so full of satisfaction in excitement and joy. The story is simple, and the theme of the old and new conflicts is great in the first scenes. This theme is the essence of the film, but it would have fallen, if it were not the magnificent characters and the actors who would have portrayed them. The aged Patriarch, Master Liu, is a relic of the Chinese pre-expansion days. He runs a bathing house in an old neighborhood. Every scene in the bathroom is a source of jealousy for us, stressed, unhappy people. Even chronicles can not be found in this wonderful situation. Liu Er's mentally handicapped sons is the second truly powerful character in the movie, along with his modern brother. The interactions between these three people and the various visitors to the bathroom are amazingly detailed and heartfelt, and some scenes that have so much excitement are beyond everything they see in movies. - Critical message, this film was not only censored, but also covered with low hardness. It could be a coincidence, but when a movie of this caliber is virtually impossible to find, even on the internet (!), You can not help to become a suspect. So, help your freedom of speech and the world movie, buy, rent, copy this wonderful movie, and if you happen to own the DVD, if there is one, then share the action!
