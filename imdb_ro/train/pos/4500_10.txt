Hunky Geordie Robson Green is Owen Springer, a young doctor who moves home to Manchester to be near his father. Along the way, he falls for Anna, a 20-year-old senior woman who happens to be the wife of his new boss, Richard Crane. Despite the warnings of new colleagues, Owen continues to bring Anna, going so much as to sabotage Anna and cheat Richard's marriage. This is a romantic drama with many subtleties of humor and a quick spirit. The actors are gorgeous: Green from "Student Prince" and "Touching Evil" smolders on the screen as cunning Owen but warm-hearted; Annis of fame "Dune" is lively and turns out to be a good fit with Green; The kitchen, from "To play the King" is the right threat that Richard, whose comic mistakes and snobbery highlights the mastery of his hatred, building for Owen. This is a perfect triangle of love, and despite the weaknesses and errors of our three characters, you better get to know them and watch them.
