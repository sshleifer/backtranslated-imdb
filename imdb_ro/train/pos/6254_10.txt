I just saw this movie at the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival. The title was "Dog Days". The audience response was mixed. Some people have found that graphic sex and realistic violence are too much for them. Others seemed to really appreciate how good this movie was. This film is not for the weak of the heart. It is like "sex happiness" with explicit sex and a less optimistic vision of humanity. There are animal intoxications, a sting of an elderly citizen, an orgy bath in a shopping center, a penetration of anal lump and the molestation of the mentally incompetent. If it sounds too much to do This film is the most desperate and pathetic humanity. "The banality of our existence is pushed to our face with the greatest joy." Seidl has no interest in redeeming humanity here. he? This film presents excellent performances from all involved, is always interesting and is probably the most intelligent social statement to be made on film over time.
