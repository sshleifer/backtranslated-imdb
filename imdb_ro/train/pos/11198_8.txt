Hitchcock shows his already developed vision for visuals in this silent early film. The film, which involves two boxers fighting a girl, is a direct drama without much to recommend. Hitchcock's talent, however, is in his stunning use of images. Almost every film is full of visual symbols. Especially memorable are the jewels that a boxer gives to the girl just before marrying the other boxer. She slides it on her arm in a clear and simple way. Hitch showed us everything we need to know. Boxing scenes are treated well with some interesting photos from the point of view that prove again how far Hitchcock was. The film also provides insight into its subsequent treatment of women. The subject of boxers' wishes is driven by money and cravings, not by reason or love. The only other women in the movie are either beautiful party girls who make open sex deals or old chronicles that help destroy happy relationships. In total, the ring is a must for anyone interested in Hitchcock's early work and his development as a visual narrator.
