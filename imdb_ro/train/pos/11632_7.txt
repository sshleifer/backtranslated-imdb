Greetings again in the dark. What relief ... a thriller that actually is thrilling! The new girl Rachel McAdams ("The Wedding Crashers" and "The Notebook") dominates the time spent on screen in this wonderful thriller, from the famous director Wes Craven ("Scream" and "A Nightmare on Elm Street"). Craven even has a cameo as one of the passengers on the plane. What makes it work is the realism of the first 15-20 minutes when we see that McAdams interacts with 4 or 5 people either in person or on the phone. It's a natural one. When he meets Cillian Murphy ("The Scarecrow" in "Batman Begins") in what seems to happen, the movie really goes. Watching the two types of yuppie butterflies, while the audience knows something is bad, is to make the shooting courage! The success of the embarkation plan is fascinating, and the 30 minutes on board are claustrophobic. Craven keeps us guessing about the involvement of others and if someone comes to save her. As with many thrillers, the only contempt occurs during the climax when the lamb turns into a superhero. An interesting plot plot makes us believe that a little Rachel needs the frustrations to see this, but we can only help but hurry a little. The busiest scenes involve guests of the hotel, an annoying airline passenger, Cillian and FX injury to the hotel. The strength of the film lies in the development of characters and psychological gaming among the leaders. Unfortunately, fine screen veteran Brian Cox is under-utilized, but this is generally a suspense thriller above average that is worth seeing for everyone except the finals.
