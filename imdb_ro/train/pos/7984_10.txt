The man on fire is definitely one of the best drama / crime thrillers I've ever seen. Although it has a slow start, the story is so amazingly complex and sensible that it is lacking pretty well. This is the perfect role of Denzel Washington playing a guardian called Creasy, who is tormented by his past and is alcoholic, but never gives up his job to save his last protector, Pita. Dakota Fanning interprets Pita, the very intelligent and enthusiastic little girl who loves so many things and acts in a very convincing manner, has a great future ahead of her. As I said the story is somewhat complicated, to fully understand it, you have to watch it a few times. This movie is made in two parts, it is the first hour in which everyone is happy, nothing is wrong, everyone lives their happy life until the kidnapping of Pita and where Creasy is almost killed. And then it's the second part, the rest of the movie, from which suddenly everything becomes complicated and somewhat frightening and disturbing when Creasy recovers from serious injury and begins to chase away and kill the many criminals and "La Hermamdad" responsible for planning and executing abduction to Pita. Denzel Washington shows us the most current acting talents alongside many other talented actors who have a great future ahead of them. It is a real shame that this film has not been sufficiently recognized, Washington really deserves another Oscar for its performance, and Fanning and the director. And maybe even the visual effects that were of very high quality. If you like thrillers excellent, slightly disturbing, suspicious, this is the one to be seen. The most amazing thing is that the elements of this movie are actually based on a real story and real characters! 10/10
