Moonwalker by Michael Jackson is a true adventure film for the whole family! Before we start the real story of the movie, we get a show of the Bad tour (The Man in the Mirror) and start a great movie. After that, we get a kind of Michael carrier collage, as it was before Moonwalker came out in 1988. After a few music videos (Speed ​​Demon, Leave Me Alone etc.), the story begins. <br /> <br /> The plot is that Michael and his three friends (who are children) are being watched by the bad guy of the "Mr. Big" story because they have discovered his evil plans to make children all over the world to feed on drugs. During the pursuit we see fantastic segments, fx. Michaels video for Smooth Criminal, which is absolutely fantastic with its dance sequences, etc. But then one of the children is kidnapped by Mr. Big, and Michael will decide to save her before he becomes addicted to the drug. <br /> <br /> During the movie we see special effects not only amazing for those days, but also impressive today. For example, see Michael turning to a robot / space ship to protect his friends! The film ends with a Come Together show (later published in Michaels's double album of HIStory), and leave the movie with a magical sentiment. Amazing! I recommend this for every family who wants to spend a nice night with candy and popcorn in front of the TV. And now some parents can get up and say, "But Michael Jackson is a supposed child abuser!" Yes, he is indeed, but, come on, we all know it is not true! Wait and see ..
