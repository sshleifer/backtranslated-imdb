Bar of some of the controversial shareholders (there musicians at the end of the day), this in Quentin Tarrinno's words is "The best rock movie ever made ... period" Think 8 Mile, but without being kidnapped - a young musician, trying to prove themselves to the local community as they struggle to cope with a broken house and a rival band. Drop in the sexual interest and truly exceptional performances, this is real 8 miles. The Prince offers solid performance, just like Morris Day and Jerome Benton. Decent scene, good direction, great plot and spectacular shows. Do not forget about the best rock / pop / funk music you'll ever hear.
