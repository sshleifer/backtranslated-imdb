Lost is one of a kind ... so charming and full of suspense, emotion and emotion all at the same time. I have never seen any television series like this before. It's full of jungle and has a good script. The actors have felt life on an island in such a natural way that I feel lost on the island while watching it. It's an excellent piece of work, narrated in a very intelligent form. The series is like a film describing life survivors lost on a deserted island. I am tempted to see one episode after another and I highly recommend series for all TV fans. Follow it to see the magic of losing nowhere.
