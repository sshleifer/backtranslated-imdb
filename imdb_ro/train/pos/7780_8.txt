Robert Stiva did not really get over the loss of Best Supporting Actor Oscar for Kyle's "Wind Writing" role for Anthony Quinn's 12 minute performance in "Lust for Life." Stack plays the alcoholic son deeply troubled by an oil tycoon. He lived his life in the shadow of his friend, Mitch, played by Rock Hudson. Both love the same woman, Lucy, (Lauren Bacall), who becomes Kyle's wife. Kyle's sister, Marylee (Dorothy Malone), is a drunk whore who is in love with Mitch. Their story plays in glorious color under the direction of Douglas Sirk, who has dominated the melodramatic field with some incredible movies, including "Imitation of Life," "All Sky Permit," "Obsession Magnificent," and many more. Do not make any mistake - this is a potboiler and stack and Dorothy Malone takes full advantage of their roles, Malone has won a Best Oscar Actress. There is an amazing scene mentioned in other reviews, where she dances full of music as her father collapses and dies on the ladder. We're convinced Marylee is sleeping with everyone, including the guy who pumps the gas, because he's in love with Mitch. Mitch does not want to be in touch with her. He is so in love with Lucy that, out of loyalty to Kyle, he wants to go to work in Iran to avoid temptation. I doubt he would be so anxious to get there today, no matter how in love he was. Hudson and Bacall have less interesting roles here - Hudson's Mitch is the good guy who cleaned Kyle's messes for his entire life, and Bacall is Mitch's wife who is in a nightmare when her husband starts drinking new after a year of sobriety. Sirk focuses on more volatile players. In Sirk's hand, "Written on the Wind" is an effective film and the big scene towards the end of the mansion is particularly interesting. The director had a gift for this type of film, and although he had many imitators, he never had a tie.
