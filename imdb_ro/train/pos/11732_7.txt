Okay, I saw that in the theater when it came out and I do not know why. I have not seen it since, but I got to this page because I woke up thinking about this movie - again I do not know why. But the fact that I remember talking volumes. Comedy is hard - much harder than any drama. Making it right makes it easy, but does it harm ... is it worse than a bad comedy? Steve Martin, be careful, you're in this category again, for some reason. Elvira Mistress Of The Dark must have done well for me to be happy to remember this movie. Written at a fast pace with tongue in the cheek and knowing it's not the story of Philedelphia, it has fun from start to finish. The donor's brain is another one that fits exactly in this category (sans most boobs joke free). A point of discussion - the end. It seems that the writers / directors had no idea how to finish a comedy. The end tries to be a love story, subverting to some extent the odd, fast dialogue, until that moment. Then there is the silence scene. While this must be seen (the opinion of men), it is so high and out of place, it is like a shock. There was another rewriting to finish. It's not a comedy genius such as Spinal Tap or Producers or the Holy Grail. But if you do not try to dissect it and just let it go chaos and fun, you'll laugh, we guarantee you.
