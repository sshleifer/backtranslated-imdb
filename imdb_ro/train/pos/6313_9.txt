Five guys who organize the crime - with very little brain capacity.Brothers Anthony and Joe Russo are the directors from Welcome to Collinwood (2002). It's a comedy that is often very funny. You can not laugh when everything goes wrong with these guys. actors playing these characters.William H.Macy plays Riley.Isaiah Washington is Leon.Sam Rockwell is Pero.Michael Jeter is Toto.Andy Davoli is Basil.Gabrielle Union plays his love interest Michelle.Jennifer Esposito plays Pero love interest Carmela.George Clooney (also the producer) interprets Jerzy, the guy tattooed in a wheelchair. This is a very fun movie. I certainly recommend it.
