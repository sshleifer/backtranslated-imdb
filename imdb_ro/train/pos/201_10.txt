Marion Davies, great and undervalued, portrays his stuff in this silent comedy (1928), featuring the wonderful William Haines. Davies plays a Georgia trick, which collapses Hollywood with Haines. They appear in cheap comedies until Marion is "discovered" and becomes a dramatic star. A great lamp at Hollywood and her claims. Davies & Haines are a wonderful team (too bad they have never talked together) and the photos from Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glynn and Marion Davies it) are a hoot. A necessity for any serious movie bravo or anyone interested in Marion Davies still stabbed!
