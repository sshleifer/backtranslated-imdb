It's so rare to find a literary work translated appropriately on the screen, so it seems to me that I've rated this film more than it deserves, but not much. As a long-time student of Vonnegut's works, I do not hesitate to recommend the recommendation of his readers' film, at least to those who love him as I do. The Tower is inspired: Nolte is underestimated in triumph, amazed in defeat, decisive in court. Sheryl Lee is full of love, but her handling of the rebellious Resi and her tragic crescendo almost makes you forget her beauty. Alan Arkin offers a totally loving Soviet spy, but equally treacherous. You do not feel that you have to read Mother Night to appreciate the movie; though, if you have not read Mother Night, you'll probably want to see the movie. Notice the changes in color to black and white and back and do not miss the final symbolism of Campbell's anger. Watch also for Kurt Vonnegut's movie, close to the end of the movie. Bing Crosby's "White Christmas" will never sound the same (I write in mid-December, and drive the walnuts).
