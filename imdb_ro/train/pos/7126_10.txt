This movie resonated with me on two levels. As a child, I was evicted from London and planted unconditional hosts in a rural village. While I got rid of bombardment and had experiences that produced precious memories (for example, hearing a night night, singing a dark night for the first time) and enjoying a life I could never have in London, I missed my family and I worried. Tom is an old man whose husband and child have died and died and live alone in a small village village. Like an old man who is now without a wife whose children have married and live far away in another province, I am once again alone. The boy's mother is a religious fan, with very strange ideas to raise the baby. Since a deep affection has grown between the old Tom Oakley and this young boy, Tom goes looking for him and finally saves him from very strange and dangerous circumstances. At the end of the story there is a lot of tension because, due to some bureaucratic regulation, it seems that the child will lose someone who has developed a loving relationship with him.
