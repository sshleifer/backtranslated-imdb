I saw this on the big screen and I was encapsulated with him. Queen Victoria's younger years are a mystery and this is a perfect description of how a young girl has been entrusted to one of the most important roles in the world. The script is perfect, the act is amazing, history and attention to the details are from this world. Emily Blunt is perfect like Victoria. Funny how her mother is interpreted by Elizabeth 1 and William IV is interpreted by Prince Albert! (Think Blackadder). This portrait of Victoria shows she was a rebellious young woman once - I'm sure she'd been on the Jeremey Kyle Show if she'd been around then: "My mom and her boyfriend are trying to steal my life." One Piece perfect from much of British history and the Commonwealth.
