I would say it's time, this movie was wonderful ... and yes, if you do not have the desire to become a Christian, then why bother you to watch it. I saw this movie after I was already saved and I found it very moving. Now I see that they have made these films to another level and created the series "Left Behind" ... they have a close comparison and certainly are more modern to reach people. I think to judge this movie, you should see it, I'm 3 or 4 in series if I'm not mistaken ... do not use our comments to judge, to see the movie for you! ! God will bless you if you follow them.
