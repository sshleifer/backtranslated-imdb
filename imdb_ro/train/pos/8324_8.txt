This is a romantic comedy in which Albert Einstein, played awesome by Walter Matthau, and Chronicle Producers plays the match with his niece (Meg Ryan) and a talented mechanic (Tim Robbins). The interaction between these major roles is amplified by an extraordinary adventure of renowned actors. This movie is cute and fun ... a "good feel"! Bad recommendations.
