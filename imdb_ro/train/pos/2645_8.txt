No film caught my attention as it does. You see, I wanted to see this movie again for over twenty-five years. The only time I saw her was like a teenager, which may have been the year he was released in 1977. What I remember about the film is that she touched those deep emotions so deeply that there is still an overwhelming desire to look again. The intrigue that this film offers through the human element of the father / son who seeks and seeks is sure to touch any human soul that pursues it. Why this movie has not been taken out of storage and shown as often as many other films of a lower depth, I do not know. PostScript: The received copy of the movie and after watching again was delighted to see that my memory is true. The rating reflects the content of the film. He would like to watch this movie on DVD because I see this 1977 production on a worn VHS tapped from general quality.
