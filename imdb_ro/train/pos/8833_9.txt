I was intrigued by the title, so, during a little beat of insomnia (fueled by my curiosity ...), I stayed and watched it. Then I checked my TV list and watched again! There is a very obvious achievement that I realized when I saw this movie - despite politics, traditions, culture, etc., adolescents everywhere are almost the same. Children's characters from Belgrade could have been transported to, say, somewhere in the Midwest of America at the same time, and language differences would be impossible to say except any local adolescents of that age. They certainly have the same growing pains and concerns, politics: music, sex, film idols, music, drink, sports, music ... In fact, the same things that have taken my time growing up in Southern California since 1970. This was a sweet story, but the joy of the young people made her very enjoyable. Characters, especially young actors, were also completely credible. I will not say it was "American graffiti," but I will say it fits perfectly with other 50-year themed films.
