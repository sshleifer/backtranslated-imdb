The first time I saw this movie, I fell in love with him. Atmosphere was the one that attracted my attention first. I expected a fest gore, but instead of looking at a very clever disaster with my head in a cool soundtrack (actually, my sound is currently P). The fact that I could not predict when he killed and disappeared was a major addition to my book. The predictable horror movies bother me. I know the story has some discrepancies, but if you're like me, you do not even notice them until the movie is over and you sit in bed because you saw a masterpiece on the move. Finally, as mentioned, the soundtrack is timeless. It's one of my favorite theater scores over time, so I was very happy to hear Rob Zombie leave him untouched in his remake. Speaking of remake, I read a very comprehensive article about him, and now that I know Mr. Zombie respects John Carpenter, I have great hopes for taking this classic. This movie is great for any moment you have a desire for a tingling spine, but it is the perfect, ultimate, ultimate addition, you call it for an All Eve movie marathon. :)
