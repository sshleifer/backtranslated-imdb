Rated NR (R rated for pervasive language and gross sexual humor). Quebec Rating: 16+ (should be 13+) Canadian Home Video Rating: 18A Eddie Murphy Delirious is Eddie's first edition in routine comedy. He appeared in 1983. Since then he has starred in the film 48 Hours and Places trading and he was on Saturday night Live.Eddie made two movie comedy stand.Delirious and Raw.I preferred Raw because I just found the subject to be more humor.Delirious, however, is also very funny with Eddie talking about childhood and fun of celebrities like Mr.T and singers like Michael Jackson. Any fan of the stand-up comedy movies should see Delirious of Eddie Murphy.
