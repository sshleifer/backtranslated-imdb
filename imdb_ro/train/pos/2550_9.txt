This is truly one of Hollywood's "Golden Age" like I do not. It's a unique, fun movie that keeps you guessing what's going to happen next. <br /> <br /> All actors are perfectly distributed and all are supporting actors. This is the first movie I've seen with Ronald Colman in him and since then I've been a fan of him. Reginald Gardiner has always been a favorite supporting actor and adds a certain quality to every movie he's in. While he played another character character here, he added something else to the movie that another actor in this character would not have added.
