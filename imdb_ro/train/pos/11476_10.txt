Day zero is based on Colombian high school massacre. and a two-boy video log. at first you do not know what will happen you think it's just a bad student movie. until they start talking about the horrible things they will do in this pretty school. until they start talking about bombs and gun rifles and shooting in the woods. there is much to say about this movie. everyone knows that this movie is a movie that you watch watching a movie and watching a real video made by two boys. the two boys behave as if they were in a strange cult. they burn all things there. such as play station games dvd books home school stuff stuff. these two boys can be any of your brothers friends or the people you see walking down the street. (and that's what a gun does), in the videos I make mentioning the harassment that's going on with them, and how people said things about the clothes there and the things you're in, do not say my right, but many people do things like to stay. And also things are with this people are suspected they like because of the sensitive subject they chose on this movie. my review on day zero. <br /> <br /> And let's just say that the scene of the filming from the end is messy.
