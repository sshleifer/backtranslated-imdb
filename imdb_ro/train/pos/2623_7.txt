I really like the original, and this movie has ups and downs. Here are just a few: Ups: Most of the original voice came back. Downs: I did not like Timon's Ma's voice. I know he made a voice in The Simpsons, but this show is just stupid. <br /> <br /> Ups: We have to see Simba as a "teenager." Downs: They lost it with a slogan-slurping contest between Timon and Simba. <br /> <br /> Ups: Rafiki told Timon about "Hakuna Matata." Downs: How did Pumbaa know about this? Ups: Songs Again. (some of the original songs were there, but they were just background music.) Downs: But stupid songs. (as a soloist of Timon). Generally, this is a pretty good movie. I would recommend it to the fans of the original. But if you do not like the original, you may not like it. <br /> <br /> My score: 7/10
