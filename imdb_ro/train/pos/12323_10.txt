This is the best Chinese movie I've ever seen and, in my opinion, much better than the hero or tiger Chrouching, the hidden dragon. The film is a unique combination of several genres: it's a beautiful story of love, action movie, comedy and horror at the same time. And the most amazing thing is that it really succeeds in all this! This movie definitely makes my top 5, and it should be enjoyable for every film lover. The sequences of action have the jump and even the traditional unrealistic flight, but the way it is shot differs greatly from Hero's style and the flight always looks great and usually makes sense (the ghosts can fly) <br /> < > Watch this movie, you will not regret it. 10/10
