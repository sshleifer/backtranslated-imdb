Telemundo should definitely consider creating a new Xica DVD collection! I know many people, including myself, who would like to be able to buy the Xica novel! It is a very fun novel, which is established in Brazil. The costumes of the actors are beautiful and the city where the novel is being performed is beautiful. Xica contains a lot of history of that time. I wish Telemundo to broadcast it again, even if it was 2 in the morning. I would highly recommend watching Xica if it's ever shown Telemundo again. I sent a Telemundo email a million times to show the novel again, but my motives fell on deaf ears. The only warning about Xica is that from time to time it contains some harsh scenes I would recommend that children under the age of 14 do not look at Xica. Overall, Xica deserves 10 out of 10!
