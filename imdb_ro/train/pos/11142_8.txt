Just joking. Looking for greener green hills in New York City, Jon Voight is Joe Buck's teenage youngster Cowboy (Texas). It does not take too long for Big Apple to swallow him ruthlessly and his ambitions whole and very soon Joe is the target of both the cold of New York and the evil of the masters. Given his clean heart, he is pitying for one of these criminals, Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) and later moves with him to the apartment wreck and the two struggle literally to survive. While Midnight Comedy is labeled as a drama, it is best described as a tragic comedy or comic tragedy in my opinion. It is, above all, a beautiful film that is elegant in capturing the contemporary hippie-vibe of the late 1960s, with Warhol's obligatory film, banished by his vows with ultra-urban New York City. The film turns Cowboy Joe Buck somewhere between them, emphasizing his position outside. We feel for his struggle to fit but also to get just enough money to feed Ratso Rizzo. Cowboy at midnight brought tears to my eyes because it is also rich in substance and projects a lot of heart. I imagine that this film must have inspired both Forest Gump with its heart-filled and out-of-place character and, to a certain extent, the Crocodile Dundee movies because it deals with almost the same kind of humor - a contrast between the country - cowboys and cosmopolitanists in New York. Very impressive and sensational creative film that I highly recommend. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
