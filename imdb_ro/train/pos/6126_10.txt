I saw Jack Frost for 4:00 at my local store and I thought it looked pretty good for a low-budget movie, so I bought it and I was right that it was good. For starters, this movie is about a killer snowman, so it's something to laugh at and how it looks funny compared to the snowman on the cover. <br /> <br /> The actor was fine and the Jack Frost lines said that I was laughing, "I just turned you to smoke" and "The most pirate world in the snow cone" how amusing and camp is to stay? The story from the beginning was pretty fun and bad. "Jack was agile, Jack was fast, Jack was looking for candlesticks." If you're looking for a horror of B-Movie Comedy full of words, check Jack Frost out. 10/10
