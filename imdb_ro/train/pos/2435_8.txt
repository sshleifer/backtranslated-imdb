I never thought an old cartoon would tear my eyes! When I first bought Casper & Friends: Spooking About Africa, I wanted so much to see Casper's first cartoon titled "The Ghost Friendly" (1945), but when I saw the next cartoon "Good Boos To-Night" (1948) made me give up! I could not believe how sad and tragic it was after seeing Casper's fox killed! I've never seen that before in the other Casper cartoons! This is the saddest of all! It was so depressing that I could not look again. It's like seeing Lassie at the end of a movie. I know it's a classic, but it's too much for our old cartoon fans to handle me like me! If I wanted to see something old and classic, I rather see something happy and funny! But when I think about this cartoon cartoon, I'm thinking about my cats!
