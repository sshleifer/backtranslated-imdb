Rain or shine in the open air, you enter a cinema house. It makes you happy. (If not, go out immediately.) The lights are off. Place yourself with a bar of ice cream. Moving images begin to blink on the screen. You feel satisfied. In the dark, you returned to the beginning of time. Sitting around the campfire ... looking at the modern version of the flaming flames 24 times per second and sharing the joy of discovering the unknown twists and twists of the script with the rest of the clan / spectators. <br /> <br /> Those who are not happy with themselves, should not write comments. (Romantic comedies live ...)
