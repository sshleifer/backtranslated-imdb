This is one of my favorite movies all the time and I would recommend it to anyone. On my favorite list of videos (mental list, mind), the only ones we find are films such as Lord of the Rings, Spirited Away and Fly Away Home. the main character Jess. At the beginning of the movie, she is a shy girl with a strange background, which has many more friends who are boys than girls. She truly embraces you in her life. Also, definitely can not come any action of the protagonist or anyone else in the movie. Football was interesting to see even for someone like me who does not know the rules. The film is never boring. Romanticism is really cute and does not make me blush too hard! One thing that really made it was the Indian factor. Jess's parents are Indian and there are many Indian colorful conventions throughout the film, giving a very interesting cultural perspective as well as everything else. The Indian people are also hilarious! In essence, this is an age-old film about choosing the path you want and fighting for it. <br /> <br /> Feel good comedies become my favorite kind of movie because of this movie. They are fun, they are refreshing and make you feel good! ^ _ ~
