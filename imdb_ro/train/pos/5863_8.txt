Even 15 years after the end of the Vietnam War "Jacknife" did not come too late or was useless. He is one of the few who are trying to cope with the second sad part of the war: after that. Various films such as the "taxi driver" or "Rambo" who use their characters as heroes destroyed in a bad environment after the war, allow the audience to face a different view of Vietnam veterans. Their development is shown very clearly before and especially after the war. The problems are obvious, but in all this tragic there is always the feeling of hope based on love and friendship. "Jacknife" could be the quietest movie in Vietnam, but after almost 15 years this is truly plausible and therefore justified. In addition, it can make us believe that the war is not over; at least for some of us. <br /> <br /> The three main characters are amazing. De Niro has made one of the best jobs, but Ed Harris is the star of this film. Possibly, this was the best performance so far.
