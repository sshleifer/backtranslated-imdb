I love Claire Danes, and Kate Beckinsale looks incredibly immature in her role. The film is wrong only because it seems that the two accused appear to be in a particular monastery, working as monks in the grass and under the discipline of strictly martial arts. Thailand's stunning movie, filmography, and colors should be clearer, but Claire Daines steals the whole movie and is unexpectedly profoundly learning the hard lesson of life itself until the end, in an act of unbelievable unexplainable unexpected in the real world. The flaws are detailed and I recommend the movie, which seems buried sad forever on rare TV shows. I want the movie for my collection - a collection of movies with only 10 "nominations. Be careful, you will be very touched.
