OK, so I do not see too many horror films - and the reason is the movie "Dark Remains". I caught this (a surprisingly full DVD) and scared me badly. In fact, the only one I think the DVD was missing was a pair of new pants. However, the next day I told someone about it when I realized that I really saw only 10% of it. Otherwise, I looked at the pizza on the coffee table - nervous that my girlfriend would catch me if I was covered with my eyes. Sometimes I bravely watched the screen I jumped so loud that I decided not to look again. The film is solid and the characters' situation was really compelling. The simplicity of the movie is what really captured my jump button - it's just a forest, a cabin and an unused prison - and a lot of darkness. The most surprising thing for me was that, although this was clearly not a multi-million dollar production, the effects of makeup looked as if it were! It is also obvious that this is a movie made by someone with great love of film. Sound design and music have made use of my surround system, as many Hollywood movies have never done. I noticed online that this movie won the LA Shriekfest - a truly important achievement, and I think the festival saw the clear talent of the filming - and probably much more of this film than we did. <br /> Lift the sound, turn off the lights and, if you want to keep your girlfriend, order a pizza.
