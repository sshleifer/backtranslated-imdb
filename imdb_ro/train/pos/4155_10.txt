What amazing episode for this fine series. This is the excellent television at its best. The story takes place in 1968 and is beautifully shot in black and white, almost in the film noir style, with deep shadows and stark images. This is a story about two men who fall in love, but I do not want to ruin it. It is a rare presentation of what homosexuals faced in the 1960s in America. Written by the magnificent Tom Pettit and directed by the great Jeannot Szwarc, we move through their lives through their mutual love and tragedy. Taking such a delicate problem makes this episode even more amazing. Our emotions are just as torn and edge as the characters. The storms fled my spine at the end, when they played brilliantly to Bob Dylan: "Ah, but I was much older then, I'm younger than now," as the Byrds sang. It goes well beyond 10 and up to the stars. Beautiful.
