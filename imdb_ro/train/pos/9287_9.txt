Several young Iranian women dress up as boys and try to enter a World Cup qualification match between Iran and Bahrain. When caught, they are enrolled in an area where the match stays in the cage, but is not visible. Prisoners plead for being released, but rules are rules. Given the pedigree of his director, Jafar Panahi, disarmament was the discovery that Offside is a comedy and a frequent comedy. In "Mirror" in 1997, Panahi presents two versions of the Iranian girl and leaves the audience wondering what is "real". In the 2000 Circle, several Iranian women are out of the system; their violations are different, but all end in the same tragic place. However, thinking about Offside now, it's hard to imagine anything other than a comedy, because the situation it poses is so obviously ridiculous. While women ask to know why they can not watch the football match and their captors struggle to respond, the only possible outcome is the comedy. What makes the Offside most affected is that young women are not portrayed as activists attacking the system. They are simply football fans and patriots and, despite the fact that they are being treated incorrectly, they never lose focus on the match and the historic victory that is in the hands of their nation.
