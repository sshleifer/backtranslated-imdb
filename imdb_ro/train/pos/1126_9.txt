My interest was raised as I passed and I saw the name of Iphigenia. My name is Eugenia, so I thought well, let's see what this is. I'm so glad I was on the canal. What a wonderful and wonderful story. Drama, sadness, some over the top, but a wonderful moment to have. I look at it and make me sad for all the disturbance that the film industry takes away and these precious stones are gone. Give Iphigenia a try and I hope you will enjoy as much as I do. I even took my children (27, 25, 20 and 17) to enjoy it. Start slowly, however, drama builds up and you will be drawn into the story. Watching this wonderful movie made me want to embrace my Greek tragedy and pathos.
