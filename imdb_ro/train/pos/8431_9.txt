] Did not you see this movie? Have not you even heard of this movie? It will not surprise me. One of the few truly "independent" films produced over the past ten years, no studio has trusted the picture and has never been taken over for major distribution. Independent company Kino Films gave BOESMAN AND LENA a very limited game, virtually without promotion, and most major film critics have not bothered to even revisit it. I think a film based on an act, a piece of play about apartheid and its impact on two people have never had a chance on today's market - and it's the smart loser loss of the film lover. , both Angela Bassett and Danny Glover deserved the nominations of Ocsar (just like the cinema), but the film has received such a fanfare that I can not even blame the academy. This is a provocative, provocative thought-provoking film, and actually asks the audience to meet it in its own terms. Considering this, it's certainly not a movie for mind-free entertainment. Director John Berry wisely does not try to dress Athol Fugard's play. Sure, we have some fractured flashbacks and some picturesque frames, but the BOESMAN AND LENA version of the film remains a story about two people living in inhumane conditions. their fundamental human rights, Boesman (Glover) and Lena (Bassett), have no one to attack, but each other. A third character joins over time (Willie Jonah, amazingly in a very silent role), but the film never strives for the characters in the title and what they have become. Bassett and Glover give courageous performance like broken torques, performance that simply could not be improved. Strong and brutal stimulation both intellectually and emotionally, BOESMAN and LENA deserve to be rediscovered by home videos. Hands down, the best movie of the year 2000.
