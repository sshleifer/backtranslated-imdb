It is always satisfactory when a detective packs a case and the killer is brought to the book. In this case, the climax gives me even more pleasure. To see the tired scorn from Abigail Mitchell's face when he realizes that the victim has left a "witness of death" that leaves no doubt about her guilt is very satisfactory. Please understand: while I admire Ruth Gordon's performance, her character really * really * irritates me. She is selfish and demanding. She makes her own way by putting into practice a act of "little girl" that is embarrassing to a woman of her age. Worse, she has now settled as judge, jury, and executioner against the husband of her dead granddaughter. When Columbo approaches too much, he tries to disappoint him by manipulating him in making a cue to speak to a high class ladies audience. He turns the tables perfectly, offering a very warm and humane discourse about the realities of police work. Nothing can distract Columbo from pursuing justice. Abby's final appeal to his good nature is rejected because he has too much respect for himself in order not to do his job well. Here is a situation you can not do with Mrs. Mitchell!
