Icy and mortal assassin Tony Arzenta (a divine and unclear interpretation by Alain Delon) wants to give up the assassination business, but the dangerous mobs they work for will not let him. After the wife and child are killed, Arzenta declares the season open to all those responsible for their death. Director Duccio Tessari relates the story of absorption at a steady pace, reinvigorates a serious and no-nonsense tone all the time, traces agitated shocks and causes incidents in cars with considerable rip-off and notes the narrative with bloody explosions. Delona's suave and charismatic presence adds an extra class to already aggressive procedures. This film also features Richard Conte's sterling action as Mafia's wise role, Nick Gusto, Carla Gravini, friend of Sandra, Marc Porel, Arsenal, Domenico Maggio, Anton Diffring, calculating capo Grunwald, and Lino Troisi as the Rocco Cutitta gangster. Silvano Ippoliti's most glossy cinema boasts several graceful tablets. Gianni Ferrio's funky score strikes the groovy spot. Erika Blanc and Rosalba Neri shortly sparked some muddy parts. However, there is no filling to talk and even get a nice cute free female nudity. The amazing conclusion takes up a right and slopes to the right. A solid and satisfying winner.
