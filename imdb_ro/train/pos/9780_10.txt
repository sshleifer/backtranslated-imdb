I saw this film at the BIFFF Festival in Brussels in the spring of 2004. What a surprise! This German production, an elegant and imaginative shock, is one of the most frightening fleas I've ever seen. Be warned: this is not a joke! This terrorist has a large cast of good actors (for example: Peter Martell as a European guru has a strong presence), a great direction, a beautiful production design, a very good soundtrack and a lot of gore sfx like horror movies Italians are eighty years old. The flesh has been cleaned up to the bone ... and the blood is red ... this stop by the wild heart will catch you ... and give you some dark dreams ... You have to see it!
