This is one of those movies you think about when you wake up the next morning. It will give you that warm feeling, fuzzy and will leave you with a smile on your face. Sure, we fed typical characters and stereotypical stories, but it does a trick: Entertain. Being in Sweden and living in the United States for some time, it's funny how we react. "Deadbeat husband will kill him," "She (Gabriella) will die, and then there will be a lasting defeat longer than life." We know how these things work, everything is coming to an end. And he did it. The characters were somewhat simple, they were so elaborate that you did not think twice about it, nothing left for your imagination. The closest is probably Siv, it makes you wonder if she really is in love with Daniel, but that's all. But the movie is beautiful, in rural Norrland, the music is absolutely stunning and the characters are full of love. Michael Nyqvist is truly a genius with his unique crazy appearance and Frida Hallberg is charming and approachable. Maybe a little too nice. But above all this movie makes you feel, and this is the most important thing. You cry, laugh, hate and identify. I do not know about you, but that does not happen often.
