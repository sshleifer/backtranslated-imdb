I remember that the trailer for Legend of Zu was quite impressive and was a fan of a man called Hero (my favorite of all time), Storm Riders, and I decided I should look at that too. I know there is a lot of criticism about the ability to act Ekin Cheng everywhere but until now is my favorite Hong Kong moviestar (much better than Nicolas Tse however) and is one of the factors I liked this film . Undoubtedly, this film is a work of art from the beginning to the end. I really thought that only the actors were real and everything else was generated by the computer by the end of this movie. They had to do a lot of things in this and deserve a good credit for it. The story of the film was a fairy tale between good and evil, with a love story thrown in (I suppose Ekin Cheng pulls the girls with ease). The story is not very intellectual and deep, but that's not what you expect when watching an action movie. I wanted the action of martial arts to be stronger with fists and fists instead of magic skills, but that's life and it never works the way you want it. And why did they call supersonic planes in battle through the sky in the end? It's too funny. Zu's legend can not be a man called a hero in my eyes, but it's like a video game and it's not a bad thing at all. If a company decides to publish games on this movie, I will not surprise it because it carries all the video game items. Good job. Please do more fantastic movies like this
