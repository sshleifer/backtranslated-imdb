Michael Jackson is no longer popular in the US, though in Europe (especially in Germany), he still has many fans. Many will say that this is a bad movie, and it is: it has no plot, it is full of cliques, Michael boasts constantly. But, you can not expect a plot or non-clihes in this type of movie! It has fun visual effects and music is perfect. Smooth Criminal - the biggest song ever, full of Moonwalks, group dance and even the famous "Michael Jackson's Bench-over" - makes this film one of Jackson's masterpieces with a Michael (Michael White) Jackson! A must for Jackson fans, a must for music fans, a must for dancing fans act. However, since I am a MJ fan, I should warn all Jackson's killers there: DO NOT watch this movie, you just make hate ...
