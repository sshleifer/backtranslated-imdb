Cat Soup at first seems to be a very animated movie. The best way I can explain is that it is quite acidic. Although not entirely random. The story is about Nyatta, a young cat cat and Nyaako's sister. Nyaako is very sick and dies, however, Nyatta sees that her soul is taken to death and is able to recover half of her. The story is about their quest to bring Nyaako fully back to life. Although a lot of content in this movie seems completely random, it is not. Most is symbolism for life, death and rebirth. You can also see references from other stories such as Hansel and Gretal. This short, cute movie has an interesting story with a deeper meaning than what you see on the screen surface.
