Canadian producer Mary Harron is a cultural piano whose previous films have highlighted the artistic excess of the sixties and eighties. With "The Notorious Bettie Page", she is turning her eye on Fifties America, an age in the moral righteousness of Joe McCarthy, as she faces the beginning of a sexual awakening that would result in free love for the next decade. Harron and her co-writer, Guinevere Turner, are not obviously interested in the standard biopic of a sex symbol. This is a movie about the underground icon of an era and about how the purely sexuality revealed both the instinct of prey and the impure thoughts of a culture unimpaired by the beauty of a nude body. If the details of Betty's life were all about the movie, then why did it end before the most tragic period began. Obviously, Harron is more interested in American attitudes to sexual images, then and now. Along with Gretchen Mol's furious performance and the amazingly atmospheric cinema of W.Mott Hupfel III, she fulfills this admirable goal, taking a mirror in the past, making the audience examine their "enlightened" attitudes called pornography. As America suffocates under a new conservatism, it is a necessary film more than ever.
