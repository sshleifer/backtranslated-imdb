This movie is great, you never have to wait for a belly laugh for more than a minute and it does much more than the original premise of the movie. Over time, there are mockers of the traditional schmaltzy genre - local-boys-done-good-overcoming-adversity of parodies. Do not let anyone tell you that they are trying to get cheap laughs just by using obscenities; - sure, there's a lot of that, but everything is contextual, it's not free. I liked this movie and cost me only 2.99 euros on DVD, so in terms of entertainment value for money, it was the best movie I've seen this year.
