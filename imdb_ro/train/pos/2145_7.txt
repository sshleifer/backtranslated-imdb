"Shall We Dance?", A Joyous Journey in Japan, tells of an overloaded accountant and man who is drawn to a dance studio by a beautiful woman he sees on the train during his daily journey. What he finds in the studio are dance lessons and, above all, himself. Funny, poisonous, and charming, "SWD" is an award-winning movie that deserves more mature viewers. (B)
