Although this series only had one season, she stayed with me for 20 years. It has been a lot of my favorite cartoons over all my time. I would give you almost anything to have on DVD or any formats I can get. If you find any way to see this series, I suggest you make the most of it. This series was the first (in my opinion) that had a truly coherent story that spans several episodes. I also really worried about the characters and what happened to them. I'm sorry that, in fact, Goose sometimes scared me. He was weird at the time. Also, the group leader reminds me of a combination of Clint Eastwood / Tommy Lee Jones. If someone has any way to contact the creator / rights holder on the series and can get them on DVD, please do so by all means!
