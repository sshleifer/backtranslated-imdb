Kolchak is a full fun. Striking stories and great distribution, and nothing else weighs it. Darren McGavin offers an energetic performance that attracts the audience with him. Simon Oakland, Jack Grinnage and Ruth McDevitt give McGavin solid support that most of the top actors can only dream of. Some excellent stars add colors and paint to individual episodes - Erik Estrada in Legacy of Terror, Phil Silvers in Horror in Heights, Antonio Fargas in The Zombie. It's easy to see how he spent a child watching that Kolchak led Chris Carter to create the X Files. Darren - RIP. Simon - RIP. Ruth - RIP.
