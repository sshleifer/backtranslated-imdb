When the plague erupts in New Orleans, Richard Widmark is rescued in "Panic on the Streets," one of the less famous films of the great Elia Kazan. Kazan keeps the intense rhythm and there are a lot of wonderful touches - the scenes between Widmark and Barbara Bel Geddes, who play the wife and scene in the police station, show the family life, professional life and the relationships of average citizens who are in strong contrast of the lives and relationships between the low lives portrayed by a menacing Jack Palance, by his weak man, Zero Mostel, Tommy Cook, and Louis Charles. There are also some interesting visuals - Palance has some scenes with actors who seem to raise their knees to a height. The act is wonderful, and the dialogue is clear if the story is not quite up to the direction and performance. It has some questionable issues that will be seen by the viewer quite easily. Besides, it's worth watching. Kazan was a master director.
