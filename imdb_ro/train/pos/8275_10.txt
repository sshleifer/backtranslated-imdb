Wendigo is a pretty good psychological thriller, the movie has a great drama between the characters and some scary scenes. The act is good, the characters behave like a normal family. The Wendigo effects are good, Deer's Form reminded me a little of Rabbit in Donnie Darko. The film sees a family that will stay for a while in a house, but accidentally hit a deer, a group of hunters arrive and one of the hunters called Otis begins to argue with father George, after the car was lifted, House. Miles's son is a little shaken by the deer, but his parents are trying to tell him that it is natural for such things to happen. That night, while he's in bed, he starts to see strange things in the bedroom the day he enters the city and Miles meets a man at the counter that gives him a small statue in Wendigo when Miles shows Kim the statue and tells him that a man at the counter gave him the owner says she works only there. Once he returns home, George takes his healthy son, and while riding his feet, beating from the board and Miles being watched by the wind, after winning briefly, looking for George, I find him in front of the house where he tells him he was shot Kim's hospital tells the sheriff that Otis would have shot him, Shriff goes to Otis, where he hit his head with a hammer, as Otis leads the way he finds that Wendigo follows. <br /> <> Wendigo is a pretty good thriller that has a few cooling moments. Check this. 10/10
