This movie was great, I thought the original was silently mediocre. However, it received all the ingredients, a 1970 Hemi Challenger 4-speed transmission, which really shows that Mother Mopar knew how to build the best muscle cars! I was in Chrysler's sky every time Kowalski got into that big block of Hemi and he certainly did that :)
