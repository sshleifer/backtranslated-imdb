I saw this movie as a child and broke my heart! No other story had such an unfinished end ... I grew up on many anime movies and this was one of my favorites because it was so unusual - a story about injustice, cruelty, loneliness, life and choices that the need of others can not be canceled. Chirin is done alone when the Wolf kills his mother, but Wolf is alone when Chirin follows him on the mountain. The wolf does not kill the lamb, even if every night says "maybe I will eat you tomorrow." The band I have is broken and degraded due to age and use. I'll fix it and watch the movie again someday and I'll cry as hard as I am. Stories like this, with this depth and sentiment, and this complexity of meaning, are very rare. It's a sad story, but I have not met any more catharsis done. I'm glad to see this movie and I'm glad I saw him as a child.
