A fantastic Arabian adventure. A former king, Ahmad, and his best friend, Abu thief (played by Black Narcissus Sabu) seeks the love of Ahmad, who was stolen by the new king, Jaffar (Conrad Veidt). It's not a very low moment here. We always invent new adventures for heroes. Personally, we found Ahmad and his princess a bit boring (you do not have to ask why John Justin, who plays Ahmad, is in fourth place in credits). Conrad Veidt, always a funny actor, makes a big villain, and Sabu is very fun as the prince of thieves, who at one point finds a cute in a bottle. I also really loved Miles Malleson as the sultan of Basra, the father of the princess. Collect stunning toys from around the world. Jaffar bribes him for his daughter's hand with a flying horse. It would probably count as one of the wonderful children's movies of all time, but the special effects are horrible given today. Kids will certainly bother to overlay the images when Abu and genius are on screen together. And the giant spider scene looks very awful. Although the youngest generation probably thinks King Kong is sorry at this moment, Willis O'Brien's stop-motion animation is a thousand times better than a puppet on a string that does not even look like a spider. 8/10.
