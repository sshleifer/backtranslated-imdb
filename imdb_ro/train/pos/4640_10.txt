It's one of the best movies I've seen in the last two years (I saw the prime minister in Tel Aviv, Israel in the summer of 2006, just when the last war started ...) This problem in communication between people, I'm interested in a lot of time and it does not matter who the boys, the righteous and the homosexual, the Jews and the Arabs ... I have already seen Bubble 3 times and still surprising and interesting, each character reminds me of one of the many people who I know, and the difference between them, as well as between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem ... The last time I saw her was with my friend, who is a Christian Arab, and it was Israel's day of independence (the most symbolic on that I could, how ironic) and ... she finally shouted! - if it was touched and was not embarrassed - everyone would be touched by The Bubble!
