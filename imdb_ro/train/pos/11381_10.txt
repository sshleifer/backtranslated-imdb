The best part of an American in Paris is the long-lasting ballet sequence in which Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron are the living personification of a few great painters. Kelly was first established as a pavilion artist in Paris so the sequence is the logical end of a musical that bursts with life and energy, songs from Gershwin and distributes members like Georges Guetary and Oscar Levant. Kelly was best here - it's a bit different from Singin 'in the rain, and the effect of the film like that of a ballet gives it a real wow factor. No wonder the sequel ended with "That's Entertainment" after all the other MGM musical moments have passed!
