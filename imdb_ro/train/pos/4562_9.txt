He saw this movie on DVD yesterday and was gob-smacked and flabbergasted. The unaffected act of DDL just exploded my mind and I was surprised by the entire distribution and its gorgeous act. All my character was so authentic, I really got DDL for Christy Burns and Brenda Fricker for his mother. Go and see! You will cry your heart, but you will experience a wonderful catharsis! In addition, it teaches you an important lesson: Determination is everything. You may be an offender in the poor suburbs of Dublin, but when you're tough enough, you will not have any trouble. If you can only use your left foot, you are still good enough to be a painter or writer. The worst thing you can do when you are mentally challenged is to indulge in self-pity. It will not take you anywhere and the only person who will love you will be yourself.
