If the movies are believed, Chinese ghosts are much more beautiful and worse than Western counterparts. The stories of the three Chinese ghost films are largely identical, but the direction is excellent, and the details and colors are such that it is not an enormous problem. As always, humor is an integral part of the film, accompanied, of course, by a multitude of bites. For those who have not yet met the "Chinese GhostStory" trilogy, this film offers an exciting discouragement from Western horror / ghost genres; for those who have, another pleasant pocket in the Chinese phantom world.
