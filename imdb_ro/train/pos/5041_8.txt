Matthew McConaughey is a mysterious man waiting for agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe) in his FBI office. He claims to have information about a serial killer pursued by the FBI. When Agent Doyle arrives in the office, he tells him that the serial killer is indeed his dead brother. Agent Doyle asks for some proof and man tells the story of his life from childhood. They were a simple family of three: his father Meiks (Bill Paxton), his brother and himself. One evening, his father gathers the two brothers and tells them that an angel of God has just visited him and assigned his family to destroy the demons. What happens next is one of the most frightening movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie four months ago on VHS and yesterday I watched again, now on DVD. Although it is a low-budget movie, the script is sharp without any defects. The cast is remarkable, but I would like to highlight Matt O'Leary's performance as young Felton. It is a very difficult and complex task to be accomplished by a young teenager. Bill Paxton's direction is remarkable. There is no explicit violence in this horror movie. An excellent debut behind the camera. I regret this Brazilian title of this film: "A Mão do Diabo" ("The Devil's Hand"). If at least it was "the hand of God," it would be acceptable. But naming this film as "the devil's hand" is indeed ridiculous. Brent Hanley, the screenwriter, does not deserve such a lack of respect for the Brazilian distributor. This movie is highly recommended. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Mão do Diabo" ("The Devil's Hand")
