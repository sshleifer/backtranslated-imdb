I saw the movie with birds and I think it's great! its fun in the back, about the time spent by the British film industry with some fun! it's good that the guy he met at the gas station is mentioned in the film in news agencies, a nice note. The actress was convincing (I'm a biker) reminded me of some good moments that I had in the bike scene. It was good to see the film director get involved, jon well done! Finally, a new crop is mentioned, in Ireland this is the basis for the second film? hope to keep them coming. Great movie, well-written, realistic characters!
