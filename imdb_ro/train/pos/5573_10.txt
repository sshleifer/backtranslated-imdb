MUST SEE! I saw WHIPPED on a press screen and it was hilarious. We speak of unholy laughter. It makes MARI look like a meandering drama. Amanda Peet calls out the quality of the stars with her winning combination of beauty, brain and serious ability to act. Peter Cohen, the director, has produced a state-of-the-art film that portrays men inside the ego of urban encounters throughout the world. For all his comedy, Whipped manages with his intelligence. Which is so rare for a first time director, especially with a romantic comedy. He is a major talent. Judah Domke, Brian Van Holt, Jonathan Abrahams, and Zorie Barber ended the cast with deep and powerful performances such as slick men. You need to see these guys go to work and get caught up on Peet's internet. Check out the trailer on whipped.com, it's worth a 3-minute download.
