I'm not a big fan of most anime, but Gundam Wing is really something else. The Gundam Wing does not have all the stereotypical melodies you might think when you think of the anime, since the number of jokes made in the 17 hours is only doubled, Gundam Wing gets directly to business. <br /> <br /> Wundul Gundam is as much a political thriller as it is a series of action. The big parties are focused on the diplomatic relations of war, not just fighting. Although the battle animation does not have extreme details in cases where it is just an animated pain, the individual battles between gundams are close to art, given the lively use of complex mechanics and fast movements. <br /> <br /> As far as I know, this episode 49 plus a series of movies was taken over by the cartoon network in 2000 and then was professionally called by them. doubling is simply impeccable. not just every word said it fits, but the use of voice really makes the characters more credible. many think it's better to watch anime with English submarines, but I just do not have the decision to do that. <br /> <br /> Not only are the voices good, but the score used in the series is quite impressive. I'll say he let me get out of the net in vain to find a soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The park in this series is what will attract the viewers really, and no, do not look for a first-rate drama like Lost, which was made just in order to catch you. explaining that the plot would be deep would lead to numerous spoilers because many of the characters have not even a few names up to a few episodes in the series. The gross idea of ​​the series is that the earth and its space colonies, now independent, encounter difficulties in maintaining peace. Thus, a war began, leading to military strikes and the elaboration of diplomatic situations. I feel that every detail will begin to provide information, which is essential for the plot. <br /> <br /> I will end here saying that this series is great for anyone who likes anime, whoever thinks ALL ANIMES are bad (they have good reason to think about it) and anyone looking to get into the anime with a serious tone for him.
