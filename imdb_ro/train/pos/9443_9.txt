It is a shame that Deliverance is known especially as rapeseed and Dueling Banjos. Even those who have seen the movie can not get their minds out of that rape scene. It's not as bad as the rape scene in Pulp Fiction. It's certainly not as bad as any female rape scene in almost any movie. People tend to lose the power of the movie containing the infamous buggery scene. Deliverance's actor, plot, cinema and soundtrack give him a hand of charity. The country where she was shot is beautiful and is quite contrary to the dark subject. Both large and minor actors make you feel like you are walking on that river right beside them. The thing separating this movie from the others is the tangible feeling of horror they inspire. Not many movies can make you feel so squeaky. Bottom Line: This movie is classic. I can not say much.
