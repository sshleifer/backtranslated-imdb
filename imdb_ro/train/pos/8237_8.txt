For my life, why did this movie receive an R? While it's a meat-eating zombie, believe it or not, it's actually a good movie for families - at least if your kids are 10 years old and older. Unlike traditional zombie films, it has an excellent sense of humor and traditional values ​​- though slightly twisted! Language is not a serious problem, there is nudity, and the style of the movie is certainly child-oriented (just like the old TV show "Eerie, Indiana") - yet some hit with a R rating! Believe me, most children have seen more serious violence than this, and it seems terrible to make the audience believe that this is an adult movie. The story lies in a parallel world. While the fashion, the car and the mores occur around 1953, this bizarre world has created a recent zombie plague that has led to the "zombie war" and massive changes in everyday life. At school, children are trained in armed struggle, and there is a pretty late scene in the film where the father gives his son a gun and tells him to keep it in his backpack "just for the case"! As far as school life is concerned, it's quite strange, as people have learned now that zombies are not that bad! Heck, using shock and training collars, they can be made into slaves that can make your households, clean streets, deliver milk or, in the case of a really sick patient, be your "special friend". <br /> <br /> This movie deals with a single family who finally buys their first zombie slave (played by Billy Connally). My mother is delighted and her son becomes the friend of the zombie. The father, on the other hand, is not convinced - because he was forced to kill his own zombie father years ago and has not yet reached this point! Funny, irrelevant and unique - this movie must be seen by a much wider audience.
