I saw this when I played in The Wonderful World of Disney as a child, so I did not remember too much. As I have seen recently, I sat there thinking, "This is the weirdest thing I've ever seen." Scenarios "travel" look like something caused by an LSD overdose. The animated characters are mostly strange colorful / voice versions of the Jungle Book and Robin Hood characters. Some things I have not discovered, Disney: Children are being threatened by the knife and prostitute point (during the play in Portobello Road). It was very fun, although the musical numbers were long and I do not see much children get bored with them. Also, the subject was a bit dark, seeing how it was established during the Second World War.
