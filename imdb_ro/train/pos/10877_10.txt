I saw this movie with a bunch of friends and, although only two of us came out of the cinema, thinking about how cool it was, the others laughed and commented how bad it was. Well, that was not because it should not be taken so seriously, basically it's a horror film and it's a bravado job. There seems to be another movie that comes out like that, umm. .. Movie Scary ?? Well, this is Aussie, and original! Jessica Napier makes surprise performance and Sarah Kants has a bright bright future in acting! Hope to see more. Molly Ringwald was a good move, and Kylie was a better move. The impossible princess was the queen of the screen! We recommend watching this movie, as you will guess by the end of the connection with Raffy, Hilary and the movie that was not finished 20 years ago.
