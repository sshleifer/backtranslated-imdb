I always knew that Anne DeSalvo was a great character actor, now I know he is also a great writer / director. I've been a fan since I first saw it in "Perfect", "My Favorite Year", "DC Cab" and "Stardust Memories". It's so rare to see Lee Grant these days in anything. She has been out of the screen for too long. It's also great to see Cloris Leachman in something other than a sit-com. This is the best work from the "last picture". If you grew up in an Italian American family, you will enjoy this movie. I did not expect much when I started watching this movie, so I was pleasantly surprised when I fell in love with this movie. If you have a chance, look at it.
