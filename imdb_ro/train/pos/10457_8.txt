Forget about the "religious" films of the campaign that monopolized the television / film market ... this movie has a real feel for it. While it can be considered a film that has cheap emotional traits, it also has that message of forgiveness and good general morality. However, I did not like the light in this movie ... it was too bright for a movie that dealt with such subjects. I felt he took it from the general appeal of the film, which is almost an unforgivable sin, but the acknowledged play and its performance counteract this surveillance. It's definitely worth seeing ... buy the DVD.
