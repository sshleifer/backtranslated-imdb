Now, for all fans of cinemas there, this movie may not be on your list of things to see. But if you know something about the development of the plot, the deep truth and the intentions that this movie has (the series), you understand my story <br /> <br /> Given, the specifics of the film are interpretations of the writer who can not expect to he knows what will eventually happen. But the film is biblically correct and justifiably "scares" the spectators to think about what they might be. I am a Christian, not because of this film, but because of my personal decision to accept Jesus as my Savior. The film and the potential as something similar to the circumstances described in it scares people to think about their actions and decisions. It is not a cheap attempt to scare people into believing in God, but rather a means of attracting your attention. As a Christian, I know I will not lag behind and, thanks to films like this, I can look beyond the entertainment, acting and budgeting superficialities to appreciate the depth that the film can offer. This is a movie that you should not only see, but feel with heart and soul.
