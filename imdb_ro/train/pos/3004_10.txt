Philo Vance (William Powell) helps solve more crimes among the rich after a dog show. I usually hate complicated mysteries (like that), but I LOVE this movie. It moves very fast (only 72 minutes), is beautifully directed by Michael Curtiz (uses many narrative rumbles), has an ingenious story line (including a solution to a murder in the closed room that was just incredible) and has a very good distribution. <br /> <br /> Powell is very suave and awesome as Vance - does not seem to act - he is Vance! Mary Astor does not have much to do but adds class and beauty to production. All the others are very good, but Eugene Pallette is best as Detective Heath. He is a very good actor with a very distinct voice and some of his lines were hilarious. Basically, a mystery of Hollywood murder in the 1930s. It's worth seeing. <br /> <br />
