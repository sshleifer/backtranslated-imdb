I find it difficult to place this movie at a "fair" number of stars, but I set myself at eight because of its high production values ​​and what was, in 1968, an innovative approach to the war movie. Remember too much that I have not seen him since 1969. But he made a strong impression. The long day of death must be one of the worst antiwar films. It does this simply by portraying, in extremely real terms, the actions of a thousand Northwest European soldiers in the years 1944-1945. No movie before it shows war on the infantry crew with so many brutal details and all in a badly disputed way that allows action to speak for itself. There is no prediction, no sentimentality, no comical relief, no complicated scenario. Unfortunately, no subtlety exists. In part because of their situation - trying to stay alive - the characters meet as familiar, familiar clichés. As "entertainment," the film does not, although it clearly did not intend to "entertain". It was meant to sacrifice your head with the misery and horror of the Second World War and the modern war in general. It was twenty years before the Platoon and thirty years before saving Ryan privately, both of which were more "visible." Here, full and generally disagreeable characters, the lack of a real plot, and unpleasant realistic images (including what may be the first vomit on screen in theatrical history) make the movie hard to stay, although it's only 95 minutes. <br /> <br /> So 10 stars for production and realism, 4 stars for the feeling you'll have when it's over, an outstanding star to have the heart in the right place. On average, 8. Like Carl Foreman's "The Victors", a film as slow, but more exciting and challenging, The Long Day's Dying does not seem to be on DVD. Why not? Both films have been cabled several times.
