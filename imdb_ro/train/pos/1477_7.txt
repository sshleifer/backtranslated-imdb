I was watching this movie Friday, April 7th. I did not see the last scene (because I talked to my mother in law at the same time). Whoever can tell me what happened to her? I could easily see that her husband heard that someone was talking to the wife in the bedroom and then opened the door, she already died. What happened to her? Did he commit suicide? How could she arrange all sorts of phone calls, while she was at home when her husband was talking to this strange admirer? Whoever can explain to me, please. I'm so curious! (I finally read that she suffered from Multiply Disorder Personality). Just before.
