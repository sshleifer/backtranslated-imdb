I took the film without cover and I did not even know what it was, but when I looked at it I laughed so hard. Now it's one of my favorite movies of all time. Rusty and the boys have created a masterpiece, I would recommend this movie to anyone with a sense of humor. Thank you, Rusty for giving us something to laugh.
