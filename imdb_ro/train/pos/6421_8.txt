"Men of Honor" - the true story of a marine and persistent black marina diver (fabulous Cuba Gooding Jr.) is definitely a great movie that touches and has fun and is part of the absolute cream of the new millennium cinema. Wonderful action is the main reason for making this movie really special and quite pleasing, a splendid experience. Charismatic Robert De Niro is awesome as the tough, fierce and ruthless chief Billy Sunday - the role is practically written for him. This film alongside the fantastic "15 minutes" (2001) is two of the latest proof that he is still one of the best actors of our time. On the other hand, Men of Honor includes a beautiful performance from Cuba Gooding Jr., who was one of the most promising young black actors in Boyz n the Hood. "People of Honor" head straight for "Jerry Maguire", "Just Like It" and "Instinct". Cuba Gooding Jr. is an accomplished and fantastic actor and I am ready to get many great movies from him. "Men of Honor" also has an excellent story and probably the most interesting diving sequences in the history of the film. This is a wonderful and fascinating film and I can recommend it only.
