The feel of this movie was amazing. Adam Sandler's performance was very inspired. As he played a very hilarious and fragile character, he took his skills to the limit and really performed his role. His character was really interesting. I see that I read the script for this film and that I am not half interested in the play Sandler has done to me. For someone who plays primarily comedy roles, he took a serious role with what seemed to be his own strangeness and entry. I especially liked the scene where the characters of Adam and Don led the motorized scooter around the city. I was familiar with the moment, because Don seemed to be witnessing something Adam is doing to get away from everything. With his video games, music and many other things he does to keep him from thinking about the past, riding his scooter with his helmets, it seemed to be an escape from his thoughts. This movie definitely deserves the watch.
