Western colored. Wyoming Cowboy, James Stewart, heads to the Yukon Territory to jump gold, sell the voyages, and try to get a date with the pretty salon owner, Ruth Roman, if he can shake the shit of the sheriff, John McIntire, who wants Stewart's cattle. Beautiful cinematography in a collaborative effort between William Fritzsche and Bill Daniels. A Good Adventure by Technicolor from Universal-International, directed by Anthony Mann. He also plays Corinne Calvet, Connie Gilchrist and Walter Brennan as Stewart.
