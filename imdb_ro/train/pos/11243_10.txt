I saw "Breaking Glass" for the first time when it was released in England in 1980. I liked it then, and after capturing it in August 2005 on a Canadian station, it's still great. The only thing I regret is that I can not find the sound track or the DVD in the stores ... ... anyone who cares to shed some light or have to order it from some Internet companies over price. But, coming back to the movie, music is a test of time, Hazel / Kate had something to say about the UK in 80. In fact, in the same decade, I moved to Canada for some of the same reasons why I was " Thatcher "and what he did then in the country. If you have the chance to watch this movie, you will not be bored!
