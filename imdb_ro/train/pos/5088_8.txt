I never had a guess while watching the movie that it was meant for the idiot box. I always thought it was a very successful film from the late 1990s. But after I saw on the internet that this was for television, I was shocked because it's absolutely fantastic for a television movie! The thing I was most interested in was the length. I felt that the one on a battle scene had to be eliminated because it was completely useless. He also began to draw to the end, because it seemed that the adventure would never end. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is a strong, exciting and exciting terrain with magnificent performances by everyone. I just felt that Patrik Frayze looked a little haggard. I also felt that Gogool, who looked at dementia, became a bit stupid in some scenes. I was delighted with the beautiful landscapes of Africa. Also, the first half of the movie would have made me give myself a movie 9. Still, it's a great movie for television. 8 out of 10.
