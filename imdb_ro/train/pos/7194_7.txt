I call this the best of the Zorro chapters. The exciting musical score adds the fist to an exciting game on the screen. There is an excellent supporter of the towers and the mystery that will keep you guessing until the final chapter. Reed Hadley does a good job as Don Diego and his alter ego Zorro. Last but certainly not least, is Whitney's leading English team.
