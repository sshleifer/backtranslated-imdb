I just saw this movie when I rented it and I thought it would be just another movie with a girl trying to prove a point, but Diane joined the box because she wanted it. I thought this movie was good. I gave it 8/10. This is good. Plus a movie with Michelle Rodriguez is always good. Even she was only six years old.
