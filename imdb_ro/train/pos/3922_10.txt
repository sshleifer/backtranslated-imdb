Carmen is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's hard to say which is the best show: Antonio Gades, Cristina Hoyos and Laura del Sol are gorgeous. They dance their souls. It is a beautiful story of the inseparability of life and myth; the myth penetrates into everyday life. Dance becomes life and life is danced. True people, at the same time, live their own lives and become someone else, act in the parts of old lovers. Magic continues.
