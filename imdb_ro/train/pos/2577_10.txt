My father grew up and looked at George Reeves as Superman, and when I was little, he had VHS episodes and let me see them, including this movie (going to the family if you want) and I loved him. > <br /> <br /> Clark Kent and Lois Lane are sent to a small town with a mine of oil, and I'm spreading radioactive dead people and targeting the city supposed to be dead and it's up to Superman to stop this chaos. > <br /> It's so great and fun to see. The special effects and the old sound - the crew drew such beauty with such a small technology. George Reeves was my hero when I was young and now I'm 16, but just showing how endless and classic these adventures are.
