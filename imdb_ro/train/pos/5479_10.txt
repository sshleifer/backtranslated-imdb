<br /> <br /> Arriving with a stroller in New York City, the young woman with BABY FACE begins to methodically adapt the road to the upper levels of power in a large bank. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck is fascinating as the amoral heroine of this influential drama in pre-code. Without a piece of decency or regret, she manipulates with cold the removal or destruction of men quite unhappy to find her way. A wonderful actress, Stanwyck has the opportunity to expose her great talents. Appearing fairly late in the story, George Brent is a welcome addition to the one who managed to make Stanwyck; its sophisticated style of action makes a beautiful counterpoint to its ice behavior. Douglas Dumbrille, Donald Cook and Henry Kolker portray a succession of his unhappy victims. John Wayne appears for a few seconds as an unsuccessful aspirant for Stanwyck's affections. This would be the only time these two performers appeared on the screen together. The film should recognize Nat Pendleton as a speakeasy client, and Charles Sellon and Edward Van Sloan as banking directors -> <br /> The music heard on the soundtrack throughout the film, perfectly emphasizing the plot, is "Baby Face "(1926) by Benny Davis and Harry Akst and St. Louis Blues (1914) by W.C. Handy. <br /> <br /> BABY FACE is a prime example of pre-Code unhappiness. In its sincere and unapologetic relationship with sex, it is precisely the kind of film that the implementation of the Production Code in 1934 had to eliminate.
