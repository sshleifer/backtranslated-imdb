In my case, I liked this movie because when I saw it, I found more than I expected. I mean, this is one of the few animated movies that made me think of her themes even after I finished. Talk about death, vengeance and hell so that it comes to you as a blow in front of you, even to get to suffer with the dream sequence in the middle of the movie. That makes this movie so good: the ability, unique in Don Bluth (director), to play with people's feelings and to make them love or hate a character in the shortest time. That, and the fact that she has so many good characters like Charlie and Ann-Marie, is that in the sad, sad but happy way you have to say, "I have something in my eyes" to hide the others from shouting. All I have said is just some of the good points of this movie. Otherwise, you have to see them for you in an extremely honest movie. Don Bluth, thank you.
