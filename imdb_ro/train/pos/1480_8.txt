I'm right in front of the TV, watching Casomai. It changes, it evolves or better ... it gets. Start with a courius wedding of the two protagonists in which their love story is reported. After that, everything changes, a baby is born, and the rest usually happens in the couple. It's not a special movie because it talks about a normal couple, and normality is the center of this movie. She does not want to show us anything special, it's nothing new, it's just a story of normal love, the story of a couple, and it's normal to become different from the rest. It's also a flashing movie, everything is short, every scene is only a few seconds long. It is a story reported, many things are known because friends and parents talk about it, and their opinion is central, opinions create the story and destroy it. It's a simple story of a couple as I said, but it's not boring, it just shows a couple, it should be everything that's known, it's, but I'm sure each of you will want to know what's going on, so that do not forget to watch the end!
