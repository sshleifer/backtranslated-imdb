I'm not even sure what to say about this movie. is one of only a handful of ever-made movies that I would consider romantic. to try to talk about plotting or performance or technical details about this film would be in the words franc zappa "like the dance about architecture". it truly hits the right angle on the head in the way that it captures those passing moments of life that move us and then we run from ourselves to never live again. this seems like the personalized version of Charlie Kaufman in Adaptation wanted to write. the end is left open and ambiguous, not ending happily here, just mystery. not profound life lessons, just a pair of excited and intelligent children who explore the ability to feel the most irrational and unrealistic feelings ...... romantic love. 10 out of 10 watch it with your special lady and recommend it to a stranger ................
