Space Camp is a pretty decent film. The plot is predictable, but the actors do a good job, and the special effects are decent for the time. This movie was originally launched in connection with the moment of the disaster, and it really made a hindrance as popular as it was. The scene in which the shuttle doors open in space is simply spectacular ... on the big screen, that is ... on a television ... it only shows on average. I remember this scene in the theater. It made you feel like you were right there. This would be a good movie on IMAX, but I'm sure it will never happen.
