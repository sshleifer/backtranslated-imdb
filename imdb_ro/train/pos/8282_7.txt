** POSIBLE SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Most of the movie that does not work It's Wendigo, and when your title character fails, your movie is usually not far behind. The film's interpretation of Wendigo's form is interesting and can be properly threatened when properly filmed - when the fugitive murderer sees Wendigo in a mirror in his rear mirror, for example - and the shape of the trees was actually very good. However, as a monster character, he never returns to life. We do not have much explanation for his behavior, and what we see from him does not bother either the story told in the movie itself or any kind of Wendigo I've ever read. <br /> <br /> I think one of the main reasons the monster has failed is that it is not enough to do in the movie. When you beat this movie to bones, what you have is a suspense thriller with a supernatural element instead of a movie about a monster. Cinematography is good, though slightly cheesy; directors use landscape, lighting and daytime to convey the atmosphere and mood well enough. Otis' character is truly dangerous and unpredictable, making him a true monster in the movie. It could have been more effective to explain his behavior because he was possessed by the spirit of Wendigo's hunger, which would be a more accurate representation of the real legend. I have heard unconfirmed reports (from a newsgroup) that the reason why Wendigo does not do much is that when the monster suit was built it was so hard and uncomfortable (to imitate the position on the hooves the artist had to walk on his toes) that it was almost impossible to run, walk or otherwise play in it. Thus, the numerous clips of the creature remained standing, and the obvious recordings of running speed. I point out that these reports are unconfirmed.
