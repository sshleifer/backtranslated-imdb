Well, I gave a movie to 7. It was better than "Thirdspace," but not as good as "At first," until the B5 movies go. I really think the TV series has done a much better job with special effects and portraits of characters. Let's hope the producers and distribution will receive the next Crusade series up to the B5 standard.
