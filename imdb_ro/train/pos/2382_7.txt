For a long time, "The Menagerie" was my favorite "Star Trek" episode, although in recent years it has been eclipsed by "City on the Edge of Forever". What I used to say about "Menagerie" was that Star Trek is tougher with this fascinating story back to Trek's passing story. I still think it's quite ingenious how Gene Roddenberry embedded the original pilot into a two-part episode. Although the "new" part of the story is largely an excuse for Kirk and a few others (and us) to follow the pilot, the idea that Spock is martyred in court is a clever one. You can find holes in the plot if you want. For example, given the skills of Talosians to control the mind and Captain Pike's state, why is it really necessary to physically bring it back to their planet? And there are other confusing questions about Pike and Commodore Mendez ... best not to think too much about the details and enjoy just that ST is just two ground floor.
