Hollywood North is a satirical aspect at that time in the Canadian film history, when the Canadian government offered huge breaks for films made in Canada. It has often been treated as a tax shelter or as a cheap way to get American movies. For example, Porky got out of her. Anyway, Matthew Modine plays a novice producer who wants to make an adaptation of a loved Canadian novel. However, in order to get the money it needs an American star. He gets a full cannon and learns that he has to compromise to the point where the film does not resemble the book he originally founded. It plays well in Canada but can not be understood outside the Great North. The Americans will think we are enlivening, but we will lose the view that we are enlivening them. For Canadians 8/10 for the rest of the world 5/10.
