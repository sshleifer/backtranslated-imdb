It has been 16 years since the original run, I would have hoped that some "marketing wizards" would have promoted up to now a live version of this classical actor, or would at least try to re-publish 65 original episodes. I can not understand why the sci-fi or cartoon network did not do that. Galaxy Rangers actually had thoughtful thoughts and even better scripts. The animation was over average quality for its time, and excellent compared to the presentation of Japanese animated talk slides today. She preceded the heavy toon toy tie in the market, this may have sealed the doom too. I would willingly spend money on a GR DVD, if available.
