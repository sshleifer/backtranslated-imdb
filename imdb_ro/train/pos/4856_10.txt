I first saw this movie years ago and continued to see it several times a year when I got the chance. It's on my favorite movie list along with some of the classics. If someone tells you he is crazy or outdated, ignore them ... this movie is for anyone who enjoys laughter and music. Dance is not as important in this film as in other Astaire films, so comedy and role shine. See this movie if you can, it can be easy, but it's still very funny. So I know that many people hate black and white films, think old movies can not really be funny, this movie should make them change their minds. No one knows she can watch this movie without being a little amused. The only problem with the movie: Fred Astaire singing without dancing. He can be a powerful and capable performer, but he is not fascinating and leaves a big hole in the middle of the story. Comedy sometimes becomes a strange clich√©, but the performance of the G and G Allen guns are just perfect for the play and can satisfy anyone who is looking for a laugh. Give this movie a chance, even if you do not like old movies, this movie can appeal to ridicule in any one.
