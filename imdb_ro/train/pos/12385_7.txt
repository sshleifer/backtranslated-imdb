Man, I really like the new DVD that Universal pulled out of it. I have never seen SENTINEL so well because I have been dealing with fat, fat fat VHS cassettes for years. Unfortunately, there is no extract beyond a trailer that seems worse for wear. And avoid the Goodtimes DVD at any price. It sucks. Anyway, the troubled fashion model Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) moves into the haunted church in NYC, just that it's more than haunted. It is also a gateway to hell, and the Vatican retains an old blind priest (John Carradine) to oversee it and ensure that the devils and archangels do not escape. It has a star filled with old actors such as Ava Gardner, Arthur Kennedy, Jose Ferrer, etc. ... as well as future 80-star comedians, including Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldblum (the voice of was mysteriously overwhelmed) and Tom Berenger. And you will not even recognize Jerry Orbach from LAW & ORDER. I had to do double when I did not exactly where I saw it before. Alison's beautiful sands that cut off his eyes and nose from the rotten dead body of the dead father who was possessed by the devil. And there is a tidy end when deformed, deformed people try to haunt Alison to commit suicide, so that she is not the next to guard the portal. It seems that Alison's troubled past makes him a first candidate by the Vatican to become the next sentinel. An excellent, creepy classic from the 1970s from director Michael Winner, who should not be missed. I also recommended it for those who want a little less imaginative than ordinary teenage vagrants and horror comedy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span>
