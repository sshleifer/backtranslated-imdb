This movie is an interesting step on the type of killer scarecrow - amazing that it manages to grow to become larger than the sum of its parts. The medium-sized scenes, 30-year-old teenagers and some excellent facial expressions blend together to become one of the modern waves of the modern classics. As a viewer, I came out of the movie with the same sense of "shock and awe" as when I saw God in 1969. Tiffany Gardner's stunning moral image of moral robbery deserves the Grammy nomination, a well documented documentary stolen by Ricky Martin and the restless hips. Unfortunately, none of the tracks could stand up to the original expectations (unlike the Godfather series that improved with each installment and should culminate in 2012 with Godfather 4: Eat My Rage.
