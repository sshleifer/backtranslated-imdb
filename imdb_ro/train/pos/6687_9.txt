Although I can not claim to be a comic fan, I've read my part, so I think I'm part of the audience of this movie and I was not disappointed. She is almost draining, almost full of ideas, and it seems Lena Olin, one of my favorite actresses, has been left on the floor. Also, a bit of blue Raja of Hank Azaria can go a long way. However, it is easy to forgive all these errors when you have a movie that is so fun. All actors seem to have an explosion with their roles, especially William H. Macy as the right arrow Shoveler, and Janeane Garofalo as Bowler. And, unlike some, I found the city's design to make the joke even more fun. I also liked how disco was the favorite music of the bad guys; in a way, seemed right.
