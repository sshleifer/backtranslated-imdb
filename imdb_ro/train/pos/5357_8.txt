This comic strip is funny, has a nice action and an excellent futuristic style. Writer Steven de Souza, who also wrote Commando, gives Arnie plenty of lines to send: "Send me a copy," after signing a contract and stabbing a pen in lawyers; "What a sore throat," after blowing under the barbed wire; "He had to be separated" after he had cut his body between his legs; and finally, when Killian hits a panel with his own face, Arnie concludes: "That's hit the place." Pretty entertaining, he has some similar remembrance, another sci-fi scene with Schwarzenegger.
