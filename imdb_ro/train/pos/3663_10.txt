Perhaps the last movie you would expect to come from Vittorio de Sica and Cesare Zavattini (who wrote the novel on which this film is based). It's a neorealistic fantasy, kind of oxymoron, really. An old lady finds a baby in her cabbage patch and raises her as her son. After a few years, the child is a boy (called Toto), and the adoptive mother dies. He goes to an orphanage and leaves at the age of 18. He immediately finds out that he has no house. But this is optimistic and will not let anything escape him. A man steals his suitcase and, instead of getting angry with him, Toto becomes his friend and goes and stays with him in a small shelter. This organizes an initiative and organizes many homeless homes in the area and builds a better road. Soon the landlord is trying to sell this land and the citizens of the region have to protect themselves. After many attempts, the owner mounts a police force to escape the homeless. At this point, the film becomes complete fantasy (before it was the more comedy / fantastic melodrama in the style of Charlie Chaplin). These things are so strange and shocking that it is probably best for others to see for themselves. It is quite amazing and very funny. There are objections that you could raise about the plot of Miracle in Milan, for sure. Fellini and Visconti were very much criticized when they began to deviate from neorealism. I think I read this was widely criticized when it was released. At this point, however, it is so enjoyable - I really enjoyed it. It could be my favorite in Vittorio de Sica's films, although Umberto D and The Bicycle Thieves come very close. 10/10.
