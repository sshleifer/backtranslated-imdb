Cary Grant, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Victor McLaglen are three 19th century Indian soldiers who, with the aid of a water boy (Sam Jaffe), release the thuggee killer cult area. The chemistry among actors makes this movie one of the most fun of all time. Sam Jaffe is exceptional as the stray water boy who is ill-treated by everyone and still wishes to be accepted as a soldier in the company. It is based on the poem by Rudyard Kipling. You have to see someone who enjoys this type of movie.
