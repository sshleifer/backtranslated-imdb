Anyone who does not like this movie is the one who is afraid to explore their own demons. This movie makes the viewer sometimes uncomfortable, but that's his intention. He asks you to look at your own life and face the obstacles your head is finally making. He asks you to overcome fear of perception and become who you want to be. Bret Carr has a mirror, unlike any director. The intent and message are clear and profound. People's misunderstanding about this film comes from their own uncertainty. An open viewer has this inspired message and goes with it. Sometimes a life-changing achievement does not come in a moment - a bulb is produced. This story is real and changes life if its viewers in a real way.
