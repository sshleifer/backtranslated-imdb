I just stood at a very pleasant 45-minute ROLL pace. Roll is about a country boy, Mat (Toby Malone), who has dreams of becoming the Star of Sport. Mat moves into the city and is about to be taken by his cousin George (Damien Robertson). Well, that was the plan anyway. George is involved with a gangster, Tiny (John Batchelor) and makes a delivery for him. We do not need to say that Mat is shot in George's world. <br /> <br /> I thought it was wonderful how Mat teaches George about some morals and respect, while George teaches Mat to relax and enjoy life a little. Toby and Damien threw themselves together and did a great job. Each character in the movie compliments very well, the two cops were wonderful. David Ngoombujarra brought great appreciation to the film. Tiny played a gangster full of love that reminded me of one of my favorite "Pando" characters from Two Hands. One of the other things I liked Roll was that he introduced the cities in which I grew up and lived for 20 years, Perth and Fremantle. It was good to see the sights and landmarks that I grew up with, especially the old wheel wheel. <br /> <br /> This Rocks 'n' Rolls
