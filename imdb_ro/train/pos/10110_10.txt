Every story includes a premise, characters and conflict. Characters that make up their own promises play triumph, and a militant character is easily related. The premise of Ardh Satya is summed up by the same poetry written by Dilip Chitre. The line goes - "My effect is to sin, please, please, please?" A crude translation - "The delicate balance between good and evil (usually seen on the busts of blind justice in court) has a powerless power on one plate and one pride on the other. Is the center needle a half truth?" <Br /> <br /> The poem is remixed by Smita Patil at Om Puri in the middle of the movie at a restaurant. It has a profound impact on the protagonist and sets the foundation for many subsequent events that follow. At the end of the film, Om Puri ends in exactly the same situation described so well in poetry. The film tries hard to make a single stage in poetry. However, Chitre's words are too strong and, at best, the film fits into poetry in every aspect. <br /> <br />
