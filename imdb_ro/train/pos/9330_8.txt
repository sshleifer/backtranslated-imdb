"Dangerous Crime" is the story of a seemingly anti-social girl and how she got that way. It is based on a true story, and though I was irritated by the unique representation of the note, that is, the shadow, the title character, and the hard-to-believe dedication of her attorney, I have to accept that life imitates art and there are people there like this. The film succeeds for me because, although there is little softening of the title character's behavior almost to the end, one is gradually moved to sympathy for her because the film shows how she has reached her current state - which turns out to be rather self-destructive than anti-social. Really a moving movie that will bring a piece in your throat when you think about it - which will often be. Despite its many shortcomings (including the fact that it's hard to look at, sometimes because of bodily functions and suicide attempts), this is another production that makes me proud to call Canadian.
