I swear that the zombie was killed twice and returned. We gave this movie to 8. Let's face some people, exactly what other commentators say, that is, a shot shot. Hey, hey, hey, welcome to indie total movie. The fact that Todd Sheets has received over 700 zombies to appear in this film is a tribute to his talent. Yes, the story has gaps, yes, we see the same zombies again and again, but who cares? Take it for what it is, a fun movie and great horror, one to share with your buds or to block people who care about LOL. Good people, I assume you all liked some pieces of garbage instead, like "Titanic" or "Twister." Peace, and support independent film making!
