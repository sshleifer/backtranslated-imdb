This is short to the point. The written story used for Star Trek: Hidden Frontier is surprisingly good. Action is on the whole map, but the main characters over the years seem to have worked to improve their skills. It's hard to believe that this series has been running for nearly seven years and will end in mid-May 2007. I will not refresh what was said about sets and graphics. Since this is voluntary, no profit, it is quite amazing. If it was a professional production, I should give it a 5 for a good story but terrible sets. However, as a fan-based production, I have to give her an excellent rating, except for a few other efforts, it is in a league of its own. For high volume, I do not think this was right. Congratulations on distribution and crew for an effort many people admire.
