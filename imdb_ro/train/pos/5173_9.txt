I rarely see a movie with which I am very worried; this was one of them. It had good action, dialogue, plot, and the landscape was beautiful. I laughed aloud several times, especially with the scene of the kitchen raid. The slapstick comedy made by the floating hand of the meadow puts me on the floor, but I admit that I'm a heel sucker. The story dealt with a group of 30-year-olds who were returning to a summer camp they attended 20 years ago. It was a good week of camping, and the place was definitely closed at the end of the season. As adults the camp seemed different and felt different about her and the others. We recommend this funny movie, moving for all. <br /> <br />
