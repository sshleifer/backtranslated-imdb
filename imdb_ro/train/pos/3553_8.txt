Boys and dolls is an itch movie for a remake. It was done forty-eight years ago. The two main stars are either dead or 409 pounds. Although a remake with big stars would be a success in the box office, it would not be able to capture the magic that came into this version. Her infinite energy can not be recovered, nor is the pure joy you have when watching something like this: a giant, wide-screen, great entertainment screen. Marlon Brando (who passed 409 kg last time I heard) interprets Sky Masterson, one of the biggest players in New York. Frank Sinatra is Nathan Detroit, whose game as-he-can-find-a-speakeasy-for-it-carp is the famous city. However, when the only place he's left to own is to pay $ 1,000, Detroit needs money quickly. It makes Masterson win $ 1,000 so he can not take missionary Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons) to Havana with him the next day. Boys and dolls are nothing more than singing and dancing the fuckin ', as is the case here, add them to the fun. It's obvious to see how it was a Broadway musical: there were not so many sets, and the scenes were long. If I was complaining about one thing, how unequal the songs were. Sometimes there were two songs in a scene; another thirty minutes passed without one. Boys and dolls are never boring, just a wonderful time. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> Not rated.
