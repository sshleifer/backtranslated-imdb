I love playing football and I thought this movie was great because it contained a lot of football in it. This was a good Hollywood / Bollywood movie and I'm glad she won 17 awards. Parminder Nagra and Kiera Knightley were good and so was Archie Punjabi. Jonathon Rheyes Meyers was great on the pitch in front of the keeper. Jazz (Parminder Nagra) likes to play football, but her parents want her to learn to cook and wants to get married. When Jazz starts playing for a football team, he meets secretly with Juliet (Kiera Knightlety) and Joe (Jonathon Rhyes Meyers) who is her coach. When her parents discover strikes, but her father allows her to play the big match on her wedding, her sisters Pinky (Archie Punjabi). At the end, parents realize how much they love football and let them go abroad to play.
