I caught this movie on TV last night and you know that Danny Masterson was a pretty good actor in the movie, and his great guy to see him in something other than the shows of the '70s. The movie is not rated, but in my opinion I would evaluate (R) just because of nudity and a lot of adult content. But everything in everything I liked, I thought the Wisecracks of dirt was pretty funny. It's just about a guy who does not have a job, girlfriend or money and eventually becomes a private investigation service (more a messenger indeed.) He gets framed for killing a rock star and rock star friend is one of the People who must help him. I give it .... *** 3 Stars.
