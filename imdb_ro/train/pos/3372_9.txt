His time to pay tribute to the great Christon Heston after his recent passage, but this film is not one. The other films of a past generation were BEN HUR, the ten commanders, OMEGA MAN and PLANET OF THE APES, were his best works. This film, made in 1973, attempts to propel a future land in 2022 that is so overpopulated that the human race has been manipulated by the authorities to eat a universal product called Soylent Green, which is made with human flesh. This bizarre and implausible movie was as ridiculous at the time of its release as it is now, and supposes that India's population, which would be about 2 billion people, would then be meat consumers without knowing it. this character overwhelms an international secret conspiracy that the powers of the world have developed to meet the nutritional requirements of overpopulation by using cannibalism. Unfortunately, for the producers of this film the green message they give is not the Green Party of today's ethos, the glory of the Lord. Cannibalism was practiced by indigenous peoples in New Zealand, Fiji and Borneo until just 40 years before this film was made, but has long been abandoned by human civilization. Another bad prediction in the film is that women become quasi-sexy slaves that turn back the wave of radical feminism that was growing in 1972 when the film was made. The movie was bad then and it's just as stupid right now, but it contains a last great performance movie by late and great Edward G. Robinson but it's still not a valid reason to review the movie other than for academic reasons. This is a stupid film and I would not recommend baby boomers or Charlton Heston fans. All the other reviews of this movie I've heard sounded the same as a dystopian society in the future, about which the centralized theme just seems to involve the US in which an ecological disaster has occurred. <br /> <br /> Only the merit in the film is that the earth is overpopulated.
