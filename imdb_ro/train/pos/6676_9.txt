****** WARNING: "Mystery Men" may appear spoilers ************** <br /> <br /> So, what are they simply put, Mystery people are a group of sub-heroes trying desperately to live their adolescent fantasy lives while rashing both their real identity and their super-identity. The Shoveller (Bill Macy) works during the day, and at night he leaves his wife and children at home as they cut across the street looking for crimes to handle his extraordinary and unique fighting style. Blue Raja (Hank Azaria) sells silver for everyday babies and binds some cutlery to crackpot villiers at night if his mother does not keep him busy with the last snoop. Mr. Furious works in an unwanted courtyard to earn his salary, then takes his frustration over his friends at night, throwing badly-designed gaskets to friends and enemies alike and threatening to really get angry (leaving everyone to he wonders, what?). Ben Stiller breathes such a life into this character, can not help, but I love him. <br /> <br /> These three nights spend trying to capture that "moment of glory," I dreamed ... to become real Super heroes. Obviously, it could happen. The champion of the city has the amazing captain, after all ... a flying super-policeman with enough logos on his suit to stop an extra bullet or two. Greg Kinnear turns into a star show as a middle-aged sellout tries to regain the attention of fans in the twilight of his career. <br /> <br /> To bring it back as a "extra magic" that could win again mentions, C.A. releases Casanova Frankenstein, a WAAAAAY over-the-top threat, played by Goeffrey Rush. This mad genius has created a "psycho-instructor" to turn Champion City into a reflection of his madness ... and ends up catching C.A. within hours of being released from prison. This leaves only Mystery Men to stop Frankenstein's evil plan, but with the acolytes, such as Frankenstein's Disco Boys, the trio needs a little help. <br /> <br /> The recruitment begins, and after a painful recruitment party, the team sets up with The Bowler (Janeane Garofolo), who initially has the only real talent in the team, bowling mystical ball apparently animated by the revenge spirit of her dead father; the invisible boy (Kel Mitchell), who CLAIMS becomes invisible when ABSOLUTELY NOTHING looks at him; Spleen (Paul Reubens), gave the mystical flatulence of an angry Gypsy; (Wes Studi), which is proven to be able to cut weapons in half with his mind, then spends much of the rest of the film panting foolish riddles and acting on the Wise. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a Romp romp. Anyone who wants to shoot with pigeon mouths in small small classes is struggling with a losing battle. This is a spoof / parody of the superhero genre - from pseudo-Burton sets endlessly recycled (and occasionally decorated with more spoof material) for ridiculous outfits, the genre of comics becomes a pretty good send-up. But, at the same time, it is also a super-heroic movement. Both. Although not necessarily a unique idea in itself (for example, this film is, in some short-lived reflective modes of Inferior Five Working D.C. Comic), is quite innovative for the big screen. Gives the world to comic books that require a suspicion of accepting anyway, then throws the inevitable vagabond - and we all know if the superheroes are real, so would these real guys. If Guy Big with S were flying around New York City, you see half a dozen reports of idiots in intimate underwear getting their ass kicked regularly. Sure, Shoveller is fighting pretty well, and Blue Raja throws the forks with great precision - all parts of the superhero world. But does that make them authentic superheroes? Only in their minds. This movie is also a comedy, though a dark one. Inevitably, when trying to point out the ridiculous nature of the superheroes. A flight line acts like comic stripes on the stage, throwing many bits out of which to play. The dialogue between Janeane Garofalo and his bowling father is particularly wonderful. However, it is not a comedy in the sense of laughing separation or everlasting memorable jokes. It blends in a dose of drama, discovery and romance but never fully ventures into any of them. What really makes Mystery Men a good movie, in the end is that it is very engaging. Good / weak boys are finally justified and, for a brilliant moment, they are really superheroes; justice is served; and the movie ends with a scene that moves from realism (as much realism as possible in a world where bowling balls fly and glasses make perfect disguise). If the spectator no longer attempts to label the film, then the film can be a great story. Of course, no movie is perfect. Claire Forlani emerges bored and boldly as the interest of Mr Furious's love, despite having a central role in his conscience. Tom Waits seems somewhat confused by his own lines as mad inventor Dr. Heller, with all the opening scenes taking ladies retired in the elderly's home is worth watching alone. And the Villians are never more than sticks of arms (a point in the movie). The cinema is jaded and incoherent (as is the case in the average comic book, so it is excruciating), music sometimes overwhelms the landscape, and the special effects are not quite integrated into the rest very well. <br /> <br /> But generally, this movie is incredible. You probably have to be a comic and superhero fan to really appreciate this movie, but it's a fun and good way to kill a few hours and let the brain rest. 8/10 in my opinion.
