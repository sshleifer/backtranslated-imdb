I liked this movie, at first the thin graphics seemed strange to the granular film, but I quickly entered it. Probably thousands of hours of shooting have been recorded, and I really admire the work done for cutting it. If you are slightly shocked by drugs or violence, it's possible that the movie is not the movie for you, but here are extraordinary characters (and real tossers). From a technical point of view, I liked it very much, probably using a new interleaving algorithm, or maybe just the movie seemed so dark, but I was not annoyed by the usual artefacts seen in video and movie transfers. (The Open Water struck me, especially because there are cheap and progressive cameras available now and I do not see any excuse in not throwing it on fire if you're going to show up in the cinema). I'm sorry it's my own. I definitely recommend this movie if you ever got involved in the music scene, it has some tragic moments, but most of it is hilarious, I may be accused of laughing at another misfortune, but it's a classic song.
