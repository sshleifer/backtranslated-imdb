I watched this movie in the morning when I was asleep. This, in itself, was a testimony that Deliverance was a binding film. I think Boorman did a great job in the direction of this movie. How well the early scene was made with people in the hill and the banjoed duel. It looked so good and how early it was how inherently reserved and simple was the people in the area. The point case - near the end of the duel, the banjo-smiling boy (he said his banjo), but when Drew tried to shake him after the battle, the child was too reserved to answer. The river voyage did not leave you bored, sure. The scene of rape was brutal, but it was necessary to show exactly what the group was facing in this region of Georgia. I think Beatty's traumatic shock was well done. Some said it was fairly unaffected by the herd. I do not agree - if you have really paid attention, he did not respond during the next immediate action, in which Reynolds threw the arrow through the attacker and drove the guy without teeth. He was confused when Ed killed the other, later at the top of the cliff. Almost it was shown that the arrow was shot while Ed was bent and waiting to die, but then you understand that the arrow that she shot earlier had effect. Finally, a wonderful movie and I was moving between 8 and 9 votes, but after reading a message from an unsatisfied voter who gave him a "1", I gave her a "10". This reasoning of an individual seemed to rely more on personal bias than on an objective vision, and his vote was obviously an inadequate attempt to reduce ratings.
