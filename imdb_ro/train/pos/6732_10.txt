This was the best documentary I've ever seen! I just saw Lords of Dogtown and wanted to find out more about Stacy Peralta and she was surprised and happy to find out that it was one of his films. Stacy Great Job! I was hit him back to work last week, bored O * & ^% less and this movie came on. Growing up in Orange County in the 80's I sailed up and down the local beaches and so did my father when he was a teenager. I grew up at the beach, my parents took me every weekend, I sailed with the body, got up, then moved from there. This movie captivated me. It was long before my time, but it was great to see what went through these guys ... PIONEERS TRUE! This movie is a collection element.
