Great movie when I saw him. I have to say one of my favorite movies of all time. I've seen it eight times in the theater and got the DVD. As I grew older and I saw it again, I realized the film was medium. Compared with movies that are good comedians, this is nothing. I mean Rock was hilarious in the movie, and the whole change with racial stuff breaks a few barriers that are great. Also, the thought of how the movie works is a pleasant way of thinking. It's like most people have thought about a movie, but also a little twist that is a very pleasant touch. I like the whole movie so I give it a ... <br /> <br /> Another 7/10 good for me.
