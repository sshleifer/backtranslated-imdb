This is a language in the cheek film from the beginning, with a voice-over who enjoys everything French and then produces a rather na√Øve but very brave hero in Fanfan La Tulipe. Explained by the splendid Gerard Philippe, the young bully who fully believes in Lollobrigida's fate predominates the prostitute - especially that he will marry the daughter of King Louis XV! The problem is that La Lollo soon finds herself in love with Fanfan ... Powered by fights, savannas and other spirits, the film moves at a lively and comical moment. The direction is probably the worst aspect, but the movie is so easy and it's so bad that I could not give her two thoughts to those deficiencies. Watch out for Noel Roquevert, a traditional heavy movie in French films, trying to steal La Lollo, making him a nuisance, and nurturing it with the fortune that reads La Lollo's hand! And what kind of jewelery Marcel Herrand is like King Louis XVI megalomaniac and driven by lust? That's not all: so many beautiful women in a movie make me want to be in France and on the plateau in 1952! The movie may have gone out that year, but the voice, the cheek, the stunning story, the immaculate photo and the memorable Gerard Philippe make sure it stays modern and enjoyable. I would not hesitate to recommend it to my grandchildren, not to mention someone who loves movies in general and especially those who teach specially! You see her!
