I caught this film on the IFC and I enjoyed it, though I felt that the editing work was a bit tough though maybe it was deliberate. I had a hard time calculating what happened at first, because it seemed like a Pulp Fiction style nonlinear plot. It seemed a little forced. I certainly think the movie is worth watching, but I think it could have used some cleanliness. Some scenes do not seem to make sense to others. <br /> <br /> I am surprised to see the rating here as low as it is. Not remarkable, but it does not have serious problems. I gave her a 7/10. The film has shown at least that Laurence Fishburne can act when he wants. They probably just told him not to make Matrix movies.
