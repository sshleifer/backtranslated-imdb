The types of tweedy teachers thought they managed to figure out. Today's peoples living in Polynesia have descended from Asia as a migrant, moving from the Far East, islands to islands, east to Tahiti and all the other exotic tropical islands in the South Pacific over thousands of years. But the established thinking did not work well with the young Norwegian ethnographer Thor Heyerdahl. If this explanation is true, how could some people born and raised in those islands have traditions, works of art and physical traits similar to those in Asia but not South America? How can the vegetation of Ecuador, Peru and Chile look so much like what you found on the island a few thousand miles away? Is it just a coincidence that Islanders are heading for the sea in the direction of South America and say where do their ancestors, led by Tiki, come from their equivalent of Adam? Meanwhile, as the Norwegians speak of the Scandinavian precursors who were traced from the South American continent they colonized, and along with some of the indigenous peoples they have become friends, they started at sea - westward? It's too much to be a coincidence for Heyerdahl. With an amazing amount of moxie, a handful of crew and local know-how to build traditional rafts, an expedition begins. It is so much a journey into human imagination, because it is a pseudo-scientific demonstration that such a journey is only possible with many basic things of instruments and navigation. The Oscar winning documentary can be dated in the Anglo-Ethnocentric tone and approach, but with a spirit of adventure, even the space program launched a decade later, because people are willing to risk everything to test a theory they think is true. Wonderful. Do a favor and read the first book. It's an amazing set of pages and the perfect setting for the news-style movie.
