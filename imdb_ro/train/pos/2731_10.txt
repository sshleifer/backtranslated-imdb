I'm sorry, I do not have much time to write. I'm not a psychologist, but I've known a 25-year-old. She said that Scott Wilson performed a sociopath (without conscience) extraordinarily well. I agree! She also said that Robert Blake represented a person with anger and impulse control who had a consciousness but could not control superbly. I agree! What a smelly and extraordinary movie. I've seen over 2,000 movies and I would categorize this in the top 100. My lifelong friend deals with clients like these on a regular basis. My only criticism was narrative preaching at the end of the movie. Many people grow in lesser circumstances than the ideal ones, but only one in a million will behave as these two losers did.
