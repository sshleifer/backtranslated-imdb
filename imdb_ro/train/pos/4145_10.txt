This is not the Masterpiece Theater. You should not get into this by waiting for that. This is a pure FUN girl with the most fantastic cast of feminine women. As someone else said, this is the Baby Mama movie that was supposed to be. And the only downside I can see in this movie is that Tina Fey was not in her - except that she plays the smartest and brightest girls on the planet. The film is a pure nonsense on the surface, but if you really look, you will know that it has a lot of messages and deep meaning for any of us who want to come back and make it alive again knowing what we know now. PURE FUN and recommend it to everyone looking for 84 minutes of escape.
