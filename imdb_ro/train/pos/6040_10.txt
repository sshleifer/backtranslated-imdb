I just did not get tired of watching FREEBIRD. My husband was an extra, so I was involved right from the start. You have kept in touch with Jon and helped promote the movie in both cinemas and DVDs. Even to the extent that it distributes promotional postcards on intermediate ferries and in various places in France. FREEBIRD has been written and guided in particular with the perfect combination of fun and serious moments plus the choice for casting. Only Phil Daniels could fit into Grouch's role. The great privilege to meet with Jon and those at the party after the prime minister in January. Anything else you want to get Jon to ask you, either by e-mail or by phone, you know how to do it to me. Sue xx
