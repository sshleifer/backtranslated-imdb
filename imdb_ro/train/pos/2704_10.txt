I was disappointed, if not surprised, by the lack of appreciation that this film received. Once again, Billy Zane proves he's more than a cute Hollywood boy in a silent interpretation that combines spastic slapstick with underpriced pathos. Calling to this silent movie is inaccurate because there is plenty of music and sound. It has a manic rhythm and is full of the blunt inventiveness Ed Wood teaches in the end. Look at the cast statement, and realize that everyone shines. Nobody is just to show his face. I think everyone is in the movie to show their appreciation about Wood and to make a broad and physical type of action that has not been seen these days. But today, reviewers are trying to guess what's going on to become a hit much more than show any kind of aesthetic appreciation for a movie. IWUETDID has no visible audience. It was mostly made of love for Wood's script. Even after his death, socially parasitic fashioners gave him another serious blow and deprived the world of a classic minor. This is a really fun and truly experimenting movie that deserves to live, at least on DVD.
