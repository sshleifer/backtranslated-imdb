The State Department of the United States would not like to see this movie because it has beef with the Iranian government. However, it shows us how the truly civilized Iran is, despite the content of the film, which focuses on fighting women there for equal rights in simple terms: the ability to watch a football game at the stadium, which is strictly limited to the public male. The movie is hilariously funny, and in itself is proof of freedom of expression and expression in Iran. I really liked this movie. Five girls are trying to penetrate the border at the ticket gates at a football match between Iran and Bahrain. The next comedy is too fun to describe, from bus to stadium, police interception and subsequent girls' detention until the end result. Do not miss this classic movie. SHOULD see him. One of the best foreign movies I've seen over the years.
