The premise for this film is simple and so is the scenario: an elderly Muslim receives his adolescent son to lead him in a similar old age carriage from France to the Mecca in Saudi Arabia in order to be able to meet his Muslim obligation dies. The Father is clearly devoted religiously, but the son is unprinted; he rather accepts his obligation to his father than to religion, he would rather be with his (non-Muslim) girlfriend. The father is stubborn in many things that the son does not understand, and petulance between them is the device that keeps the drama though it is often rather strange. However, like any good road movie, there are strange characters encountered along the way; for example, a woman on a road in Croatia who, after asking for guidance to Belgrade, simply gets to the back seat and shows with her hand a word they suppose to be a place but can not find on the map. In Bulgaria, another man asks for confirmation that he can speak in French, but then gives an ample comment in Bulgarian. There is also an occasional humor - in a country, the tires for eating egg sandwiches and wanting flesh are given a goat, but unfortunately (probably fortunately for the spectator), run before the father can fulfill the Muslim sacrificial ritual. They eventually reach Mecca - the Muslim equivalent of the Vatican, but on a much larger scale. For Westerners it is bizarre but fascinating. The film is not sophisticated, but it is charming in its kind, a sort of National Geographic with soul.
