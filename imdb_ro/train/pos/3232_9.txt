I wanted to see this Finnish film and I have to say that this is one of the best movies I've seen this year. The intrigue is composed of 5-6 different stories, all taking place on the same day in a small Finnish city. The stories are finally coming together very nicely, remembering perhaps a bit of the way Tarantino's films are doing. Most actors have done very well, which is certainly necessary in realistic dramas of this type. I especially enjoyed the act of Sanna Hietala, lead actress and Juha Kukkonen. I have noticed that IMDB has received the wrong information about Sanna. Her name, as you would have seen in the magazine;), NOT Heikkila, but Hietala.
