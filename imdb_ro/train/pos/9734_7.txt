Well, here comes another romantic comedy ... but unlike all other films of this kind, this is by far the best I have seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> I admit, first I wanted to watch this movie because of Megan Fox and a bit because of Simon Pegg ... First, if you saw a huge amount of movies, you you know Sidney and Alison would be together in the movie and in the movie in one way or the other ... but from the beginning to the end of the movie you will not know how ... <br /> <br /> Well, now this the film is for Simon Pegg only. I can not see any other actor in the role of Sidney, and I'm sure this would be a very poor film, if not for Pegg's performance. <br /> <br /> A lot of jokes and jokes in this movie that kept me laughing very hard with the kindness of Simon Pegg Sidney's character ... but I think everyone in this movie is good. For example, Kirsten Dunst is really solid in this movie, think of her only as an average act but she was really good at it), then I'm Jeff Bridges, there's Gillian Anderson and, of course, Megan Fox playing the role spoiled Sophie Maes ... her big role ... <br /> <br /> Overall, although I usually disagree with her rating on IMDb, this time I would agree with them ... <br /> <br /> Go and see this movie is really light and positive and I strongly recommend it ... My rating 7 of 10 ... well 7.5 actually ...
