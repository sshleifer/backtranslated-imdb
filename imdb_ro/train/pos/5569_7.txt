The next film by Cheech & Chong (1980) was the second film to play duo loving Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong. Those who love burn smokers are now roommates. They live in a condemned building, looking for ways to score more smoke and stay throughout the day. But Cheech is the "responsible". She has a job and a constant friend. One day, Cheech wants to do his oddity, so he's trying to get Chong out of the house. Another problem appears, Cheech's brother "Red" (Cheech is another role) is in the city and wants to stay with him. Firguring that he could kill two birds with one stone, Cheech pioni Chong off and Red. What kind of adventures will Chong and Red come in? Will Cheech do the freak? How long will Chong go without smoke? Just watch CHEECH & CHONG'S NEXT MOVIE to find out! Tommy Chong takes over directorial direction to continue. He received an experience when he did an uncreated work about UP IN SMOKE. Funny, but not as good as the first movie. But fans Cheech and Chong will enjoy. Followed by NICE DREAMS. Recommended.
