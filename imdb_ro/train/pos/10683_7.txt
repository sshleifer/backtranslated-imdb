This is a quieter movie than the average, and it's still worth seeing if you're a fan of silence. However, if you are not yet a fan of the genre, we suggest trying some other movies before watching this movie. That's because the plot seems old and hard to believe in stains. But despite this, it is still a good film and has kept my interest. A beautiful lady, unfortunately, linked to the evil man and fled to marry him. The film begins five years later, after realizing that he is indeed a brutal thief. In spite of these things, she tries to do her best and not to confine herself to how good her life was before she enters her life. However, the rent is due and there is no money, so the lady is forced to look for work. She becomes a personal seamstress for a rich lady whose husband is trying to make a deal. Unfortunately, the lady they were trying to associate with a potential client for a party can not do it, and the seamstress is kindly paid to be the man. Well, like the Cinderella, she cleans up pretty well and the man is infatuated with her! What to do now - since she is actually married and that the new guy wants to marry her! See the movie to see how it's done. I did not like the husband's hand, because they seemed highly predictable and clich√©ed. However, once it failed, I admire the way the movie did NOT give up the end of the numbers and left the movie with some free heads. , a very good movie that's worth seeing, but certainly not great.
