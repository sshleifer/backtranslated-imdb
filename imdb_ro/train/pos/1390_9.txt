If you like Sci-Fi in the 70th cult as they do, or if you like movies like "Repo Man" or "Buckaroo Bonzai", you will not like this. It's a spectacular spectacle of 70-year consciousness, including a twentieth-century ramp and Earth a million years ago. This movie is pure from the '70s. Put Pink Floyd's "Fly Like A Eagle" or "Dark Part of the Moon" on Steve Miller and you're ready to go!
