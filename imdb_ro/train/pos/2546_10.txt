It's just the same league as "The Black Cat", although I would give a 9 and not a 9+. It's really a praise for a movie that was so badly underestimated that it's amazing! "Ray Invisible" is a horrible part, a dramatic play and of course a part of science fiction. For a film made in 1936, sci-fi elements were a good thing before their time. The mixture of horror, drama and science fiction is a perfect blend, while Lugosi and Karloff can not be better. Director Lambert Hillyer captures a lot of elements that James Whale has done so often. What I'm saying is that this movie is dizzy and well shot. The gargoyle scene outside Lugosi's room is a perfect example of mood. It's a remarkable moment in the movie that, unfortunately, is missing in today's genre films. As with "Blackheads" and "The Soul of Lost Souls," I do not understand why the movie has not yet been released on DVD. When you consider some of the junk that has already been transferred to DVD is much more puzzling. Anyway, watch this movie if you have the chance. When it's released on DVD, grab it fast and put it in a place honored in your DVD library.
