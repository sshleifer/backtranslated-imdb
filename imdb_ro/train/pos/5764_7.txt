I first revisited this movie on Amazon about 6 or 7 years ago and I beat him. I think I called him "miserable" and "turkey." Okay, well, according to most standards, it's still a turkey. It has almost no production value, which has a small parcel has almost no meaning, and the action is at the level of a third-class game. Having said that, this has really increased me over the years as a kind of classical camp. In fact, all the films by director Todd Sheets had this effect. I'm almost like Ed Wood in this regard: Watch them again and over and select flubbed lines, continuity errors (the same zombie, two different locations!), And other defects. tell them: The sheet is a very cute guy and, while one of his first productions is not so great, he has become enriched. And I have to add that Kasey Rousch, the only truly decent actress / actress in the film, though I can be biased, while I attended school with her.
