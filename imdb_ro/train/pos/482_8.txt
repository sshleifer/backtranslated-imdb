This is a film poetry, presented wonderfully and photographed with sensitive art. It captures the atmosphere of time and the perfect place. (Lake District of Italy in the 1920s). It's a love story with a turn. The characters are unique and credible. Settings are delicious exotic. Some of the scenes - the funeral boat in the fog --- the long shot of the chess table at the center of a complicated floor - are beautiful pictures. And rather than the happy ending, this story has a sweet sweetness. If the film is an art, this is close to a masterpiece. <br /> <br />
