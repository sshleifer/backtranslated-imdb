I want to be honest, I finally checked this movie not because of the stars - though they were reasonably traceable and persuasive, especially by the three rulers - or even the convincing story of a violation of the Presidential Secretary Service (something, has been informed by the DVD extracts of this show, has never happened. So it is true, that's remarkable!). I took it because it was straightened and has a cameo choice of no one other than Detective Meldrick Lewis! Well, well, Clark Johnson, one of my friends at "Homicide: Life on the Streets" and a veteran (mostly) television director. I would say he does as well as he can with a project that can be tracked, but quite environmentally, despite the possibilities. Veteran and secretary The American secretary Pete Garrison (Michael Douglass) must find out both those who blackmail him and the one who killed his boyfriend, he targeted and threw a helicopter in the air and forcibly forced the President. His affair with the first lady (Kim Basinger, clearly one of the first HOTTER ladies I've ever had, fictitious or real) does not surely help her position. He needs to cut off his real afternoon and avoid the dog like the hunt of his former friend and boss (Kiefer Sutherland, almost completely in "24" mode). Cast yourself in some other pivotal agents (Martin Donovan and foxy, something hard to buy like Eva Longorria) and shadowy foreign characters, and you have a fairly standard political thriller that's not so big that he pretends and gets to desire, if overwhelming, results. The synthesis line is about the best way to describe how this show looks without spoilers. The DVD for me seemed more visible and more exciting than the movie, although the movie itself was fun enough to keep the most (including myself) interested.
