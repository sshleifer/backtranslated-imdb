The premise of this story is simple: an old man living alone in the woods accidentally encounters an assassination of a small child and tries to convince the police that the crime has taken place. Although the dialogue is very limited throughout the film, the visual story given only by the eye of the camera made the film quite interesting. Adjusting gray forests gives a sense of loneliness that complements the silence of the characters. We also feel helpless in the old man's inability to convince the crime police, which is parallel to the inability of silence to tell their own story. The dreadful truth consists of feelings of hope, helplessness and irrationality. This film addresses these elements only visually, rather than relying on cheap sound effects or blood and gore that other horror films misuse when the narrative is weak. Cleverly, the story runs at a slow pace to create tensions for some daunting and surprising moments. The end is also unexpected and credible. Removing Japanese horror films such as "Ring" and "Dark Water," or horror films in English such as "Lady in Black" and "Innocents," this film gives viewers the true horror experience of the atmosphere. I recommend anyone who enjoys a good cool bones to scare to make this movie a try. By the way, if you have not seen the movies that I just mentioned above, you might want to give them a try as well.
