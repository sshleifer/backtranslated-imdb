Kusturika managed again. Another masterpiece. A comedy of corals full of landmarks, with a frantic rhythm and many glorious moments, I laughed and laughed, what a party! Music is everywhere, but also the shooting, the animals, the insane madmen, the amazing sex and gadgets and inventions, everything that is visually colored to have fun. Cinema pure, essentially. A wonderful experience to watch. And one is particularly grateful, because good comedies are so rare and so wonderful. Well, this is one, and if you like Kusturica's previous films, you like this, though, as in all comedies, it's a chemical reaction and you have to have a mood for mood.
