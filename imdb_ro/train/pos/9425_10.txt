A series of super comedians from the 1990s (Two Series were made in total) who suffered in UK ratings due to inappropriate programming. When you've encountered established comedies such as "Minder," even the best new comedies will struggle to observe. Fortunately, I caught the series of the first episode and I followed her with avidity. I mentioned this to friends and family at the time, but everyone seemed to look at something else. Very, very frustrating. Anyway, I loved both series and never forgot. Then I looked over the internet and found that an ultra-fan tried to get both series released "on their own". Well, both series are now available on DVD. http://www.replaydvd.co.uk/joking_apart_S1. htm
