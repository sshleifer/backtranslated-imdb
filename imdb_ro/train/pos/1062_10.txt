I think this show is definitely the biggest show. Jessica Alba is doing such a good job in it. Michael Weatherly also does a great job, as well as the rest of the play. The show is very exciting and has wonderful stories, and their waterfalls are amazing. It's like watching an hour's movie. It's definitely worth watching.
