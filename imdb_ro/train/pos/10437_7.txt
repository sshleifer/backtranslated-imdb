This is a slow story. No action. No crazy suspense. No sudden surprise. If you can not see a movie about two people talking and wearing, about a story that develops slowly to the end and about the love of love, do not waste your time and money. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, if you are in dialogue, tell the story of the master, think challenging ideas and find true love in the fabric of life, then this is your movie. We recommend that you watch this movie when you are most alert, however, because the rhythm, the music and the general tone of the movie can put you in a hunting state. It's really fantastic. I myself say that. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are sometimes annoying with their manners sometimes, but fortunately, the chemistry between the two makes the act very natural, warm and delicate. They act and feel from the beginning, making you feel like an intruder. In their conversations there are excellent reviews on many topics that will cause your thinking and conversation with you and your partner. I thought it was too deep and too diverse for such young characters, but I could underestimate my intelligence. Still, it did not ruin the movie. The whole story is very simple, which I think gives the film the charm and, ultimately, the power. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: The film flow is slow. The dialogue is fascinating. The story is built up easily, systematically and substantially. Construction to the end is satisfactory and eventually rewards.
