Full House is a great family show. However, after seeing a few episodes again and again, I realized that I was incredibly boring and it seems to be gathering a lot from the outside world. Yes, there is a lot of comedy, but there are times when it is incredibly cheesy. It's not like I hate her, but you do not always look at them, because they get old fast. Perhaps the best season is the first. Full House is about widow Danny Tanner (Bob Saget) and his three daughters D.J. (Candace Cameron) Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley). When Danny's wife dies, he needs help. So his best friend Joey (Dave Coulier) and uncle Jesse (John Stamos) of the girls are moving with them. Once they live together, they discover that they can not live one another. <br /> <br /> The complete house reminds you of how important the family is and that you can always go home again.
