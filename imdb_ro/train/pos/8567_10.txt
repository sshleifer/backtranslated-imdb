I liked the film and I would suggest anyone just for a good time. Do not take the movie too seriously because remember that it's Disney and it's rated G. It's a good fun though some parts can be recognized by adults, but the children would never notice, especially the "triangle" between Cruella, Le Pelt and the believers of Cruella valet Alonso. Glenn Close is fantastic and really did Cruella and is even terrible even when she is "cured" by loving fur ways, she can instill fear in audience with her cries that literally shake the theater. (I really woke up jumping in my chair when you caught her surprise with her "bipolarity" like the dog that loved Ella.) Overall, I'll see him again in the theater, so much to me.
