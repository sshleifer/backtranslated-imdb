This has to be the best movie I've ever seen. Combine a stunning cinema with stunning action and a close plot, and you have a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Dog Bite Dog caught the edge of the chair during scenes, moving in horror during the others and drowning in my tears after the tragic end. The film gave me a deep impression. Violent shocking scenes suddenly contrast with painful and delicate scenes of love. The film does not deserve Cat III's evaluation (nudity); there is no nude scene, and "love" scenes do not even involve kissing or "doing." The message that this movie presented to me? All people, no matter how violent or cruel they may seem, have a delicate part. Edison Chen does an excellent job playing Pang's killer. I rate this 10/10 movie. It's a must-watch.
