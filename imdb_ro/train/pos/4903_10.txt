Inspired by at least Ivy Benson & All The Girls Orchestra, who played throughout the war years at the Covent Garden Opera, this film chronicles the attempts of a saxophone player to reform (almost) all the band he played with as a school towards the end of the Second World War. Rapid reporting of the original troupes on the stage brings some wonderful music and helps fill the band's background and, in particular, girls' relationships with a single young man - their transvestite drummer (who is trying to avoid the call). Ian Holm ("Lord of the Rings", "Cromwell and Fairfax") and Judi Dench are transformed into superb driving performances like Elizabeth's recent widow, Patrick, the drummer. Joan Sims, young man, is perfect as the band leader who is now playing a beach bar piano, and Whitfield shines like a rescue army trombone. Cameo's appearances by other masters such as Cleo Laine, Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Billie Whitelaw make this an unforgettable experience. The film is a memory band, with a star of all the stars of what should, through all rights, be a bunch of actresses over the hill. All I can say is, I hope I look good at their age! Leslie Caron, in particular, is still an incredible fox, 69 years old. Surely my pulse! As I watched him, I mentally complained about the casting director not to use women of the right age. Afterwards, I looked at these girls and found that each of them was old enough to be performed in London in 1944 (although this could be a bit stretching for Judi Dench). If you like swing bands, thrive on nostalgia, or just want to see how good a woman can manage the look for almost three quarters of a century behind her, do not miss this movie. <br /> <br />
