This movie is definitely one of my favorite films. Interaction between respectable and morally uncorrupted characters is a cave owl and a code of honor among thieves and policemen. It deals with themes such as duty, guilt, word, manipulation and trust, as did the few movies and, unfortunately, none that I can remember from the death of the "police" in the late seventies. The sequence is delicious, to the essentials, without living anything, and which causes the spectator to behave in a correct and wrong masterpiece without an accessory that attracts spectacular eyes and scenes often required in smaller copies of the genre, to keep the audience awake. There are no such scenes or are not required. The argument is unclear and honest for the spectator, which is an important asset in a genre where suspense is often accomplished by treading the public. No, do not miss Marble ... A note of congratulations on music is in order A movie to watch and enjoy every minute, not just to see.
