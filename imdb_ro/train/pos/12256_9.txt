Kate Beckinsale is great as Emma manipulative and yet irresistible in this TV adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. When I read that novel, sometimes I was quite doubtful if the protagonist really deserves to be considered the heroine of the story: for frankly she is so self-righteous and scheming that she is tempted to despise it seriously. Kate Beckinsale's interpretation saves Emma from herself: she is portrayed with all the innocence and generosity of her character in full vision, and can only help her give up and love her despite her less-favored qualities. Kate Beckinsale is the main but not the only reason why this TV series is so delightful; Raymond Coulthard is perfect as Frank Churchill, fully expressing this person's personal magnetism (which is all the more obvious because this role was not well managed by Ewan McGregor in adapting Emma's 1996 screen) and Mark Strong, Samantha Morton, Bernard Hepton and Olivia Williams are just as they should be in their roles. This production is, in short, a great achievement and one to see many times with increasing pleasure.
