Daniel Day Lewis is one of the best actors of our time and one of my favorites. It's amazing how much they throw in each of the characters they play, making them real. I remember, many years ago, we had a party in our house - the friends came, we were sitting around the table, eating, drinking wine, talking, laughing - having a good time. The TV was on - it was a movie we did not pay too much attention to. Then, suddenly, we all stopped talking and laughing. The glasses did not shake, the forks did not move, the food became cold on the plates. We could not take our eyes off the screen, where the young sick man whose entire body was against him and who only had control of his left foot took a piece of chalk with his leg and for what it seemed that eternity attempted to write only a word on the floor. When he finished writing one word, we all know that I have not seen one, but three victories - the triumph of the will and the human spirit, the triumph of the cinematographer who managed to capture the moment of this film in the film and the triumph of an actor who did not act , but who became his character. "My Left Fever" by Jim Sheridan is an insatiable, unconscious bio-drama about Christy Brown, the man who was born with cerebral palsy in a Dublin slum; who became an artist and writer and found a love of his life. I love all the shows of Lewis' day (I have mixed feelings about his performance in GONY), but I think the biggest role was Christy Brown in "My Left Foot"
