DOCTEUR PETIOT, with Michel Serrault, is a brutal story about a brutal man. A doctor who heals the sick in busy France, even if their ability to compensate is not there. However, it deals with the weakest in the middle of the population. The images and the cinema are gorgeous and give a terrible feeling to this complex story. He is the perfect psychopath. Seductive and altruistic, intelligent and thoughtful, calculated and killer. A sure film that will not be forgotten soon by the spectator. Kudos to Mr. Serrault, for his refreshing portrait.
