He enjoyed this little movie very much. It's a moving film about fighting, sacrifice and especially the friendship between different peoples (the child actor playing Miki is especially good). There are so many large-scale impersonal movies around WW2 that this convincingly told the little story is a true break from the norm and an original one at that. I will also add that this movie is far from being boring, very far! Of course, the horses are wonderful and the scenery is breathtaking. For anyone who really treats the animal as part of the family (I), you will find this highly rewarding film. Recommended for movie fans looking for something different.
