I also watched this movie at the Santa Barbara Film Festival. It was an excellent film about adult family relationships. Paul Reiser wrote the film and included some resemblance to his family. It was funny, hot, full of motion, and moving, as well as fun. A movie like this would do very well with word reviews. I would definitely tell my friends and family to see this movie. Let's hope they just get the chance. I would recommend the film as one of the best movies I've seen in a year. It does not contain violence, scenes of action, crime, sex, so distributors wonder, whether they take it or not. Believe me, there are people who would like to go see a movie like this one, which has a redeeming value, instead of the many big box office blockbusters we usually offer.
