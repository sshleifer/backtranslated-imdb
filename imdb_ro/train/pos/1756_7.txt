'' The 40-year-old Virgo '' made me laugh a lot. I do not care if it's considered a very sexual comedy, I just enjoyed many of the jokes and scenes present in this movie. Steve Carell is perfect as the virgin sorcerer Andy Stitzer and I think the scene where Andy has his hair in his waxed chest is one of the hardest, especially because it's real. Many of the actors and actresses present in this movie are well known or already famous, by the way. Andy Stitzer has a quiet life. It's a little strange and collects a lot of toys, but it sounds harmless. One day, while playing poker with his friends, he discovers that Andy is actually ... virgin! And he's already 40 years old! After this surprising revelation, all his friends try to make Andy sleep with a woman ... the problem is Andy's confusion, especially now that she starts to like Trish, a woman she knew when buy a DVD player in the shop he's working on.
