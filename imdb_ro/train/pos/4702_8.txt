If this film proves only one thing, Keaton is, has been and will always be a heartbeat, even when he dodges the bullets, pointing to the electric chair and reaching the wrong end of an information line in prison. <br /> <br /> But Johnny Dangerous continues to prove even more. In the '80s, ZAZ boys (Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker) were the culmination of the spy world. But there were a few contenders at the throne. This time, Amy ("Fast Times at Ridgement High"), Heckerling tries her hand with a stunning amount of television writers behind the script (go and check). <br /> <br /> This happy doll doll doll of the 1930s has lost its films casting almost every loop for a loop and even adds a few clich√©s that did not exist back when the <b> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> More, every other Hollywood actor who it happened to be in the immediate vicinity. You'd be surprised how many faces you'll recognize. I know I was. And jokes? Well, when they start, they come to you quickly and angrily like a machine gun. There is too much to count at first, surpassing a Weird Al Yankovic crazy song. But you have to be careful when recharging. And it has to recharge a little too often. <br /> <br /> Everybody tries, they seem to have fun and laugh a good deal of time. In the end, however, there was plenty of time to think how certain scenes might have been funny - it's usually not the best thing to think about after watching a comedy. But for a slow night when there is nothing good on television, pop in "Johnny" and be ready for some "dangerous", laugh seriously. Eight stars. Check out "Johnny Dangerous" ... do not be a "bastidge".
