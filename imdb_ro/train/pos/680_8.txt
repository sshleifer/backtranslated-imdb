"The Last Wave" is one of those movies that relies heavily on the mind. The title refers to the aoriginal theory of contempt of the day: there will be a last wave that will erase everything. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) is a Sydney lawyer employed to defend some Aborigines accused of murder. During this time, there were unusually high rainfall in Australia. As he defends the Aborigines, David learns the latest wave theory and begins to wonder if it's just mythology. The last sequence of the film is a metaphor to get down into the depths of the mind. Peter Weir created an amazing but thoughtful film. Austrian actor David Gulpilil (seen in "Walkabout", "Crocodile Dundee" and "Rabbit Shelter") offers an interesting support role as one of the defendants. <br /> <br /> If you get the chance, watch the "do" feature on the DVD. Peter Weir explains some subtleties of the film, some of which refer to Richard Chamberlain's background.
