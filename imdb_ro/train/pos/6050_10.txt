Finally! A decent British comedy that is not centered around bank robbers or twists from a television series. John Ivay's film is a psychotic story of discovery, dressed in biker gear. The three protagonists are gentle madmen with a propensity to failure and each at a turning point in their lives, offering a sensitive, emotional trio of sub-plots to riot riotous comedy together. The chemistry between the three amigos is palpable and makes for a moving company with a hilarious dialogue and a few moments of classical comedy. He feels part with Thenail and I, part of the American Werewolf in London, and part of Quadraphenia (but only because of bikes and Phil Daniels). In fact, the dashing lover of Phil Daniels reminds you of Danny, the trader in Thenail and myself, with his scientific approach and scientific commitment to drugs. This is a wonderful movie, especially for those who have gone into psychoactive substances in the past and will refer to many moments of the film. A personal preference is the brilliant scene in the Welsh corner shop that buys ammunition as they resist "shrooms." This gentle comedy will warm your palms of the heart and laugh at you loud and you do not have to go cycling or even go you will enjoy them, but it will add to this if you do.
