Anne Bronte's epic novel Anne Brontes' Witnesses should be studied and read in schools and libraries and homes. It's a fantastic story and tells the "true" truth about alcoholism and ruined marriage, and a mother struggles to keep her son away from her brutal husband. They are so similar to our today's stories that we see and hear, and I think people can learn a lot from reading this book. Based on the possible real experiences the author made in the 1840s. Watch this movie, a wonderful version of the book and really a really good move. I'm sure Anne would have been happy with the way it was produced. Excellent actors and excellent locations.
