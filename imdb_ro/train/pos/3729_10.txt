While I suspect that this movie could get rap as Anti-Vietnam while I was seeing it, I did not feel that was the case, as the film was simply an honest aspect in the perspective of the young people being trained for a war that the public did not support ... they showed fear, despair, leadership ... everything, out, empty. As a soldier, many of the themes proved to me true in my military experience - especially in the luggage camp. On the whole, this film, although shot on a very small budget, looks very good, is very well put together, and has an excellent acting and direction. I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for another great film by Colin Farrell. 10/10
