This story based on two pieces by Edgar Allen Poe ("The Fall of Usher's House", "The Dance of Death" (poem)) is actually quite creepy from the beginning to the end. It is similar to some of the old black and white movies about people who meet in an old, devastated home (for example, "The Cat and the Canary," "The Dark House," "Night of Terror," and so on). Boris Karloff plays a demented inventor of life-size dolls that terrorize guests. He dies early in the movie (or not?), And the inhabitants of the house are subject to terrifying experiences. I will not go into much detail here, but it is certainly a necessity for the fans of the old mysteries of the darkness of the house. Look at her with a lot of popcorn and soda in a dark room. /> <br /> Dan Basinger 8/10
