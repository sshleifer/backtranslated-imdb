Most Stoogephiles think this is not the best short Stooges bar, and they are right. Curly is a scream in the sensation like "Senorita Cucaracha," and Moe and Larry are in top form like "Senor Mucho" and "Senor Gusto", respectively. Christina McIntyre has a beautiful and well-functioning voice, and she's a well-prepared singer - and it's great. The great Gino Corrado is hilarious as a pompous Italian singer, Stooges terrorized at a society party. Some really funny bands, good direction and very tight editing make it to the top of Stooges's prolific production. More amazing is that Curly had serious health problems at the time, and in a few of the shorts he has done during this time, you can see that he is obviously sick; his calendar is much farther, he speaks very slowly and slowly, and has trouble getting closer. Fortunately, his health has been steadily rising when he made this film and looks. Classic Stooge comedy, and even enjoying non-Stooge fans (I had a girlfriend that could not resist Stooges, but she even laughed at it). We have to see.
