If you're a Freddy fan, then you might not like it. This seems to be a puppet of nightmares. Not much to see here. The only reason he keeps up with himself is Freddy's back story. The only thing that's always great in Nightmare's movies is death scenes. But death scenes have been very entangled in it. The visual effects were great, and the act was fine, but the back story was great. In fact, Freddy's story comes in this circle. I read improper reviews for this, but I enjoyed this despite its many flaws: 1. Nightmare on Elm Street. (8/10) <br /> <br /> 2. Freddy's Dead: The Last Nightmare. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 3. A nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Master of Dreams. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 4. A nightmare on Elm Street 3: The Warriors of Dreams. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 5. A nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dreamy Child. (6/10) <br /> <br /> 6. A nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge. (3/10) <br /> <br /> We recommend you enjoy the series. This was Freddy's fully explained, but that's all he is. Next on my Wes Cravens New Nightmare list. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
