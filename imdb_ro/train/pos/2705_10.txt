This is a script that Ed Wood has been working on over 10 years trying to do. Aris Iliopulos finally got the chutzpah to film a screenplay that Wood saved from his house burning at the expense of other more transient value objects. This is a movie without dialogue, which some can describe as crazy as silent. In fact, it's a pretty noisy movie, without the crazy jerk of most blows. In the hands of these directors, music and sound effects offer a rich audio experience that works better than almost any song from the Hollywood stage mill, especially since the stupid boat movie, Billy Zane, was the last time in ' Watch Out! ',' Oh No! '- J. Cameron .... ick ...) I will take Zane to a wonderful monosyllabic grunts communion in this film over naked dialogue on any day. Rick (b) Schroeder, Eartha Kitt and Andrew McCarthy The design is perfect, but it does not matter, the exquisite set of pyramids, and the performance of Ron Perlman is simply wonderful. Overall, this is a chaotic, visceral masterpiece made by fans of Ed Wood Jr., auteur and cinenephile, and I have to see for someone who really loves the movies as is obviously the first rate of Illiopoulos and his speech. A movie that makes you want to do it yourself.
