Spoilers After: I got the book "Evil Angels" when it first came out without knowing anything about the case. Just to give the press and the Austrians a pause here, I was far enough in it before I began to question Chamberlain's guilt. The author obviously intended the reader to understand why the audience jumped to the conclusions he had made. John Bryson told the story just as he was presented to the jurors (and taken over from the press) by the arterial spray, the actelon plates, the certainty of Dr. James Cameron that the collar was cut with scissors, that a child could not be taken from her clothes with the buttons still executed, her bloody hand, etc., all pretty convincing. After all, they were experts in their fields, who, for no apparent reason, had lied and the evidence was completely wrong, it was not at all apparent to me. There was also extremely technical, difficult evidence for a layman to understand. At this time, beyond some trial testimonies, almost nobody had ever heard of a dingo attacking a man; people did not think it was possible. The audience was suspicious of Seventh-day Adventists, whose origins made them worship, and all kinds of wild beliefs about them contributed to the appearance of vices. If they were not dedicated, disinterested attorneys, who were constantly working to investigate and counter the testimony of the trial, finding Azaria's clothes later would not have been enough to get Lindy out of jail. The book shook me for this reason, and I was reluctant to conclude on the guilt of anyone then (except, of course, JO). I was delighted that a movie would be made about the case and I do not think it could have been done better. I always liked Sam, which I could fully identify, and Meryl was perfect as always. Beautiful photo, haunting music. I think it's not just a very good movie, but very important. It's a shame she did not get publicity at the time of her release.
