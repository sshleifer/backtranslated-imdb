Spielberg's first drama is not over. It's a beautiful film made without any blame for the life of an African-American woman. It also proves that not all films that have African-American ethnicity as the center of the story must be headed by an African-American director. What I like about this movie is Spielberg's ability to do is very realistic despite being based on a book. In addition, Danny Glover was excellent as Mr. and usually is himself in all his films. But in this case, it remains complete and is someone else for once. But the performance of the whole movie comes from Whoopi Goldberg. She's excellent as Celie. You will never forget these characters once you see this movie. Now I've heard that the music version will be a movie and all I can say is: I hope it's about as good as it is, because it's a movie that should not be missed.
