That's what I expected when the DS9 star was released. Not to ease the DS9. This was a wonderful show in his own right, but he never gave fans more than what they wanted. The enterprise is that show. While it has a resemblance to the original trek, it differs enough to be original in its own way. It again makes interesting exploration ideas for us. And this was one of the main ingredients that made the original so loved. Another ingredient for success was the relationship that has evolved between crew members. Visitors were deeply worried about the crew. The company also has many promises in this area. The chemistry between Bakula and Blalock seems very promising. While sexual tension in a show can often become a crutch, I feel that business pressure can lead to much more and can say far more than it is typical. I think when we deal with such large-scale characters of different races or species, we have some very interesting ideas and television. We also have to notice the performances, Blalock is very convincing, because Vulcan T'pol and Bacula really have a caprice and a force of character that delivers tremendous performance. The rest of the cast also had good performances. My only aggression is as follows. Theme. It's good that it's different, but a little to leave the heart for my pleasure. We need something bigger. It does not have to be orchestral. Perhaps something with less electronic sound would be enough. And my other complaint. They sell too much. They could resolve this by selling less ads or making all the programs two floors. Otherwise, we'll get to see how the final act of the contest ends too soon, as it was one of my Voyager complaints.
