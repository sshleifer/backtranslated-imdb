Definitely, John Garfield's top five of the best movies must be Pride of the Marines. It is the true story of private sailor Al Schmid, who at the price of his own vision, while injured, held a horde of Japanese attacking Guadalcanal. <br /> <br /> The story fits nicely into three parts, Al Schmid's family life where he is a simple rigid worker who gets serious with a woman and who does not like it better than his bowling night. Pearl Harbor is bombed and he remained at war as millions of others were. The second part is at Guadalcanal and we see part of the action if he is in an isolated litter, holding Japanese troops. His action prevented the navy's positioning, but in his eyes a grenade. And, of course, the third part is the painful adjustment of civilian life, and to ensure that people do not care for him alone, especially the girl he had seen Eleanor Parker. This film was featured on John Garfield's 95-year TCM and was a documentary about Garfield, hosted by his daughter. One interviewee said Garfield was the most credible actor in the role of the working class in having and owning a union card. <br /> <br /> In this sense, he was lucky to have landed with Warner Brothers in Hollywood. Although he continued to get involved in gangster roles in the tradition of that studio, Garfield was great in these parts because of his background because he came from the life of Al Schmid, except for Garfield's Jewish Foundation. <br /> <br /> In this sense, he was perfect to play the role of a working class hero, such as Al Schmid, who accepted the responsibility to defend his country. No super hero here, just a guy who would have preferred to go back to Philadelphia but do a job that was supposed to be done. It's a big part for Garfield. It's a movie you do not have to lose. I wonder if all that happened to the real Al Schmid.
