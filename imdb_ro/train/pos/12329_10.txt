Before watching, please make sure you saw the Night of the Living Dead ... This could be the best 7-minute parody I've ever seen! "Special Effects" absurd, crappy (rope, rope!), And slices of bread slices ... what else do you need? <br /> <br /> (Do not watch this movie as you eat bread ... it might scare you!)
