The American film of Spring with the Australian song strikes the screen with a bang. And a stab. And a slice. And a scream or two. And a lot of blood, fear, red herring and lots of laughs. In fact, there is a lot of the first cut around - it's Dave Warner's first scenario to be produced, though he has more than one option or in negotiation; is the first major film of the director and former Hoodoo Guru Kimble Rendall; and is also the first film for producer Martin Fabinyi. And for a bunch of boys sinking their fingers at their feet in this kind for the first time, they certainly know their stuff. Cut tells the story of a group of Australian students who have heard about a slammer movie, Hot Blood, which has never been done because her director, Hilary (Kylie Minogue), was killed by the actor who played the psychotic killer in the film. Despite their lecturer (who was deputy director Hilary night died), warning that whenever someone tries to start producing Hot Blooded again someone dies, director Raffy (Jessica Napier) and producer Hester (Sarah Kants) decide to go ahead and finish the movie. They reunited a team and managed to get the original star, Vanessa Turnbill (Molly Ringwald), to return to Australia - in fact, in the original location - to complete Hot Blooded? 14 years after shooting shut down. Of course this is a movie of slasher, a lot of blood is born? long, with lots of laughter, some good scares and an Australian rock soundtrack. Cut shows that Australia can make a great horror movie on a large scale as well as Hollywood. It's a fine artistic feature, with great special effects, a plot full of charm and a killer - Scarman - hello plus to Michael, Jason and Freddy.
