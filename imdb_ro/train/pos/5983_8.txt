I saw the first movie as a teenager. It was at a time when hard metal led the world. Trick Or Treat has every element for a movie that you rock. With a distribution that includes Skippy from family ties, Gene Simmons of Kiss and Ozzy Osbourne as a preacher, how can you go wrong? Bad bad backs played on vinyl! Yes, that's right, they use records in this movie. In a scene, Eddie (Skippy) listens to a message from the evil rockstar on his player when things start to scare. The monsters start to get out of the speakers and its stereo becomes possessed. As a teenager I tried to play back my records hoping it would happen to me. Almost 20 years later, Trick Or Treat is still one of my favorite films.
