Very sweet pilot. The show returns to Tim Burton's best movies ... Edward Sissorhands, Big Fish, Charlie & The Chocolate Factory. Cinematography, narrative, music, external sets call Tim Burton. There has to be a strong connection or influence, I have not researched enough to know where it is. <br /> <br /> As we saw in the forums, yes, Anna Friel plays a poor man Zooey Deschanel. Every time I see her on the screen, I see Zooey. Do not get me wrong, Anna Friel does a wonderful job. Her character is very sweet and pleasant and you can easily attach. It's more of a distraction that I still think "why they did not get Zooey Deschanel." Lee Pace does a job too. I tried to remember where I met him and I just looked at him. Wonderfalls !!! Big and short life series since 2004. If you like the Great Pusars, you have to go Wonderfalls rent, which is another creation of Brian Fuller ????????? ********** ************************************************** ************************ (Little Shop of Horrors) again. Two undervalued character actresses who never manage to bring them with their performance.
