I've seen a lot of PPVs in the past, but this is the most fun, intense PPV and the most complete DVD I've ever seen. DVD extensions are worthwhile because they offer a different view of how fighters act after the show (such as the chris benoit interview / edge interview), some pictures in the mornings during the night war, Hogan's first match winning the title the gold label and some promotional talks. In addition, there is a good music video. <br /> <br /> 1. Team Label: Bubby Ray and Spike Dudley vs. Eddie Guerro and Chris benoit 7/10 This was a good match to start the show. There are not many owned and only pure physicality. Spike can keep his own matches in the tables and Guerro and Benoit have given good fighting skills to the mat. <br /> <br /> 2. WWE Crusierweight Championship: Jamie Noble w / Nidia v. Billy Kidman 3/10 The crowd did not care about the fighter and did not care until Kidman made a star release. Usually people expect a lot of flying in the sea in a cruise weight championship, but this has been very little. In fact, it was so bad that when Noble hit his finisher, no one even worried or knew (you can tell the lack of camera blinks). The end was quick though. <br /> <br /> 3. WWE European Championship: Jeff Hardy vs. William Regal 5/10 I never liked the royal as a fighter, he has no intensity and style. Hardy was impressive, but he really did not have the chance to show his high-flying act, though he still played some good counters and added that it needed a quick rhythm for the match. It ended quickly, which was perfect for this match. <br /> <br /> 4. John Cena v. Chris Jericho 6/10 It is strange that I look around Price's first PPV, as he was himself, how he used to dress and look his interview is quite funny). It was a good intentional Price game showing a beautiful variety of claws, braces, counters and some antennas. Jericho was sub-par but certainly helped Price to launch his career. The prize wins. <br /> <br /> 5. WWE Intercontenital Championship: RVD v. Brock Lesnar 8/10 This was a very intense and good match. Both wrestler styles really fit well on the screen, with Brocks' pure power and gross power vs. RVD moving fully in motion and speed. RVD showed great in this match (better than his subsequent matches with edge and price) and the whole match was fast. The end worked perfectly for keeping Brock's unbeatable series, while giving RVD its desserts only in its original state. <br /> <br /> 6. No Disqualification Match: Booker T v. Big Show 7/10 Another solid match that did not have a certain intensity as the RVD, but it's still a good tracking. Although it started quite slowly (which is always a great show), Booker T was impressive and made a sick motion on the reporters table. The finisher was awesome, the conclusion was a great shattering and a great move for Booker T. <br /> <br /> 7. WWE Tag Team Championship: Hogan and Edge vs. Christian Storm and Lance 5/10 This was a mediocre match. Hogan comes out as usual in a huge pop, but the variety of movements does not have that intensity and energy. Again, the Christian does not himself have the greatest athletic skills. This was at best a mediocre match, but he was still fine for the PPV. <br /> <br /> 8. Triple Threat Match for Uncontested Championship: 10/10. Rock v. Undertaker v. Kurt Angle. Easily match the year. This is by far the best triple threat I've ever seen. It had a fall, a lot of finishers, stolen finishes, brutal energy, intensity and fast pace. No one could predict who would get out of this. If you want to buy this DVD, I would buy it strictly. (at last, you look at yourself!) <br /> <br /> In general, this was a solid PPV with many extra goodies to keep you looking again and again. Although this is hard to find (I had to pay more than usual for this DVD), it certainly deserves the money.
