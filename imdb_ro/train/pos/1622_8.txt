I just saw this cartoon for the first time and I recognized the cartoons of various black artists ... Cab Calloway, Bessie Smith (not Josephine Baker or Sophie Tucker, White), Thomas "Fats" Waller, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson, Stepin Fetchit (despite the fact that) Louis Armstrong and the choir girls emerged from the famous "Cotton Club" in Harlem. True ... stereotypes are there, but it was ... and these cartoons were considered as adult entertainment at your local cinema before the main feature. The Harmann & Ising cartoons tended to be more "cute" and more luxurious (after all ... we speak of MGM) than the short animated standard made at Warners, Paramount, Universal, Fox, RKO or Colombia. Even Mickey Mouse at Disney had a lot of humor before Uncle Walt cleaned him up before going to "Technicolor." Disney had some cartoons with cartoons of black diverters as well ... for example, 1937's Silly Symphony "Woodland Cafe". But we must remember that these films are part of a certain time and place. 50 years from now ... Simpsons, Family Guy and South Park videos will also be examined, analyzed ... and even beaten by future viewers.
