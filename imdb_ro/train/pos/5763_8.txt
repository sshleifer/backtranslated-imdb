<br /> <br /> I have to admit I'm enjoying bad movies. I love them all. Great horror. My friends and all of us gather after a difficult week at school and work, rent some crazy tapes, we order a pizza and we are an explosion. One of the ones I received at the Hollywood Video was Zombie Bloodbath. It had a big box, so I expected less than usual. The story is about a home project that is built on a nuclear unit that has the surface above the bulldozed ground, and the other underground layers are simply covered. Residents in this neighborhood find the covered facility when some children enter a hole inside a cave. This arouses some zombies. From this starting point, it is a city chunk. The effects of gore and action never stop until the end-of-year loans roll. OK, it's not a great art, but this, with in-glum's dialogue and horrible top stuff, was our favorite evening. In fact, it was one of the best "party tapes" I've ever had the pleasure of looking at. And you could say it was done without money, with a bunch of crazy people. There are hundreds of zombies, and the director looks like Brendan Frazer (he has a cameo) and it's just a wild trip.
