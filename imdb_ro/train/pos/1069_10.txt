I bought Dark Angel's 1st and 2nd years ago two weeks after I got some episodes from season 1 on Channel 5. Nothing has prepared me for how brilliant the show is. I have not enjoyed so much from Firefly (also amazing show). I recognize Season 2, which is not as good, but there are still some amazing episodes (see Designate this, Bag 'Em, Berrisford Agenda, Harbor Lights, Freak Nation etc.) and Alec is great. I've heard some of the plans for season 3, and I have to say I can not believe it was canceled - I will not hurt it for you - but it would have been ruined! I also think it has great potential as a movie (though it seems very unlikely at this time). As evidence of my obsession, Max's barcode number is 332960073452, and in the two weeks I've had it, I'm 3 episodes away from being followed by both seasons twice. It's too good.
