Vincent Price's follow-up from HOUSE OF WAX (1953), the movie that cemented his reputation as a horror icon, revolves around bitterly? although inventive? showman. Although a remake, the first (shot in Technicolor) remains the upper effort; who said that, besides a certain comical relief, the mandatory reserves to make cheap gimmick (it was another 3D show) and occasional narrative deficiencies (no matter what happened to the missing bag that allegedly appeared at a a police station containing a cut head?), it offers more than enough Grand Guignol souls and a total value of the camp (the price depicts it in a variety of disguises as an inventor of illusions confessing "missing" monks who took advantage of his genius) to stand on his own two feet. Besides, the involvement of Brahm's director here does not prove a mere coincidence? because the narrative incorporates elements of two horror titles (both starring Laird Cregar) that he had previously, that is, THE LODGER (1944) and HANGOVER SQUARE (1945). The youngsters are weighed by Mary Murphy (as an ingenious assistant of the price) and by Patrick O'Neal (as her inquiring police detective, quite curious, he himself will take the lead in a similar play, CHAMBER OF HORRORS [1966] have acquired in time just to serve as an encore to it). An interesting aspect here is the adoption of a new fingerprinting technique, which is crucial in bringing Price's collapse (in a predictable but rather strange climate), although the persistent snooping of its amateur prosecutor, much to do with this in the long run! Looking at the star in a role to measure, does the movie give you a lot of fun? especially at a compact 73 minutes.
