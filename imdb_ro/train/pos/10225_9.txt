I laughed aloud all the idiotic comments for this movie, because it is obvious that those people who criticized the movie have never seen it or were stupid enough to pay it for it. <br /> <br /> The best reason to watch was Elvira's show a few years ago. Elvira delivered the film with as much laughter as possible. <br /> <br /> It's a good monster movie, compared to hundreds of terrible American blows. Better!!!!
