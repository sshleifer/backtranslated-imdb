I can not believe they got into the air. Especially when there are only a few episodes left. My daughter, my sister and some of my friends liked watching this show. I was so upset when they stopped doing this because of the so-called ratings. It is not fair to those who are watching this show from the beginning. We had the right to see the end. I would like to get a general vote from all people with a voting system 3 times a year. They could send documents by mail, and we, as spectators, could give a global vote about all the programs we watch or heard. This could also help to promote a new show. People would see and wonder what it is. Not only can you see what watchers view, but you could also use this as a free advertising tool for television and cable channels. We want to see the other episodes. Bring it back !!
