You have to start with Ed Furlong in this regard. Must. God bless this child. $ 5 says the character he's playing in this movie is what he really feels in real life. She has one or two, which made me suffer almost biting, because of the subtle humor of the script. You know all the attempts this guy has been through in recent years, and it does not seem that Furlong really works. Maybe that's why his performance was good. The same thing with Madsen. Keep thinking, "I bet this guy really is." Madsen really has to act? Just natural. Vosloo has clearly advanced from the Mummy guy. I think the biggest surprise for this film was Jordan Spiro's performance. Her reactions are in this film. I fought if it was hot or not, but I realized I wanted to see more of it. <br /> <br /> It's not a big fan of shoot out / hostage movies. But I'm a fan of movies with many twists and turns to try to keep your guesswork. It's not just your standard robbers who take over a bank, they kill the hostages, and the good boys win at the end of the movie. Towers continue to come ... and come. The cafe scenes work best with the help of handholds to show how it really is there. It's not glossy over a bit. Think of the Bourne Ultimatum style "lite" on some scenes in the cafe. And for those fanatics of Bo Bice there - actor Curtis Wayne (who plays Karl) will make you double. These guys are twins. As I looked, I was wondering why some actors had foreign accents and what they were doing in this little town. Finally, it made sense that these people smuggled with other countries / states, so they could have these accents. But more are revealed in the bonus features of how some of the producers wanted to make this film for the international audience with some of their stars that we probably would not have heard of. And some of them smoke hot. Moncia Dean? I have to say more.
