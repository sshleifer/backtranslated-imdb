First I would like to say how wonderful this is. It's staggering and sometimes shocking. And to say at least I am 11 years old and this is my favorite movie, it can certainly be a boring movie, but that's nothing but boring. It's like a journey through humanity. His firm realism shows through this monumental masterpiece. It's an inimaginal story of the two descendants (VOIGHT and Hoffman) who build a mutual friendship. Joe Buck (VOIGHT), a naive Texas student, comes to New York to make him rich in entertaining women. Soon he meets Rico "RATSO" Rizzo (HOFFMAN), a poor man who has barely been able to pay the rent. Ratso becomes Joe's manager, but soon both men can not find Joe a job that results in the stealing of food. As they try to survive on the streets of New York, we realize how hard it is. They can not make Joe a girl until they meet a lady at a party. Joe makes some money, and soon Joe takes Ratso to Ratso's dream place in Florida. The last five minutes are the heart breaking still some of the greatest moments in the film. From MIDNIGHT COWBOY we receive an urban and sometimes disturbing view of life.
