No one really understands the logic behind Italian zombie-numbering, but? honestly? why would we bother? Every movie in the Zombie series offers great fun, ugly gorilla and free shocks, and "Zombi 3" is no exception, despite all the production difficulties that occurred during the shooting. This movie started out as an interesting project Lucio Fulci, who had to further develop the success of "Zombi 2", but it has become a typical Bruno Mattei product with more defects and stolen ideas from previous films. The script is hopeless and ignores all the forms of continuity, every ingenious idea in George A. Romero's "The Night of the Dead" and "The Crazies" is repeatedly shamed here, and the acting performances are really miserable and painful. However, all of this has not bothered me for a moment, because the sublime gore of all overcompensates everything! On a secret military base at Phillipines, scientists have ended the bacterial warfare virus "Death One" and prepared it for transport. After an unsuccessful attempt to steal the virus, the infected body of a terrorist is incinerated, and the zombie ash contaminates the entire population of a nearby tourist village. The last group of survivors has to fight with powerful hyperactive and inhumane zombies as well as white-bloody soldiers who have been instructed to kill everything that moves in the contaminated area. This film is comparable to Umberto Lenzi's "Nightmare City". Really bad ... but incredibly fun with action sequences with fast rhythms and some very zombie-mad situations. Exquisite birds were original, for example, and the entire zombie birth sequence at the desert hospital was also quite cold. The infamous head-flight scene is not as terrible as it is done and is perfect in this pleasant and pleasant Italian zombie. Recommended for fans; do not disturb negative comments.
