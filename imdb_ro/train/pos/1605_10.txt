"Moonstruck" is one of the best movies ever. I have this movie on DVD! The film deals with a New York (Cher) widow who falls in love with his brother (Nicky Cage), angry brother (Danny Aiello), who works at a bakery. I'm glad Cher won an Oscar for that movie. Nicholas Cage and Danny Aiello are also wonderful. Direction from Norman Jewison (who directed "Fiddler On The Roof") is fantastic. "Moonstruck" is an excellent movie for everyone to see and laugh. You have to see! 10/10 stars!
