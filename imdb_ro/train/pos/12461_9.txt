A clever script from SEBASTIAN JAPRISOT and the intelligent performances from the two male prizes - ALAIN DELON and CHARLES BRONSON (or should be the other way around) result in an appealing and fun thriller. above the competent direction from veteran JEAN HERMAN and a low but effective score by FRANCOIS DE ROUBAIX, it becomes easy why this film has an undefined quality. alone, both disillusioned and tired of the world, probably coming back from Alger. Like the other colonial powers of this time (after the Second World War, which drove in the 1960s), France struggled to maintain appearances abroad. Algiers' loss was a bitter blow. ADIEU L'AMI (the original title) chronicles the actions of the two (anti) heroes as they strive to make a move after they are unloaded. /> <br /> One thing happens after another, and the spectator has to pay attention, because JAPRISOT is expensive and economical with his script: if there is, then there must be a reason. <br /> <br /> It is enough to say that these two people are physically and mentally fighting, a long weekend. Their motivation is quite different, their goals are different - their survival depends entirely on each other. This ALAIN DELON and CHARLES BRONSON are so different - the former, probably a cute boy, and the latter a nasty ugly, adds to chemistry. This trip makes for a wonderful story, which in turn makes for a great movie. To forget that there are women in this film, and according to the Japrisot method, they are also memorable, although they are not as well made; to say much more would be to ruin our delight in discovering their true nature. FAREWELL, THE FRIEND IS RELEASED IN THE UK; ANAMORPHIC IMAGE, 16.9 CONSOLIDATED; IN ENGLISH ONLY (not even subtitles for hard-hearing); A TIME OF 110 MINUTES; MONO SOUNDTRACK but music DE ROUBAIX has a lot of punch! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
