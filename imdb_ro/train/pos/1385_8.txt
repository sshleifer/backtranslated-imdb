I saw her at Cinema MK2 Hautefeuille just one evening after the first public projection in Paris. A very cute movie about three teenagers aged 15, all of them just at the same psychological stages. Many scenes have allowed us to return to the age of our adolescence and our first feelings about sexual intercourse. it is possible to imagine that the director would like to reduce girls' early sensual emotions to lesbianism, but even in this case it does not corrupt the probability of the story. You can find the movie sometimes slow, but it is what creates this intimate atmosphere. Fundez young talent actresses, a special mention with Floriane and Marie, very convincing. There are many small details, but this movie also allowed me to discover what the swimming is in sync: impressive!
