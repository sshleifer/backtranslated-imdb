I saw the film in Vienna a few years ago, where the audience liked it. I liked the performance at Summer Phoenix still haunting me, so I decided to write a comment. The story unfolds in London around 1900 when a Jewish girl decides to become an actress. She is desperately trying to become one, but it is not before a man treats her badly on stage, has talent and connects with the audience and is a stronger human being. There were some reviews, her performance was destroyed, she accused her of being boring, failed to bring her life to the character. I think it's her strong point, exactly what Esther Kahn and Phoenix are supposed to do is a courageous decision to make Esther a pretty dull girl. So its transformation at the end is stronger than it could have been otherwise. <br /> <br /> The cinema is wonderful, the images of London around the twentieth century are very dark and sad, you can see how unpleasant the life of that time. <br /> <br /> The only mistake in my opinion is the length of the movie, you lose contact with the characters, after all it's just finding the actor in you, so there are no dramatic actions in the movie. I think it's Phoenix that we do not lose interest in the film after the first hour.
