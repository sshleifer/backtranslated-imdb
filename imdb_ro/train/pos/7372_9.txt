"This is not a song of love" is a brilliant example of the Chase genre, which many people think has a fundamental meaning. The love of the two main characters can be more than fraternal. I think Heaton is in love with Spike, but Spike is too naive to see that. I really feel that this is portrayed with scenes such as burst sequences and letter writing. Heaton shows great intimacy with Spike. With intense expressions of his face and giving him a lot of attention by writing Spike's name at the top of his letters. One thing I noticed when I look at external reviews is that when the movie was scheduled, the reviewer seems to have not fully understood the movie because they did not even mention the possibility that Heaton would have sexual feelings for Spike . I also have the feeling that some commentators did not recognize him when they use expressions such as "Who is Heaton? What does he do with a retarder like Spike?" This person, however, struck the toenails with their remark. Spike shows visible signs of having A.D.D although I do not think that person did this because it seems to use the word "retard" as a derogatory term. I really enjoyed this movie. Although it is not for the weak heart. The film relies heavily on character, after filming to the end there is only a dialogue between the two anti-heroes. If you are not accustomed to watching such deep movies, stones, stay away.
