At first viewing this movie, it's hard to know what happened, but a later view becomes clearer. I liked this movie. Dean Cain was great in the role of Bob. The character of Lexa Doig was confused to understand that at first he was about to catch Bob, but I really think he came to love him even though he broke his heart. Dean Cain's performance was usually excellent. He gets better with every movie he makes. My only question at the end of the movie was what happened to Bob, Camilla and the baby. He left the viewer to decide
