A second axle stretch that manages to be as good as the first. <br /> <br /> Once again, pouring is just great. I like how the first and second episodes have nothing in common except for intelligence and intelligence. The second episode is very funny, very stupid and very pleasant. It's the first Christmas episode, about a woman who is tormented by a serial killer dressed as Santa Claus after she murdered her own husband. Like the first episode; karma. The most humorous scene is a connection between her husband's killing and her phone call, first falsifying her fear until it becomes real.
