Melvyn Douglas once again offers a polished performance in which, this time, he lives as a detective who can not place his love before duty and adventure and the beautiful Joan Blondell (who, far from being illiterate, writing a novel about her early life) is as pleasant as ever that her boyfriend ever suffers. It's almost a screw comedy, almost a thin film, almost a series, I think it did not succeed. It does not reach the classic level, but it has all the ingredients for an 85-minute fun with an episodic but passionate scenario, beautiful character actors and direction that keeps everything moving fast enough not to notice that Williams (Douglas) does not it's exactly Columbo when it comes to detection. I would have liked to have more movies like this.
