A commentator notes that it does not seem to matter what Welles actually says or does, it moves you. I agree. He was and remains a unique force in the film. More than a triple threat, who could act, write and direct, had a unique genius adapted to the film. One can consider whether at a time earlier he would have been a painter. This movie definitely strengthens that impression. A musician, a theater actor, a heir to Shakespeare? hard to say, but I'm very grateful that his time with the film and he captured the film. I like the accent. I like the face, the size, the style, the mind and the games. I like all the movies and want to be more. I especially like other actors interacting with him in the movie. Many have never been better or at least different from him because he was firm there. Even by the end of the year when his beauty was destroyed, perhaps from his own intent, he was impossible to ignore and made all the scene in which he was. Rita was a gorgeous blonde - Lana Turner looks the same, but maybe even more beautiful, and even then the eye goes to Welles and another minute, another movie, another hour in his company. That is why we all want to get to the lost remnants of his films, because we all know that it is not part of him that is not worthy of our time. Look and be grateful for this chance.
