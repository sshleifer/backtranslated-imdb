This is another film that is said to be Madhur Bhandarkar. I'm not sure why she has this obsession to show the child's and G * y's concepts to the Indian cinema audience, but I find some of these really disgusting scenes! What's new? It's a pretty piece together with Bhandarkar, where she presents the story of an entertainment reporter played by a leading lady in the famous film, Mr. and Mrs. Iyer. What makes this movie different is that it also covers the stories of people with whom this reporter interacts or is friend with, such as her homes, colleagues, film stars, models, rich people, and others on the entertainment page no. her newspaper. <br /> <br /> Notice: It's another good performance from Mrs. Iyer. It is likely to be observed for this role. It does selective roles, but it shines in them. She is considerably de-glamorized and less beautiful in this film. But then, entertainment reporters should not master the people they cover, do they? Verdict: Madhur came up with another good movie, which brings social problems to the very nice spotlight. However, this film is losing attention and one is not sure what the director is trying to say. Are they trying to show us the shine and brightness of rich people? or is it trying to show us the life of an entertainment reporter and that contrasts with the life of REAL criminal reporter? Are they trying to tell us how the government and the rich lead the press? or attempt to illustrate problems related to child abuse and the gy population. The other concepts he has brought include the unwritten rule that young women have to sleep with directors or co-stars if they want to get into Bollywood. In addition, he talks about how flight assistants get sick and tired of their jobs after a while, and resort to extreme measures by marrying many elders, etc. He also talks about unfortunate women and children kidnapped in wealthy families. be too complex for a movie that just wants to relieve some stress during the day
