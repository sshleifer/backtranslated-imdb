Except for an uncomfortable scene, this fantasy rejuvenating tale has a subtle, exciting and delightful adult cynical intelligence that shines in the audience as well as a soundtrack that vigorously moves this fairy-tale epic along. Except for one of Robert DeNiro's scenes that does not fit smoothly and does not seem to sync with the tone of the rest of the movie, this funny romantic queue has an extraordinary sense of storyline and strong magic and perfect balance between serious adventure and Spiritual humor is easier made. In the updated tradition of PRINCESS BRIDE, this contemporary presentation of magic and love is exciting. Eight of the ten stars.
