Okay, so it comes a few weeks ago, but he's here. Most of the time, this is due to the assertions of various negative natures. Starting with technology. When Star Trek: TOS ran away, the technology with special effect was extremely low, and more than that, the crew had little money to make any appropriate mock-ups. In the 35 years since the launch of TOS, the Star Trek crew became experts in the economy. Eventually, they have rightly decided in my mind to abandon the look of TOS and the inverted engineer TNG et all. So, if they decided not to make the gold conveyor or make the Phase Guns look closer to Star Trek II? Regarding the nits chosen for the first contact with the Klingon Empire, it is assumed that, based on observations made by Kirk and Riker, the Earth only met the Klingons in 2200. Nothing has been firmly established. The Enterprise gives us the most promising place of exploration we've seen for a while. That was what Voyager COULD was. No series can evolve without a few inconsistencies, but be grateful that Star Trek has so few. So, give up the grip and enjoy.
