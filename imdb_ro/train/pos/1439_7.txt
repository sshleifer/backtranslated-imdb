CITY HALL is a somewhat mixed bag. Political life in New York and a moralizing story. Al Pacino, a Dukakis-esque Chief with presidential dreams, often offers demeaning or under-performing performance. There are several times when it chews the landscape, and in the case of CITY HALL, here it shines. John Cusack offers poor and generally flawless performance without going into the cartoon of a New Orleans dialect or slipping into melodrama during filming. Danny Aiello, as political chief, is also very good. I also like showtunes. The major issue with CITY HALL, and is a good movie in many ways, is the general feeling of impulse. It comes more like a documentary than a movie. We see the action or follow the story from a detached perspective and, of course, the viewer does not get involved. When the spectator does not get involved to a certain extent, they become apathetic to the characters and ultimately to the plot. It tends to be alienated and what should have been a riveting riveting detail, came like a "Hmmm ... uh ... well." They say, "You can not fight the town hall," as the clich√© goes on the hip. However, I still can not prevent you from thinking about what it could have done if it was just the scenario and rhythm of this movie.
