I saw this movie when it first came out. It was an official selection for the Temecula Valley International Film Festival and voted for the best picture. Justine Priestley is hot as Amanda, psychotic but complex. This is not your regular movie. A lot of interesting and original shocks about gender. A sort of "fatal attraction" for a younger set of blues, mixed with Amanda's affection, is married to a blues singer who has less time for her husband as her career decolorizes. <br /> <br />
