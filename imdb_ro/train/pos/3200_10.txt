This is a great series of Canadian comedy. The film tells how stars Jean Paul Tremblay (Julian) and the main writer of the show and his friends Rickie and Bubbles interpret it on top of the true satirical aspect of life at trailer parks and the inhabitants of these halls. The film will tell you why Rickie and Julian are starting to make their more advanced forces in the world of crime. Why the motives behind everyone would be a spoiler, so I will not give the real reasons behind their brightest escapades. Their boyfriend and partner often (Bubbles) is a brilliant character. The whole show is brilliant and missing, the movie will not affect how you will see sit-com a bit. It's a comedy with a C capital and a brilliant satire in the caravan park that lives and a small crook with little time ideas but great dreams. If you ever have the opportunity to watch - buy - steal this program grab it. You will be glad you did. And my American friends ... It will also break you. 10 of 9. Brilliant. TV how the TV should be.
