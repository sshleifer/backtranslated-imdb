This is the second Baby Burlesk short to be released and probably the most popular, is a spoof of the silent film of 1926 What a glory of price. I looked at this and did not understand the porn child that was claimed. It's just a nice movie. I saw family shows I grew up when I watched in the '80s and' 90s, with little girls dressed more challenging acting in a "mature manner". It was more challenging because I am NOT CLOTHING in diapers. There is nothing provocative about a diaper if you do not have one of these fetishes. (just a joke) I read that description of the movie and where she says that only a pedophile would like to look at it. They were. For me, if you are following this and you are disturbed by it, then maybe you have to look into your own psychic and try to figure out what bothers you. It's an innocent movie that has been made as a parody of another movie. All B.B. were parodies, nothing more. Today's parodies / spoofs are graphic in nature and have true almost pornographic scenes and quite vile language. Should not these be more dreadful? I can watch the troublemakers, but sometimes I take the children's stories and turn them into dirt in those parodies. It should be under your skin. Not that they made a movie for adults (since 1926), because we know how these silent movies were, right? Not to mention the pre-encoded Hollywood pre-encoded movie, so evil and dirty. Would NEVER do such dirt today? (observe sarcasm)
