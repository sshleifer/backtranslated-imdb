D.W. Griffith could have made any film he wanted after the enormous financial success of "the birth of a nation"; he chose to make the most technically ambitious film by that time, "Intolerance." He took a risk with such innovations in assembly and film form, and the well-known financial train train resulted. Buster Keaton does not have such a risk with "Three Years," a parody of "Intolerance." This is Keaton's first feature film (he acted only in "The Saphead"). She had a backup plan to divide the three episodes of this film into three shorts, which Griffith did with "Intolerance." Keaton did not have to. Chaplin has already done with long comedies, so if Keaton risked here, he was fully computed. Chaplin had already made a parody of another film, "Burlesque on Carmen" (1915). Keaton seems to allude to that movie as well. The battle scene of the Ancient Rome episode refers to the fight of the sword that turns into a fight in Chaplin's film. Comic distance to the chart of the two scenes is the same. Moreover, Chaplin's film mimicked the shiny style of DeMille's "Carmen", and Chaplin's film seemed a tribute to that film. Keaton does not try radical editing, narrative structure or monumental nature in his parody, but he still seems respectful of "Intolerance." At least, stories are not quite as simple as other post-'Intolerance 'films such as Dreyer's "Leaves of the Book of Satan" (1931) and Fritz Lang's "Destiny" (Der MÃ¼de Tod 1921). There is a slight jump back and forth between episodes. If Keaton took risks, however, he is in his bold physical comedy. This is Keaton's unintentionally failed to skip the buildings in the modern episode. Apparently he was convinced to change the scene instead of trying again the jump. And, not only Keaton was risky; the anachron baseball gang, for example, was quite dangerous. Thus, though, in a different way, Keaton, like Griffith, takes risks with his big film. And I think they both succeeded.
