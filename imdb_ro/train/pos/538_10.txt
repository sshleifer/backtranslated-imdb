Go back to the cabin near the Lake is probably one of the few sequences that can live up to the original. He had a Black Humor, a Good Suspension, a Beautiful Girl, and, of course, a psycho killer. What's missing? I do not believe anything. Unless we were left with a small amount of gore and nudity because it was made for television. Besides being one of the best sequels, it's one of the best thrillers to see as a family. Recommended for everyone.
