I almost did not see this movie because I remember that the penguin march was not so exciting. I went mainly because Disney promised to plant a tree if I went to see him on the opening weekend, but after seeing it, it was simply amazing; the fact that photos can capture impossible images are simply worth your money. You can also see different habitats, vegetation, animals and different natural phenomena that will not only shock you - simply because you would never expect nature to be so magical and dynamic - but also to you touch the souls and raise the issue of humanity to the world, how our lives have deviated from nature to such an extent that we take into consideration the natural beauty and miracles that are essential to our biosphere. You do not have to be a lover of the earth or an environmentalist environment that lures the trees to appreciate the wonderful wonder of this documentary. You just have to be a curious soul that questions the value and the miracle of life. Enjoy!
