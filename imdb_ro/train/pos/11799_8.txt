A summary of a real event! Well, actually, I was not there, but I think that's how it was. I think there are two typical American stances in the film: "communistophobia" and parallel to Adolf Hitler. These should be obvious to most independent observers. However, Boothe has a great performance, as are many other well-known actors. The last twenty minutes of the movie are unbearable - and I mean! Anyone who can sleep well after them is abnormal. (That's why it's so terrible - it all happened and probably looks like that). But, actually, the last scene on the air station really took place?
