Neil Simon has a lot of things, but it's the strange couple that brought him to fame. This movie really works. Jack Lemmon & Walter Matthaw have a great chemistry. Support for this film is also stellar. <br /> <br /> It's about two people who live together who are from opposite planets. Scripture swells with humor in this situation. This has been done in some previous forms. This is the one that brings them together in a very good package. Simon did some decent work, but this is indeed his best work that made possible the rest of his work. It's hard to imagine that Simon overlaps.
