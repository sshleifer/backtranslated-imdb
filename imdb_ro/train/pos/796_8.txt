Thomas Capano was not the head of Anne Marie Tom Carper, the governor. This is why the federations got involved, called Clinton and asked him to make the federal officials involved in this case. I lived outside of Philadelphia at the time, so the case was news on the front page every day. I also read the Ann Rule book and saw the "City Confidence" segment on A & E. Tom Capano was a megalomanic (sp.), A Uber controller and a monster. He claimed to love Ann Marie, but all he wanted was someone he could control. When he did not let him do that, he killed her, the final form of control. I think it's a waste of money that he's still alive.
