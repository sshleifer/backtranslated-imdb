I have seen almost all the Gundam / Mech anime that appeared in the US and this has by far the best story. The way his plot twists and turns. Gundam Wing is a series that focuses mainly on politics and war. The series follows a group of five 15-year-old boys who have been trained to pilot the stage of mobile costumes known as Gundams. Gundam pilots have been trained to fight a strong insurgency known as Oz. As things begin to warm up between the OZ and the Gundam pilots, new political groups will form and the old ones will disappear. Old conflicts will end and new ones will appear. To achieve peace, Gundam pilots have to deal with the events that take place in their world and end all the fighting. But how far people are willing to reach their goal. I recommend this anime to anyone looking for a show that has a profound plot.
