Dumbland is not forever. In fact, maybe Dumbland is not for anyone except Lynch, and that's what makes him funny and a collective drawing. Violent? Yes. Blasphemy? Yes. Absurd? Yes. A piece of garbage? Not. Dumbland is a wonderful image of Americans who have no brains and hit the wife and children to have fun. From Mexico I can say I like it! My favorite episodes are: 1- My teeth bloody, all the noise around and the violence make me cry and put myself behind my bed. 2 - Take the stick! Yes, take your child and learn a lesson: some people are never grateful for your actions. 3- Antre. The more Lynch, music, surrealism and a very sweet revenge ...
