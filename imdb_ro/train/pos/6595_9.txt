I borrowed this film to a friend who did not know anything about it, and it turned out to be a remarkable documentary about traveling on an old ship on large stretches of ocean. Thor Heyerdahl has developed a theory that the ancient Incas of Peru managed to travel thousands of miles along the ocean to Polynesia, based on relics found in both places, certain types of ancient sea vessels that we know they had the analysis of oceanic and wind currents and the knowledge that the Incas had in fact made trips in undetermined quantities at sea. To test his hypothesis, Heyerdahl and his crew built a ship as close as possible to what the old men had at their disposal, using only balsa wood and other materials available at that time and out of Lima, the capital of Peru , to try to reach the islands of Polynesia, about 5000 kilometers away. His theory, as much as in ancient history, is impossible to prove with 100% certainty, but the cover of their journey offers strong support that he is right. The film is really a bit more than a narrative of the recordings made during the expedition over 100 days, but it is a very detailed description of what it was and of the trials and tribulations it faced. I often want Oscar winning documentaries to be easier to find, and this has been so exciting and informative for over 50 years now, as I'm sure it was when it was released for the first time.
