If your idea of ​​a thriller is car tracking, explosions and dozens of people who are clogged with gunfire, then "House of Games" is not the definitive movie for you. If you like and appreciate psychological drama and suspense, then, by all means, you see it. "House of Games" tells the story of a beloved psychologist and writer, Dr. Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse), who tries to help a patient and engages in the shadowy world of condemned Charlie Mike (Joe Mantegna). To say something more about the plot would ruin suspense. Frankly, I find it hard to believe anyone who says they saw the twists coming. Like an intelligent artist, this movie draws you on the web and boasts vigilance. The story is stretched and well-crafted, the intelligent and laconic dialogue that acts uniformly (Good Mantegna is superb charismatic). Some have complained that Dr. Ford is not a very sympathetic person and wondered why Mamet will make Lindsay Crouse look so physically unattractive. But Dr. Ford must be cold and far away; in addition, her homeliness is somehow essential to the plot (at one point, I think an injury to her sexual self-esteem is an essential part of her motivation ... I will not say). <br /> <br /> "The House of Gaming" is a dark look at the bottom of human nature which ends on a note of unpleasant ambiguity. It will keep you alert every second while you look and stay with you for a long time afterwards.
