In the hands of a more qualified director, this film would have been considered a horror masterpiece. In spite of Michael "Death Wish" winning the winning direction, the movie is exciting, original and more than a little frightening. The script has more than a horror clich√© on the back (many can not shake) including Chris Sarandon as the heroine's friend who actually listens to her, while she insists that horrible things go down. Burgess Meredith is delightful as almost crazy neighbor. Eva Gardner haunts a young Beverly D'Angelo as her lover who is faint and disturbed. John Carradine is doing a job in a chair. And watch out for a short cameo from an unknown Chris Walken on time! This movie is creepy and creative. Flipping the plot is wonderful, if it's easy to predict. The climax, about which I will not give details, is disturbing and quite impressive. Again, a better director could have done more with him, yet he is quite satisfying - at least for those with sad sensations of seventy. If you like the fantasy of modern torture, Not like that. There is almost no gore. The direction is quite spartan. The effects are few, although there is some pretty makeup near the end - most are not actually makeup ... but maybe I have already said too much. I've rated it a bit bigger than its quality can justify, but I liked it just as much as any "8" movie I've ever seen.
