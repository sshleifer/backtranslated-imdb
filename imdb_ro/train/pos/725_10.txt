Fascist Miss Togar (Mary Woronov, who is shot by the expert photographer Dean Cundy as though he is ten feet tall) has a plan to turn his tall square. There are complications that cause that objective in the rock'n'roll winner Riff Randell (PJ Soles who lightens the screen - also has a hot spot), who is an obsessive fan of punk THE RAMONES. Pal Kate Rambeau (Dey Young, whose large glasses and nerdy role can not hide his stunning beauty) joins forces with Riff to put an end to the alleged crises of killing rock'n'roll for good, which is the desired mission of Togar. /> <br /> Vincent Van Patten has a hilarious role as Tom Roberts, a success at all, but he has been put. Kate is crazy about Tom ... just that he could get his head out of the sand and see him. Clint Howard steals the film almost (honest, who can steal this film away from Soles?) Like Eaglebauer, the "provider" that can get almost everyone. His office is located in the boy's toilet! Paul Bartel is also hilarious as a music teacher who becomes a Riff ally when enjoying a concert of RAMONES. A high school highschool that defies all the rules of normality ... and I loved it. It's like someone just says, "Let's have fun for one and a half hours." The film is really the anarchy ... a chaos without plotting, wishing to love THE RAMONES with all the heart (even if they are horrible actors, have the opportunity to win new auditions with this movie). ending pretty much sums up the movie as a whole. Riff and his colleagues take high school and start a massive party. To be honest, I did not want the party to end! It is not conventional in any way, this film just to lose a frenzy. With a rock soundtrack showing some of the best songs THE RAMONES, this film allows a viewer to accept a moment in life when the war did not dominate the titles and the people had a good time. I think it was these days.
