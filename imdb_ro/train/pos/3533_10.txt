Unfortunately, it's not available on DVD yet, but it's worth watching on TCM or VHS. A secretary thinks her boss is wrongly accused of murdering and courageous many dangerous characters in an effort to establish the truth. A movie with many twists and turns, none of which I will never remember! The Jazz Sequence where our heroine is looking for information about the killer is one of the most erotic scenes in Hollywood's history, despite the fact that it was a very low budget and was made during the Second World War in white and black. Despite its low budget - Long Island seems somewhat mountainous - this is an original style film and an extraordinary vision. Ella Raines was a great actress discovered by Howard Hawks, who knew a lot about these things, casting the most frightened women - Joanne Dru, Hepburn, Angie Dickinson, Lauren Bacall, Ann Sheridan - of their time. Robert Siodmak was one of several German, Hungarian and Czech producers - Sirk, Wilder, Zinnemann, Lubitsch, Curtiz, Lang etc. - which emigrants have moved to Hollywood and brought with them a fresh vision. Unfortunately, Ella Raines has never got such a big role and eventually got into poorly produced vestiges.
