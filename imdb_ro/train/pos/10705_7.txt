The trailer for this movie did not make the movie justice. And while the movie did not know what it really wanted to do, the first half of the film was a light, romantic comedy, and the second one had a more serious, romantic drama, the overall impact was much better than I thought it would be. This movie was more of a dated film, but the trailer made it more than a suspense thriller, which never turned out to be. Kidman, being one of my favorites, of course being biased, but this movie turned out to be a light, sensitive film if something weird, which deserves better. Three out of four stars. 5.9.02.
