My 10/10 rating is just for the fun factor and assumes that you decided you liked "Slaughter High" just before watching it. Yes, it's the typical revenge story, a few years after a mess, but how can you not like some of the things I'm shooting here ?! I could not have predicted the bathtub scene in a million years. Okay, maybe we could be cynical and say that this movie does not offer anything new. Well, do not pretend. It's a kind of hit that the Scream characters probably watched and contributed to their rules on how to survive a horror movie. After all, who does not like to look at people suffering to do these things? Obviously, it has a kind of reactionary subtlety, because people punish themselves to do what they did in the 1960s. But still, you must like this stuff! So, with apologies to Don McLean, this lady did not sing for king and queen!
