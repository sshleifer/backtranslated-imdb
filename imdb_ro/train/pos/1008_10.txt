We have entered this excellent season 4 season and since then we have seen that all episodes have all episodes on DVD and are getting better with seasons 9 and 10. Now Richard Dean Anderson no longer has the addition of Ben Browder and Claudie Black's performance was more resilient and original even after 10 seasons. Unfortunately, the science fiction channel has escaped this spectacular show without reluctant hope for an 11-year season, making two direct DVD movies and hopefully more. Atlantis continues to be strong in the 4th season. And there is a third spin in the franchise factory Stargate is not nearly dead. This television show is something to be seen for all sci-fi fans and people of the genre because this has such a wide range of things that can appeal to all ages and all kinds of people Watch IT !!!!! 10/10
