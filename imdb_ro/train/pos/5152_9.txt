"Hitler, Raising Evil" is clearly produced by people who are not emotionally charged with the horrors of the Second World War. Which makes you experience a refreshing experience. I think the greatest value lies in the clear discovery of the Nazi mechanism. Of the highly corrupt ways, Hitler used to get to the top. After he got there, this movie is over. When on the top, "Fuhrer" (German for "leader") led Germany to the biggest and most devastating war in human history. The end of six years later in the total defeat of Germany. As a result, Germany lost its eastern provinces (= approximately 35% of its pre-war soil) and had to accept a 44-year division of its remaining territory. Both West Germany and East Germany had to be rebuilt from their remnants, their reputation severely affected by the many Nazi atrocities inspired by racism. As I said, "Hitler, raising the evil" makes a good watch. Established in an acceptable environment of thirty years, with more (competent) action. In particular, the role of Peter O'Toole in the role of elder President von Hindenburg is remarkable, even adding an extra dimension. My copy of "Hitler, the Ascension of Evil" also provides a second DVD with two good documentaries. One is about Hitler's personality, the second deals with the falsification of Hitler's newspapers. In 1983, this fake caused a hilarious scandal in England and Germany, damaging the reputation of many historians and journalists.
