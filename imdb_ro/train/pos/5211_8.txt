Since their unpleasant divorce from Disney Company (with Disney's trademark Miramax), Weinstein seems to specialize in the above films, which are under-promoted and seen by few. FLOCK is a prime example. A story about public servants who have the ugly task of keeping records of sex offenders registered, this picture will tell you more about sex criminals than a whole season of the Law and the Order - SVU. Richard Gere gives his best performances as a soft-spoken speech-consuming agent. Claire Danes has the opportunity to get involved in a solid role (instead of junk in which she normally blocks) and she does the most to play novice. Cinema, rhythm rhythm, editing, everything is the first rate --- and I have not seen any trace of attention-deficit-disorder room jump-around excess room or cut that others have complained about. The subject is treated with restraint, but it is still a rough subject and you may feel bad. 50 years ago, there was almost no problem with the types of sexual offenses listed here abundantly, which would even shock red. Then the Supreme Court's rulings were made, linking the hands of the police as the "rights" of the sexual perversions were opened and America became the buyer's paradise for sexual perversity, both desirable and unwanted. Every such step was praised by the Liberals who celebrated Warren Court's evil works with shiny covers on Time and Newsweek. The Liberals of every day also praised the Court's action and mocked those who disagreed. In 2007, how many Americans know that the genre of pornography that describes the violence and torture of young women - can be subscribed and its delivery is subsidized by the US post office. Only part of the problem - a problem that can disturb someone's family to pieces. Richard Gere is a liberal, but he gives the best performances here. Perhaps at the age of maturity he gained wisdom.
