This is a fantastic, outdated, ghostly story. I showed it to some of my friends in my movie club and they were kept scared to the end! Without blood or gorilla - just a good old-fashioned sigh. Start from the very beginning and build and build. The end is a real twist that caught me unconsciously. <br /> <br /> Well directed and well acting. It is also a "vintage piece" - established in the 1920s - that brought it into the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I was so impressed to have received Susan Hill's book from Amazon. The film follows the book quite carefully. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that it's not available on DVD. My copy is VHS. This along with "Haunted" are probably two of the best ghost stories we've ever had. What just goes to show that a little creativity goes beyond "in front of you" gore any day!
