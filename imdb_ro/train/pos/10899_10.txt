I laughed so hard during this movie that my face was bad. Ben Affleck was hilarious and reminded me of a cute boy Jack Black in this role. Gandolfini offers typical performance A. The whole cast is amusing, fairly good, and wonderful comic moments. I entered this film and did not expect too much, so I was so surprised to get out of the very pleased and facial excitement. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys comedy, can identify with loneliness during holidays and / or put together with relatives. The best part of this film (for me, anyway) was the subtle fragments of humor that surprised me completely and made me laugh long after the rest of the audience stopped. That is, the scene that involves illuminating the Christmas tree. Go see and laugh good!
