Almost the whole movie takes place in a public bathroom in China. There are no fantastic sets, explosions or charmed people - just a beautiful writing, action and direction (Hollywood, take note!). An estranged son returns home when he thinks his father dies. He is surprised to see that his father looks good and is in charge of family maintenance as usual. In fact, he notices that his father and his retarded brother have indeed falsified a close and worrying relationship, and it soon becomes evident that he is out of the loop! The father is very traditional and this son visited is from the big city and does not really see the value of the old bath. The way in which their relationships change and where the plot happens is extraordinary and credible. I was happy to see that not every Chinese movie is a picture of action (like Jet Li or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), because I'm not particularly interested in these frenetic films. The shower and the spring in a small town are two wonderful examples of Chinese movies about PEOPLE!
