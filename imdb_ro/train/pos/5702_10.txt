I did not expect Val Kilmer to make John Holmes convincing, but I woke up forgetting she was not a porn legend. In fact, the entire cast has turned into amazing performances in this highly underestimated movie. As mentioned earlier, look for the two-disc set and look first at the "Wadd" documentary; will give you a lot of backgrounds about the story, which will be helpful in appreciating the movie. <br /> <br /> Some people seem dissatisfied with the fact that the video at the LAPD crime scene is included on DVD. There are a number of reasons that could have been included, one of which is that John Holmes's murder trial was the first ever to have occurred in the United States where such materials were used by the prosecutor's office. If you do not want to see this, it's easy to avoid; is clearly identified as "LAPD Crime Scene Footage" on the menu!
