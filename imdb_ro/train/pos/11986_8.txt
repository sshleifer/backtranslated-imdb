I looked at "Speak easily" one evening and I thought it was o.k. but something is missing. Perhaps Buster Keaton, strangely, threw me out, or the emergency delivery of a leading lady. The next day I still thought about the movie, though. I could not pull out Durante's song, tried to recall the first scene of Thelma Todd, I thought maybe Keaton made some fun and physical comedy. The following night, I watched a scene with Thelma Todd as a choir girl trying to impress Buster and Jimmy with her sexual appeal. A very funny scene, the excellent actors, their faces, their eyes, their stupid expressions. I watched another scene, their show opens on Broadway. Buster in his happy innocence spoils each act. Again, I laughed loudly, appreciating Keaton's clown and clattering. So, the next night, I watched the whole movie again and this time I see it for the first time: it's full of power! It's sensational! It is sublime! Three great comedians! Todd is dancing! Durante sings! Keaton speaks! Sure it's not poifect ... but there's a lot of laugh in this picture.
