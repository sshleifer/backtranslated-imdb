Without "mental anachronism," this movie I'd like to find on DVD offers tremendous diving in the vital and mental context of people's thinking before "world disappointment." That's thirty years, a director and a scriptwriter could test such empathy and such a romantic truth to make it out of the masterpiece leaves them astonishing. It would be necessary to see and review it for a better capture than the cultural and temporal distance to lose the ability to be included / understood, analyzed and ultimately accepted by such an example of "primitive thinking" Because this thought that keeps almost impossible to feel in the secular world still contains some keys to our behavior that only future generations will be able to analyze with sufficient relevance.If someone knows where to get a numerical copy or VHS for me or DVD? Thanks in advance.
