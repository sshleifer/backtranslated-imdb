Why is this movie not the best of 250? This film still looks amazingly fresh at 56 years from production, but it could only be done after W.W.II due to the perception of the approaching death. People were more aware that life could be stopped at an unexpected moment. And what about life? I liked the scene at the end of the judgment, and all the people of all nations gathered. (Roger Livesey), who defends Peter Carter (David Niven) and June (Kim Hunter) against US prosecutor Abraham Farlan (Raymond Massey I - an American) . Everything is so imaginative! Michael Powell wrote, directed and produced this amazing film, which is a true "power-fly". The message of the film is clear: in the universe the law is the most important, but nothing on the earth exceeds the love of people. The way this beautiful story is told is much more interesting than any Hollywood movie could ever do.
