Sentinel hoped to be a good movie and a boy was right. A wonderful story, first of all, from a novel, and I thought this was an original story, but I guess it was not a very smart story. Michael Douglas in this movie is very good and Keither Sutherland is also, but still it's very hard to get rid of Jack Bauer's role in 24 years, but eventually you are very different in The Sentinel than in 24. also another person trying to get rid of TV roles but failed. Eva Longeria. He was not that good in the movie and he had a place behind in the whole thing. After seeing the movie, I had constant dreams about The Sentinel and not sleep. Overal Sentinel is a good movie and I would recommend it.
