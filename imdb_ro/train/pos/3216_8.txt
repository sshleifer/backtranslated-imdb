The stoic and laconic soldier, Sergeant Todd (a fine and credible interpretation by Kurt Russell), gets put on a distant planet after being overtaken by ruthless and arrogant Colonel Mekum (played with joy by Jason Isaacs) Todd and colleagues they were replaced by a new advanced race of genetic combatants. Todd joins a peaceful community, which is in a community of self-dependent addicts, and must defend this community when new soldiers arrive for an exercise on the ground. Director Paul W.S. Anderson, working from a smart and challenging scenario by David Webb Peoples, describes a cold, dark and rough vision, maintaining a charming rhythm and a tough and tough tone. In addition, Anderson takes good care of moments of humanity's movement (Todd's struggle to come into contact with his previously repressed feelings is really painful), and he shows the action scenes that are agitated with the kidnapping taste. Russell offers a powerful and impressive portrait of Todd's pantomime; he transmits a lot of emotions without much telling and instead makes most of his action through body movements and facial expressions. Bang-up supporting the turns of Jason Scott Lee as brutal rival soldier Caine 607, Connie Nielson as compassionate Sandra, Sean Pertwee as Mace, Jared and Taylor Thorne, as a mute boy, Nathan, Gary Busey as a veteran-led captain, Michael Chiklis as johnny Johnny Pig and Brenda Wehle as the sensitive Hawkins mayor. Better, this film makes a profound and significant statement about the spiritual cost of a ruthless soldier and the importance of intellectual power over physical power. David Tattersall's film, Joel McNeely's orchestral scores, and the remarkable effects of primordial rhythm, all further enhance the sterling quality of this hybrid science-fiction / higher action.
