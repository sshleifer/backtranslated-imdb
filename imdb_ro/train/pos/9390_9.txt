This movie kicked me off Nick Cage. It's a story full of overturnings and transformations - a movie of motives and movements. Of course, Dennis Hopper was a ham, but J.T. Walsh and Laura Flyyn Boyle are the perfect pair to catch the man who has not fallen on the internet. Everything about this movie is good - cinema, rhythm stories and, moreover, the end. Cage excels on what he does best - not being a hero of action but being a man trapped in the traps of life.
