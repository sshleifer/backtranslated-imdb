I have not read other reviews about the film, but judging from the point of view of the average rating, I can see that it is unlikely to be very complementary. I saw her for the second time with my children. They loved him absolutely. True, he did not have the adults to rotate around the floor, but the sound of the joy of the children made it look like that. It's a real Mel Brooks farce, with a lot of moral content - how tricky it is to be loved for our money, not for who we are, and how nasty our friends and associates are. There are many other films on a similar subject, no doubt many of them have a greater, comic or emotional impact on adults. I find it difficult to imagine such an impact on the junior members of the family. <br /> <br /> Therefore, for kids, a 9/10 from me.
