Commitment, riot story of the captured American army, who must prove his innocence to avoid the aggressor. Paul Ryker estimates a friendly fire in an apparently condemned attempt to convince a military court that he was actually an American spy on a secret mission in Korea. In the classical curtains of the court, "Sergeant Ryker" is an extremely well designed mystery guided by an impressive turn, the director of Kulik, a constant impulse and effective twists. This film was originally made as a television film in 1964 and later this enrichment was enriched with the presence of many "name" actors and action sequences. Dillman, resuming his role, is on the spot as a questionable defense attorney, whose attention sometimes reflects on the personal situation of Ryker's supportive, yet distant, wife, played with the aptitude of Vera Miles. Beyond the first line is Peter Graves for the prosecution and Norman Fell and Murray Hamilton in key supporting roles. Marvin's interpretation of Paul Ryker's character is a balanced representation of a simple but dedicated man, the backward behavior is challenged by the desperate circumstances in which he was placed. Marvin moves perfectly from resigned indifference to passion for determination, offering convincing, often intense performance, which is the culmination of this drama, otherwise on a small scale. It's a performance that should put the film on a platform where it occupies a place on the best dramas lists in the meeting room. However, despite its apparent obscurity, "Sergent Ryker" still remains a convincing examination, like a book that you can not get down to. Highly recommended.
