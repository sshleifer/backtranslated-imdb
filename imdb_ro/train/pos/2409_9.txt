This film has problems in its presentation, it may even be offensive to people seeking temporal and cultural faith, but it causes the observer to reflect on a variety of issues. One of these is the nature and character of the relationship between Jesus and Judas. Another is that of the historical nature of the Bible and of faith. And thirdly, it is the humanity of Jesus. The tension of Christ-traitor's connection is developed and sustained through the film. Judas' passion is presented as a darker parallel to that of Christ. When Judas takes his own life, the viewer can feel anger. Petru's party and guilt, no matter how moving, are not so strongly represented as the Judas drama. Chris Sarandon offers a new and provocative Christ, whether credible or not. I would like to find this movie on DVD or even VHS to be used in study or discussion groups.
