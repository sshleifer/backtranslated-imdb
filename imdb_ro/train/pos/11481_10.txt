High school friends Andre Kriegman and Cal Gabriel declare war on their colleagues and plan a terrible attack on their high school. As the countdown begins, until the last act of revenge, the two begin a video log to explain their feelings and chronicle their mission. There is another similar movie called "Elephant". Why do I get this? To compare the two films, of course. I have to say that although I liked "Elephant," this is a much better film. What's the difference, you ask? Well, for the start, this is shot differently, much in line with "Cloverfield", "Blair Witch Project" and "The Journal of the Dead". This makes the movie the better because it is more painfully realistic. But what earned me was how the film was willing to show "the other side of the story". You know these two shots, unlike the Elephant. One of the drivers really took care of me and I could understand their actions and why they did what they did. This movie makes you feel sympathetic to these people and that's a good thing because it's not always black and white. To be honest, that's why I almost cried out in this movie. Characters are real human beings with logic and motives behind their actions. You have to understand them. They do not mean they want to kill people for attention. Overall, this movie is emotionally and very haunting and much better than "Elephant".
