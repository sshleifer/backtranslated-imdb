Made by the French brothers Jules and Giddeon Naudet and narrated by Robert De Niro and Firefighter James Hanlon, this is a fascinating and heart-breaking story about how the glow of New York shone in its darkest day. I saw her for the first time when I was a naive young man, 12 years old, and at that age he still touched me. Knowing how serious 9/11 really was, this has widened the effect of September 11. I have discovered who the heroes are, how the daily lives were composed, and how they put their lives on the line in a situation where most people just run away and save themselves. These courageous men have put their lives on the line, and looking at me, this adds up their admiration for them. Take care if you can, this is the best documentary I've seen personally.
