This gaming show lasted only one season, but it was intriguing for audiences because it required visual skills and a steady hand. A false move would disqualify the competition from winning the prize, although it was clear that the competitor knew the correct answer. It was always interesting when the competitor began to draw, wondering if he would finish his drawing or be cursed; allowing the other competitor to easily win the contest. It was a light-hearted show, but it was clear that competitors were often embarrassed by a stupid mistake made unintentionally. Rarely seen, the show did not survive after a single season. Only a game-dependent addict remembers this show because it turned out to be quite unpopular, even if the game shows had a big rebound on the TV screen after the 1950 scandals show the game. But it was a unique concept for a game show and one that has never been seen before.
