I watched this movie after I saw it on Broadway. I like Broadway music and I like the movie. I watched the movie as if it had nothing to do with the Broadway show. I am a passionate reader and I have seen what happens to most books when they are turned into movies, so I developed a really early philosophy. Let's assume the movie will be based on the book (or musical in this case), but that while the story line may be similar, it will not be the same, it will be different, so watch it for what it is. > <br /> We danced for 12 years before making a choice. I was a good dancer (bringing the choir into local productions as a kid etc.), but I was not really talented. But I was super talented as a travel pilot. I was told by my dance instructor and my coach (who spent several months a year at the state farm) that I have to make a choice when I am 14 years old. I had to move from dance two hours four to five days a week and riding 3 hours a day 7 days a week .. and dedicate one or the other. So I love cute dance and I like this movie and many other ballet and dance films. I chose to watch this movie for what it is, is a great movie about raw emotion and human interaction. It's the power of anticipation and mood disorder when you really work hard to get something you want and you just do not understand it. I like the movie. I love Broadway music.
