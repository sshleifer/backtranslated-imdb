Ignore the plot and enjoy Fred Astaire making a Day Foggy and some other dances, a duo with an unfortunate Joan Fontaine. Here we see that Astaire makes what are essentially "stage" dances in a cleaner form than in his films with Ginger Rogers and before learning how to make the most of the film's potential. The best thing is that we see Burns and Allen before their husband / wife television career making the kind of dance they must have done in vudeville and did not have the chance to do it in the movies their college Paramount from the 1930s. (George was once a dance instructor). The two numbers with Fred are highlights of the film and it's worthwhile. The first trio of soft shoes is a warm-up for the "Chin up" carnival, in which the three sing and dance through rides and other attractions. Almost seems spontaneous. Fan of Fred Astaire and Burns & Allen will find him worth a "plot". I've seen this 4 or 5 times and I find the button fast forward.
