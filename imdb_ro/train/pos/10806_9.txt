I felt this movie - all the way. I was impressed by Russell Crowe's talent in developing his relationship with Lillie, a typical Aussie blend that was slowly and slowly approaching, a little depreciable, and very persistent. I really enjoyed the cinema and the direction. Peace was fair and the portraits of almost all the characters were impressive. God, Russell's talent has not stayed in 1993! .. and I have not seen Gladiator yet.
