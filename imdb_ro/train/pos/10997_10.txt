WOW. One of the biggest movies I've ever seen. You absolutely loved it! Before the credits started, I was stuck on the screen. It's a sci-fi thriller - and the edge of your Whodunnit chair. Incredible. I wish it never ended. Lucy Liu is a throwing role. Whoever could play it. The main actor, Jeremy Northram, was the perfect guy. <br /> <br /> This movie appeals to me who loved the Games of War, Sneakers and Track Down. <br /> <br /> Incredible! <br /> <br /> 8-22-06.
