I have seen this movie several times, and every time I look at it, I can only help them. Gunga Din is one of the classic films made in Hollywood's golden years, when the actors themselves had to attract audiences into a movie without relying on fantastic special effects and "monsters" made by man to take a stage. The charisma on screen and the show shown by Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. are suber and very fun to watch. The attitude of the tongue and the cheek in which the three actors play their roles works nicely and flawlessly. Some might think it is "corny," but I think it's "classic" shooting and acting at its best. Someone has to remember when watching this film that Europe was involved in a war with Germany, and the public went to films to get rid of the horrors of the war and to be distracted and taken to a place where people were bigger than life and doing heroic deeds, it would always be to conquer evil. Gunga Of accomplishes this perfectly, allowing the public to laugh at and with the actors during their cumbersome escapades. In short, it's a classic movie that does not take too seriously and does not want the audience.
