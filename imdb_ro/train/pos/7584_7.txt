This PM Entertainment production is filled with enough bullets to make John Woo say, "Enough already!" Of course, it's not as beautiful as Woo can deliver, but it becomes workable job done in 90 minutes. Eric Phillips (Don Wilson) is an undercover cop in the near future. When his wife is framed for killing the governor of a team using a similar cyborg, Eric needs to clarify his name. Wilson gets to get Van Damme's job as he plays his heroic role and his bad robot. Why the Academy did not take note is beyond me. Being a PM production, there are tons of tracking machines, machines that explode (4 in the first 5 minutes!) And pull out. I really liked the wagon that was spinning in the air before it even approached an explosive truck. My other favorite involved a girl in the neighborhood who came to refine his karate in Don's simulator. It's just a chance to highlight some cheap effects from LAWNMOWER MAN around 1995.
