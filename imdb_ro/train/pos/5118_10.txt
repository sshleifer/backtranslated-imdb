******** Spoilers - Careful ********* <br /> <br /> What can I say? I'm biased when it comes to Urban Cowboy. I like it and I've looked it over and over and I usually find out something new about it with every view. I think one of the things I like is that Urban Cowboy is about working class people, not rich people who live in LA or New York. Well, it's true, except for Pam. <br /> <br /> Travolta plays Bud, a Texas city boy who moves to Houston to work in the oil fields. And this is the moment when Travolta actually played in dramatic films such as Saturday Night Fever, instead of playing stereotypes / boys in high budget movies. This is a very good movie - mechanical riding and two-step dance can be silly, but you have to enjoy that for what it is. Bud meets Sissy (played by Debra Winger with slutty glow) - and shortly they are married and live in their dream trailer. But their relationship becomes a real battle of the sexes. Bud wants to be a real cowboy. Sissy wants to be a real cowboy. But in modern times, the roles of men are not as clear. Where can Bud prove he is a real man? He can work his day in a dangerous day and ride mechanically at night - he can be a "urban cowboy." But Sissy wants to drive her truck, and she wants to ride the bull. So where does Bud live? While Sissy claims independence, she sleeps riding the bull and flirting with the ex-con star and rodeo prison - a true bull rider -, Wes (played awfully greasy by Scott Glenn). Bud is threatened, and Bud and Sissy are separated. Sissy beats with Wes, who is abusing her. Still emailed, Bud becomes the Pam's toy, a rich girl whose father is in the oil, and all that involves. Sissy comes next to the trailer to clean her - Pam does not do that. She writes a letter of budding Bud, but Pam hurts and takes credit for Sissy's housework. Bud's uncle tragically dies at work when lightning strikes and causes an explosion. Bud and Sissy have a chance to reconcile, but they're too stubborn. Later, the mechanical bull contest is at Gilley, and you know Bud will win. Pam realizes Bud does not love her, but Sissy - she did it for her. Wes is trying to rob Gilleys, but you did not know that the urban cowboy, Bud, saves the day and wins back the woman she loves. Of course you can ask why Bud and Sissy go to Gilleys every night and "live like pigs." Perhaps he contributed to their bad marriage. Or why Bud did not stay with Pam - he was not that bad and he had money. Or why they had to kill Uncle Bob. Or why Bud and Sissy had such stupid friends as Marshall and Jessie who always tried to destroy them: Marshall told Bud: "She {Sissy} rides that bull better than you!" But part of Urban Cowboy's fun is a bit of fun - and it's not that Bonnie Raitt on the stage!
