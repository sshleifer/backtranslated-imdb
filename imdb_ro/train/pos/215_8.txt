The word "classic" is tossed too often nowadays, but this film deserves appreciation. The combination of Neil Simon, Walter Matthau (possibly the best comic actor in the world) and late father, George Burns, makes a comic masterpiece. It's interesting to contemplate what the movie would have been if it did not prevent Jack Benny from playing George Burns as planned. As it is, the meeting scene in Matthau's apartment is not likely to be overtaken as a sidesplitter. Definitely one of the films of my desert island. <br /> <br /> "Enter !!!!!!!!!"
