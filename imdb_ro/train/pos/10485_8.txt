I saw her last night on TV, and I was very excited. <br /> <br /> It's kind of a movie that makes you feel beautiful and warm around your heart and you think there's still goodness in the world (all the neighbors pretended not to see what grace is doing to help her and protects it - the old cop is my favorite), although you know this story is not realistic. I liked playing (they all seem to be just as ordinary people, I live in the small picturesque English coast town), but the biggest thing in the film was the spirit and the humor it has! Just remember the scene in the store with two old ladies after they had "tea"! Perhaps the end was a little confusing, but did not stop me from really, really enjoy the whole story!
