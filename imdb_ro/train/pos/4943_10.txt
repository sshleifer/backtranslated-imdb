This movie is the simplest and the best. I had doubts because, although Freeman is a great actor, sometimes he gets involved in bad projects; this is not one of those times. It's a small story that runs a little over an hour and fifteen, at a time when we get used to having longer and longer movies and not necessarily better, the director uses the short time to his advantage because the characters are so good from the beginning (great interpretations by Freeman and Vega by the way), that little background information seems to be real, Morgan is himself, even if the name is not mentioned, he has been out of films for a few years now because has been tired of business, and has developed a fear to engage in a scenario, and is doing research for a character in an indie film where he plays a store manager / supermarket. The story begins to be dropped in a supermarket in a tough neighborhood where the cashier of the 10 items or less (Vega) meets and has to walk with its cause "production" forgot to take it. In many ways, it's a road movie, Morgan offers laughter and smiles with his unbeatable smile and a positive outlook on everyone, presenting an accomplished actor who has prepared his mind to define everyone he has sees in a character he can play, and Paz (by the way, a beautiful, beautiful woman even more beautiful than Penelope Cruz) brings the vulnerability of a 25-year-old woman who works more than anybody else from a supermarket miserable. It's a talk, there's a lot of dialogue, but the balance between light and fun and serious and sad is well sustained, the characters become so loved immediately spend the last 20 minutes begging for more time on the screen but the torque is weird but the failure is in the nature of the story, so it was a good call from the director not to give up.
