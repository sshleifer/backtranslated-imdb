I do not have much to add to what was said before, but it's a time movie and the first (and probably only) time when the studio drew the entire movie on Dead End Kids. Warner's gave boys a lot of help, from director Ray Enright and an "A" budget, to a nearly magical distribution of supporting actors. At each turn, we get one of these jewelry shows from real professionals. There are too many to list, but it seems that everyone in Warner's group (Sans, the biggest viewers) is going through this picture. (See if you can see John Ridgely) Only the top performance is from Eduardo Cianelli, always trusted, as a mob leader with a messianic complex. He plays this character almost exactly like that of Thuggie leader in "Gunga Din". It's something to watch! And Marjorie Main is excellent and has the best part in "Dead End". My offer for this is a second feature on a double invoice with something like "City for Conquest". <br /> <br /> Follow for Warners!
