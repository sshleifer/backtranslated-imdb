Given the limited budget and production limitations, this movie is very good. It is plausible, realistic and shows how Csikos (the Hungarian horsemen who lived in the plains) risked their lives to save a descendant American pilot from the ruthless and wild Nazis. We are attracted to strong feelings for the young, but you are very attractive to the boy - who admire the American pilot. If you're looking for special effects, super heroes and magical traps - this movie is not for you, if you want to feel what it must have been to avoid persevering, amorous Nazis and their lack of compassion, then you'll be excited about this movie. I was really glad for those who love horses, humble dogs and humankind, who appreciate freedom, and those who aspire to this end, this movie will be one that you will remember for a long time.
