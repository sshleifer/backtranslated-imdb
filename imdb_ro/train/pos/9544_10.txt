Meatball Machine is an amazing splashing film, has an original plot of young love, blood buckets and strange alien creatures that move people into robotic war machines. Now the movie is not for everyone, people who love brilliant movies or the movie Tetsuo: Iron Man will applaud it. The special effects can be amazing at some points in the movie, but do not assume taking the movie seriously. However, it is all fun if you discover starving romanticians infected with thin tumors, such as gobble-bumps trying to destroy themselves in bloody foreign battles.
