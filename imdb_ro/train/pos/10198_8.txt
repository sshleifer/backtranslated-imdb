I am grateful to Cesar Montano and his crew for the subtle revival of Visayan. "Panaghoy" is, hopefully, the precursor of a rebirth in this language (which supports more speakers than the Tagalog). The details of dialect and lifestyle resembles precisely this region of the Philippines. Disadvantage: Disturbed suffering and deformation of the American antagonist. The other element I did not appreciate was the lack of authenticity in the costume of the "same period" by the same character and, above all, his bloody red kit, which I suppose was supposed to pass for a roadster in the 1930s. Without the small but wonderful details, "Panaghoy" would have been at least 9 out of 10 in my rankings - daghang salamat, Manoy Cesar! Addendum: This film certainly beats Peque Gallaga "Oro, Plata, Mata", which offered a different view of Visayas during the Second World War. Alos, there are a few parts where the cinema returns to Spielberg's "The Color Purple," and the story begins to recall "Noli Me Tangere."
