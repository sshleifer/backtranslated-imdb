I was of Irish origin, loved this film, not only was the hot and funny son he was also sincere and honest. I loved the girl she fell in love with and she was beautiful. They were such a nice couple. The end was so sad. Love this movie! Although it is a bit dirty, it reminds a Prime or British Prime or Irish version. If you liked this movie, you should look for premiums. The same line of young story falls for older women, older women fall for a young guy. A lot of paths cross, finally, the best decision is made or the task ends. You have nothing else to say without destroying the entire movie, yet I thought the French guy was ugly, less appealing to me. Umm ... if you like Irish movies, I would recommend "Circle of Friends", the movie is so good. Quite fast, you might not get if you do not look at her "okay, that's my ruin." LOL
