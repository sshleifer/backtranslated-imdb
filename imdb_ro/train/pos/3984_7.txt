As part of the Royal Royale release, this film with the new Bond that took place in this film was presented by director Roger Michell (Notting Hill). I almost stopped him because I was a little boring, but I'm glad I got stuck. In principle, May (Anne Reid) is a single mother of Helen (Anna Wilson-Jones) who sees no one and has no friend for years. Her daughter says she might marry her new lover, Darren (Daniel Craig, of course). After only a few days, Darren and Darren have a secret adventure. And at her age, 30, and the new Bond? Anyway, they want to keep their secret, but May regrets and wonders if Helen will find out. When he does, Darren gets less hassle than ever. In fact, Helen asks her permission to hit her. Also played were Peter Vaughan as Toots, Danira Govich as Au Pair, Harry Michell as Harry, Rosie Michell as Rosie and Johnny Engels Oliver Ford Davies as Bruce. Very good!
