This movie was great. I did not expect to stay with all the hype, but it did. Like all Bourne movies, the action is fast, realistic and intense. If you liked the other two movies in the trilogy, you'd love that too. The story of the movie is simple and there are no overturns of plot that are too unrealistic. Okay, the character Julia Stiles who appears in the Italian safe house was kind of appealing especially after it happened in Supremacy, but it makes sense that she is the only character in the Treadstone that Bourne knows he does not want him dead he could trust the only person to lead him in the right direction. Action is driven by characters and their reactions to what is happening around them. The thing we've always loved about Bourne's movies is that Bourne can hit his head, but when he matches people as good as fights, fighting is very painful. They never treat the public as idiots. All actors were solid in their performances. I think Damon could play Bourne in his sleep and receive excellent support from Joan Allen, who resumed his role in the Supremacy, David Strathairn and Scott Glenn. I recommend this movie and the trilogy. I miss Frankie Potente though.
