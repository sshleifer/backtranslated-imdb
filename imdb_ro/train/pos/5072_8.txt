Pierce Brosnan will probably be the only thing familiar in Richard Attenborough's new biography. The rest is new to the international audience: Canadian history and First Culture of Nations. "Owl Gray" is an easy examination of how a man has been adopted in Ojibway in northern Ontario, teaching and teaching ecology for decades before becoming politically correct to do so. The film contains a love story, a moral message, and a man tortured by his past. However, torture is not always brought to life with the dramatic impact it may have. Still, it's a movie that keeps the audience without any violence. It gives deep respect to the first Canadian nations and presents them in a dignified and non-stereotypical manner. Brosnan's performance is somewhat rigid, but I suspect that Lord Attenborough did so. Thanks to a proud Canadian.
