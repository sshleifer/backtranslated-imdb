I met this show for the first time when I stayed in Japan for six months last year. I found her on the internet when I was looking for subtitled drama to help my Japanese. My host mother warned me to stay away from her because she thought it was weird, but it seemed delightful to me! Koyuki showed such conflictual features, and Matsujun's spirit made me the day I set it up! I first saw "Hana Yori Dango", but I liked it much better! Although the characters are interesting and well developed, I was disappointed to learn that they did not change very much during the show. Their relationship grew, but they did not really do it. However, a fun time had it all (Even for Fukushima!).
