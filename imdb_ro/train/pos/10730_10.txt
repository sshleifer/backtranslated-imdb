Unfortunately, SpaceCamp appeared around the same time with the Challenger Explosion. Which really puts an encryption when to remove it or even if it should, to get it out. I'm glad they did. I watched the first SpaceCamp at a drive-in movie. Which has greatly improved viewing. <br /> <br /> While I heard about Lea Thompson and Tom Skerritt. I've never heard of the others in the movie. So it came as a great shock for me to find these young people who act and act really well! Of course, Kate Capshaw was great. I especially liked scenes, where these children were shown how to act as a team. Scenes of children who were ready for a trip they could only tell. The real launch of a spacecraft is, of course, old news for us. However, this was different. Everything is one of my most precious movies. You may run, but it was fantastic for a space like me. After the rental, perhaps, 30 to 40 times. Finally, I found it available in a particular store and bought it. Now if they appear only on DVD. I'll probably have it forever. This movie gets 9 out of 10 from me.
