What surprised me most about this movie was the full audience she drew. Similar films, such as Anita and Me, have never caused so much hype as this movie, though I think it's likely because of the "Beckham" title in the title more than anything else. It's a brilliant film that puts on a brilliant message - you can do anything if you are determined enough and think about it, which is a positive message for anyone watching this movie. I think this is one of Keira Knightley's best movies, and I think she's a brilliant actress and she was great for the role. The Nagra parminder was also shining. Unfortunately, I can not say this to Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, because I do not think he was a good actor, and to be honest, his eyes were a little frightening. <br /> <br /> On the whole, a brilliant film and a brilliant story
