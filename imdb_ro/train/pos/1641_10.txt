I saw 25 years ago on PBS. It was very hard to look. So real. To pursue this small family struggle in the winter, it was heart. There is no time for courting: fate has thrown us together and we put our shoulders on grindstone and we make it work. This was based on the woman's current diary, which I read several years later. She said in her diary that her parents died when she was young and that all their drunkards and sisters had to work on the farm to feed. She had learned to cost, who was not like a lady. He was afraid that no charming prince would want a woman with his hands the sun, handled, but his husband was so happy that his new wife knew how to cut and she was happy to do it. Both were widows and together they worked to build a new home. It was so, so sad when the baby died. Of course, if they had it today, I'm sure it would have been good. That makes the extra-sad tragedy. I cried so loud. But then they came out and successfully brought out a new calf. Spring is on its way, and life continues. In her diary she had two boys and they lived.
