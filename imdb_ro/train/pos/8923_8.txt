The Blob is a classic film from the 1950s, the SF movie. You probably know the story: two adolescents (Steve McQueen & Aneta Corsaut) see a meteorite hit by the earth, and when they go looking for him, they meet an old man with strange stutter ... stuck on his arm. I'm going to the doctor's office and then go find out what happened. From there, the stain spreads, eating everyone in its path. The special effects are brown fun, just like the story. There are many wonderful touches, like the policeman playing chess over the radio with a policeman in another district. It is not a masterpiece, but it has a special place in its genre. Steve McQueen is very good. 8/10.
