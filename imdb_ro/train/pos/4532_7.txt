This was Keaton's first feature and three shorts at the time of the eternal triangle of Romanticism (Stone Age, Roman Age, Modern Age). Stories parallel to each other as Griffith Grizzly INTOLERANCE, which he intended to satirize. The strengths of benches and gangs rely almost on anachronisms, bringing modern business into an ancient atmosphere. <br /> <br /> **** WARNING - COLLECTION WILL FOLLOW THE BEST POINTS ****** <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Here are the classic moments: <br /> <br /> Using a turtle like a border (stone age); A watch that contains a sun dial (the Roman era); A spare wheel car (the Roman era); Use of a cassette block as a tire lock (Roman era); Early golf with clubs and stones (Stone Age); The dictation of a will being carved in a rock (the Stone Age); Changing meteorological forecast (Roman age); Horse race in the snow -Buster using skis and huskies with a spare dog in the boot of the chariot (Roman era). The above are all thrown throats that keep our chick. There are also unforgettable moments: Buster removes the shaving equipment to match the face with makeup; The fantastic double takes when a stung Buster looks at his plate to find a crab that looks at him (in a second he jumped to sit on his seat in a seating position and jumped back into the waiter's arms - one of the funniest moments I've ever seen). And that lion - manicure - simply bright. There's also a bit of racism out of color when four African American Bed Sheepers abandon their mistress for a game of Roman carp. Kino's printing is a bit fuzzy and contains many sequences of both nitrate damage and film damage - most likely at the ends of the rolls. The Metro feature is piano and flute-labeled and borrows a lot from Grieg. A lot of fun and laughing.
