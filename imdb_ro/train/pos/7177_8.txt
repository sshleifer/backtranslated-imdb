I was so entertaining in this insightful documentary and waited a good way for it to come through the pipes (my local video chain) and it's worth the wait. I like a documentary / special interest, but it was certainly a heart, honest and nostalgic, if you look back at adolescent life. The imagination of a child is fascinating, and here begins a wonderful story. Rent it or buy it if you like a good humorous documentary and around. Mr. Stein and the company have indeed come close to neighboring camcorders of bank suspicions and homosexual rings that turn people from gay at a glance. Everybody seems to be really successful in the respectful fields, and it was good to know that all are good friends. The DVD has several additional trailers for other good documentaries, and has a number of Darren's most notable productions, including Crazy News.
