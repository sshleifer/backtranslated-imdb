Gundam Wing is a funny show. I appreciate that because you bring me to Gundam and anime in general. However, after seeing his predecessors, such as Mobile Suit Gundam, Zeta Gundam and even G Gundam, I think Wing is Gundam Lite. Characters: A Gundam's face is to have the characters push in difficulties and mature. This is not the case in Wing. Heero is a top dog in the beginning, and he is a top dog at the end. Personality does not change, growth is never touched. The best character is Zechs, who is for all intents and purposes a hero in most of the series. But suddenly the series betrays him and turns him into a bastard for no apparent reason. Mecha: Wing has a great design. Gundams are super cool, with Epyon being my favorite. I think some of the OZ suits are just like some of the classic Zeon suits. But the design of sweet suits does not save the serious series of dull characters. Conclusion: In the end, Wing has cool fighting scenes, though animated with recycled animation, but with a wonderful plot and character development. Glad, but do not move like previous trips to Gundam.
