Old movie movies will know why I would call this "Man of the Gray Flan Robot". Most Bible-based movies are basically a skull - which could bring smiles and chuckles here is how Peck is trying to raise consciousness on a variety of psychological and social issues, with the spear bearing everything about Neanderthals. As a great romance, it collapses like unleavened bread. But something about this movie is something like that. Of all Hollywood biblical images, it transmits most strikingly the ambivalent attitude of the average American towards faith in the biblical God. Billy's thesis on Sunday controls him with H.L. Mencken through the scenario. Whoever best obtains this in the synthesis supported by the heavenly crown depends on your point of view. Besides, D & B enjoys Peck's good performances (especially in the penitence penitentiary scene) and Jayne Meadows as his first friendly wife, Michol, a lively atmosphere (a good idea to do the greatest action at dawn or night); the overwhelming interpretation of the 21st Psalm at the end.
