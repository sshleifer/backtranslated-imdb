The Enterprise pilot has one thing that lacks Star Trek: A dose of realistic, erroneous personalities. The utopian characters of the next generation were tedious, they were so noble that they were unbelievable. I also like the sub-plot that people are bitter about Vulcans. Funny, seeing them as pretentious snobs. It makes me look forward to seeing people become the dominant race between the two, although I do not think it will work during the show. The only negative ones I've jumped to have been "quickly cut the end of 2 hours," you feel at the end, which is common among many of the Trek shows. The second was shameless scraping for evaluations of some meaningless scenes. It was not in place, a good science fiction show should be able to stand alone without trying to push the pre-adolescent audience with some skin. But it's not my task to make the show profitable, so good. <br /> <br /> Let's see how the next episode is doing.
