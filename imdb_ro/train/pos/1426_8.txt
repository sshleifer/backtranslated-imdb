I have to say that sometimes "appearance" is all that matters, as BBC's Jeremy Clarkson has pointed out (not our land though, but he is right anyway). And when it comes to this movie is such an incredibly amazing beauty that you will absolutely love what your eyes are about to see. And then there is the personality of the movie, interesting, with an exciting narrator narrator narrator stories that will touch your soul as you follow those superbly filmed images. The movie is unlikely to affect your lifestyle, destroying these beauties, but it will surely remind you of how precious the land we really live is. <br /> <br /> This film deserves 10 stars, being one of the few stylistic earthly docs I really enjoyed.
