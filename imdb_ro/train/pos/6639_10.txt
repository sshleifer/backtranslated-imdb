Use the IMDb. <br /> <br /> You gave some serious votes for some of your favorite movies. <br /> <br /> It's something you like to do. <br /> <br /> And because of that. Fifty seconds. One world is over, another begins. How can not a ten number be given? I wonder who gives this seven or eight ... exactly how could be the FIRST VERY MORE FILM? For recording, the long, still open photo is a great show, a superb innovation, perfectly suited to the situation. And the dog on the bike is a wonderful touch. All this within fifty seconds. <br /> <br /> The word genius is often too much used. <br /> <br /> This is a genius.
