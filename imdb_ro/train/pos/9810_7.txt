Albuquerque is a film that has all the elements of a Western class A, except for one: the story, which really belongs to a B or C class. It was acceptable at the time the movie was made, when people were so excited to see west, in color, but today it looks very primitive. However, for those who enjoy old vestiges, it's fun, the original color and sound are very well kept on the DVD that came out recently. Gabby Hayes is a good opponent, Lon Chaney is like always, and Randolph Scott a little cheerful than usual. In a movie called Albuquerque, you would expect to see something that reminds you of the city, but the city presented here could be anywhere.
