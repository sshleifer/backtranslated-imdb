My brother and I have Pokemon 4Ever on DVD. I looked at it like a couple of times and it was the best. Too bad It's a new Pokemon did not talk this time. I'll use it. The Iron Masked Marauder was quite important when he captured Celebi with his closed ball. Good Thing Ash and Sam managed to get him out of control. <br /> <br /> There was only one song in the final credits called Cele-BRATE by Russell Velazquez. Pokemon 4Ever It has become a success from the previous three films and people will always love that movie.
