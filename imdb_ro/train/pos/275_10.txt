This film starts with a family going in all directions, and teenage daughter Martha MacIssac (Olivia Dunne) was very in love with Joe MacLeod (Zack). Mom is interpreted by Mitzi Kapture (Jill Dunne), who suddenly enters her daughter and Zack, and then there are all sorts of problems. Jill Dunne has a husband who always travels or stays away from home quite often. There are also big issues that arise when the family decides to go on a camping trip that their daughter Olivia does not like and can not adapt to sleeping outdoors and requires a tent to keep all the bug -hate. In many ways, Olivia has a remarkable performance, while the teenager and Nick Mancuso (Richard Grant) provide an important support role as owner of the hotel. This movie will make you guess how it will end and you will enjoy a horror and horror movie. enjoy
