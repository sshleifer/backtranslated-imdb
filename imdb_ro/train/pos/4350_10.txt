This film is one of those who have a special familiarity. It is earth, earth and a movie that will make you think ... and smile. Paul Reiser and Peter Falk lead you on a journey that you will not forget. The soundtrack is very varied and suited; and the film itself is like a mouth of fresh air. This is definitely worth recognition for both the film and the actors! Finally, a piece of art that moves away from the story of obvious love and the frequent special affections that are seen today. I never came out of a movie with such a deep and thoughtful heart in my heart; because it felt as if someone had wrapped it in a fluffy fleece blanket. To see this movie is to find a real treasure and enjoy it.
