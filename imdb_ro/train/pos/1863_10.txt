ANTWONE FISHER is the story of a young US sailor who has emotional problems. His problems lead to Jerome Davenport, a psychiatrist who helps him to realize that his problems come from his childhood education. <br /> <br /> Prepare to shed a tear or two. The film could thaw the coldest heart. I liked the story, which turns from something so horrible that it will happen to anyone in a positive end. ANTWONE FISHER is a powerful, most important film about forgiveness. Other important things that you think are child abuse, adoption and care. Oscar winner Denzel Washington makes an impressive work in his directorial debut. There were many scenes that I liked to look at. These included the beginning (a boy's dreams, check the giant pancakes!) And the end (dreams have turned into reality), which nicely bound the story together. Another wonderful scene took place when the doctor encouraged Antwone to look for his family to find answers to his questions about his abandoned family. My favorite scene happened when the young man finally faced his mother and her reaction to him. Priceless. <br /> <br /> All actors represented their songs well. <br /> <br /> In addition to managing responsibilities, Mr. Washington continues to show why he has won an Academy Award and is successful in all his roles. He had a strong presence in this film. The actor, Derek Luke, demonstrated why he was so fit for Antwone Fisher's part. It was a very real and unimaginable work. Joy Bryant, who played Cheryl's part, Antwone's love interest, looks like a ray of sunshine. Chemistry got well between romantic characters. Novella Nelson, who played Ms Tate's role, is a perfect character and deserves a special mention. Although we only see it for a few minutes, the actress who played Fisher's mother gave a remarkable performance. Everyone should see ANTWONE FISHER.
