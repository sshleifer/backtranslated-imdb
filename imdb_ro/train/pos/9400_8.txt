If the man in a white suit was made in America, can not you see either Danny Kaye or Jerry Lewis trying Sidney Stratton from Alec Guinness for size? This is one of the best of Alec's Guinness Films and certainly one of the best that the UK's Ealing Studios have ever given. It fits perfectly in the timeframe of the new government of labor and the society it was trying to build. It is amazing how in times of crisis the capital and the workforce can agree. Alec Guinness This little small schnook of a man is obsessed with the idea that he can invent clothes that will not need cleaning, all sorts of foreign matter when he touches the garment. <br /> <br /> He is a persistent cuss and he succeeds. Of course, the implications did not really reflect on the type of impact clothing it will have on society. Finally, everyone is watching him like a fugitive, like Peter Lorre from M or Orson Welles in The Stranger or even Robert Newton in Oliver Twist. <br /> <br /> It is the sign of a great comedy that a potentially serious situation such as that chase, as described in some of the serious films I have mentioned, can be played for laughs. Guinness's costume is not only white and repellent, but shines like a neon sign. Aside from Guinness, the best performances are from Cecil Parker, like another pompous bust, Joan Greenwood as the siren daughter and Ernest Thesiger, Britain's largest clothing manufacturer> Come to think about it, made Paramount to borrow this Ealing suit and give it to John Travolta for Saturday Fever?
