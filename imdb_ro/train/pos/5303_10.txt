John Water's ("Pink Flamingos" ...) "Pecker" is the best movie I've ever seen. It gives the viewer a surreal picture of life in Baltimore (living in the vicinity of Washington, DC), with the use of colors, movements and emotions exaggerated by Warhol. Pecker gets bigger than his city can handle and he's separated from his loved ones (including a sexy Ricci) by his man-loving art manager. The image left a refreshing taste in the mouth - like a fresh strawberry ice cream on a hot summer day - and although that taste was rather full and simplistic, it was only deeper and more critical. It's a feast of life, freedom and the right to wear weapons ... and everything else in this country. -Juan Pieczanski (jpieczanski@sidwell.edu)
