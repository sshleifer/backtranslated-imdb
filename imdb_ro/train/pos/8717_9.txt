I must immediately recognize that I am not a big fan of "family" films these days. Many of them, IMHO, are sentimental nonsense. But this, like TOY STORY, Pixar's previous movie, is really fun. The two characters were probably a little too gentle (especially when compared to the two ANTZ stars, but otherwise this film is better), but the rest of the film was more than composing for him. The animation looked great, humor, though wide, was consistently good (especially I liked Hopper's line "If I did not promise my mother on the deathbed that I would not kill you, I would kill you!") making the voices, except for the two leaderships, were all terrible (Denis Leary makes an animated film, what concept). And like everyone else, I liked the extras! I hope the video has the new ones.
