This documentary explores a story covered by Pilger's latest "Freedom Next Time" book, which was published in 2006. It reveals the shocking expulsion of the locals of Diego Garcia, one of the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean. <br /> <br /> Insulars are British citizens technically, as Diego Garcia is a British colony, like Mauritius, the neighboring island where the locals were exiled. But the British government has ignored its request to return to their homeland because the island is now a military base for the United States military that used it as the basis for bombing Iraq and Afghanistan. <br /> <br /> As usual, Pilger's coverage is shocking, especially as it documents the treatment and poor living conditions of surviving insulators. His interviews are excellent, and casting a representative of Parliament, where he uses his government's own information to fix it, is one of the best. <br /> <br /> Pilger also uses a dramatic reconstruction to dissect a series of newly released documents that fully illuminate the British conspiracy to evict the locals. The film's weaving with island interviews and music really raises the impact of the film. It is not easy to see, but "A theft of a nation" is John Pilger to the best. Recommended.
