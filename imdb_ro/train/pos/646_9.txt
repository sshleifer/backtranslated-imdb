Have a female friend who is being drawn into a relationship with a SOB who has a long-term girlfriend. Of course, the SOB is very beautiful, charming, and my friend is a very intelligent woman. Watching Jean Pierre Leaud's character at work is just like observing what happens in real life when such people destroy the lives of our female friends. It's tragic and you know she's going to be very hurt, but you can not do anything. Leaud is brilliant. Completely empty. A hole all the way, he pulls his face and tells the stories he thinks he will get the reaction he wants. The two-hour scene where Leaud and Lebrun made love, and the next morning he puts on a record and, very sweet and charming, sings over time to amuse him to be brilliant. The phrase "What the hell am I doing here with this idiot" that lights up on her face and face will be in my memory for a long time. It's a long movie, but see it all at once, preferably in a movie theater. He has some time to enter, but then time is gone.
