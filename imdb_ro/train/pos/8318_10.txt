An excellent movie. Superb acting by Mary Alice, Phillip M. Thomas and a young Irene Cara. Tony King was very realistic in the role of Satin. This film was one of the last "all black" movies of the 70's and unlike the blaxploitation of that era, this movie actually had a plot and was very well done. The soundtrack, sung by Aretha Franklin, has been popular in the R & B charts since then.
