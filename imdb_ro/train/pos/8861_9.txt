Andy says: "No one is hurt, everyone wins." Before he says, we know the opposite is true: Everybody hurts, no one wins. This is a new component in American films, or perhaps an old tightening at the end. Think of "Eastern Promises," "There will be blood," "No country for the elderly". These films are dark, serious, extremely well done and do not care about the happy ending. I love them. "Before the devil knows that you are dead" fits the general description, but creates an atmosphere of his own. Kelly Masterson's debut script is just as close to a Hollywood film that will ever end up in a Greek tragedy. Paying homage to veteran director Stanley Donen, Sidney Lumet completely transforms the sumptuous story into a remarkable drama characterized by the old school. The opening photos, although by an ordinary accountant, the dog, are shaping their trophy wife, have the look of a Dutch master painting. In contrast, the drug dealer condo looks more like a string of Mondriani. Excellent performance around. Only the character of Albert Finney, Charles, feels a bit overwhelmed, his eyes wide and the agape almost almost all the time. But then he is in a deep, profound difficulty than any of the tribulations that most of us will ever know. For compensation, Marisa Tomei is super hot. But, of course, you do not need to tell you that. Why her character Gina would like to be with a guy like Andy, we're never told, but that's okay. Action is character, after all. The unique and magical character of Carter Burwell's music makes this wonderful film a masterpiece. Do not miss.
