They're probably one of Nancy Drew's biggest fans out there. I have read each book three times and played many games in Nancy. I liked this movie. It made you have fun with everything you watched. I went with about ten friends and everyone I loved. There were three women standing behind us who seemed to be in the late 1930s to the early 1940s and asked how they liked it, they said they loved it! So you will see that it will be fun for all ages. You have to give him a chance. And learn a lesson, be alone, even if everyone around you is exactly the same. So, in general, this movement was great. I'll see for the second time now! So stop to beat him. It's a great movie!
