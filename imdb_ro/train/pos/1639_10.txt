Fabulous actors, beautiful landscapes, strict reality. I will not elaborate all the comments of other commentators because you have the picture! However, the movie is not for squeamish. The reality sacrifices pigs and other animals to survive. I have the book of Elinore Randall Stewart. I read it a few years ago, I have to reread it, since I watched the newly released, remastered DVD movie. I have tried to buy video for many years, eventually bought it used from a video store that left the deal. But Yippee! The DVD is now for sale, I bought it on amazon.com. Not cheap, but it was worth it. This is a movie I will follow until the end of my days!
