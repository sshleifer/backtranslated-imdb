I will admit that I thought this movie would not be good at all, but I changed my mind very quickly. The movie keeps you guessing which direction it's going. Pierce Broson is amazing in his role as a hit man who suddenly gets burned and asks a man he met at the Mexican bar for help. Greg Kinnear is a great man as his role as a gentle man in Denver, who starts an innocent conversation with Pierce at a Mexican bar. The movie will make you laugh that Pierce offers a hilarious hayar (especially about sex). The imagery of this film is very well done, especially in the bullfighting scene and when Pierce sees himself when he tries to finish his last job.
