This is widely seen in Australia as one of the best dramas of horses ever produced here ... and for my money, anywhere. It's brutal, hilarious, the characters are real, the situations are credible, and they are not hampered by the darker part of life that policemen and offenders, victims, lawyers, and other people face in their different orbits. > <br /> This show lasted 2 seasons and was interrupted because the show did not sell well abroad. We are sorry for its loss: however, like Fawlty Towers, we will be able to respect it as a series of lasting, high-quality uniforms.
