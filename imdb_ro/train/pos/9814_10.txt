This Peabody Award winning episode is one of the most important moments of season 1 where a holodeck flaw traps Captain Picard, Beverly, Data, and a Starfleet historian, named Waylan, in a 1930 San Francisco d√©cor. The episode is a tribute to Raymond Chandler's "Maltese Falcon", where Patrick Stewart assumes the role of Humphrey Bogart - complete with fedora and trenchcoat. The Bureau itself is almost an exact response to that presented in Bogey's "Falcon Maltese". <br /> <br /> This episode also briefly presents a mysterious insect race called Jarada, which communicates with great noise. Communicating with this extraterrestrial race is difficult, and Picard must communicate with this race in their native language so that negotiations and diplomacy eventually start. The best part of this episode, however, is the advent of famous Hollywood actor B Lawrence Tierney as gangster Cyrus Redblock. He was such a beautiful man in the 1940s.
