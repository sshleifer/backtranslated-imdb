I have no words to describe how good this movie is. Only a genius like Amrita Pritam could have written a real picture of the days of divorce. The movie continued to haunt me for many days. Urmila has made the role of her life in this film. He put his life in the role of Puroo and Manoj Vajpai did no less in his role as Rashid. It's hard to imagine anyone else than the two acting as Puroo and Rashid. Punjabi's costumes looked so natural on Urmila, and Manoj looked like a natural Mudalmaan Punjabi. Sandhali Sinha like Lajjo and Suri as Ramchand have made a fabulous job. Priyanshu Chattarjee did a good job like Triloki. Some of the scenes that you just can not get rid of. When Puroo meets Lajjo for the first time, he brings tears to your eyes. The climax is just a killer. I was expecting a tragic end, but fortunately, the end was wonderful. This movie is in the same category as Pakeezah, Mughal-e-Azam, Banaras, etc. Not to be missed.
