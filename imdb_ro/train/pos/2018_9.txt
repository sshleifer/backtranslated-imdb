I loved so much that I bought the DVD and the novel at the same time. The chemistry of the actors (including the little Arthur) is amazing and thrilling. He could have used a little longer on screen for friend Frederick Lawrence (played by James Purefoy). And Gilbert Markham has been amazing "on her" since the beginning of the movie. <br /> <br /> The one who fascinated me through shock and surprise and astonishment was Rupert Graves as Arthur Huntingdon. I love him in Forsyte Saga and all I've seen. But he's wrong here like Arthur. In my wildest dreams I could not imagine playing a psychic dementia like Arthur Huntingdon. But he does. And I like it. And I love him.
