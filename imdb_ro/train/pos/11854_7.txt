I agree with "Jerry." Is it a very underrated space film (of course, how many low-budget items are NOT underestimated?) If I remember correctly, the solution to mystery was a kind of variation (but not "rip-off") since 2001, because the computer that controlled the spacecraft had actually been a man, which in a way was transformed into a computer. And like HAL, they tried to disconnect their "mind," but not its mechanical parts, and, as in the case of HAL, led to disaster. There is at least one funny moment. When the character of Christopher Cary, who finds no food, finds the abandoned bird of the pet, there is a terrible moment, but obvious things do not happen after all.
