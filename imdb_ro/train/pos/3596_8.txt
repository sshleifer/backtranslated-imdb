We finally came to see the movie in this way and I have to say that I was very impressed. Michelle Rodriguez is probably one of my new favorite actresses - not only can she act, but also choose the roles best suited to her, which are more significant and more important than they would seem first. I have read some comments that have expressed the relief that this was not a frightening feminist thing as they had previously thought, but I certainly do not agree. Diana is a feminist. She follows her dreams and believes in herself the opposite of what practically everyone around her thinks (except her tiny carer Tiny and her coach and manager, Hector, who turns out to be more of a father figure than the real parent) , what is the word "feminism" is about. It's good to see movies like this pointing out the real part of feminism - they're not a bunch of missed supporters - but they have dreams and can do anything. Diana is true for her while the prey of love is still falling, and she and Adrian have a more realistic and complicated relationship than just something that works magically. Girlfight is a true taste of reality and puts a faith back in my perception of people. Thank you, Michelle. 8/10 - A very important film that refers not only to young women but also to all who want to go far in their lives.
