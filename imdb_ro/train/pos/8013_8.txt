Yes, it is another magical movie of Muppet and I adore it all; characters, movies, TV shows (it's the best ever comedy or music show) and all the artists behind it. But here they have made such a fatal fatal mistake and certainly talk about the strange ending! <br /> <br /> I think it's very dangerous to get so involved in American drama and to end a love affair through marriage! We, like all the poor spectators, feel so free or happy for the absence of discomfort, inconvenience, and misery! So, we all enjoy these stories that bring together two cute heroes as young lovers without a legitimate bond like Mickey Mouse and Minnie, Superman and Lois Lane, Dick Tracy and Tess, etc. So with all the previous couples and their pleasure, I bet you feel safe, serene and peaceful. Therefore, when you look at what the producers of this film have already done, you will be as crazy as me! They made the poor, miserable creature (Kermit) marry the everyday nightmare, the vague woman ever (Miss Piggy)! This is a historic change through the American entertainment industry! And it was quite normal to have a negative impact on the public who just refused to bless or believe or be content with this sudden marriage (even the pathetic frog did not have time or the opportunity to think or decide anything!). So it's no surprise when you know that this film is the most failing of their cinematic series, earning just 25 million from the 65 million earned by the first movie (The Muppet Movie? 1979) five years earlier! <br /> <br /> Simply in this movie they took Manhattan, and my rest too!
