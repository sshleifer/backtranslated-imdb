In fact, my vote is 7.5. Anyway, the movie was good, it has those fun parts that make it worthwhile to see, not to misunderstand me, it's not the funniest movie in the world, not even the original one, because the idea I saw most early in other movies, but it has its own taste, a friend of mine told me it was a movie for lovers ... I think not exactly, but who cares? There is also another movie that shows us almost the same subject, Chris Rock appears in it, the name is Down to Earth, people one is a very funny movie, see if you want and know that you will agree that Mr. Rock has won with his movie. I would like the protagonist to be given Ashton Kutcher, but the movie is good.
