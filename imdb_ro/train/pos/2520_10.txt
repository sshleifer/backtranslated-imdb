Despite what the others said (* cough *), this is my favorite movie of all time. I do not know how long I've been waiting to see, but once I finally did, I fell in love immediately. Sure, it's weird, but that gives it more of an interesting flavor. For those who do not know, Moonchild is one of the first films of Gackt and Hyde. They did not do too many, maybe three or four peaks each. So give them some credit. We all know that Adam Sandler was not the best at first. I think they are throwing strange situations out there, but I'm looking at it to find the best points in this movie, the emotions displayed and what not. So I gave, and I will always give this movie a 10 out of 10.
