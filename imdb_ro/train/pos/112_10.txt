EUROPA (ZENTROPA) is a masterpiece that gives the viewer the excitement that must come with the birth of the narrative film almost a century ago. This movie is truly unique and a genius work. The shooting and editing rooms are brilliant and combined with the narrative narrative tropes used in the film, create an extraordinary and unforgettable cinematic experience. The participation of Barbara Suwkowa and Eddie Constantine in distribution are two guilty pleasures that should be seen and enjoyable. Max Von Sydow offers his big voice as a narrator. A unique movie! Four stars (highest rating).
