I thought it was one of the best sequels I've ever seen. Sometimes I felt like I just wanted someone to die, Stanley's murder of annoying characters was brilliant. It was such a good movie that you were happy when it died. My only problem was that some scenes resemble that someone with their home camera was filming and it was weird. Judd Nelson is cute, at least in my opinion and was excellent in the role of Stanley Caldwell. Brilliant film.
