An uncensored original print of this amazing film was discovered in 2004 in the Library of Congress and was featured in several specialized theaters around the world in 2005. According to the current reviews we have found online, the original has all the most irritating dialogue and innuendos intact; these were subsequently either eliminated or completely re-shot by the studio before the initial release to pass the New York state censors. I also read that a DVD is "expected in 2006" and can only hope! If we are really lucky, we will include comparisons between the two versions. Note that the released censorship version was initially available on Laserdisc, which I saw. The Stanwyck rules!
