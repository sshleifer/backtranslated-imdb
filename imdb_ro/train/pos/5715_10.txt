Karen enters a Japanese home as a replacement for Emma, ​​a weird woman who sleeps during the day and wakes up at night. Karen goes upstairs when he hears noises when he encounters a frightening ghost. He'll learn the secrets of the house. It's very scary! The scenes are shocking and scary! Characters are good. The settings are terrible. I like the whole plot! The end was shocking! I stopped in a scene where the little boy had so infuriated the man who found his sister upstairs and I was shocked. This is the most frightening film I've ever watched. I did not see the Japanese version. I recommend this to horror fans. 10/10 and 5 stars!
