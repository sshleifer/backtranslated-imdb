I got this movie on Sundance Channel on cable after a late afternoon. You might say, "Who loves the sun" is a perfect fun for a story, why not. You've come up with the trio: Lukas Haas is Will (he's back after all he's all gone now), Molly Parker is Maggie (I've learned that he's a big part of the Bloom family), and Adam Scott is an enemy or a fianc√©e Daniel ), by the picturesque Lake Falcon, Manitoba, Canada, captured in graphic compositions juxtaposed in vivid summer colors against the sun and shadows. And supporting the trio are two more family members in the revealing mix: Wendy Crewson is mother Mary Bloom and R. Thomson is father Arthur Bloom. Writer-director Matt Bissonnette has made an ingenious deployment of the story line and its various tentacle linkages - do not worry, Haas might have a "blurred" face, but the humor will come when Parker and Scott enter the circle of friends reunions, breaking and knowing the delights mingle. Dialogues can be torn or even null, yet we will get the flavor of what is found, confused or wondered. Yes, "Who loves the sun" can be very well classified as a sleeping stone. Chemistry between all five principles provides gels and "combustions", giving a performance to the energy assembly. After all, it's all in the family and the movie is not taken seriously. It seems that the official site is still available at "wholovesthesun.com" and there is information about Mac McCaughan's soundtrack (Portastatic with guitar and string songs) where score fragments are played, and behind scenes production notes , interview with writer-director-producer Bissonnette on how came the film and the concept about casting and more. Always appreciate Molly Parker as her free performance yet Magnificent in 1996 Lynne Stopkewich's "Kissed", and she married Bissonnette, who "wrote the part of Maggie for Molly."
