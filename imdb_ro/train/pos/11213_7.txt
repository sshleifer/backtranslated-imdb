This second movie is just as exciting as the previous one, except there is no suspense. We know what he will do and what will happen before he is even cleared on the screen. Then pleasure comes only from the way the different tricks and their succession happen. We know there will be dynamite in the car, it will lose a wheel, the car will have an accident, just to talk about the car. And that's what's happening. Now the details and details are for you to discover them in the movie. For him to be beaten by a great woman is obvious and must come, but we know he has already seen through it and knows he is dragged into a trap. Now, how will you get out of it? This is what you have to discover yourself. And do not worry about getting the main smuggler, but what's another story. A speedboat does not match our busy castor on the river. We know when he's injured. They did not know what bulletproof vests were in those days. Lately, it has been discovered that some GIs did not have such equipment in Iraq. But what is the meaning of such a movie? This insistence on hunting traffickers and this blindness that does not see that the ban creates the problem. But the film is a constant and perfect illustration that has no value that can stand in the way of this moralist crusade against the forces of evil. Why not simply legalize these goods so they can be properly observed and supervised? When something is not illegal or pushed from the way it's less fun to use, do it. It is forbidden or restricted which is attractive. Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Dauphine University, Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne University and Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines University
