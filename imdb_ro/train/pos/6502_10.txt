Though too young to remember the first show of the series (being just a child), I later regained television at the end of the 80's even when I was interested in the war and all its aspects. My grandfather was the first to show me the series and also gave me the first interests related to the stories of his time in the National Marina in Malta and later in the Pacific. Since then I have devoured many books and have seen many TV series about the World War II era with mixed opinions. British TV stations are generally very good to produce, as can be seen at The World At War, with many stones made by both the BBC and independent companies. I strongly recommend titles such as "The Nazis - Warning in History", "Blitz" and the BBC series about Dunkirk. "The UK at War in Colors," with its accompanying series "Japan", "Germany" and "America" ​​are of a very high standard. The world at war is by far the best and, despite its age, never succeeds in delivering. There will always be new revelations about the war that will continue to cultivate, which obviously are not included in the series and, of course, the Second World War took place on a cloth so large that to produce a series with every detail it would take more time and money than any other, even if such a commitment was possible. What I think I have to say to those who say it does not include everything is that World At War can not physically make this a series, but surely the hell can urge you to do extra research - and make it enjoyable. That certainly worked for me: I now have a very comprehensive library of books, videos, DVDs and cassettes and CDs. Recommend to everyone who has an interest in passing. The series was so well made that it would be hard to disagree that it was quality and very informative programming.
