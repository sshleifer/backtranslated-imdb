my sister and I use to rent this every time we have movies and our parents would be so upset about it (but let us in any case) and I like ... I can not find anyone who lives next to me who knows what I'm talking about ... I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one who loved this movie ... I'd like to find this on DVD somewhere! I would love to watch this now bc I loved it so much like a little baby ... and now I'm 15 years old !!! I remember so much about this ... that's where I got the song fufu from the little bunny and all my friends know the song but not the movie! I think the little girl got there, sliding on the slider on her little playground
