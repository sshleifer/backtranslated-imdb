The first hour or so of the movie was mostly boring to say at least. However, it was further improved after the beginning of the Valentine's party. Aside from twisting the identity of the killer, the scene of the hot crime scene was one of the few relatively memorable aspects of this film. The garden scene with Kate was well shot and was the last scene ("twist"). In those scenes, there were some genuine suspense and emotions, and the hot crime scene had an ugly edge (as it should have been). The previous killing is frustrating by the lack of gore.
