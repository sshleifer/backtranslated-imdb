Intelligent, full of malice and thrilling, "The invisible man" was noted in 2000 as the regular composition of Sci-Fi, balancing the fantastic direction of "Farscape" art and sometimes the melodramatic scenario with cynical stones and modern noir dialogue. The show stood between "Law and Order" and "Doctor Who" on the credibility counter, but it was not denied that the characters "I-Man" overcame the caricature. Even characters that have come close to predictability, such as the Keeper, the Official and Eberts, have been postponed. Paul Ben-Victor and Vincent Ventresca had a chemistry that evolved and changed elegantly, becoming more remarkable by the team of doors rewritten by writers and directors. Effects are never allowed to overwhelm the plot, and science only sometimes comes down totally unbelievable. The low points of the show are still fun and we have never seen such pilot episodes. Matt Greenberg and Sci-Fi should be praised and fans have the right to request a comprehensive DVD edition of the show. Every time I encounter a "Hercules: Legendary Journey" marathon on Sci-Fi, I cast my eyes and sighs, weeping for the emotion and the fictitious television television posed by the "invisible man" and ilk.
