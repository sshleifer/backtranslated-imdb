A prequel for the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica series, from the same creative crew Ronald D. Moore and David Eick as well as the new co-creator of the series Remi Aubuchon. Caprica is in the twelve colonies 58 years before the events at Battlestar Galactica. The new series, alongside human drama, chronicles the essential steps in the development of what will become the Cylon race. The pilot and series are followed by two families; Graystone, who includes Daniel (Eric Stoltz), a computer genius and corporal tycoon, and Zoe's daughter (Alessandra Toreson) as brilliant but rebellious, while Adama includes a lawyer Joseph (Esai Morales) and his son his William the future Admiral of the Battlestar Galactica. Like the Battlestar Galactica, the series includes some experienced actors in Eric Stoltz, Esai Morales and Polly Walker, as well as some very talented actors, including Alessandra Toreson and Magda Apanowicz. <br /> <br /> For Battlestar Gallactica fans there are similarities and continuity with this series, but it is also very different. In the pilot, at least science-fiction items are certainly present, but they are smaller in this series. Scenes from Caprica, reflecting a more technologically advanced society, also have a retro feeling, this being done through architecture, costumes and the way it is shot. While the aspect of the two have substantial differences, some of the themes will seem very familiar, and religion is again very important here, while the racial theme rarely encountered in BG is much more important. We also reach out to terrorism the existence of a soul and whether a car can have a car or not, as well as crime and government issues. The pilot was released directly on the DVD in an extended space and unrated version before broadcasting on television, the show is set to begin in 2010. <br /> <br /> As the Battlestar Galactica, this series is filmed in Vancouver
