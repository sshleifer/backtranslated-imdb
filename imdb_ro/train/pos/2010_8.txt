I thought this movie was pretty good. Some parts were horns, but this is understandable because it was done more than 55 years ago. I thought the best interpretation in the film was given by Michele Morgan, who played Millie convincingly. Jack Haley is also very good like Mike O'Brien. Even though I'm not a big fan Frank Sinatra, I think he was very good in this movie. If you have a craving for stupidity over the top music comedy, Higher and Higher is the movie for you. <br /> <br />
