I just watched the movie for the third time and I enjoyed Lindsay Crouse and the rest of the cast as well as before. It's getting better and better. You simply have to lie to the carefully measured way of expression, to slow deliberate action, all right in its place. Really one of the best and surely my favorite all the time !!!
