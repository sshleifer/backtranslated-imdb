In the forties, when the movies reached aspects that were not yet admissible in the "polite" society, they turned to codes that supposedly floated above the head of most audiences while they ran those who knew exactly what had happened. Perhaps no one of the decade has been so overloaded with inconveniences, such as The Dark Desert Anger, set in a small oasis of gambling called Chuckawalla somewhere in the California desert. The owner of the Purple Sage salon and casino is amazing Mary Astor, in pants and with a cigarette holder; in the city she heads her daughter-in-law, Lizabeth Scott, searches Technicolor for $ 20 million. But listen to the dialogue between them, which suggests an older lesbian and a young and agitated partner (one can only ask if A. I. Bezzerides' original script made this relationship explicit). More obviously, John Hodiak is a gangster and Wendell Corey is his jealous torpedo. Add Burt Lancaster as the City Sheriff, mix and stay back. Both Lancaster and (surprisingly) Hodiak falls for Scott. It seems, however, that Hodiak has not only a past with Astor, but a wife who died in suspicious circumstances. The sun in the desert heats these ingredients up to a boiling temperature, with aplenty fa√ßade plates and shifts. Do not go through this melodrama of greenhouses, full of exotic scary flowers, if your path comes; is a remarkable movie.
