I think the idea of ​​the plot is perfect for exploring first of all the emotional experiences of the people involved and, secondly, as someone else wrote in a comment, the implications of this type of relationship (incest and lesbianism) in Romanian society. <br /> <br /> so ... to start with the second look ... to make it short, it was not at all visible ... <br /> <br /> as for the first .. as I said, had much more potential ... I think those relationships generate much more tension ... much more tension ... and the potential tension failed ... <br /> < br /> I think the soundtrack could have been more than those few songs in the background and the theme (which was nice but not enough and not always in the right times) ... yes ... I felt the absence of a better soundtrack .. actors ... I think they were somewhere from 7 to 8/10 ... not enough sensuality in key moments ... <br /> <br /> a total of 7/10 .. .. especially for the story
