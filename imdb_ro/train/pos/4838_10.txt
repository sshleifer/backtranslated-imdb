This movie reminded me that some old black and white films definitely deserve the look. Initially, I had a few reservations, but from the beginning of the movie to the end I was captivated. I was very impressed by the mix of drama, suspense and comedy. Arthur Askey (Tommy Gander) is HILARIU and has been in seams all the time. <br /> <br /> movie at night for a slight relief from sometimes depressing movies and "too" strong or too "funny" today.
