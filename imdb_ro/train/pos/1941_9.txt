Actually, I thought this was a comedy, and I was standing to see she was waiting to laugh my ass. soon enough, it became clear that it was not a comedy, or at least not a Jim Carrey guy. what we keep watching was the characters - the movie begins with some grumpy, troubled people, gathered to try to fight one of their basic fears - the fear of water, the fear of swimming. we begin to take them alive, to confess their troubles, to guess their thoughts. In fact, I made it look much darker than it is and, besides the event chain, I hope to live them. I probably would not have watched the movie if I had not known a comedy, but rather a drama, but I had good time, I enjoyed the story and I did not bother spending about 90 minutes with him. Many movies deal with the alienation of the people of the Western world, this film shows how people can gather together and help each other <br /> <br /> "and if in the light of the day of death you meet, do not let it go away and leave, do not lose it, it's your gift from the sun ...
