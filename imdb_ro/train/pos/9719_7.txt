Entering this movie, I heard good things about it. Coming from her, I was not amazed or disappointed. Simon Pegg plays a rather childlike character, similar to his other films. There were a few laughs here and there - nothing too funny. Probably my favorite parts of the movie are when they dance in the club scene. I have to try all the next time I find myself in a club. Some stars here and there, including: Megan Fox, Kirsten Dunst, that chicken from X-Files and Jeff Bridges. I realized it was fun enough to see Thandie Newton's cameo in a scene. Of course, being in a previous movie with Simon Pegg, Run Fatboy Run. I see it as a throw up, you will enjoy it to some extent or you will find it a little dull. I might add, Kirsten Dunst is adorable in this movie. : 3
