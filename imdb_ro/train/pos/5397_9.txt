Tenchu ​​aka. Hitokiri - directed by Hideo Gosha - with Shintaro Katsu and Tetsuya NAkadei belongs (along with Goyokin, HAra Kiri & Rebellion) to the best chambara films. The story of Shintaro Katsu (who plays Okada Izo) who works for Nakadei, who wants to become zimio. Okada, being "the cleanest" for Nakadei, is treated like a dog - and after a while he realizes - what really is for Nakadei. But there's a lot more in this movie - every fan of the Japanese cinema should have seen it !!!!!!! (Tenchu ​​means the punishment of heaven)
