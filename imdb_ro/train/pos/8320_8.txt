Farrah Fawcett spent most of his post-Angel career confusing us with spectacular, occasional performance between her Playboy sandwiches and Letterman escapades. But when it comes to her, there is no doubt that this girl can act. Far from a story of epic proportions, this well-done TV movie is gentle, quiet and occasionally on the move. Fawcett plays the black daughter of a black sheep who comes home only to find that she has missed the last days of her mother's life as well as the funeral, much until her sister's more stable and perhaps more sensitive. Brad Johnson plays the interest of love and a story unfolds with all the typical elements of telefilm drama - but then it always happens that Farrah will look at it, and indeed it remains eminent to watch. (And yes, I admit, I had the Farrah poster on the wall back when). Silk Hope gets three and a half (out of five) on Corkymeter. Bosley would be proud.
