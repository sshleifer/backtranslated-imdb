This film is based on the art of Frank Frazetta, the fantastic mythical illustrator. Some characters are directly from his paintings (the best example being the Death Dealer). Surprisingly, the animation manages to keep the feeling of original art. Bakshi is well known for the serious use of the rotoscope (the technique of watching a live action sequence) and this film is no exception. However, since the subject of the film is quite realistic (all the characters are people), this works pretty well. But what I really like here is the plot: for once we have a story with interesting characters and some beautiful action sequences, a really hideous bastard and a gorgeous babe. This movie has the feeling of the best Conan comic, not surprising, because Roy Thomas is the writer of the Marvel series of our favorite Cimmerian! This is a cry far away from concert live act Conan, not to mention all B-film genre. <br /> <br /> Definitely recommended!
