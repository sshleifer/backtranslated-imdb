Much more rich in texture and character than in classics from the 30s and 50s. George C. Scott was born to be Scrooge, as he was born to be Patton. Scott will be known as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century. Scrooge's character, played by Mr. Scott, seemed to jump off the screen. Scott as Scrooge brought a richer, more robust, but deeper scrooge screen than any of his predecessors in the role of the poorest 18th-century London man. Scott seemed to bring Scrooge to a more personal level, easier to understand, but very much in conflict; his role was acted upon by the great authority that Scott always brings to the screen: however, his usual bellicose voice would sometimes bring to a whisper, almost like a soliloquy, as he would celebrate the Christmas holiday in one breathing, but revealing its own human fragility in the next line. He could portray Scrooge sour and cruel, and a Scrooge understood and sympathetic throughout the scene. It's truly a remarkable performance by a giant of its generation.
