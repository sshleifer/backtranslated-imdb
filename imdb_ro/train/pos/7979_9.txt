Tony Scott can make good and bad movies, personally I think he can be a bit shiny and pulled, and his work obviously suffers compared to his famous brother, but this is probably the best movie his. /> What makes this movie so great is that Scott gives Denzel (in his hot form, better than Training Day) and the revelation of Dakota Fanning's time to develop a relationship of true warmth and sensitivity. Setting up is not absolutely boring, though it takes time - it involves and takes us on a small journey in characters - including a superb role for Radha Mitchell as a mother. All of this serves to make action much more effective, as we are so invited to the characters, for all their obvious weaknesses. This movie has you on the edge of its whole, and it does not get it to an end. The film would, of course, be nothing without Washington. I often wonder why he seems to get so many roles of duff when he is pretty clear that almost any leading man out there (I can only think of one, Daniel Day Lewis, who has more power on screen these days). This movie should have been huge, given the status and power of its performance as well as the quality of the film. It's just to show you that if a studio does not return a movie on the handle, it will go directly to the movie. I'd have the chance to see that on the big screen.
