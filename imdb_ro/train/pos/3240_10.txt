I found this movie by mistake many years ago and I wondered then (not yet) why she did not get the recognition she should have. Okay, written, beautiful, in an ironic twist after another, and it's placid about what the bad characters try. I would not recommend this movie to people with short attention; requires enough intelligence to understand that there may be a core of truth in this story.
