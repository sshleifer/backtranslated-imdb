When I first learned that Brian Krause will be in this movie, I wanted to watch. It took me weeks to realize I saw the original and I loved it. So I had more reasons to look. I looked. It was actually better than most sequels for TV movies. I hate what happens to Brian's character (you can find him alone), and I did not like most characters, including Brian. But the movie needed stunning and annoying characters and scorn, for Stanley Caldwell (Judd Nelson) to shine once again. Finally, I applauded Stanley and her own happy ending. If you liked the Original Cabin by Lake or if you like the bloodless horror films, I would suggest you look at this.
