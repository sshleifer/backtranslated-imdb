"Once in a lifetime" is a very good movie. However, it is not good for everyone, due to the extensive use of vulgar language and violence in some situations. The film manages to represent anecdotally, credibly "life" in New York neighborhoods, where drug issues are important. This image is, in turn, used as a decoration for a very careful and sustained drama supported by strong dialogues (however, I have had difficulty in understanding some of them because English is not my mother tongue.) There is sometimes overlap, but I think it fits pretty well with the general orientation that Fishburne gave to the film, which gives reflection to matter rather than being a good style exercise, especially in time / action management. <br /> <br /> The characters, though not simple, are easily understandable and the actors do a good job to share them. By the way, I enjoyed the soundtrack (B. Marsalis) .If you are not too cautious, you should enjoy watching that movie once, times, three times. I've rated 9/10.
