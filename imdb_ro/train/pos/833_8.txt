First, let me say that the director has a wonderful use of titles in making photos. I really liked it. I really enjoyed this movie, but I have to say that alongside Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinear is pretty stupid. Brosnan melts so well in this character that it is very hard to remember that he is the same guy who has played. He also shows his range and depth of actor. It's kind of indie and it's been great to see especially with all the mainstream movies flooding the movies at this time of the year. I found the characters to be well done. The twisting in the middle I felt was especially good. I also liked the way the characters turn off realistically. We often have these cartoons of people who are not really characters, but stereotypes of walking ... I like the different approaches that this film takes. I think sideways when I think about this movie, but I think this is more visible and a better movie ...
