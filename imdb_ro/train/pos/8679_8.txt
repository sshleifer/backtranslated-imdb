If you are a fan, then you will probably enjoy it. If you do not know who Misty Mundae, Darian Caine, Ruby LaRocca or Seduction Cinema are, this is not the movie to get started. It's very cute, bad, the girls are hot and it's fun to look. There's no sex till the end of the 45-minute movie, but the scoring is scary and the plot is not a total boredom. Misty Mundae's makeup is bad in this movie and her hair is in awkward ribbons, so she's not as hot as she was in the other. But her pants are pretty nice (you just have to watch the movie so it does not sound very strange). If you like this, you'll probably enjoy the "70 Years Girl," "Vampire Vixens," or "Erotic Survivor" (which is a bit sexual sex). If you prefer to watch Misty or Esmerelda in less sexual, horrific / exploitable (but lower budget) movies, check the Factory 2000 Web site.
