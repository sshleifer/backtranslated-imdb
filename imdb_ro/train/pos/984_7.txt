I walked along the "Bait" on the cable one night, just as he started and thought, "Eh, why not?" I'm glad I gave her a chance. <br /> <br /> "The bait" is not perfect. It suffers from unnecessary directions and unusual food. But, in general, this movie worked. All the elements aligned to the right and withdrew what otherwise could have been a rather ugly film. <br /> <br /> Most of these, I think, are due to Jamie Foxx. I do not know who tagged Foxx for the lead, but whoever has made this film a great favor. Credibly and amazingly enjoyable, Foxx glides through the film, smooth as butter, and more fun than hell. You can say he works instinctively and the instinct does not fail. The plot, though inconsequential, actually binds quite well and there is even a character arc through which the character of Foxx grows as a person. Again, it could have slipped without such a thing, but it only makes things much better. I'm surprised by the low rating for this. Maybe we just got this move on the right night or the other way round, but I'd give it a 7/10. Bravo, Msr. Foxx.
