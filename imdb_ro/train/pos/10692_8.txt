Nice, funny and simple storytelling, excellent Nicole Kidman (I almost always like the movies they are in). This was a good "vehicle" for someone adept at comedy and drama, as there are elements of both. A romantic comedy wrapped around two crime stories, large closing lines. Chaplin, very good here, was also good in another good, but unpopular romantic comedy ("The Truth About Cats and Dogs"). Maybe they are too implausible. Ebert did not even make a review for this. The big comedies with "screwdrivers" were obviously totally implausible ("Bringing the Child", etc.). If you saw an implausible comedy, did you see them all? Or maybe people are ready to go through the 1930s. Strange. Birthday is a movie I enjoyed several times. Nicole Kidman may be the "killer" app for the home movie.
