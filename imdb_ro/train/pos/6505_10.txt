Theo Robertson commented that the WAW did not adequately cover the conditions after the First World War that led to the rise of Hitler and the Second World War. Perhaps he lost the first ONE and a quarter of a second of volume 8? It covers this period, and along with previous volumes in the series, clearly shows the existing conditions, I feel. A friend of mine grew up in Germany during this period, even joined the Youth of Hitler, and his experiences were very similar to those mentioned in the WAW. This documentary is so far from the documentary of the Channel History, also own, that there is no comparison. The only fault, and it's a small one I have with WAW is this: numbers are not included, many times. For example, if we talk about the loan, then how much was the loan material borrowed / rented? How much for Russia, how much for Britian? How many commercial ships did the U-Boats sink and when? How many ships had the German or Japanese army in total in 1941? What kind were they? How many troops? How many allies have the allies made, in total, and by country? A lot of numbers could have made many viewers give up, but I would have preferred MORE! And, of course, I always want to see more military analyzes. Why did not Patton & Clark capture the German army at Cassini after they surrounded him, instead of accompanying Monty to Rome and letting him escape? I do not think you can begin to understand the war until you've seen some of these video segments about the "total war", such as the Dresden fire bomber. It's like trying to understand Auschwitz, etc. Before you see the videos of the death camps: you just can not wrap your head around it - it's too unbelievable. were the worst cruelty and inhumanity of the Japanese, including cannibalism (read "Flyboys"), and a LIVE viviseion of "experienced" medical prisoners without any anesthetics! <br /> <br /> Dave
