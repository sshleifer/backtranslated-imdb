In 2151, in Broken Bow, Oklahoma, a farmer shoots Klingon Klaang with his plasma rifle after the explosion of a methane store in his farm, and the Klingon is sent to Fleet Hospital. Ambassador Vulcan Soval proposes to disconnect the life support system and to bring Klaang's body to his war empire from the planet Kronos. However, Captain Jonathan Archer proposes to go with Enterprise on his first trip and bring Klaang back to life on his home planet. Jonathan invites Ensign Hoshi Sato and Dr. Phlox, who deals with Klaang, to fill his crew, and Subcommander Vulcan T'Pol is assigned to participate in the Enterprise's first dangerous mission. When the ship's ship is closed, Klaang is kidnapped by the Sulibans after a shot in the hospital. After Suliban's autopsy shot killed, Captain Archer is informed by Phlox that the alien was actually a mutant, altered in a sophisticated genetic engineering process. T'Pol modifies the sensors of the enterprise to track the Suliban spacecraft until it reaches Riger X. They investigate and reveal that Klaang was a courier, bringing an important message about the Temporary Cold War from Suliban Sarin to Klingon leaders in Kronos. Despite the fact that he was a big fan of Star Trek, I did not watch the "Enterprise" episodes on cable television. I decided to buy the DVD of the first season and this first episode surprised me. The adventure of the First Enterprise, Captain Jonathan Archer, the super T'Pol, Reed, Mayweather, Dr. Phlox, Hoshi and Trip are excellent, at least in this pilot. I noticed in IMDb that this episode is actually divided into two parts, but on DVD they are only one, therefore my review is valid for both. I did not like the musical theme, which I found very annoying, but that was an exception in this great show. My vote is new. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Broken Bow"
