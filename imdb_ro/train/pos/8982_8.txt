Hell, it was a lot to get. I was pretty fascinated all the time. It was pretty perfect, though I would say that editing has a lot to do with it. I can not believe this guy stayed in good condition with many of them (Anton especially) to get all these records without any serious beef. Dandy's got along well, middle-class kids who took advantage of their situation (and rightly so!). I felt sorry for Jonestown and especially for Anton, which may not have been what a lot of other people felt. A great piece of film and a wide variety of subjects. I recommend this to any music / movie fan. You'll probably find out something about film shooting.
