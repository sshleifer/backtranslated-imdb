The film revolves around a man who believes that all forms of media are outdated. The idea behind his art project is to discover the ridiculous culture we are swimming in. Of course, the movie takes place in Los Angeles / Orange County. He attacks the comic strips (caw, caw, caw), rock bands, models, Hollywood blockbuster movies, and touches on many other environments. Eventually, he is in the sight of the weapon he has set in motion. The film is five years old and the rings are more real every day. It's the best description of post-punk fury we've ever seen. It's also one of my first 10 favorite movies.
