One of those beautiful intense movies that draws us so intimately that it's over soon! Then they looked at the screen as "They did not!" Lol. Good performance everywhere! The actress is great with Emily Blunt just remarkable! I knew it would provide solid and convincing performance through the admiration of Victoria's virility, temperament and vulnerability through the whole film. Production is remarkable in every respect: style, substance and sensitivity. A remarkable look at a remarkable moment in Britian's history narrated through a very personal and moving biography of the school-age princess, until her reign as Queen, after which she married later with Prince Albert, rather than ending with the birth their first child. He had a well-written script and impeccable editing. Rupert's friend, as the young man so patient and compassionate, Prince Albert, who struggled to win the attention of the young queen, than to secure his love before Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany), cared to look. Just as it was the relationship between adolescent Victoria and her mother, who was sometimes anger, just like her mother and King William (who also did not like the mother). The actors and scenes were exciting, very emotional. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this to anyone interested in the historical and political situation existing at that time, and indeed, anyone who loves a true story
