I saw this movie again and I noticed how close it is to the novel if we ignore the part about Cary's childhood [Leslie Howard]. Considering that at that time we can not see much on the screen, [not that there is much in the novel] the character's obsession with Mildred [Bette Davis] is very well communicated to the public. I recommend this movie to anyone who has ever fallen for another person, and the other side has tried to take advantage of him or her. I read that Maugham was asked to make a record of the selling novel, but when he started studying, he began to cry and could not finish more than a few rows, and the whole project was chucked. It can be said that the novel is written from the heart, and the film is a good adaptation of a part of it at least.
