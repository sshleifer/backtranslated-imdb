This could be a 10 if it was not a fairly predictable and Hollywood scenario. Daniel Day-Lewis confirms his position as one of the most important actors of our time (why can not ask for leadership) and the rest of the casting station at a very high level. I personally was impressed by Hugh O'Connor who played Christy Brown as a child. The first scene I looked at was very strong. Wow.
