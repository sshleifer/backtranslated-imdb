This movie is amazing and I would recommend it to both the child and the adult. The animation is beautiful, the characters are rich and interesting, and the story is exciting; much better than any American studios were producing at that time. However, there are some reservations to this statement. It is a shame that Disney bought the Ghibli studio catalog and then grinded it. My main point, Disney has re-named the film, despite its original English version, being very impressive. The new cast with Van Der Beek and others has destroyed it and has made much of the character's attractiveness, Pazu and Sheeta have gone from adventurous adolescents to teenagers. The original music score is also much better than the Disney remix. The question is why did these Disney changes? It seems to me that by distributing Van Der Beek and others, then Disney can attract more money, which is quite fair, but during the process they affected the film. It's still a beautiful movie and I would recommend it to anyone. My main beef is that Disney has ruined a childhood movie I loved and still love. I'm pretty lucky to have an original Japanese import with the original English version that I will keep with my life now!
