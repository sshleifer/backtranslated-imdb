this was one of the most entertaining and informative shows I've ever seen. This is a MUST to see for someone over the age of 16. This show had me and the two boys who laughed out loud at the beginning. I do not know if everything was true, but the way it was presented did not cast doubt on the fact that Mr. Wuhl was not only very well informed, but also had an explosion presenting this information to the children from the very lucky colleagues who were present. If Mr. Wuhl ever decides to recreate this format, he will have to rent a Georgia-sized building to keep all the people who want to see it. I agree with the idea of ​​doing this an HBO series. It would be an amazing trace
