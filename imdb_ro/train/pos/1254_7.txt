Ed Harris's production in this film is a standard of excellence, that is, he steals the screen away from anyone he shares with, and it includes the formidable Sean Connery. The film, which is more than a saint, only lives in scenes when Harris is interrogated by a lawyer for another convict. She is breathtaking, a master class in artistic control. The other cast members are all followers and Connery is trustworthy, as is Fishbourne, but the story itself is not packing. The ground largely depends on the premise that a black prisoner will always be maltreated and forced by white law enforcement officers. This is the driving story, good or wrong, and makes you feel a cheating tad at the end. Still, it's worth watching you see Harris in action.
