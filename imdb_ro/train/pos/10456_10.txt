This movie is not related to the entertainment or even a movie you want to watch over time. This movie is a real show of true love that can only come from God. You can only help yourself deeply by watching this movie. We have some dimensions of love that contribute to the value of this movie. There is the divine love of God, which is beautifully portrayed. God's love transcends heart and mind and endures and is eternal. There is love in a marriage. While the main character struggles with his wife's illness, he realizes through the love of God that he loves his wife more than he could ever imagine. He knows that he and his wife are one and can never be separated. Finally, you have the love of child and parent. Family children meet and realize that nothing else matters except that love conquers fear. Dear friends, love is not love unless it comes from God, because God is love and love comes from God. Talk to someone and tell them you love them. Love is not good unless it is given to others. I pray that this film can inspire and change the life of anyone who sees it. Amen!!
