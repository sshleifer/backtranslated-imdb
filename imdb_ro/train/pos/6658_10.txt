Mahatma was described as a man who neglected his own son in this film. Do not get me wrong that I do not condemn the movie; is a great movie and came out of the cinema with a piece in his throat. We must understand the spiritual position of Mahatma, he is a true spiritual leader. Only a fully enlightened man can detach himself from his loved ones. A man of such caliber leads his family and descendants by example. According to the film, he spoke with his son and tried to make him understand where he came from, but the poor Harilall with so little intellect could not understand his father. When things went wrong with Harilall, Mahatma could stay calm and accepted that his son was a great tragedy. <br /> <br /> If there were any other parents, they would compromise their values ​​to help the son stand up. Mahatma did not do that, he is a true leader leading through the example.
