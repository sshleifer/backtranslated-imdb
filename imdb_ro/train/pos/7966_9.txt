As a child I thought this movie was great. He had animals, he had beautiful music and he had my favorite actor: Michael J. Fox. Now, I still love this movie, for various reasons. She has well trained animals that are put through various stunts and scenes that look great on the room. It has beautiful, well-written music that fits perfectly with the scene, with fast-paced songs and the main theme that makes me cry. Even when people are humming. And he has my favorite actor, Michael J. Fox. <br /> <br /> Based on a book, this is the story of three homemade houses, a smart, over-confident and considerably patented lab, called Shadow, a cat wise and in vain, but still intelligent, with the fear of water called Sassy and a clever and curious nebulous street bulldog, Chance. The three are taken to a friend's farm when their family disappears. Extinct and worried, pets start and plan a trip to the Sierra Mountains for the journey of their lives. A truly incredible journey. So maybe it's home over that mountain. But if it is not? <br /> <br /> I suggest Homeward Bound for people who like the three amazing actors who offer the voices for lead characters, and for everyone else ... yes, everyone is going to look at it.
