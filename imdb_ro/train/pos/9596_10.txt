This film documents a transforming experience for a group of young people, and the experience of the viewer is transformative for the spectator. Few films even aspire to this level of transcendence, and I can not think of any other film - documentary or drama - that does it. There is no other movie in which I laughed so much and we cried so much. Yes, it's about DMD and affordable travel; Only on these issues is a valuable business, but there is more. It's about friendship. It's about life itself, living every day that you're alive. And it is an extraordinary, entertaining and adventurous narrative. That's why God created cinema! View this movie!
