When I started looking at "Fay Grim," I had no idea it was a sequel to Henry Fool. Now, the latter was not a movie I imagined as having a sequel. But someone has arrived and is pretty good. I suppose you saw the original, so I will not explain it. This starts with Fay (Parker Posey) who lives with her son, with old Henry (Thomas Jay Ryan). Simon (James Urbaniak) is still in jail. One day the son is expelled because he brought a pornographic toy to school. But this is not an ordinary toy. It has a secret that explains much of what happened in the first movie. And this secret goes deeper into geopolitics than "Syriana." I have to say that I am quite impressed with what Hal Hartley did here. Perhaps it does not reach the quality of the original, but certainly has a good look at what is happening in the world. And the end leaves open another possibility. He also plays Jeff Goldblum.
