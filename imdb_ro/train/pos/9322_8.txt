I'm glad someone made a movie about how hard it is to risk your heart a second time. Or the third. This movie is exactly what it promises to be - wonderful, funny and gives you this good feeling around your heart when it's over. The story may not be very inventive, but there are millions of ways to tell the story and have not been used yet. The cast is perfectly selected, although Scott Wolf does not look like a father for eight years even when wearing a suit. So the sparks are in all the right places, the support of the distribution is boldly supported, and although you probably could predict the whole movie you would not want to change. It's just kind of entertainment for a Sunday night.
