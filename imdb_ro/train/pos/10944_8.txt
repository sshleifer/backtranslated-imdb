The Sarah Silverman program is ... better than the other shows. There are no laughs, painful jokes, just one program. The Sarah Silverman program. If you are like me, and you like the comedy, this is probably a show for you. Sarah Silverman brings fun and even funny to the table with ease. A mixture of different styles, which makes it your own initiative. This program is not something you want to start a comparative war, seeing how it has nothing to do with it (other shows). This performance is an entity of its own, and I think most of the comedy heads will love it very well. Go watch and see.
