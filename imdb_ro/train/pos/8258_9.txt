At the risk of sounding slightly sacrilegious at the first view, I'm a bit inclined to put it like "Shaun of the Dead". Now that I consider Simon Pegg to be an incontestable genius of comedy, I realize that is a pretty big statement. And to what extent do you agree with that last statement can be a good preliminary indicator if "Fido" will appeal to you. In a way, the comedy takes over where "Shaun" is left, except that we are returning to the 1950s stereotypical American city of ancient origin. The zombie wars are over, and the zombies themselves are getting better and better adjusted , members of the community. This, so we are informed from the beginning, is largely due to the scientific advances made by the good people at Zomcom - a nice piece about the romantic comedy, maybe? <br /> <br /> The beauty of the film lies in the image of dead-pan of a respectable neighborhood that maintains the fundamental values ​​while making a place for zombies and the special dangers they pose. The charm and balance with which it is doing is almost perfect. The themes you could expect from a more traditional kitsch comedy, through which a pure pleasure, appearances, repressed emotion, parental values, social décor, and the situation of the alienated individuals unfold. a story told with a happy heart and amazingly appealing, brought to life alive by the strong distribution of the film. It is one of those works in which it really shows by the fact that all those involved took a blow to take part. It's also fun to imagine what Billy Connelly learned his script should have been like ... So, in conclusion, you're likely to appreciate the humor of this movie if your dad did not tried to eat you.
