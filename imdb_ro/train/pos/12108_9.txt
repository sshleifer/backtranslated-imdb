Yakitori! Ja-pan (translated as fresh Japanese bread) is the story of a young man named Azuma Kazuma and his journey to make perfect Japanese bread or Ja-pan for Japan, and for the Japanese, which will be recognized throughout the world. Of course, that's just outside. In fact, Yakitate! The pan is not really about the bread, but about the reaction that comes after eating the bread and about the mouth that comes with the reaction. The series is full of love because of these words. From popular anime titles such as Naruto, Detective Conan and Dragon Ball to successful films such as The Matrix and Lord of the Rings. It's all there is. So, what makes this title different from other titles of the same genre, such as Cooking Master Boy or Mr. Ajikko? Well, unlike the others who use cooking for world domination, Yakitate! Ja-pan is a pure comedy. Sure, there are times when the story turns into drama or even murder, but the comedy atmosphere makes you laugh at them. You will laugh at your own view of the sky. Just remember that this is fiction even though part of the bread made here is based on real bread, eating home made Japan # 2 will not turn you into a Super Saiyan or turn the body into rubber.
