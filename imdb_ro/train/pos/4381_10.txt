This massive drama has everything: a top act, an incredible picture, a good story. It is often compared to "Braveheart," because both films take place in historic Scotland. Even if I love Braveheart, I think this is the best of the two movies. Jessica Lange gave incredible performance (she should have been nominated for the Oscar). Liam Neeson is fantastic in the lead role. Tim Roth plays one of the worst and worst characters in the history of the film (he was nominated for Oscar). John Hurt is excellent as Mr. Montrose, another desperate character. I am always amazed by the incredible range of characters John Hurt can play. This is a story about a money dispute between Rob Roy and his clan and Lord Montrose. Rob Roy is a self-standing man who will not solve his problems with Montrose if he violates his sense of honor. Montrose, who inherited his title, has no sense of honor. And, in essence, this is the story; Honor of the common man to the corruption of the nobility. This movie is very fun, should appeal to all. It has romanticism, action, beautiful landscapes and has an interesting plot. One of my favorite movies.
