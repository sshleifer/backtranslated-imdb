Rated R for powerful language, violent content and nudity. Quebec Rating: 13+ Canadian Home Video Rating: 14A <br /> <br /> The fear of a Black Hat is one of the funniest, most original comedies I've ever seen. It's basically a rap gangsta version of This Is Spinal It's a shame, not many people have heard of this gem of a movie. If you can find this movie anywhere, do not hesitate to buy it even if you do not like rap music. There are not many comedy films that give me a perfect 10/10. The only ones that I can think of are the movie, Clerks, The World According to Garp, 40-year-old Virgo and Chasing Amy. This movie is a hilarious stereotype of the rap gangsta movie is about a woman named Nina Blackburn, who makes a documentary about the NWH fictional rap group (N **** z with hats). These are essentially the stereotype of a rap group, making many songs of controversial rap about killing and being a gangsta. Fear Of A Black Hat is a great comedy movie and I recommend it, even if you are not a fan of rap gangsta scene. It's a shame this movie is not in the top 250. <br /> <br /> Runtime: 88min <br /> <br /> 10/10
