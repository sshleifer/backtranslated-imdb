Coming back from this accidentally, it was behind the movie box of what I thought we were renting, I did not know until I got home, I saw it anyway. Absolutely fantastic! a wonderful movie and one of my favorite favorites of all time, I recommend everyone! The story is enjoyable and easy to follow, this could have been a little confusing, but the actors and the director do a good job of keeping together. <br /> <br /> The actors themselves are fantastic, who have a wonderful character and do a great job. <br /> <br /> You need to find a copy somewhere ...........
