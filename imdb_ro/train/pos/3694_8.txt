He was not sure what to expect from this film, given his amazing collection of stars and directors, but eventually he did not disappoint. For me, one of the most important moments was the last episode of American tourism talking with a terrible French accent (which made me feel better about myself), which was actually quite moving and a great way to close the movie. The story of the paramedic and stabbed victim was also very moving for pure comedy, the Coen brothers and Steve Buscemi taking the prize. The Tom Tykwer video was also impressive, though quite ambitious in its scope. However, the Bob Hoskins segment was totally reasonable and the vampire story was completely afraid. The dialogue in Wes Craven's section felt very hard, and the story in Chinatown was completely incomprehensible. Generally, this movie is worth looking for good bits and has a strong finish. It's not too painful to stay in bad sections - it only takes 5 minutes anyway. I watched at the feast !!!
