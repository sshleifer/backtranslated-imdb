It was great. Touch, action-packed and perfect for Kurt Russel. I liked this movie, it's worth more than 5.3 or more stars. This film is the story of an old soldier who learns that there is more to life than the soldier and people who learn that there is a time to fight, a need for defense. I cried, laughed, and especially I looked at this story. Good work written for an action move, and the plot was right and pretty solid. The end was not overturned, but it was still excellent. If you like to escape from New York, or get rooted for subordinates, this movie is for you. It was not an unnecessary amount of gore or violence, it was not hard to look at that. Something for everyone.
