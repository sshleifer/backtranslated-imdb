Piece of subtle art. Maybe a masterpiece. Undoubtedly a special story about the ambiguity of existence. Kafka-style story about the impossibility of victory or survival in a perpetual strange world. Life is, in this film, just the adaptation exercise. The lesson about limitations and original sin, about the fragility of innocence and the errors of its paths. Leopold Kessle is another Joseph K. Images of the Trial and the same ambiguous woman. Europe is a symbol of the basic crisis, which has many aspects, such as the chimeric wars or the truthless / questing of the truth / essence / golden age. The metaphor or parable, the film is the history of disappointed evolution. War, peace, business or lie are just details about the time of gelatin. Hypocrisy is a mask. Love - a convention. The only method for sacrifice to hope to understand a painful reality.
