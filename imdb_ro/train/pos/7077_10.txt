One of the best science fiction movies, all the time, is visionary and challenging as Blade Runner or even Gilliam's Brazil. Willis performs the best here but is overtaken by Pitt's incredibly frenetic tower that does not resemble anything he has done before or since. Even Stowe does not get out of her league here. The story is very layered and offers quite a lot of thought. The climatic scene is magnificent, and the last lines fit perfectly. Scenes from the mental hospital are terrifying and yet so funny in their way. A lot of humor on the screen. Fantastic production design and bizarre cinema. In the top ten.
