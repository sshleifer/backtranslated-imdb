Miike makes an adventure film for children, not unlike the Unfortunate Story. It is actually one of the least favored in the director's films. Even the worst Miike is better than many good movies, but the Great Yokai War also has many things worth recommending. It's at least as bad and unpleasant as most American children's filming. I may think the kids themselves would find much to please (the DVD includes a double English), but like all Miike's films, it may tend to move very slowly. This means you have some kind of strange inequality, where sometimes there is a strong action sequence and the next scene will shoot forever as the characters speak. The story is not very good, and Miike's perpetual failure of incoherence raises his head ugly. Most of what I liked came from the technical side of things. This must be Miike's most expensive movie and looks fantastic. "Yokai" are Japanese spirits, and come in all different shapes, fantastic, and costume designers, crew of special effects and all the others involved in designs have done a remarkable job. I've seen the Yokai Monsters: Spook Warfare movie in 1968, and the rubber costume monsters you can find have been transformed into more credible creatures with cutting-edge makeup and special effects. Especially I liked the appearance of one of the bad guys (or girls in this case), Agi, who had a dark shadow on his eyes, a bright white dress, a white whimsical hair and a whip. She played incidentally by Chiaki Kuriyama, whom you could remember as Henry Liu in the role of Kill Bill: Vol. 1. The film's hero is played by Ryunosuke Kamiki, who offered voices to Miyazaki's Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle.
