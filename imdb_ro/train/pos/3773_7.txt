Bill and Ted have returned, only this time a bad guy in the future sent a bad Bill and Ted to destroy them, destroying the "Wyld Armies" and the basis for human society in the future. This time, Bill and Ted have to travel through the life of "Total Bogus" and save the "Excellent" mankind. With much of the same humor zany and some wonderful new characters, such as the grueling reaper, the station and robot Bill and Ted (creating the posts), Bogus Journey is once again entertained and worth watching just for the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The party on the guys! hehe
