and anyone who watches this movie will agree. This film was directed in the days when the plot, the credibility character and the theme really had importance. Jean Peters, Widmark and Thelma Ritter steal the spotlight. Ritter is in top form as an informant "Moe" she survives in the Bowery section of NY, which acts as a stall dove for the New York police. The only other movie we've seen Peters is "Niagara," and she certainly proves her ability to act here, complemented by the Brooklyn accent. Widmark is properly threatening, as an anti-hero who has to discern what is good, despite his need for money. The photo is brilliant. Neon, metro station (though it looks cleaner than the real thing), the port where Widmark lives as a transitory. The city is very well used, with Chinatown's "Lightning Louie"; the many flavors and appetites of the city are addressed here; the political climate of time is a bizarre background. 10/10.
