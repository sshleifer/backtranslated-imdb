Here's a favorite cartoon drawing of Tom & Jerry, perfect for Halloween. I know he does not have much rage, but he has the trick as Trick or Treat, as Jerry did to Tom with the blind window and the vacuum cleaner with a shirt hung on her to make her a ghost; but I like to put it on the Halloween cartoon list. In this short, Tom listens to "Witching Time", a ghostly radio story program, horrified by the horror story he was told. Halfway down the road, dramas (standing hair, low heart, chills on the spine) start to happen to Tom. . . literally. And Jerry noticed everything and laughed at himself, believing that Tom feared more, scaring him. I like the end, it was a bit funny. And you know, this short is the first of four cartoons in which Tom attacks Mammy Two Shoes; the rest being the Lone Mouse, the Home Mouse and Nit-Witty's Kit. And also This short is the first of twenty-five cartoons where Tom speaks. The others are the Lone Mouse, Cat Zoot, Million Dollar Cat, Bodyguard, Mouse Problems, Mouse Comes to Dinner, Quietly Please, Happy Trap, Solid Serenade, Mouse Cleaning, Texas Tom, Mucho Mouse and Cat Above and the mouse below directed by Chuck Jones.
