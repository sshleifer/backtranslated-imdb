Made in 1946 and released in 1948, The Lady and Shanghai was one of the great films made by Welles after returning from relative exile to make Citizen Kane. Darkness, the defeat and the paranoia of the cold war since the beginning of the Cold War, this film is tall as a criminal-noir movie. The cinematography of this film is full of the strange strange features of Welles of strange angles, fast cuts, long pans and sinister enlightenment. Using ambient street music is a precursor of incredible long-lasting shooting in Touch of Evil, and mysterious Chinese characters and Chinatown sequences can only be considered as inspiration in many respects at Roman Polanski's Chinatown. Unfortunately, Welles' obsession with the technical movie that hurts this movie entirely. The story of this story is often lost after a sometimes incomprehensible agglomeration of film techniques. Still, despite this criticism, the story combined with Welles' great shows, Hayworth and, in particular, Glenn Anders (Laughter) do that, you're filming a joy to watch. Orson Welles pulls out not only the Irish brochure, but the identities torn like the honest but dangerous sailor. Rita Hayworth, married to Welles at the time, breaks routine as a sexual goddess and assumes a role of real depth and contradiction. Finally, the strange and bizarre portrait of Glenn Anders or Elsa's spouse's law partner is nothing more than a classic!
