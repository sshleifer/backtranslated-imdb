this movie is great. a kind of. she dosent really says a lot, or does a lot, but it's a great movie to watch because of how stupid it is. high school is taken over by evil ms.togar who hates a thing that all students love, rock & roll. riff randle takes all the tickets for the ramones show, and this peak movie with a take over of the school led my riff randle & ramones. this movie has everything, a bad scenario, a questionable direction, bad actors (such as clint howard & pj soles), a wonderful soundtrack, extreme campyness, these elements and many others come together to do what it is, a classic . > <br /> Note - During the live set of ramones, you notice that the collapse of germs is in front of the crowd. clean it.
