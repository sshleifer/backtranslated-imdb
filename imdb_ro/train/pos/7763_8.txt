One thing about Hollywood, someone is successful and it's always urgent to be copied. And something else is that players give some of the best performances from their home studio. Rock Hudson received such awards for his performance in the Texas film that the Giant used, that the Universal Directors must have believed in another modern Texas way. Similarly, Robert Stack received wonderful reviews for The High and Mighty as a pilot who was cracked under the strain to fly a damaged aircraft that is normal to give him another crack up. <br /> <br /> Both ends were written in the wind. Before Hudson was the owner of the big farm, he is now the son of Robert Stack's father's hunter who led Hudson under his wing. In other words, the part of James Dean without the racism of James Dean from Giant. <br /> <br /> Lauren Bacall is the executive secretary of an advertiser using Hadley Oil at Stack. Hudson likes it, but he's amazed by Stack's millions, and when he's a girl, he has the means to run a campaign. She marries Stack. And last but not least, we have Dorothy Malone, Stack's amoral sister who has a yen for Rock, but Rock is not about to mess with this wild child. <br /> <br /> Dorothy Malone spent more than 10 years in a heroine cast of colorless film before landing this jewel. She won a Best Supporting Actress Award for her role as Marilyn Hadley and was well worth it. If you like Fifties technical soap, this is the movie for you.
