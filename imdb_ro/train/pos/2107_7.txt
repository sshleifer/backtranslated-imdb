I recently bought this movie with a lot of other LaserDiscs on eBay. I'm usually in war and action movies, but occasionally I enjoy romantic comedies. If you're bored with FX specials today and high-gloss romantic comedies, you should check out Shop Outround Corner on a quiet evening. What I like about the movie is that the characters have a lot of decency. There is nothing false or pretentious about them. Take Mr. Matuschek, for example: When he finds out that his wife is cheating on him with one of his employees, he tries to shoot himself. Not just because of humiliation, but because he was unfair with Stewart's character. (OK, the tired example) <br /> <br /> Yes, the focus of the film is narrow and the plot is predictable. And yet, I really enjoyed it. If you like Notting Hill then you'll love the corner shop. in fact, Hugh Grant reminds me a lot of Jimmy Stewart.
