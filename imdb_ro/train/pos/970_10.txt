Now, I've seen a lot of movies in my days, but each of them was a very small number that I was very good at. And I am a 19-year-old man who is impressed by this movie directed to a smaller audience. This is a greatly underestimated gem for those watching foreign movies. Almost all the acting is credible, the charts are decent (for which you will not even care when watching the movie. Believe me, the beating about graphics would be a stupid thing to do), the story is well written and it's a movie that all the world can enjoy not only children. That's what this movie made me do. It was one, made me laugh ... a lot, two, made me feel for the characters you should do, and three, it's a very uplifting story. By the end of this movie you will feel good. Sure, in what anime there was no child presented to turn into a great warrior and anything to defeat a great evil. It is a formula that is very much used. But in this case it is forgiving because, although they use puppets for some characters and for an average graphics that you will see 5 years ago, the appearance is not to be judged. It's very moving, the end is original, and keeps you in the movie as if it were. If you try to compare this to other films like the "Never Ending Story" or anything else will differ from you. Just look what it is and you'll enjoy it. It was a good time since I was so impressed. The only movie I felt about this feeling is when I saw the way TMNT came out when it came out. There is something about this movie I felt about TMNT, which made me like it. So do not over-analyze or take this movie too seriously, just enjoy it.
