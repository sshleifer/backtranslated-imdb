A perfect example of "Less Is More ..." Kurt Russell (Sgt. Todd) has only 72 lines and something like 104 words. What a challenge! As a black and white photograph, when the eye of the mind has to fill the voids, face expressions, physical drama, emotional gesture, all combine to have a stronger impact. This is one of the top 5 movies I can not live with, with classics such as Road Warrior. If you liked it, check out Mad Max 2, The Road Warrior and Braveheart with Mel Gibson. Also, "Gladiator" with Russell Crowe and Connie Nielsen who was also in the Soldier. "The Thirteenth Warrior" with Antonio Banderas and "Blade Runner" with Harrison Ford.
