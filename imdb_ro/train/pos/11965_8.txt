Reading a wide variety of "Scoop" reviews over the last few days, I entered the theater prepared for a trip from Woody. Luckily, I could not have been worse. Granted, artist Woody slows a touch or two, but writer / director Woody is in good shape - and he has found a credible way to integrate his 70-year-old self into the story. Judging by laughter and stutter, the audience ate Allen's tools and dialogue in a way I have not seen before for a few years. <br /> <br /> In a film landscape dominated by software-approved stories, twenty-year-old tastes, and the assembly line for children, it's a source of satisfaction and inspiration for it see Allen following her personality and encouraging the way.
