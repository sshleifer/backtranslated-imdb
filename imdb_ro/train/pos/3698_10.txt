I had no idea what this movie was until I read about it in the week L.A. Overall, I agree with LA Weekly reviews and decided to get a ticket for this movie. Molly Parker's movie (from my favorite Deadwood TV show) and Lukas haas - which I suspect will see more in the very near future. The movie is fun, full of heart, has great action and a beautiful photo. I do not know if the movie is distributed, but I hope it will - or will - soon. this is meant to be a real indie jewel. she even has music from my favorite band of silver Jews! The only disappointment was that the Molly Park was not there at screening. even without her ... that was the best movie I've ever seen at the festival.
