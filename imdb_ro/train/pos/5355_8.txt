Running Vicious Man launches the modern American media complex and hits his dead center. It could be an easy target, but they do not shoot him anymore. The Republic of Moldova is trying to fight pro-wrestling (with some professional fighters like hunters), network television, Nielsen ratings, the American government (suggesting it is anyhow entertainment-oriented), murder and punishment and other half-way things along the way. It's a cry far from the original version of novelyi Stephen King, and Arnold is not Ben Richards from the novel. But who cares? It's basically a movie from Arnie, with all the well-co-drafted and single-action sequences that require such a move.
