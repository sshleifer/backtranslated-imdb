I decided to look at this because of the recommendations of this site. I should say it deserved the effort. However, you must keep in mind that this movie will continue for 210 minutes. If you do not have the power to stay, take it on the tape and watch it for two nights. Now, in the movie, what I say will contain "spoilers," and if not the mind, here goes: Alexandre is a promiscuous vagabond, a female and a gigolo. She lives with an older woman named Marie. Marie owns a retail store and assures Alex. Alex spends his days at cafes and restaurants. The story reveals that Alex had previously impregnated Gilberte with whom he lived. Gilberte pulled him out for a less attractive man he did not love because Alex abused him and knocked it. At this point, Alex was willing to find a job and help raise his baby before he learned that Gilberte had aborted and intended to marry someone else. <br /> <br /> By chance, Alexandre meets a nurse nurse named Veronika and made a relationship. Veronika fell in love with Alex for the first time after all the sordid sex he had with men in the past. Marie and Veronika fight for Alex's affection and have a ménage à trois at the boot. Finally, it seems that Veronika is pregnant with Alex's baby, and Alex asks him to marry him. Suppose (as already mentioned in Gilberte's situation), Alexandre will even get a job and will be the supplier for his new love and family found. There is hope! <br /> <br /> With the title of La Maman et la putain, he deduces that Jean Eustache refers to the character of Veronika Françoise Lebrun. She was a whore and then she became a mother. So mother and bitch are the same person? Anyway, what I know! French films are largely (not all) very speaking, purposeless, political, preaching, theatrical, insipid, crying and full of quotes. Lebrun and Léaud played well their characters and kept the film together because part of the script became a little lost and split. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad effort. 7/10.
