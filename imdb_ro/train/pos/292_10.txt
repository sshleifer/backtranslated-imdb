Okay, first of all I got this movie as a Christmas present, so it was FREE! FIRST - This movie was supposed to be 3D stereoscopic. It's for the most part, but whenever the main character is in her car the movie falls to 2D! What the!!?!?! It's not that hard to shoot in a car! SECTION - The story is not very good. There are a lot of things wrong with her. <br /> <br /> Third - Why Show All Death at the Beginning of the Movie! He made the movie suck whenever some were going to be killed! Watch him for a good laugh, but do not waste time buy it. Just download it or something inexpensive.
