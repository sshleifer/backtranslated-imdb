This movie is perhaps the most exciting and uplifting I've ever seen. I am not a religious person, but sometimes a great piece of art like this film can give me an almost religious experience. One suddenly realizes that there really is a meaning for life. I have to admit that when I first heard about this movie, I was skeptical. I thought the intrigue sounded controversial, and I was afraid the story would be trivial. But being a fan of David Lynch, I decided to give it. It took me about 30 minutes to be fully captured by the movie, but then I was completely lost in it. There is so much wisdom and warmth in this movie! I left the feeling of cinema that I really learned something valuable about life. This is not a typical film by David Lynch, and in some ways it was very surprising that he should make such a film after exploring the dark sides of human nature for so many years. On the other hand, I am not surprised that she succeeds in conveying profound and profound human understandings, because I also thought she managed to do it very well in The Elephant Man. Lynch is one of the most talented directors around me and I think The Straight Story is the best yet. 9.5 / 10
