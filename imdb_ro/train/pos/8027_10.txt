When I saw it for the first time, I was really impressed. The director made such a mysterious atmosphere, especially in the end. Through all the stories, viewers can expect Richard to really kill Thomas or he will do it first. But ... the main point was not the conflict, but ... FRIENDSHIP! life.It's amazing. Every time I look at it I enjoy! Of course, it's pretty violent like any action movie, but I think it's acceptable. Thank you very much to Louis Liosa and Tom Berenger! Stunning movie! He advises everyone to see her. I'm sure people will not regret and really have a good time.
