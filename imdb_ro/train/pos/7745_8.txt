"Life strikes us in the face ........ we must try to stay beautiful" <br /> <br /> Debut from one of the best artists in Belgium (singing songs), Tom Barman. A long awaited movie and happy joyful happy joy for Flemish filming - it's worth watching a promising piece of work! It takes us to the life of 8 main characters living on Friday and night. The title says a lot about the way we spend time with them: we float while they are in the Friday evening party where they meet quite a lot. Rhythmic style is very "thought out". The extraordinary use of music. Sometimes he takes his upper hand to the pictures and then feels his strength. Gainsbourg! QOTSA! Stage party (20 minutes) is a thrilling visual experience for how it is shot. It keeps you really with it while it's put in a small place with a lot of people who have a big party ..... so hard to shoot. Thank you menij√®r Bartender to make this bold movie in them, over a few years, bad periods of Flemish filming. You made my day!
