I was very impressed with this small, self-made. The story, about a pair of social deceivers who meet, become friends, and offers each other a support system that they did not seem to lack as children is sometimes hilarious, sometimes sad, but always provocative. Music, mostly through underground troops, has been used with great effect, as well as experimenting with angles, filters and slow or fast moving techniques. Performances (the stars are played by writers and film directors) are some of the best we've seen in recent years. If you've ever felt that a square cube is forced into a round slot, I really think you'll appreciate "By Hook or By Crook".
