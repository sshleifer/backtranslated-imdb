Many people hate this movie, but I blame two facts - 1 - I want to be too much like the first two American Pie films. and 2 - trying to take it too seriously. This was the best of all six and I absolutely love Dwight. The story is predictable, I'm going to say this, but then what teen comedy is not? Road Trip, Dirty Deeds etc., all of which are incredibly predictable, but still funny! I say this is worth watching, I like it, it seems to me hilarious. Just do not watch it while you compare it to the first, because there is nothing like it. After watching Naked Mile and this, it became obvious that all American Pie movies were just starting out, Stiflers. What is FINE for me. Enjoy. Love. xD
