I was a fan of the show as a child and after that I always remembered myself as one of those memorable cartoons that made a difference in the early 1980s compared to the previous animated series (Heidi, Barbapapa, Il Etait I like Fois l "Homme ..., most of whom I like.) I think other similar Japanese cartoons of this kind launched later do not fit with Mazinger Z because they have begun to borrow the same pattern The same thing, novelty, can be one of the best features of Mazinger Z. Another good point is his inventiveness, with so many extravagant monsters, weird devices and bizarre characters; in fact, we were eager to see every new installment to find out what kind of new being or bad car awaits us!
