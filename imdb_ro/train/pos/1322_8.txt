What fascinating film. Even if it was not based on real life, Forbidden Lies was a fascinating portrait of an artist artist in her element. And it's kind of film psychology that students can study to find out about compulsive liars. The Author of Forbidden Love, Norma, has been revealed as a media fraud, but this move does not give her a great chance to erase her name. But the twists and turns it takes through the documentary are amazing. What a patient woman! I liked this movie. I did not read the book, but I just heard good reviews and went to see her on the rainy afternoon. The journey that this movie has on you is intelligent, interesting and totally delightful.
