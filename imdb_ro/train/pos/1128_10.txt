Although the recent resumption of part of Homer's epic "Troy" with Brad Pitt was once entertaining, "Iphigenia" with incandescent Irene Pappas was breathtaking. Dealing in a natural setting with Greek actors speaking their own language offers such authenticity. A random incident with this movie on one of DirecTV's movie channels has kept me interested despite my concentration problems. There is no brilliance or "bling" in this movie, just a rich rich rich story told by such real actors it feels that they are listening to a real family in turbulence. I think even Homer, if he really existed, would be proud of this. JLH
