This is the standard 30-year-old music comedy, with a great addition, that has some actors known in the 1930s of the small entertainment house. There is not much about the story, and basically the movie is all about its fun and worry-free atmosphere with a typical Hal Roach comedy. Appereantly is a "Cinderella" story, but I certainly did not think about it while watching the movie. The story gets very confused in stories, which features many different characters and also many little cameo appearance when the main characters hit the studios at Hollywood. Of course, the highlight of the movie is when Laurel & Hardy make their appearance and show some of their routines. It's like watching a movie and getting a free version of Laurel & Hardy. Also, director Walter Long from Laurel & Hardy makes a routine appearance and James Finlayson (without a mustache this time) as director of the short. It is certainly true that all the cameo and subplop distracts the main line of plot and character, but in this case it is not a problem, because it is much more fun and interesting to follow than the main plot and the typical superficial character . The film is certainly not worse than any of the other genre films of the same time period, although the assessment here would suggest otherwise.
