One of the ten best comedies ever. This seems like a comedy so cheerful and light that sings. Keaton's comedies are thoughtful, intelligent, and orderly. Wonderfully funny, deliberately charming and inventive, THREE AGE should be part of a top ten comedy project if I sketch one. A triple love story will delight viewers; I want to bring this approach here? Keaton's comedy is as if Lang's DESTINY is overturning or REBURS. Again, a couple crosses the waters of time and ages in the Stone Age, in Rome and in Keaton's times in a Mohammedan country, in Renascentia Italy, and in China. The same device works in both films, a bleak and dizzy melodrama; - the other, a light, virtuoso-paced comedy. Keaton is essentially the same couple; and maybe the same thing is with Lang. The babe wanted by both Buster and Beery is good. I discovered THREE AGES well written and intelligent, without being ostentatiously sophisticated; the plot is really POPEYE? that? babe is a piece of furniture, the only protagonists are the two male rivals? Keaton and Beery. Keaton's movie is simply enormously sympathetic, and maybe someone would be tempted to say that this looks like ambitious fun, but it's not, but it's great fun, great fun, ample fun. And Wallace Beery makes a good nemesis.
