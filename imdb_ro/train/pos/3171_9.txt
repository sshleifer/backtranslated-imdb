Cross-eyed is a very original and funny movie. I think Adam Jones brings a new set of revitalizing eyes to the genre of comedy and reinvents it in a good way. This movie is intelligent, concise, and constantly fun and fun. As a writer / director, Jones exercises complete control over his characters, who are both absurd and loving. The story is certainly something you have not seen before, which is good. It is unique and fun and manages to work in fantastic visual elements, as well as the long kind of music lost together to form a heart-filled comedy. A very promising first film.
