Citizen X tells the story of Andrei Chikatilo, the kidnapper in Rostov, who killed 52 people in 8 years, mainly women and children. This shows how the investigation was obstructed by the Soviet bureaucracy, how hard it was to investigate crimes. It does the job in such a brilliant way that it will not leave anyone untouched. At first it may be a slow pace, but it really hurries you as the story unfolds. I can only say that, along with the "silence of the lambs," this is by far the best movie about a serial killer that I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> It is very difficult to say the performance of the actor that stands above the rest in this movie. Stephen Rea is truly brilliant as a criminal expert who has no experience and who is in charge of the investigation. Donald Sutherland's performance as a cynical superior, and the only person in the Russian government who wants to help, is just as remarkable as Rea's. And what about Jeffrey DuMann playing the serial killer? DuMann brilliantly created a character that inspires empathy rather than hate. Yes, he is a monster, but he is also a sad, sullen and ridiculed figure of his wife, his boss, his colleagues ... He is tortured, ashamed and extremely vicious. /> I can recommend this film to all those who are interested in a well done docu drama where actors are even more important than special effects. It's worth at least 9/10, maybe even more if you ask me.
