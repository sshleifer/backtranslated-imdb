astounding, this is undoubtedly the best animated cartoon ever made. I first saw the castle in the sky in the late 80's as a child and left a lasting impression. years passed and I forgot the title of the film, and only by chance navigating the internet I found this masterpiece again. after reading reviews and analyzes of other peoples, I am not surprised to have such recognition and achieved so much, because it does not leave an impression. a true fantastic adventure, I have to see it for all children and adults. it does not give her the story away, so I would say you watch this movie will have a clear and open mind. if you have children you treat it with, I promise you will like it. there is not much to say about this piece of art, but if you have not seen it and enjoy it.
