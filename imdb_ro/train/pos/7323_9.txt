Brutally, without excitement, Michael Myers ruined his sister to death at the age of six on the Halloween night in 1963; on October 30, 1978, he escapes a mental institution and establishes a new reign of terror in his hometown in Haddonfield, Illinois. He is always watched by a psychiatrist (Donald Pleasence) who knows how bad this young man is. It opens with a bang and creates a really cool and atmospheric cooler that is actually superior to the many poor pictures that have helped inspire them. It's subtle, compared to ugly blood baths, many of these later movies were; subtle and frightening. It retains the ability to make me jump even after repeated viewing. How many movies do they really have that can continue to be frightening even after you've ever seen them? There is not much. Pleasure is great in what was probably the definitive role of his career; Jamie Lee Curtis, in her film debut, has become a blasphemy blasted queen after playing in Halloween, as well as several subsequent pictures of weakness, and she is a victim who is rooted. - writer / director John Carpenter knows what works in this film, making excellent use of shadows and dark skies; observe how most of the movie is set after the nightfall. With this picture, he and his former collaborator, Debra Hill, created a franchise that gave rise to seven sequels, many imitators, and a "re-imagination" to come. It is very cozy - who could ever forget Dr. Loomis (Pleasence), describing Michael Myers Sheriff (Charles Cyphers, a reliable repertoire player in some of Carpenter's previous works)? It's fantastic and it's worth looking. This is my favorite film John Carpenter of all time. It's not totally infallible - there are script holes, after all - but it generally has a solid impact. <br /> <br /> 9/10
