Victor Nunez imbues this unconscious story of the emotional journey of a young woman with a sense of poetry rarely met in cinema. By poetry I understand the meaning in which literary and cinematic play enters the game. There is something very literary about the film, almost as if a novel has been adapted from one page to another. In this sense, the film reaches many depths I can not; but it is also slow enough in other times, underlining the depths it once gained in favor of ennui. The star of Ashley Judd has not yet made a better film than her debut here. It fits the role of driving Ruby like a glove, almost as if it should not have acted. She has a true presence of films in the film and has failed to convey the same attraction in her subsequent films, although she was impressive in normal life.
