Meryl Streep is such a genius. At least as an actress. I know she was distracted because she did many accented roles, but she emphasizes every time. Her performance as Lindy Chamberlain was inspired. Mrs. Chamberlain, as portrayed here, was neither pleasant nor intelligent. But that makes Streep's work even more remarkable. I think it deserves all 10 Oscar nominations. About the movie, there were some interesting things. I do not know much about Australia, but the theme of religious fanaticism among the general public has played an important role in the story. It has greatly escaped this when I first saw the film a few years ago, but it came yesterday strong and clear. And it seems that the Australian press is just as fulfilled as a result of the journey that causes misfortune and overcoming American colleagues. A pretty good movie. A little different. Grade: B
