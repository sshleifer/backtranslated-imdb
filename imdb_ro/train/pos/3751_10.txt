I know you've already entered the film festivals (or at least I think you did it, maybe I did that), but I think this should become the "best animated short film" in each. Bravo. I can not wait for the movie completely. I realize that you may not hear that often because of the bizarre nature of your animations, but hear it now and accept it as truth. Kudos, buddy. Okay, now I'm just trying to get ten lines of text ... Although I still say that. And here's another - AIDS! - and I can not stop here yet. This is extremely annoying and yet, at the same time, I have nothing better to do. Actually, I'm probably going to watch all your movies in another spasmodic "Jason Steele Marathon." I have many of them. <br /> <br />
