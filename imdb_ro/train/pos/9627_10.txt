This is by far the most funny short produced by the two geniuses of the comic strip. From the moment they get in, until the time Hardy falls off the roof, that makes me laugh hysterically. I suggest that every fan of Laurel and Hardy should see this short. We also recommend all Ghost series. If you are looking laugh, watch this movie and you will be happy.
