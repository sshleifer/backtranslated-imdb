When I was young, I saw very few movies. My parents in all their wisdom hired this one. I was very cautious about what was about the movie, actually I was not allowed to watch. My brother and sister came naturally, and that made me very upset. So what did I do? Late night I fired the VCR! Hit the TV screen and called the police and reported the vandals. I was arrested, of course, I could not get my foot out of the TV before the police arrived. I just gave a talk and sent home. My parents, of course, founded me, and they made me work to pay my debts for TV and VCR. That's what ruined me, the slave worker is about to believe me, but I had to do it. He works around the house. What happened in the end? We have a big screen TV, a DVD player and a surround sound system for my work. How did I get the money? I just made my own movies and sold them to Disney! Do you remember that you found Neno? Well, I wrote that movie and I shot my gold in their fish tanks! They rewrote the plan, of course, and they did it in CGI because they could not afford to make a real picture of life as if I had done it! Finally, I have never seen Capel that did not die, and the rating I've given is my life rating! I'm doing pretty well!
