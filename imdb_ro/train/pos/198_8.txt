Oh, it's so cool to see a Silent Classic once in a while! Director Vidor is simply delightful and even makes a long (at least for 1928) cameo like himself. The story is about being successful in life and how it changes. Marion Davies plays a girl who leaves her friends in a small comedy studio to be part of a larger drama studio. It becomes a big star and its consequences are truly alienated from the real world. For a moment she even denies her past (poor)! The cinemas are simply hilarious, certainly the scene where the main character (Marion Davies) sees ... Marion Davies in the studios and concludes that it does not seem to be special ... It has to be one of the first cinematic films, the movies here and for real strangers, it is great to see the chambers and materials of that time. You have to see if you ask me!
