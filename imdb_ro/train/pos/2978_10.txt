BASEketball is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It's an outdoor movie starring South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker. They play two weaker friends who create a sport on their way, which becomes a national sensation. Most of the gangs are really hilarious, but the funniest parts of the movie are when players try to "psyche-out" other members of the opposing team. There is no rule about what is not allowed, so naturally they do the most crazy things possible. One of the flaws in this movie is that the rhythm is too fast and after watching for about half an hour, I woke up asking: "Wow this already?" Another hilarious part of the film was how Joe and Doug continue to harass Squeak, who is a small guy. BASEketball is a classic comedy, with some very quoted lines, and it's really fun to look at!
