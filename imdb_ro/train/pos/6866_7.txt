************** Possible Spoilers ********** There is only one reason I've seen this movie, and that's because I have a massive passion on Richard Belzer. I do not know much about humor.) There were some funny parts, such as Barbie and Ken Spoof, and the dealers and skit president. Remember, this is sometimes hoarse (Dare, say cruel?) It was sometimes funny, but it could have been better. Probably if they spent more time in humor and less time when women get naked, the movie would have been more fun. Some skits make you want to stutter and get lost, other pampering makes you laugh and think strangely. Unfortunately, this movie is dated. If you have a crazy passion on Richard Belzer (It's worth it), it's worth checking out and seeing Chave Chase.
