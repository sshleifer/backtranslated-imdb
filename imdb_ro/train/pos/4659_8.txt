Without Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, this could easily be a turkey. But they are brilliant. Ustinov is the best, and for Maggie's fans, it's great to see it in the early days, matching Ustinov at every step of the road with the calendar. For fifty-year-old English (and I'm in that category), it's always fun to see and hear the sounds of the Swinging Sixties, and although this film spends a lot of time in the office, it has a lot of nostalgia in the sixties including red buses, Carnaby Street, a Lulu song and a wonderful breath of a waitress's micro-skirt, like England has never seen in public places. Like an I.T. engineer, know that the hacking tricks of the computer are ridiculous, but they are not meant to be taken seriously. They are not the wonderful stereotypes of the Italians, the French and the Germans.
