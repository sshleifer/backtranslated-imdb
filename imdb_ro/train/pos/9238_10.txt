Although others have commented that this video is just an edited version of the two shows: "Fire in Space" and "Living Legend", if you watch the original shows you will find that the dialogue in this video edition has been edited. We found this video much better because scenes and lines were added. I would say that if you want to see the show in the original version, you see VHS videos. They have more to offer to the fan than the original episodes are being offered on DVD now. Another good movie is the Conquest for Earth, which had several scenes from Galactica 1980 than real diffusions. Overall, I evaluate this as a 10th because it gives you more joy than what networks wanted to show over the time they have given to manufacturers.
