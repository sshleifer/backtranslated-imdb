There were a lot of Hollywood movies made during the war that were designed to force our troop support from the public. Seen today, some may reject or see them only as propaganda - what they are technically but positively and meant to unify the nation. This film is a fairly effective and fun example of the genre - having a fairly realistic scenario and good production value. Pat O'Brien plays quite the same character he has played in many other movies (you know, the hard-to-talk guy, hard-headed, but "swelling"). Randolph Scott is, as always, competent and fun, and the rest of the extras are excellent (look for a young Robert Ryan as one of the training bombs). While the story reminds us of some other films about our pilots and crews, the film is sufficiently artised to make it interesting and not too appealing. That, perhaps, except for the end - where the film is a little overhead but also VERY satisfying. The only serious negative, and most importantly for nitrification, is that some of the material in the film is somewhat integrated in the film, and nuts like me who are both history teachers and airplane lovers will probably see this thing - it will not notice.
