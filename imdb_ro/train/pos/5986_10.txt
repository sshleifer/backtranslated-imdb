This movie is the most cult movie on metal. Premise: A child receives a final record of his favorite artist, Sammy Curr, who recently died in a fire at the hotel. He plays it back and calls the dead again to take revenge in the name of the heavy metal on those jocketers who tortured him. Any true metal fan will enjoy this movie and if you're a metal head tormented by jocks, play a Sammy Curr album back ......... do not wait to be fictional, and watch it with your fist in the air, with his head beating and the volume at 11!
