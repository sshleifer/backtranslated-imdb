Bizarre horror movie, filled with famous faces, but stolen by Cristina Raines (later "Flamingo Road") as a pretty but unstable model with a gentle smile that is paid to pay for attempted suicide by guarding the Gateway to Hell! The Raines modeling scenes are very well captured, the music is perfect, Deborah Raffin is charming as Cristina's girlfriend, but when Raines moves into a Brooklyn Heights Brownstone daisy (inhabited by a top-level blind priest) things really start. Neighbors, including a Burgess Meredith Master and a Stinging Couple, Sylvia Miles & Beverly D'Angelo, are a devilish lot, and Eli Wallach is very fun as a cunning police detective. The film is almost a cross pollination of "Rosemary's Child" and "Exorcist" - but what a combination! Based on Jeffrey Konvitz's best seller, "The Sentinel" is a fun, fun-filled show brought by director Michael Winner, based on a journey of thought that ends with skill. *** 1/2 from ****
