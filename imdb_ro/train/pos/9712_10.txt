Another review compared this band with a cross between Monty Python and Twin Peaks, also aptly. Another review explained the differences between the comedy we enjoy the non-critical and the black comedy, also worth considering. Look at all, all three series. At the end, all the characters are tied and the puzzle pieces fit in as well as a novel by Douglas Adams. The details and complications are amazing. Very post-modern. Unfortunately, amazingly and surprisingly tragic. Not for children. Not for those with thin skins or who do not have objectivity. Thought. A literal, figurative and surrealistic one in disturbing ways. The darkest comedy I can remember. And most likely the most wonderful thing I'll ever see.
