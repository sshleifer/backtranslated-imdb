I remember when I first saw this short, I really laughed so much that, like many other movies I saw, no sound came out! Curly is very great at "singing" the opera in this, I am surprised that he did not consider a career as a professional singer, because he was very good! <br /> <br /> If you have noticed, this was filmed near the end of Curly's career as Stooge, you could really say it's changed, because he lost weight and it was thinner, his voice deep, his face was worn with wrinkles, though he could still pull him, he was fifty at the age of forty. That's because he suffered many minor blows before the big one who finished his career. Either he still managed to shoot him in his last! <br /> <br /> If you do not mind Curly being really sick at the moment, it is actually one of the funniest shorts. I know it did not bother me that Curly really is changing, because I still thought it was great! <br /> <br />
