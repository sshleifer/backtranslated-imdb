The beautiful comic from Paul Mazursky, Richard Dreyfuss, portrays Jack Noah as a rather successful actor - who is filming a film in a fabulous American Parador, a fanatical American republic run by the fascist, Alfonse Sims who, unfortunately, suffered a heart attack after indulging in too many local cocktails! Raul Julia plays the giant police chief who forces Noah to give up the mere dying dictator, which Noah has a remarkable resemblance, Sonia Braga plays the dictator's gentle mistress who gives Noah a few lessons on how to "act" as a dictator, Jonathan Winter literally approaches the tower as a CIA man in Parador, presenting as a hammock vendor. May Noah win over the people of Parador? and hold the rebels? And gives the performance of a life without losing during the process? Sammy Davis Jnr, has a cameo like himself, which funny Crown national anthem of Parador as well as Begin Beguine, Frog number one (Fernando Rey appears as a kind servant, Charo is also handy as a busty maid, Score by Maurice Jarre, is excellent.
