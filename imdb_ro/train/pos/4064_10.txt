I've never met a single person (out of hundreds) who hates this movie. You bet someone who votes is a small saboteur or a victim of one. This movie has everything. Ask yourself: "Are you a fan of ...?" Then go see "Laputa". It's not my favorite movie, but my favorite is directed by the same person (Hayao Miyazaki). In any case, it is among the top five. And I saw a lot of movies.
