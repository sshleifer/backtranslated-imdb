Hello again, I have to comment on this wonderful, interesting and credible story about romance and intrigue. The music is wonderful and memorable. Very colorful movie. Another film I liked later was High Bing Crosby. Wonderful music. Thank you for listening, Florence Forrester-Stockton, Reno, Nevada
