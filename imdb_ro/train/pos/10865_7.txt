This movie is really fun to watch if you like movies of organized crime varieties. Those looking for a crime film, playing a charismatic role, with dreams to take in a bad way, can be easily disappointed with the way this film is heading. It's a fun story through a criminal underworld, however, and if you're not familiar with Hong Kong movies, then you can be pleasantly surprised by it. I was somewhat disappointed with some of the choices made in the story, but generally a good crime film. Some things did not make sense, but that seems to be the norm with East movies. <br /> <br /> People do only random things no matter how their personalities have been set up before. It's a slightly annoying pattern that even gets into this movie.
