Red Eye is a small, thriller that can be watched on Saturday night. Strong action, great sadness and unexpected action. Some may not want to see this movie because it's going for a very short film 85 Min and 88% of the movie is on a plane and just talking. Do not worry I'm really good at having a clever and witty dialogue. A PG-13 movie seems to be a new motive for director Wes Craven. But, surely, it matches how much possible violence in this thriller. This most powerful film is his distribution. This film needed good actors to provide dialogue and emotions. If they did not have these actors, the movie would have been lost and boring. I had Rachel McAdams of Mean Girls and Nesting Crashers. Cillian Murphy from Batman Begins and 28 days later. Beyond this distribution is Brian Cox from X-Men 2. Pacing in this movie was great. Only when you think it will become boring they throw a twist on you. Fortunately, this is not a long film, nor does it feel that. Much better than the other flying flight movie. <br /> <br /> Here is my plan flight comment: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408790/usercomments-578 <br /> <br /> I recommend you. It's not too long and not too shabby. 8/10
