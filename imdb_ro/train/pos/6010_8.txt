"Zabriskie Point" (1970): Was this particularly interesting to me personally because it takes place in identical circumstances with identical colleagues in my life? the Counter Culture movement in the late 1960s / early 1970s, in and out of the campus. We follow two unmarried young men in separate stories that are slowly woven together. One is a young man in Los Angeles, tired of endless pseudo-revolutionary jabber, in the classrooms and meeting rooms of his campus, and the other, a young woman who leads to Phoenix to see her father and employer, the work". The film is FULL of the Italian director's (Michelangelo Antonioni) visual notations in America, and the confusion, the psychedelicrations of that era are self, "we know everything, we will change everything for the better youngsters." Who is the "revolutionary"? What does that really mean? Dress up like one and go around the song? Do you "fly under radar", but do you give advance notice of your arrival? Have you kept your plans for yourself and you've been dealing with the change without the need for group approval? "Zabriskie Point" is certainly a piece of vintage - full of slang, uniforms, somewhat surreal moments (after all, this is a movie of the man who gave us the amazing "Blow Up" of 1966) and the artefacts of the era , but it is more. It presents options for the cultural revolution and goes by Antonioni (who seems to support it), young people are too involved to see what is needed for radical success. For this reason, it becomes a powerful, frightening film that applies to anyone at any time in any place.
