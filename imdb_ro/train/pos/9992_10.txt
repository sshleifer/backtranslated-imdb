... this is a classic with so many extraordinary dialogues and scenes that no one should miss. A beautiful story, funny situations of riches-to-rags, Mel Brooks is not a bad evil, maybe not perfect, but it's funny; D Do not pay attention to the rating, it is BS. Watch it, then watch something like the final destination (2009) and tell me that Life Stinks deserves the same rating. If you think I do not think we can be friends XD At this point I recommend to be the fourth season of "Make Your Enthusiasm" to every Brooks fan;) Vote 10 against the ignorant opinions of the worms! Do I have to make 10 lines here to post a comment? I do not want to write a book here: P
