A highly underestimated black comedy, the most beautiful of a series of great guignol films to follow "Baby Jane." Reynolds and Winters are mothers of young condemned murderers (a hint of "Compulsion"), running to hide in Hollywood. They run a school for film comrades, a bunch of hilarious children, who have been struggling with the horrible mothers. Debbie in her blond wig ("I'm a Harlow, you're more a Marion Davies," tells Winters) leads the players to the concert and wins a rich father, Weaver. It also has a deliciously funny tango and, above all, offers remarkable performance, unlike anything she has done before. The atmosphere is a wonderful blend of comics and dizziness. Looks great with the details of the high season (30 years). A lot of beautiful Hollywood miracles and the scary movie all. Micheal MacLiammoir has a ball as a drama coach: "Hamilton Starr," he purrs, "two r, but prophetic, though". See and love her.
