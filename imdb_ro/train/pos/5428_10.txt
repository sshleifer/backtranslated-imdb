A pudding?") And the incredible scene of the Cutter temple singing and then arranging, daring like brass ... "Okay, you're all arrested! "We could go further, but it suffices to say that I'm trying to catch this movie whenever it is. For adventurers and generals of armchair, it's hard to imagine better 2 hours.
