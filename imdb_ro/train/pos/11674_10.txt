The planning episodes were a bit boring, but when they reached the desert, it was quite fun to look at. The reason I call it the most realistic reality show is that, to my surprise, Charley fell out of the race relatively early. When his hands were painful, I waited for the usual stress and then a wonderful remedy, but in fact he gave up the race. The most anxious moment of the show must have been when Max was stuck in the desert without water or food! The end was great and I was very happy to see that at least one of the teams succeeded. Overall, not as big as the Long Way Round, but certainly an interesting watch as you look at the most difficult race in the world.
