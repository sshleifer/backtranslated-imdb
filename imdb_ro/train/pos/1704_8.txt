"I moved here to get rid of such things!" The sheriff in the small town is crying. "Is that what happens in Chicago?" Tell him his deputy. Well, no, not really. The plot is that a group of Martians are wronging a resumption of Orson Welles' Halloween World War II as a story of a real martial invasion and concludes that they must go into action! What follows is a lot of shortcomings involving the Martian attempts to conquer the city of "Big Bean, IL". They all conclude that they are children in very good suits, except Sheriff's daughter and her boyfriend, a child in a duck suit. The Martians themselves are comic and you have the impression that they are not a threat to anyone, but they themselves quite early. It's a fun family film.
