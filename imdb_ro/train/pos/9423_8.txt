I can not tell if the British post-war comedy produced at Ealing Studios is a taste or not, but I'm completely addicted and the man in the white suit is one of the best. There is no need to enter into the well-known plot about the threat that both the textile industry and the textile unions are threatening with an indestructible, dirt-resistant fiber. Suffice it to say that the belts and arrows suffered by naive idealist Sidney Stratton, in pursuit of his vision of polymers, make a comic pleasure. Many of the best-known faces in the character world of British actors - nervous Cecil Parker, Michael Gough, and Ernest Thesinger - have done great performances. Guinness - as always and forever - is gorgeous, and Joan Greenwood is delightful as Daphne (as the word "father," makes the whole movie see). "Knudsen !!! !!!!"
