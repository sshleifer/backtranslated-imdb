Natalia from Emily Watson is absolutely the most loving and romantic character I've ever seen on the screen. She is the queen of this film beyond any doubt. Or is it sent to the king? Interception of chess games and family battles for control, power and victory are amazing. Like chess masters in the film, the director plays many simultaneous games with our mind at once, but all weaves in major or minor forms. The period, costumes and images of the early 20th century Italian lake are captured magnificently. No square of space is wasted. <br /> <br /> So many brilliant scenes abound, I can not tell them all. I recommend you give yourself enough time to watch this movie twice, possibly one week apart, because you can not capture all the poetry in a 64-square frame but multidimensional in one frame. <br /> <br /> I did not read Nabakov's book, but to try one's own analogy, what I read reminds me of another romantic poetry-like play, Barry Levinson, The Natural. She completely ended the steep end of Bernard Malamud's fatalist book in favor of a romantic impressionism that was uniquely American. Well, the director did that better, interconnecting unequivocally moral and soft Russian and Italian as a backdrop for illumination. The real story here is that games are zero-sum; there is a winner and a loser, unless both competitors shoot. But in life, and especially in the context of our immortal souls, we are limited only by those constraints and the conventions of life, to the extent that we let others break our spirit. <br /> <br /> The pure love, as Emily Watson's Natalia personified, can transcend us and allow us to be improved by all its gifts at the same time. Only the barriers raised by our fears could cut us off. <br /> <br /> This is a magnificent movie (10/10).
