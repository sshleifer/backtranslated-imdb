It was a jewel. Amazing action from the leaders Liam Cunningham, Orla Brady and all the support distributions. The film raises a subject not only relevant to the history of Ireland and Ireland but also to many communities around the world and to many marriage units in those communities. With intensity and sincerity, the film shows how beliefs and religious traditions led a wedge to a loving and passionate family. The title "Shared Love" could not capture it better. Even if it was a true story and it's happening in Ireland to see 50 how the life of the whole village erodes and the "pogroms" are the beginning reminded me of Russia's history. Intolerance and prejudices are still too strong in the world and, unfortunately, they are deeply hidden within human nature. As in the film, Liam Cunningham's character says "hate has always been there under the surface." It was interesting to follow the moral choices that people did in this story. Also, the character of a Catholic priest and what happened to him at the end of the story was quite significant. The story, however, gives hope that the love of two people can conquer everything and love makes us better, stronger. The character of Liam Cunningham goes through the whole transformation in the course of the story becoming a man he has always wanted to be. Again, driving is a top note. The story is fast. The Irish town is as beautiful as ever. Highly recommended.
