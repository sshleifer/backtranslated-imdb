I really enjoyed this movie. Of course the idea is pretty much there ... the federal government arranging to have a tracking device implanted into a small thief's jaw to attract a more dangerous thief / hidden computer hacker. But Alvin Sanders, the man the feds have "offered" to be implanted with the device, is a very pleasant person, and it seems like it's really fun to head him up with him for a while. Alvin turns out to be more than a good character, but passive or unique, when he looks like he's not as easily manipulated as he seems. It certainly deserves a watch.
