First of all, this movie was a wild walk all the time. The story of preparing soldiers, fighting with their superiors, and ultimately grouping. From the beginning till the end. This is a drama of war that is worth seeing if you are in the constant struggle (sometimes beyond reason) and the horrors of what is the boot camp. The dynamics of how actors interacted were quite amazing, and sometimes humorous. How does Bozz (Colin Farrel) deal with Paxton (Matthew Davis) throughout the story, from camp to Tigerland, and even eventually helping him. Innovative free-handed filming brought a certain taste or flavor to the film. Constant movement, constant action and constant confusion. Sometimes it was a help. Others, not so much. Throughout the film she was more realistic. Some points in the movie (sexual scenes in particular) seemed just a little too realistic, even if they had an effect on the film that would not have been there without them. it was a very hard movie through and through. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is one of Colin Farrel's best films (if not his top performance). The actor for each character was superb. 9/10 -sysnuk3r
