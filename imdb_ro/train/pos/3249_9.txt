Corbin Bernsen has sent letters to four criminals with whom he has worked in the past and is a real intergenerational mix with Fred Gwynne, Lou Diamond Phillips, William Russ and Ruben Blades. They meet with him in this habitual Montana town and do not explain why, because he was then taken over by the New Jersey state police on a warrant. <br /> <br /> From the criminal group that was gathered, everyone knows Bernsen, but they do not know each other. A lot of the comedy involved feels each other. While the eldest Gwynne, though denies dealing with others, buzzes, but goes along. Especially when they realize what Bernsen had in mind. As for Bernsen, it is lucky to be picked up by a pair of bumblers in Ed O'Neill and Daniel Roebuck. He gets dropped on O'Neill and escapes. Afterwards, the four criminals are trying to finish what Bernsen has begun and Bernsen to escape the police. In the complicated scenario, it is fascinating how both lines of story are held together. Hoyt Axton, as local sheriff, watches with wonder what's going on in his town. The disorganized criminal is a funny fool funny movie of a bunch of players who seem to have had mostly a television experience or soon. I can not say that someone in the show also seems to click so well together. <br /> <br /> Ironically, none of these people is a comedian in themselves, but all of them show a slight comic touch that good direction has brought them. Disorganized murder is a very funny movie, the kind of film that would have been written by the most famous pessimist, Mr. Murphy.
