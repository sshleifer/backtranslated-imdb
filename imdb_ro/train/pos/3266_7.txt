Another Downey must see it! If you're an obsessed fan like me, you have to see this movie! He plays the role of Alex Finch, a 22 year old Yale who realizes that the life he's just entered is the life he left 26 years ago. Alex is the reincarnation of Louie Jeffries, a lawyer who was not bad, married to Corrine (Cybil Sheppard). Louie is killed at a one-year anniversary when hit by a car. He asks to return, only this time in Alex Finch's body. Get in on Robert Downey Jr., a lot of confusion and a lot of laughs. Although this film is 15 years old, it still makes you wonder if there really is such a thing as reincarnation. And if so, how often do you meet the same life after life? I do not know the answer. But I know you have to see this movie. It's a revolt, and Downey looks very good in a tuxedo. This movie makes you believe in love and true love never dies. It simply recycles.
