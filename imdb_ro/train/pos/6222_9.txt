This is really a great movie. Some songs have become classical immortal, and Fred and Ginger's dance is among the best of them. But practically all Fred and Ginger's films are the same. After the song and dance are over, there are the other characters in the movie that make the movie work. What really bothers me is the reason why all the negative comments about Randolph Scott? His story with Harriet Hilliard and the subject of the film is the reason I look at it again and again. He adds to this film, he does not destroy it. He has a winning personality and a big smile. Randy is in my list of top ten favorites. It's great to see him as anything but a cowboy. So he's not really a great actor, but like many other stars: Errol Flynn, Alan Ladd, Victor Mature, etc. was very pleasant and could rise to the top on certain occasions. All Fred and Ginger's films had subjects that depended on other actors to fill the space between the musical numbers, otherwise the movie would have been shortened by about half an hour. I just want more people to appreciate Randy and I felt the need to pick up.
