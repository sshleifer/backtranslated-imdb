I have not read Kurt Vonnegut's book yet adapted to him, but I'm familiar with some of his other works and he was interested in seeing it translated into the screen. On the whole, I think this is a very successful adaptation of one of Vonnegut's novels. It refers to the story of an American living in Germany who is recruited as a spy for the US. His job is to grow up with high-ranking Nazis and send secret messages to Americans through his weekly radio shows. But when the war ends, he is denounced as a war criminal, but escapes to New York where he waits for various plot overthrows. If Mom's Night has a problem, it's that she tends to become too sentimental at times. But for most of the film, schmaltz is kept to a minimum and the very strange park is worn with skill and aplomb. And there are some fabulous moments of black comedy involving three right-wing fundamentalists and a well-ranked Nazi in a prison cell. Highly recommended.
