Ah, clichés, clichés, clichés; They are an essential part of a wide variety of horror films. But Stephen King, one of the best horror masters. This movie was very good, even predictable. And what horror movie does not have fools? This is overcrowded with delayed victims, basically just asking for life to be taken. Pet Memorial I discovered I'm creepy a little. The way in which everything was set up was really scary, but not terrifying. For the most part, the act was URMAT somewhat credible, suspense was not so suspense, but the level of entertainment is set to a major rank; My eyes were practically glued to the screen. All Stephen King fans have to see this movie, but like everyone else, expect a OKAY thriller.
