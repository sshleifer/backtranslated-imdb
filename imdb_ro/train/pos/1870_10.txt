This movie is great! He touched my heart of cold stone. I could not refer to the racial discrimination that Antwone had lived because I live in my own country. I think it's very hard to be discriminated against. I watched this film in our sociology class at New Era University and did not know it was a true story, I thought it was just created by an intellectual wishing to bring clean air into the industry. It is very good. The part that shocked me was when Nadine abused Antwone (who was only six) sexually. If I were on his shoes, I could have jumped into a ten-storey building. I greet him because he was so strong! The scene that touched me here is when Antwone saw Eva's mother face to face. He did not steal it or something, but told him about the achievements he had achieved over many years in which they were separated. (I think I'll do it when I get the chance to look for my roots.)
