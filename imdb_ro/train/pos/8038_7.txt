Two snipers travel deep into the jungle in search of their targets; a milky South American drug master and a prominent general. With moderate success in building a frightening atmosphere, Sniper is, in most cases, a very solid thriller taking time, setting its characters, their situation and their peak in a few good action sequences. Director Llosa is not always able to keep up his gloomy mood, and he might get his story to some extent; some detours here do not add too much. But this movie is much better than Stallone / Stone travesty The Specialist. Billy Zane, usually incredibly tedious, is not surprisingly good as an inexperienced Fighter alongside veteran Berenger. As far as Berenger is concerned, this film proved to be his last good Hollywood company. He can do this kind of roles in sleep and is very convincing here, resuming the role twice as directly in the continuation of DVDs.
