This is one of the first independent movies I've ever seen. For such a very low budget, it was done well; as well as my insomnia, I can sympathize with the main character, although my sleeping problems have never been so intense or disturbing. Well directed, well acted, by a topic I have not seen too much in theaters, illuminated and set so perfectly for setting the movie. There are few visible, but they can be intentional; you will see after watching the movie. The film is very personal and it's worth watching twice. No movie is perfect, but a Hollywood version could not make the story better. in total, 8/10.
