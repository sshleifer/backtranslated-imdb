Since this is the Black History Month and reviewing the achievements of many African-Americans on the film in chronological order, I received this film on the VHS in the library because Duke Ellington and the Orchestra were in it. Their jazz version of Franz Liszt's "Rhapsody" was the culmination of this mixture of mystery-musical comedy, much longer than murder. Many other numbers I liked were Carty Brisson's "Marijuana Sweet", Carl Brisson's "Cocktails for Two," as well as his earlier duet with Carlisle and Gertrude Michael who is wonderful as the woman she likes to hate. Jack Oakie and Victor McLaglen might go a little too long with the love / hatred they make as the producer and the detective, but they grow up on you. And Toby Wing is an amazing sexy sadness like Nancy who continues to try to say something to Oakie, but he always gets a "No" from him. Although many of the characters have a reason for the crimes that are happening, I was not surprised by the revelation of who did it. And make a pregnancy how empty the women here (though, of course, their breasts are covered, either by hands or by some reckless peaks). It was very obvious pre-code. It's worth taking a look at a movie boy interested in such things. P.S. As a long-term resident of Louisiana, I like to see that someone was born here because Carlisle was a native of New Orleans.
