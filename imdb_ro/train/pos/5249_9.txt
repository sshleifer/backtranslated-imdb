The choice to make this SNL skit in a movie was much better thought than the other recent ones. The humor involved in the character is not a humor of humility and it is also a character driven enough to be stretched for an hour or two. Very strange that sexual content seemed to be avoided, but that may have been because the live television constraints taught me not to expect. I think I thought much more about "Leisure Suit Larry" than the producers were ... Definitely not a PG-13 movie that will probably hurt him from reaching the heights of his successful predecessors, but the premise and writing are more good than the most painful. I liked it, but I doubt it will be a huge blow ... (which is sad because Tim Meadows tends not to make characters that annoy me with the frequency of other SNL graduates tend to)
