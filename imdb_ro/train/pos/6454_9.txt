I saw this film back at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival and from the 14 films I saw there, I would classify this film as the third film. I had an initial interest in seeing this Swedish descendant with many of my ancestors from the Norrland region of Sweden where she was filmed. I also grew up in a rural area in North America, where many small towns were similar to this one. It's nice to see more movies using rural locations like their settings, such as SÃ¥ som i himmelen. It was a very good film and I'm sure a very hard movie to shoot along with his big cast, but director Kay Pollock has really pulled it after a nearly two decades off of directing. Helen Sjoholm in her debut film as an actress was fantastic and I would have been looking forward to more of her on the big screen. I liked Michael Nyqvist at the forefront of this well-rounded distribution. I would highly recommend this movie and drop it on 9.0 on a scale of 10.
