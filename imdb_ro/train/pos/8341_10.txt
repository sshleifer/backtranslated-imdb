Bottom line - the best romantic comedy ever. This film realizes what strikes all the great movies: creating a world and time that we want to re-visit and make us rejoice that we are part of the human race. When I'm blue, this movie raises my spirit and makes me laugh (and this is true after many views - always fresh). All actors are in top form. The characters are so dead, and the characters blend so well that you forget the actor (usually hard to do with Matthau, Robbins and Ryan). The supporting film is constantly shining: Fry ("agae", "a total package"), Jacoby & Saks & Maher (the three theoretician physicists being "the Greek choir" - "but time does not exist" to NJ), Shalhoub & Whaley (Robbins' head and co-worker at the gas station) and Curits (Eisenhower - how many comedies do Eisenhower have?) Don Do not miss this past treasure.
