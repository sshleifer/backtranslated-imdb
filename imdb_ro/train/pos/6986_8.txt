If you investigate the UFO facts then this video is very important. Video is the comment made by Buzz Aldrin. He is undoubtedly the best of America. Trained to be objective, honest and real in his reports. Many American astronauts of all ages have reported some kind of UFO contact or observation, and there are videos of some of these missions. At least something has happened that requires an objective, continuous investigation. I think this testimony from Buzz Aldrin shows that other worlds may be interested in our progress. Like any documented video, it can be tilted, but contains additional information and insights from an accomplished American hero. Those who do not come every day. So the fact that some people are not interested in details should not hurt you from viewing this video. If not, it's interesting and I recommend you look with an open mind.
