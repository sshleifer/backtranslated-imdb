This short was nominated for the Oscar and I would have wanted to win! Practically, a jam session shot between some very talented musicians, including Lester Young and Joe Jones, the music is incredible! Hollywood has often embraced Jazz (especially animation, believe it or not), but this is a rare movie to an improvised jam. This has been added to the preservation list of the movie and deserved. TCM runs this as a regular filler and runs it every March for his "31 Oscars" tribute. From the center of the city to the buzzer, you shake, nothing but the net and the shot so smooth, the net barely moving. The most solid and highly recommended !!!
