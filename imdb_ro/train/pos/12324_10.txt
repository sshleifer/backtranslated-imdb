This movie is incredible. With extraordinary characters, especially the old swordsman who can fly as a ball of fire and jump over the trees, this film tells the classic story of the battle between good and evil forces. The end of the showdown is particularly stunning and the musical score is pretty cool. Very, very recommendable.Not for the youngest kids, though. This deserves a 10.
