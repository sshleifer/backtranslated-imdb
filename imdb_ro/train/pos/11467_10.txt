This is the best movie I've ever met. Not only is this the best movie (school) The way Ben Coccio (the director) decided to shoot was magnificent. She shot her using adolescent actors who were still in high school. She shot her in the actors' rooms and used her true parents as parents in the film. Also, actors shot too using video cameras, making it look much like a video log. It's almost art (if it's really a word) There are a few slides, for example, when Cal sounds brads (?) To land on a rover (or vice versa, it's been a while since I saw him)
