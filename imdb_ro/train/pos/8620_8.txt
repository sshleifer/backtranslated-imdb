I just finished looking at the 139-minute (widescreen) version with some friends and I was blowing. I do not bother repeating what others have said. What the filmmakers are doing with this concept is unexpected and fun. The tremendous battle is tedious. Then we were amazed to find that we still have about 30 minutes left, but that did not prevent us from being fully involved and entertained. There is one thing that almost destroyed it and that was horrible music / songs. Blues, Country / Folk and Rock Ballads do not belong here and every time they are used, we all laughed. It's terrible. You have been warned, but the story and story keep you on the ground. There are some remarkable moments that make you appreciate the talent behind the room. There are many uses of silence as well as slow-motion photography that works nicely. I really wish I could delete the music, but unfortunately. Look for this. It's fun, it's different and takes you to places you would not expect and that's very refreshing.
