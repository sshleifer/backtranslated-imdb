Who would have thought such a dark film could be so haunting and emotional? I am very impressed. It is a shame that many people have not seen him. I liked, as always, Hans Zimmer's score. And what directorial debut of Bernard Rose? Still, I wonder if I should call this horror movie. One could easily argue that it is also a fantasy or a drama. Well, indifferent, I like the interpretative potential she has. Everything and everyone in Anna's dreams (interpreted by Charlotte Burke) represents a real conflict in her life ... the house itself, the tree, Mark, the lighthouse, etc. Many details like those that make the movie so good for repeated views. I hope I've met another small movie that's loaded with emotion and psychological sense like this soon.
