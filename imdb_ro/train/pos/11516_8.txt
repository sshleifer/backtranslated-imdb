I'm not a complete John Cleese (though I thought "Fawlty Towers was brilliant), but I'm a fan and when I saw this sitting, neglected, on a shelf at my local block, I decided to try. I got it was a wonderful surprise and one of the funniest 50 minute viewing experiences I've ever had. The lyrics are schlick "goon show" in English, in fact, as an audio sketch, this does not would be out of place on an "Firesign Theater" album, but execution and timing are on the scene, and this raises the "odd case" of the kind of performance that goes downhill, which can create British comedy fanatics throughout life. a gift for combining satirical lamps with remarkable character tics and synchronicity, and the creators use both the good effect here and the portrayal of Cleese's "Holmes" seems to be a great duty of Arkin's "Inspector Clouseau" but Cleese has such a talent for a physical comedy he owns more than his own, but the unexpected treatment here is Arthur Lowe, who portrays "Watson" as a brilliant imbecile but invincibly unintelligible with a moment so superb and deliverable that it becomes the best aspect of the movie. I never heard of Lowe before this (the background looks like a widow and a musical theater), but he justifies his entire career with this performance as far as I'm concerned. Some people may not care for the "strange case ...", especially if the British whim is not "cup cup". But I am extremely pleased to have seen this before it disappears.
