Sopranos are probably the series of minds you might ever want to watch. It's smart, it's weird, it's funny - and it carries the genre of the mafia so good that most people can not resist watching. The best aspect of this show is the overwhelming realism of the characters, who are in the underground world of New York's criminal families. Most of the time, you do not even know if the wise will stab someone in the back or buy their lunch. Continuing to add to the realistic approach of the characters in this show is the depth of their personalities - These are dangerous people, most murderers, but also God if you do not love them too. I laughed at their bangs, I was broken when they were wrong and they felt scared of the cruelty of a serious killer. The suburban setting of New Jersey is absolutely perfect for the subject of this show - people are not always as they seem, and the strong contrast between humor and the actions taken by these seemingly juvenile offenders weigh to the odds. <br /> <br /> If you have not already done so, you should.
