It's always nice to see Angela Bassett to do a role he can dump with his teeth. She is sometimes intense, funny, and even sexy in her role as Lena, a "colorful" woman forced to make her home on a desert bench just outside Cape Town, South Africa. Danny Glover is also good in a role that is not entirely as sympathetic as her partner, Boesman. Willie Jonah gives a fine, nuanced look as a stranger who discovers the new living area of ​​Boesman and Lena. You often do not have the chance to see a smart film that deals with mature themes. Although based on a play, young director John Berry (who also directed Claudine) opens the material by filming the movie in a widescreen Cinemascope format. It also keeps things interesting from a visual point of view through the creative blocking of actors and by showing us the things just mentioned in the play. Like Diahann Carroll in Claudine, John Berry could have directed Angela Bassett in an Oscar nomination. This is definitely a movie worth looking for.
