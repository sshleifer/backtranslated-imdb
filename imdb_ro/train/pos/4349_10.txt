Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) comes to his son unexpectedly. His son, Ben Kleinman (Paul Reiser), is quite surprised to hear that his mother, Muriel Kleinman (Olympia Dukakis), left his father's wife, Rachel (Elizabeth Perkins), his three sisters trying to find Muriel while Ben and his father go to see a farm that's for sale. But this is not the end of their journey. Their trip turns into a long therapy session between Ben and his father. Raymond De Felitta is the director (2005). Paul Reiser is behind the script and he has done a remarkable job. The dialogue between Ben and Sam is just amazing. And he's been working on the script for twenty years, so it's no wonder he's fine. Who would better play father than Peter Falk? Nobody can tell you that. And I really like the story why Paul wanted Peter Falk for this song. Peter was an actor who made his father laugh. And Peter made me laugh in this movie. go fishing. And as the old man beats the youngest in the game of the pool and then beats him with the stick. The movie is often very funny and I woke up laughing several times. But it can also be tapping from time to time. You could not tell a better story than it says here.
