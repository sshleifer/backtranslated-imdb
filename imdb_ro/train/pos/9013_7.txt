Although this film has some weaknesses, it is worth seeing. We chose it because of distribution and I applauded Bonham Carter and Branagh for choosing the roles different from those they had taken in the past. Both portrays people who are very upset, wicked, but they like it because of their humanity. The story touches, but the shows rise. "Jane" by Bonham Carter is a remarkable achievement, whose search for romance has opened my eyes to the aspects of being disabled that I have not thought before, but it was interesting for other reasons as well. I felt that the movie ended too abruptly, but better than an emotionally finished route of manipulation (see Stepmom). The very real English setting added my joy - it was England in the '90s, both urban and rural, without being depressing.
