I saw this series when I was a kid and I loved the details that he entered and I never forgot. I finally bought the DVD collection and how I remembered. This is how it should be a doco, impartial and factual. The movie is incredible, and the interviews are fantastic. The only other series I've found equal is "Die Deutschen Panzer". I just want Hollywood to sit down and watch this series, then make some great war movies. > <br /> Note. Brethren Band, Rescue Private Ryan, Letters from Iwo Jima, Our Father's Flags and When the trumpets fade away are some that I would recommend
