On the surface, this is a romantic post-war comedy. Under the veneer, is a MGM character casting stunt character at its most funny. Pipelines are simple, but all secondary are much against the guy. Margaret Hamilton (aka Witched Witch of the West), Edward Everett Horton (obsessive-compulsive professional fussbudget), and Sig Ruman (The Marx Brothers in _Night In Casablanca, and the Wonderful _Night At The Opera_), an intentional band, trying to bring the two cases together instead of distancing them, as would their "ordinary" characters. She also has fun at many romantic conventions, which is another indication that this may not be so much a "straight" romantic comedy, because it is a bleak reference to the many post-war romantic comedies and their characters in two dimensions. once with interruptions, so it can not be positive, but this movie may be one of those that worked better in the context of the time it was made, but it is less successful now that viewers see these second characters completely different lens. I suppose this is the case when I give him nine stars. I thought it was hysterical.
