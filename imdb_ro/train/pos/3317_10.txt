Bette Midler is again divine! With humor. In love with Burlesque. Capable of bringing you tears either with old jokes with new dresses or with old songs with more power and punch than ever. Also in all the new ballads to sing, vigorously singing the old / good perennials such as "The Rose"; "Stay with me" and yes, even "Wind under my wings". The best way to appreciate Divine M has always been free - since this is the best thing for him, we all have recommended a mixture of delight and appreciation for the older-looking adults and the child's wicked desire to push all the borders!
