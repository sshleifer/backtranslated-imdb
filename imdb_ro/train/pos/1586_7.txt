Rosenstrasse is more of an intimate film than one of the epic proportions that could have kept many movie visitors away in search of a pianist-like plot. Fortunately, Von Trotta, a good screenwriter, opts for a feminist vision in an era too illustrated on her colorful exterior, but too little analyzed from the point of view of intimacy and from the point of view of ordinary Aryan Germans, rather - a Jewish point of view. Rosentrasse finds its strength in these unknown burdens of people trapped in the historical circumstances of which they appear as victims. The rhythm of the film is introspective, slowly, slowly, meditatively. In addition, the characters are so alive, while the transitions between generations and the passage of time have been thoroughly crafted. Rosenstrasse is not a masterpiece, and some narrative defects are well discussed. Another mistake lies in a banal cinema unable to capture the intensity of the domestic drama experienced by the characters. However, this movie is worth seeing. Finally, Rosenstrasse is part of the latest trend in German films dealing with the ghosts of a hairdressing past, a trend that includes so many excellent films like Nowhere in Africa and recently the controversial Descent. I would recommend this movie to those who know to read beyond the images.
