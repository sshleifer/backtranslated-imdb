Sabrina's teenage witch was one of my first T.V lifetime shows: I used to track back back episodes everyday when I got home from school. So far, I think I've been watching each episode at least once and the whole series three or four times. Melissa Joan Hart plays perfect teen girl / witch with normal teenage problems that we all can relate to. It's funny, smart, full of witchcraft and much more. Caroline Rhea and Beth Broderick fit so well with Sabrina's aunts. Zelda, intelligent scientist, and Hilda, strange, strange, make a perfect balance in Sabrina's life. Although I have to agree that college years are not as good as high school years, but that does not mean they were not good yet. I think the conclusion was wonderful, though it was not what we hoped, it made sense, and I loved it anyway. :)
