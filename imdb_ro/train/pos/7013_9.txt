Featuring a fascinating performance by Will Smith and a story that draws on your hearts harder than a solo rock guitarist, "Seven Pounds" is flowing after The Pursuit of Happiness, a movie he's been filming, I also loved it. Remember the name of Gabriele Muccino because some of his films can jump without noticing if the actor attached to the project is not quite tall. <br /> <br /> Too bad I realized the Will Smith scheme from the beginning of the year, I put two and two together when he called in his suicide in the first scene and the scene in which the character of Rosario Dawson is introduced as an incurable heart, but I still think the writer / director has made the right choice to highlight the lyrics (the books are the first and last scene), so it is the source of the urgency and tension in the film, gradually discovering how precise it can be led a man to that final sacrifice, and it was hard to see that the relationship between the character of Smith and Dawson flourished and developed, knowing everything in store for the two bad luck. One of my friends with whom I saw the movie thought that Smith's character might have a divine gift and understand why: his performance is almost angelic in the presence of his seven elected, yet at other times he might be harsh and frightening, and when alone the maximum weight of his situation has reached too much for him and he is completely decomposed. It's a pretty versatile performance. Finally, I can not forget to mention the re-adoption of the crash scene, which was really amazing in terms of cinema-related music. Put it on your list.
