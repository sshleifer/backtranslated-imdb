For anyone who is waiting for a traditional superhero movie, it could be an unpleasant surprise. It is certainly more a drama than a action movie. It focuses mainly on emotions and is a bit like a Greek tragedy - no matter what the main character, it always goes wrong in some way. That's because Sasha, like every superhero, takes the law into his own hands and society does not appreciate that. Sasha becomes a scandal. While on the run, she meets a beautiful girl and falls in love so that things get even more complicated for him. As you can see, the plot itself is very dramatic, but the movie does not have a dynamic. I can easily remember the narrative from Ram Gopal Varma's recent films. Everything happens very slowly. However, when there is an action scene, it becomes so immense that before you figure out what's going on, it's over. But the director does not want to impress us with a spectacular and spectacular action. What is most important here is the result of Sasha's actions, which are largely very drastic. The score is very low, making it even more difficult to focus on the film. So practically you have to be very patient to watch it. Is the movie worth it? This is a truly difficult question to answer. I do not think that this experience has enriched me so much, but in a way I kept thinking about this movie and feeling that I was following it again. Mainly due to the atmosphere, which is very dense, but not suffocating, because all the time Sasha and Katya have hope. After all, there are young people who have all their lives to live. So no matter how tough it is, there is always a slight melody when they are together.
