Maman et Putain must be seen as a film that is linked both to the time when it was released (post-68) and eternal in many respects. Actually, the actors do not "act" ... I really talk a lot ... But what I'm talking about is just what makes life worth living ... or die. The very long monologue, spoken by Françoise Lebrun, is probably the most accurate and fastest written text about woman, manhood and love. It's not easy to translate accurately. This movie is a statement about the difficulty of being a man and woman (or two women in this case). And IMHO, Jean Pierre Léaud is one of the greatest French actors.
