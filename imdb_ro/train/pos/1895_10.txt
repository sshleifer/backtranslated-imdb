I have watched it all along Christmas, I do not know why, but it reminds me of Christmas, so I looked at it, so we are. <br /> <br /> Arthur is a movie that I watch with a great smile on my face and a mix of special performances, a cheerful music and a script that cracks with the spirit and the charm that provokes it. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore makes a character that can be very ugly (the wounded, rich, lazy man who feels bad for him) but turns him into a person you love. Liza Minelli is wonderful as Linda Morolla, a queen-like waitress, who manages to pull out the hard and soft lady in which Arthur almost quits his world. John Gielgud receives all the succulent lines and polishes them with pleasure. <br /> <br /> I can watch Arthur again and again and always make me feel good, check it out if you need a great movie lift.
