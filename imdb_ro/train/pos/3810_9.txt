this is my first review of IMDb, I did not really want to write, but since I'm only 2 for this great movie right now, I feel compelled to add my perspective ... and no, I'm not associated with film makers in any way (yes, yes, how often are you here before ;-)) FYI are at the end of my 20s <br /> <br /> First of all I have to admit that I really like animation movies , because what you see is limited only by the imagination of the creators and that they were quite imaginative for this. Not so from the point of view of the story, but also in the realization of a unique visual style and fresh imo. The characters look good, but they are far from real and work well for the movie, after all, it's a world of story. But the background and the world in general are filled with wonderful visions that have escaped my jaw several times while watching this. Blue Steel, like the mini-dragon rabbit, presents the show and has some of the funniest moments of the movie, it's already an instant classic, just like Ice Scrat. The story is not too surprising (a bunch of anti-heroes have to come out and kill the biggest dragon you can imagine) but cares about the movie that looks and sounds good HERE ;-) 1 thing I have to point out, imo film is not suitable for VERY small children because it has some darker scenes in it and maybe scary for children under 6-8 I would say, these are just very few scenes, but it is worth mentioning imo. Anyway, we had a great time watching this and can not wait to hit it in high definition stores to watch it over and over again just for its beauty. <br /> <br /> 8.5 for me
