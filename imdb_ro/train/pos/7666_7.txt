Two wizards struggle in the fourth dimension, one (Brian Thompson as a Kabal) trying to destroy the Earth, the other (Jeffrey Combs as Anton Mordrid) trying to save her "Doctor Mordrid" is a pleasantly enjoyable cheese pleasure. The plot is pretty bad and the gore is completely absent, but the movie is very short and fun. So, if you have enough time to kill, give it a look. My Rating: 7 out of 10.
