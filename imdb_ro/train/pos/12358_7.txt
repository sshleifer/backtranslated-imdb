the movie is more sophisticated and smart is exploring sexual tension than the American trials of 9 and a half weeks ... the sitting room scene itself ... with the couple caging in the cage while the heroin pleads for their orgasm .. it's amazing .. I did not see this movie in 20 years ... but it did a lot of pictures in my mind ... it is rich in texture and manages to create a world in which sex is the engine of all activities and at the end of it is horror the living yawn in all of us ... the plot is European, and he eats a bit, but also life ... especially when you are 17 years old and you have a strong constancy ...
