My rating refers to the first 4 seasons of the Stargate SG-1, which are wonderful fresh, creative and addictive. When the cast penetrated through the gate, you never knew what was on the other side! Beginning with season 5, the show had another focus - still good, but different. The series follows the adventures of a team of people (and a stranger) who regularly venture into a planetary transport device called the Stargate. The backstory of the series is based on the characters and events in the movie "Stargate", in which the camera is discovered during an archaeological excavation in Egypt. Episodes are light (innocuous and easy to follow) and very creative. Many of the inventive stories could easily have been transformed into fantastic SF movies. What happens next has always been unpredictable. The characters on which the show is based are also well-defined and brilliant. Their tone is serious, but the dialogue is blooming with incredible sense and humor. They are simply fun to watch. Beginning somewhere around the 5th season, the series began to evolve into a continuous story based on the fight of one enemy (Goa'uld, then Ori). Plots become more complex (more politically / strategically oriented) and interdependent. The characters were as big as ever, but the show was of a different nature. One thing to mention is watching the episodes that have commemorated episodes 100 and 200. They are simply not missing shows. They are exposed to the creative and humorous genre that wore the series in 10 seasons. If you're a science fiction fan, watch some episodes from the first 4 seasons and you'll probably be tilted. If you like story lines that develop between two sides, you have 10 seasons of shows that look forward to.
