Quick and funny satire about that original "real TV," soap opera. The scriptwriter Robert Harling's script is packed with a single lining and ridiculous situations. The best of them is the climax, a live broadcast that rapidly deteriorates in bad improvisations and brain transplantation. Keven Kline kills his lines, because he does not wear glasses, he is hilarious. Her brain will explore sideways in the next few houses. Bright distribution is on the same page as Kline. Sally Field, Elizabeth Shue, Cathy Moriarty, Robert Downey Jr., Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher, Garry Marshall and Kathy Najimy are perfect. It's a treatment to see a cast click as in this movie. This is a classic that has slipped somehow through cracks. Alan Silvestri's score is an extra bonus. It fits the soap opera with the flamboyant and melodramatic air.
