"GOOD TIMES", in my opinion, must be a CBS hit! Despite the fact that I have never seen an episode, I'm glad. It's hard to say which is my favorite. I also love the thematic song very much. If you ask me, even if I would like everyone, it would have been nice if everyone had been in the show throughout the round. Everybody always did a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, although it can be seen in TV Land now, I strongly recommend that you catch it only if it extinguishes from the air forever.
