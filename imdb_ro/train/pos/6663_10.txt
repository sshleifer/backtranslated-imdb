This film is about a dysfunctional family, but not just a dysfunctional family. It is the family of our nation's father (India), although the film focuses mainly on the relationship between Mahatma Gandhi and his eldest son Harilal Gandhi. It shows how Mahatma had to kill M.K. Gandhi, how he had to sacrifice his family life to achieve our freedom. Every time Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and his son will try to approach, Mahatma will come between them. This is a beautiful movie made. Akshaye Khanna turned out to be a top actor. He expressed his emotions very naturally. Darshan Jariwala, who plays mainly in Plays-Gurukant Desai's lawyer in Guru, played Gandhi wonderfully (as a real human being, unlike Ben Kingsley that made him look like God) Shefali Shah from Monsoon Wedding did , also to show how Kasturba Gandhi was broken between father and son. This film touches and so is the "Raghupati Raghava" soundtrack sung in a very unique way. I saw this movie just 3 hours ago (it was released in Dubai a day earlier - on 2) and when the movie was over, it was "Pin Drop Silence," and while going out of the theater, not one person pushed another the Indians do not push us?) NOT ONE! It was a Sacred Sacrament ...
