"Toi le Venin" is the masterpiece of Robert Hossein and one of the great thrillers of the 1950s. Based on a novel by Frederic Dard, a writer with whom the director has often worked (see also "le Monte-Charge" that Hossein was not driving, which was also full), the script draws you from the first pictures on a road desert at night, where a beautiful blonde could be the most aggressive of the criminals in the mysterious house where she finds fatal females and her sister. Start a cat and mouse game. A source is in a wheelchair. But is it really disabled? Which one is the killer who tried to kill the hero that night? <br /> <br /> The two actresses, Marina Vlady and late Odile Versois, were sisters. Turn off all lights before watching. Very suspense.
