this movie was pretty awful The last film of Vipul Shah was good, this is just a bad thing though it's a good story and is manipulated in a wonderful way Aatish Kapadia who adapted this movie from another game gujarati "Avjo Wahala Fari Malishu" made a good piano 2 and a half hours to notice that there are many flaws in this movie but it's still a rather disgusting melody of fun and does not work well but they're still good on the whole, a movie you've been watching with enthusiasm is still a story to consider and it's good if you're the kind of pretty good movie relationship with a lot of flaws and humor that really does not even need a bit
