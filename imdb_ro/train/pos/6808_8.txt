The "Cold Blood" movie in 1967 was probably more like "the real thing" (Think: would we really want to see the real thing?), But it was black and white in a colorful world and many people do not even know what it was, and there was an opportunity to remake it for television. In addition, if you remake it, you can show some things that are not displayed in the original. Truman Capote's "Cold Blood" book was the first novel "nonfiction". Truman's book was not really 100% true to the real story. I thought the Canadian location was enough for Kansas for a TV movie. Look for the elements of sex, drugs and rock'n'roll: Dick's wife, Perry being an aspirin drug, Perry playing guitar blues.
