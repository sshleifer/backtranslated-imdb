I and two sisters have watched all 3 series of Tenko and I agree that this is by far one of the BBC's best series. All the cast was very compelling in the parts they portrayed and although the third series was somewhat slower was the compelling viewing and my evenings to be the same without it. Doubt that we will be watching it again because it is a series that I would not hurt to watch. Excellent viewing and complete bookmarks for the BBC for such a brilliant series and casting. First rate in all departments and would recommend this series to anyone, although some age limits need be considered due to adult material. As grateful BBC for releasing this series on DVD and video.
