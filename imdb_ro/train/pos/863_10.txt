I was completely involved in this movie from the first to the last minute. It is shot brilliantly, with lots of interesting and original shooting angles and techniques used. The plot surrounds a deaf woman who is chosen by friends and colleagues. She hires the assistant at work with her true intention of finding love. He is an ex-con, and she takes advantage of him to avenge those who have hurt her. Instead, she needs to help him with a heist who needs lip reading skills to get him out. The film transcends a black film with some really excellent scenes and a finer and better one. The real beauty of this film comes from how the director takes advantage of the disability of the main character. The use of sound keeps consistent tension, and dramatic changes from silence to noise keep pumping blood, which is for sure. Drop into a little black comedy and subtleties of sexual erotic repression, you get a great movie. It's the kind of movie Hollywood really wants to do, but he can not.
