This film has a rotten core of flexible morality and yet a strange sense of justice. So many of the common Joes among us would prefer to "miss MAN". "MAN" in this case is represented by several different characters. Mr. Keller, whom Carla reports to her office. Later, Paul owes $ 70 to Mr. Marchand the club's owner. And then there's Paul's officer. There seems to be so many questions about the story of the last character. Reporters emphasize it as a weakness in a well-prepared underground ping-pong game between the two protagonists who grow up for the tat until their life changes dramatically. They are attentive to every agent of "man." One or both of them could be fired, killed or imprisoned if they do not do as they say. The film has a feeling of relief at the end. Carla is finally set. Her boss is forced to be a bastard. Mr. Club Owner is a pulp mess in his own bathroom. They receive $ $. And ... he does not have to worry about reporting to the password officer, because his moral weakness leads him to master his wandering wife in the basement (or whatever the police found to arrest him). It's a subconscious critical trigger for the lock glass that has hurt us so tightly. Do not worry that someone else can later receive Paul's file to oversee his release; for now they are free! She might even get rid of her! <br /> <br /> Woohoo ... <br /> <br /> They STUCK it to man!
