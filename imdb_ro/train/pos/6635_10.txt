What can I say about the first movie ever? You can not evaluate this because it should not be fun. But if you have to evaluate it, you should give it a 10. It's amazing to see moving images from 1895. This was one of the most important films in history. I wonder how it was to be one of the people who ever saw the first movie ever!
