Men can spit Lollo if they like it (or lollos - she gave her name in a French slang term), but the ladies have an even more tasty piece in the divine Gerard Philipe, which is not only beautiful, can act. Do not stop if your version has no subtitles, because in this simple and daring story of love and war, in which everything is right, are not necessary. All you need to know is that at the beginning of the film, Lollobrigida reads Philipe's palm and tells him he will marry the king's daughter. Later, the story is quite clear from Gallic gestures and from running, jumping and spiritism. With regard to the minus, the accentuation of the tough storyline and tone arrangement becomes somewhat exhausting, and it is annoying that the French appreciate being too superior to Hollywood to disturb even the plausibility of its exciting cascades. And, of course, the non-French speaker occasionally missed ooh-la-la, such as: The virtuous girl: I have to tell you that my heart belongs to Fanfan. Seducer: My dear, what made you think I was interested in that bagatelle?
