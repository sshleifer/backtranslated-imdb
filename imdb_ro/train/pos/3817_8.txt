If you had a drama in your own life, be it your own, or a close person, the stages of pain that this woman (but in my opinion, it would have been a man easily) I see are very real. It's a movie about the impossibility of coping with pain, about the fact that you do not know what to do to help you get through it. Obviously, it's also a movie about not knowing how to help someone close to you go through their pain. It's a movie that makes you realize that everyone is alone in their suffering. It's a movie that could push someone over the edge ... which does not seem to be a recommendation. I'm not sure I'd recommend someone to see this movie, especially someone close to me, but for me ... it's a movie that puts things in perspective that shows real pain and is therefore very relevant to being in life. Makes you realize that hey, you or the person near you has experienced pain, that hey, all the things you worry about now are of such a small importance
