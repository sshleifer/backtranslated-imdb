I found the film quite expressive, how the main character was lost, but at the same time more clear about certain things in life than those who mocked him (for example, his colleague). you liked to look at him tortured! had this perverted part that was terrible, but we were all happy to see him go out of misery again. He was a gambling character or a pan-man man through a mine or enemy and we like to look at him under a sniper or fire attack but then at the end we are happy to see him survive ... <br / > <br />
