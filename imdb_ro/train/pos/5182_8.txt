A nostalgic, quiet, sweet and beautiful film about how to confront your old friends and youthful surroundings with all the memories and problems and troubles of the present with you. A movie that makes you feel good. All the ingredients are here: old jelousy, rivalry, friendship and loyalty. Mischief, night-time refrigerator raids and all the other fun things we all remember in our summer camps. All the characters are given the opportunity to experience this once again because the old camp leader is now withdrawing and wants to meet with the children of the golden years of the camp. Everyone is now thirty and in the middle of his career.
