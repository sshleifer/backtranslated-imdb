A well-done film with a tragic ending. Pluses: The way the story moves - begins with Soorya struggling to live, followed by a long retrospection of what is there. The music. A disinterested look at the life of the cops. Minuses: Violence and gore, but I think they add to realistic effects. However, the heads of people cut and shipped in boxes and bags could have been avoided. There are no complaints - 7/10
