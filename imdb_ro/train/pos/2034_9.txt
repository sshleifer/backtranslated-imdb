I've never been huge on IMAX movies. They're cool, but once you get over that initial rush of "Whoa, I feel like you're flying!" movies themselves are usually quite strange and ordinary. <br /> <br /> Exceptions were the powerful "Everest", "Wild California" and "The Human Body" of the BBC, a glimpse into the inside of our body. <br /> <br /> Our bodies are machines of a complexity that is simply unthinkable. This 50-minute movie could last for 10 hours and still can not reach all tandem systems, as I write this review and listen to my radio, and most of us give it all. <br /> <br /> Here you can see the inside of the pumping heart (looks like an alien ship), the inside of the lungs, the little hair of the eardrum that processes the sound, the development of a baby inside an uterus, and surprisingly a few less attractive features that I thought would be shy (pimples, churning acids in the stomach ...) This movie also has a pretty funky style that differentiates it from other IMAX documentation. For example, we've all seen that sperm find its way to the egg, but have you ever seen it in the tone of Marvin Gaye's "Let's Get It" movie? There are creative moments like those that make the "Human Body" not just a health lesson, but also fun.
