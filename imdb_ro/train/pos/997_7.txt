I have to agree with most other posts. Was it a comedy? drama? for me he leaned a little to the comedy side. I could have been a great comedy movie and it was great. Jamie continues to run into Julio and what is his name. In New York, whenever you meet someone you know in downtown Cleveland. And how could Robert Pastorelli dig the Yankee stadium to hide gold. Again, a comedy or a drama? But it was still fun especially for a Sunday morning. I liked the performance of Kimberly Elise, she is certainly a beautiful actress and seems to take her job seriously. She is a younger actress who will be viable.
