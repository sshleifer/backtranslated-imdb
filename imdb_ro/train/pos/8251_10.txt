And I'm somebody. And not only me, as I see here at IMDb or when I leave the theater. Why did they love people? It's obvious: Everyone knows zombies so far (at least the Horror fans from the heart and the others by reinventing Dawn of the Dead or Resident Evil, etc.) Or at least they thought they knew everything about the zombie ... which is up when this movie came along. And you will see zombies in a new light (maybe). This is not a horror movie, although it contains some violent scenes, but it's rather a comedy. A satire must be precise. And he never turns away! That's why I rated him so tall. Wise Pacing is incredible, the actor is great and the script does not have mistakes (obvious) ... on the contrary: it's a jewel and if you're less interested in zombies, you should see it! And even if they do not like them, watch them! Because it's a great movie (comedy)!
