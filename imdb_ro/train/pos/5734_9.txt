I think I'm a great admirer of David Lynch's work, because it gives viewers an absolutely unique movie with typical elements "Lynch". After seeing most of his works, I thought naively I could anticipate Lynch's next step. I was wrong wrong. Dumbland is something I'd never imagined as David Lynch. However, after recovering from the first shock, I began to think about this extremely primitive main character and concluded that all the absurdities, cruelty, brutality and disgust presented here reflect the bits of reality, underlining its distortion. There are things in our lives that we never question, because they are either disgusting or horrible, yet they surround us, so I have the courage to say, Dumbland focuses on these pieces. It's not a movie to enjoy, though sometimes laughing at a strange, perverted humor, this is an animated reflection of all the things that we rather reject with simplicity, morbidity and absurdity. Take it as such, you do not have to like it. It simply exists. And, finally, if you are careful enough, you will also find typical Lynch elements. I recommend it for tolerant people !!!
