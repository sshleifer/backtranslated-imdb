the courageous story ........ voted ten against all the media for my age and sex ... not so much comedy (compared to a movie almost damp on myself), though quite amusing. is not a fan of musicals, so probably too much for me but give you time to take a drink or soda without losing anything important. maybe a 50-year version when Harry met sally? Ahab not really, but if he's in the top ten like mine, you'll love this movie. it really leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling, remembering what could and should be romance, something to be filmed. my summary describes it best in very few words ... quite charming
