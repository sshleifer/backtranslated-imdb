If you like Sci-Fi, Monsters and Ancient Legends, then you like this movie! <br /> <br /> Special effects are by far the best we have seen since Juarassic Park hit the big screen years ago. While the act would have been a little less than desirable, the story line and effects have appropriately compensated for it. I'd like to see this at the movies on a theater screen, TV screen. If you love non-stop action, wonderful visuals, and taste for myth and lore .... you must see this movie!
