I enjoyed this show so much, and I am so incredibly sad that it was canceled that I thought she was coming back but only two silly weeks. That's terrible. I do not like how we do not know how everyone ends up. is shit. Bring him back! ABC has stupid performances like Supernanny and not, but it does not give time to good ones like Six Degrees. If they complain about the rating, it probably had a bad slot because it was really a good show, something to which I could refer and anticipate. JJ Abrams has issued, it's great, I'd like ABC to trust him enough to complete the story. I liked the whole cast. I could not wait to see how everyone would meet at once. The whole story is now incomplete, now I will never know if Steven and Whitney or Carlos and Mae will meet. I wanted to see what happened to Laura or Damien and the others. This is really such a downer.
