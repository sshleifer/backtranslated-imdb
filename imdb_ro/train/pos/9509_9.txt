Wow, this movie was absolutely brilliant. I really do not know why everyone says it has a slow pace. I thought the rhythm was perfect. The film is about Michael Sullivan played by Tom Hanks with perfection, which is a kind of hit man / killer who works for John Rooney (Paul Newman). He does not like this, but he does it because Rooney has paid for his home and helps him financially. He had nothing, and Mr. Rooney gave him everything. But his children are not aware that this is his job, and when he is assisted with a cold blood crime, he is placed in a strange position. And when an atrocity occurs, he leaves with his son and leans for revenge. They steal slaves and much more and build a bond. They're the perfect team. Hanks does an excellent job as always, as well as Jude Law, who plays his creepy role in perfection. This drama is highly recommended because it shows a beautiful story and looks a lot like the 1930s.
