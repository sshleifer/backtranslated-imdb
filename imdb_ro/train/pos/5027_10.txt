I gave a movie of 10, because it had to be rewarded for the scary elements and actors, and my god to engage! The thing is, I do not want to tell anyone anything about the act or the story, because it will destroy the movie. But I recommend you go straight to the nearest moviestore now and rent it! (Do not forget popcorn!)
