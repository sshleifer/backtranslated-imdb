I thought this was an absolutely charming movie centered around the lives of Mary-Kate and Ashley Sam and Emma Stanton! Both try to make themselves and their happy parents happy; unfortunately it is not so easy for them to actually do! I thought this was a charming and sweet film and if you are a fan of these wonderful ladies, then I'm sure you will agree with me here! If you have not seen this movie yet, then I tell you that you have really lost; time, and you must definitely take the time to see it now! This movie is a real winner! Honestly, Rick Morris
