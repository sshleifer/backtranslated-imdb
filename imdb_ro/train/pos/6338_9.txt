I really enjoyed this movie I've seen a few times the original classic, but I do not remember any details. I think this movie is much better than the cartoon is not as white and black as it is. I really liked the way the girder made a complete character and gave a reason why it was the way it was, the villain in this movie was not Grinch, but the major, much different from the original painting. Jim Carrey was perfect for the play, all in a wonderful movie made for both children and adults.
