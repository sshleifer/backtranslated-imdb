"Before the devil knows you're dead" is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. The actor from the excellent ensemble is incredible. Philip Seymour Hoffman has a remarkable performance and is electrifying every time he's on the screen. Ethan Hawke fits the scene for the scene, and Albert Finney chews the screen. Marisa Tomei is, however, insufficiently used criminally, but looks amazing for 42 years. The script is excellent, the nonlinear story line, but fairly easy to follow. Sidney Lumet, though not known for his protagonists, has shown a gem with that!
