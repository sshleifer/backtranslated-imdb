He's singing. It has drama. She has comedy. He has a story. It is one of the greatest movies ever made ... period. If you can not enjoy this movie then you have to be asleep or some sort of psychological disorder. In "Yankee Doodle Dandy," James Cagney sings and dances his way to an Oscar; but in this movie he's better! This is James Cagney at his BEST quest! It's fast with those with one line! He's fast with his feet! It's a non-stop action. And song and dance songs are classical, especially "Shanghai Lil". And the supportive role is great; and the whole movie is optimistic, moving fast and exuding confidence. And even if this movie was made over 70 years ago, it's still visible, even today. And, of course, this film presents Miss Ruby Keeler (who was married to Al Jolson). She is the perfect partner for James Cagney ... and Dick Powell too! If you like optimistic, fast-paced movies with lots of songs and dances, this is the movie to watch.
