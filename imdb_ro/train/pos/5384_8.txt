I thought the movie was pretty well made for a movie made for television, and contained both a lot of action and humor. I discovered the value of entertainment that is worth watching and was watching again or a similar show again. I'm disappointed that Sean was not credited here on IMDb. I can see a possibility for a series of actions based on this concept or a sequel with Sean once again playing for higher "cash" stakes since his life will be on the line again anyway. I felt that Sean played very well and reminds me of an actor named Matthew Ashford who plays Jack Deveraux in our Days of Life - The Soap Opera.
