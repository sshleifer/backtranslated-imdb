During this time, this film had controversies written everywhere (such as most of Verhoeven's projects). Containing very graphic images, scenes of death; A parachuting that does not open the boys' body on the floor. A guy who's eaten by a Lion * chomp * teeth in his throat. And a guy that is run by a speed boat * zoom * bloody corpse goes down. But, apart from the gore, this film also contains some brilliant scenes (and amazingly beautiful) shot in the gray fisherman city, which is Vlissingen; Thousands of roses flying on the screen, in somewhat irrelevant part of the film, a beautiful (holy) woman who puts flowers in a box of milk, surrounded by blood-dropping blood plates and a scene of cloudy love between two characters male, in a cemetery. The story is completed in a perfect time, but for 10 minutes, which does not disappoint you and will allow you to breathe easily. Of course, with professionals come up against, some special effects are too over-the-top, and they are obviously made to see how far Verhoeven might push the gore-factor (for example, more eyes hanging from the sockets). Also, while the two main actors (Jeroen Krabbé and Renée Soutendijk) are doing a great job of breathing life into their characters, the character of Herman (presented by Thom Hoffman) is simply impressed, to care for me, even after his tragic death. I did my best to give you an easy idea of ​​what to expect from this amazing film and, as you can see, is not easy to sum up in words. So do yourself a favor, if you happen to find this movie somewhere, watch it! And enjoy the unique style and substance of this masterpiece.
