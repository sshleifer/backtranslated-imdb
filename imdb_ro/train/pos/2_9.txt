Bromwell High is not brilliant at all. Experienced script and perfectly delivered, this fiery parody of a student and professors at a South London public school literally leaves you laughing. It's vulgar, provocative, sorcerer and sharp. Characters are a caricature cross-section of British society (or more precisely, of any society). Following the escape of Keisha, Latrina and Natella, our three "protagonists", because they do not need a better term, the show does not move away from parodying any imaginable subject. Political fairness flies through the window in each episode. If you enjoy shows that are not afraid to have fun with any imaginable taboo, then Bromwell High will not disappoint you!
