Pandora's watch is one of the best thrillers you'll ever read and this is one of the best thrillers you'll ever see. An extremely faithful adaptation of John J. Nance's novel, which had a real angry script in the novel, is made even more here. <br /> <br /> Despite being made for television, this is fun first rate. The distribution is great and slips in the characters of the novel so well that you think it reads the novel. Richard Dean Anderson is heading out of Macgyver's shadow and offers the best performance of his career so far. Jane Leeves is her great role as assistant to the ambassador in a role that proves she can be a dramatic actor. Daphne Zuniga is great as Dr. Sanders and, despite character being a man in the book, works incredibly well. Robert Loggia, Edward Herrmann, Robert Guillaume and the rest of those who played the role are the best and fit with their Romanian counterparts. However, there are changes in the story, of course (including a slight change in the end), but these changes are good for the novel. The plot is realistic and very visible to believe in the way it presented it, making this film the best film set from the original film of the Airport. Production values ​​are high and, although the special effects may look as good as they did a decade ago, they work well. The sets are great, especially the CIA and the Oval Office, which shows that film producers have spent a lot of time doing that. It does not matter if you see this first and read then read the novel or vice versa. Just do both, and you will not regret losing four hours for this movie and no matter how long you need to read the novel. This will leave you breathless.
