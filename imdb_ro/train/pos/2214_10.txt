My family returns to New Orleans at the end of the 1600s in the early 1700s and watching the movie I knew it was a story my grandparents never talked about, but I knew it existed. I obviously look black as African Americans and others who can "pass" like white and chose not to. It's a tough history to look at when you realize it's about your family and the fact that the Cane River is part of that history. It makes me want to cry and makes me want to let go of my grandparents who owned those plantations and wondering wondering how my great-great-grandparents lived under that oppressive and yet aristocratic existence ... And at at the same time I did not get out of that history, I probably would not be the successful business woman I'm living today in a quite integrated world. The actress was both excellent and corrective according to the actor, but it is a film that MUST NOT be done. Anne Rice is incredible and I wonder why he writes "symbolically" about my family and I'm not. I recommend this movie to everyone. injure
