We start all our reviews with the following information. My wife and I watched nearly 100 movies a year in the last 15 years. Recently, we have been honored, receiving lifetime movies, any movie, at no cost! So we can see what we want whenever we want. The idea is that CRITICALS are counted for ZERO. Your local critics or national critics like Ebert are not really different than ourselves. The only difference is that they write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of films if they want it or not. Therefore, it is our belief that if you get money worth two hours of joy that is good enough for us! NEVER NEVER ever read or read criticism. We only care about our friends and those we know the same things as we do. Pretty good about it. This movie is very good. not only good, but very good. Critics are a bunch of morons. Just because there is nudity and language, they hate it. It was worth the ticket price and that's all you can ask for. It is not like that? Each film can not be a Candidate for the Academy. Stone Sharon is gorgeous and does a great job in the movie and mistresses me about what the hell I want critics
