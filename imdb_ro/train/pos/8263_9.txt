This movie, along with WESTFRONT 1918, is my favorite Pabst directed movies and I liked more than the more famous movies she played in Louise Brooks (like PANDORA'S BOX). Probably because both are very similar to the neo-realistic films that the Italians have perfected in the 1940s and 50s. This style film appealed for the use of non-actors (typical people) in everyday environments to create movies with intense and realistic implications. In this case, the film refers to the French and German coal miners, so the roles seem to be miners - not actors. The central conflict in which the film begins is that there is a huge mine located on the Franco-German border. Instead of a large mine, it is divided at the border, and German workers are not welcome in the French mine despite the fact that there is higher unemployment in Germany. This, the linguistic differences (fabulously illustrated in a stage in the dance hall) and World War I conspire to create a huge break between factions - resulting in a mentality WE vs. Later, an explosion causes a huge collapse in the French, and the Germans refuse to sit back and do nothing. By risking their own lives, they prove there is a real cohabitation between miners and men in general. The film is a strong critic of xenophobia and has tried in vain to get the German audience to see the futility of war and hatred. It was a superb movie with some of the most frightening and claustrophobic images I've ever seen. Given the history, however, the impact of the film was minimal at best. It is a real shame, as if this, WESTFRONT 1918, J√ÅACCUSE (Gance), and ALL of you in the WEST ZONE (Milestone) had great peace and harmony messages, but ultimately there were failures in the positive position of opinion public. So, historically, it is a stunning and sad relic that deserves to be seen.
