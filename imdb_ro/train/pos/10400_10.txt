Probably the best fantasy movie ever made. Superb color, spectacular sets, incredible, point-to-music Miklos Rosza, which is perfect for every scene and mood. The action is superb and what could have been rigid and demanding in smaller hands, but here the poetic dialogue is abil, sensitive (humor is subtle and charming as well). Doubtless Spielberg and Lucas were enthusiastic about this. Together with "The Four Feathers" (1939), one of the two best cinematic films released by Alexander Korda and London Films --- and one of the best films ever made. classical!
