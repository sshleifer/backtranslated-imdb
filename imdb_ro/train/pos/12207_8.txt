Go to see high-profile theatrical characters locked in the conflict against colorful and unusual settings, enlightened and imaginatively marked, courageously photographed, and everything was unexpected surprise details that a wiser and duller director would avoid or not think First? <br /> <br /> As usual, as well as director, Welles wrote the script and also played the hero? an Irish marine who has beaten the world and has seen his evil, but has still kept his trust in good eyes in the goodness of others? Unfortunately for him, he rebuilt this trust in Rita Hayworth, whose good looks hid a grim past and killer inclinations for the future? Was she married without love, with an impotent, helpless lawyer, acting like a gruesome lizard of shining Everett Sloane? <br /> <br /> There is a youthful romanticism that underlies everyone, and this quality has come in the exuberant game in "The Lady from Shanghai". Before the inevitable event, Welles escaped? to a triangular final showdown in a mirror room that has become one of the classic scenes of the post-war cinema? <br /> <br /> Welles did not miss a chance throughout the film to counter the words and actions with visual details that enriched the texture and increased the atmosphere? His apparatus seemed almost to comfort Rita Hayworth as the sun was playing with her hair and long limbs while she teased the young man's play on her web?
