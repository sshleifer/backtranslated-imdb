This film, as low as it may be, is one of the best psychological thrillers I have ever seen. If you accept that the budget is reduced from the start, you can appreciate how good a story is, how well the script is written, and how great it was for the filmmaker to produce something so wonderful with so little money . > <br /> All the elements of a great movie are here. Visual, though filmed on digital, were superb in places. The bizarre, sensational feeling of the movie is captured very well in the scene with the speaker dog, the scene was amazing. It's a great piece of work, but not in a pretentious way, and that's why I have a special respect for this movie. It is highly recommended for anyone looking for something unique and captivating, and differently to many of the repetitive movies that are there.
