This almost unknown jewel was based on a French farce - what I show and I want to say this as a compliment. <br /> <br /> Caroline (Lee) is courted by a wealthy Argentinean (Roland), who asks her father to marry in marriage. But Caroline is already married to Anthony (Colman), who just arrived on the plane and immediately released an audience reminiscent of the last time Caroline decided she was in love with someone else: a sculptor dilettante-ish (Gardiner). The film interprets the story of Anthony's strategy of dismantling Caroline from his sculptor and how this experience helps him with his Argentinean. It is perfectly expressed: Ronald Colman is the most sophisticated and charming, Reginald Gardiner is the most passionate, Gilbert Roland is the most exotic and Anna Lee is capricious. The film is greatly directed by Lewis Milestone (who also produced it); the whole production feels like a work of love. There are wonderful touches such as the Colman breaking frame and the camera approach, and the exceptional use of a sliding door with cabinets. It is a pity that it was not released on DVD - it is a kind of movie that can only wake up the interest for the classic movie.
