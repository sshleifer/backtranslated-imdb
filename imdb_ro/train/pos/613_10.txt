please, future writers, producers, directors - from this movie! I have never seen such a bold and original story created for the big screen. bold, because the script has steadily taken so many fantastic fantasy films avoided safely - a step toward something new, creative and bold. only when you think "Oh, I've seen this before" or "I'm sure that's going to happen now" - StarDust would make an unexpected twist and get you involved in the story more and more. <br /> <br /> The actors are wonderful - even the smallest part is interpreted with such great talent that it amazes me for the creators of this film. Robert De Niro is gorgeous and he interprets with such energy that he simply steals the show in every scene they are in. Michelle Pfeiffer is the perfect witch, and Claire Danes is a great choice for the innocent and loving star, Yvaine. Other big names make special roles. I had to fill everyone trying to give all the best for this movie. But once again, Neil Gaiman's story, all the small things he "invented" for this universe - simply remarkable. I watched this movie at a pre-screening today, the day before the official launch, and I hope it will be a huge success. There is so much humor, but also tense moments, as well as wonderful scenes. In the eyes of Yvaine, the "frivolities" of Captain Shakespeare, the passion of Lamia the witch - impressive, unforgettable <br /> <br /> For me, this is the best movie for 2007, watch it and enjoy < > <br /> 11/10 - Remarkable peace and love <br /> <br />
