My tutor friend is a well-written romantic comedy movie that has something akin to My Sassy Girl .. there are no kissing / sex scenes. Hollywood should learn more of Korean productions. Sex is not always necessary in a good romantic movie. The film is light-toned, with occasional CG cartoon scenes mixed in the film. I like part when Ji-Hoon almost kissed Su-Wan. The funniest moment is when Ji-Hoon hit Su-Wan's first love because he threw Su-Wan for another girl and will be daddy soon. How he became a father was revealed in the next scene, which brings smiles to the audience. Mao Points: 8/10
