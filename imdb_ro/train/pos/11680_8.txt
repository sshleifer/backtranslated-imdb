Ok, Clara Bow silent film from 1927, is a spin-off rain, with Bow playing the wild Hawaiian wild daughter of the local pineapple king who falls in love with the English trainee engineer - Clive Brook. Bow competes with the local widow (Arlette Marchal) for attention, but both women have a great surprise when his wife appears (Patricia Dupont). The prey wife is ready for a divorce until she finds out that she might be on the point of losing her fortune. The arc has a spare personality and has some extraordinary scenes: her nude opening bathroom, her hula in a grass skirt and the dog's rescue scene with Bow and Brook making their own stunts. <br /> <br /> Note: The IMDb credit list is wrong. The credits of the movie (from the DVD I received) cataloged Patricia Dupont as Mrs. Haldane - not Margaret Truax, as impressed by IMDb.
