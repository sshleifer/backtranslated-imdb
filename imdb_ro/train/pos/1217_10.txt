I was worried my daughter might get the wrong idea. I think the character "Dark-Heart" is a bit inappropriate and I do not like how he turns into a "medium" frog, fox, boy? I was wrong, this movie was made for my baby, not for me. She "gets" when she crosses my (under?) My Head. Of course I do not "understand." This is not one of the children's NEW videos, which adults will also do. This is directly for the young, and the crew knew what they were doing. There is no political junk. There is no magic key to save the world by ourselves, no one has the right to access the excess, and everyone is not happy all the time. And as side benefit, no one is MEY! ?? russwill.
