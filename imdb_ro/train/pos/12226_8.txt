I'm a fan of "serial killer" movies and I think this is an excellent entry into this category. Mary Giordano is also one of Alicia's top five creations. Totally memorable - as she really exists. I would have my side if there was a mystery to solve. She plays the character, as if she is doing her with her real life, with total confidence in everything she does. She looks sweet, honest, cute ... just like she's in real life. So, does it work? Yes, indeed, it is a kind of rebellion once again. This time it's not bad, it's too good and a little afraid to do things that seem over the law. But she does not do the things the ordinary teenager will do. Instead, he spends his time reading the detectives and solving the crimes. A clich√© abounds: a kind of revenge for his father's death, in a different way of vigilant style. At that time, Alicia seemed to play the same characters: rebellious, seductive, parentless, lonely. And that's what's happening here, but this time it's kind of crazy. Does not matter; she is still cool as a nerd. Check this out soon, otherwise Giordano will investigate why you did not ...
