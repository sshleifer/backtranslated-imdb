Written by the writer who wrote the excellent series of Dirty Cameras, which cataloged ACD adventures with Dr. Joseph Bell, we were looking forward to this and I was not disappointed. It was quite slow, with much emphasis on Doyle's frustration at Sherlock Holmes, which was very precise and excellent portrayed. It was an interesting and very good shot (a digital video, unusual for a vintage piece). The action was excellent, especially Tim McInnery and Brian Cox, although the actor who represented ACD, whose name I do not remember, impressed me with no end. An excellent character study that has about the same amount of twists as any normal case of Sherlock Holmes. See this if you have the chance
