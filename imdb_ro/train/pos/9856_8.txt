(spoilers) <br /> <br /> I was not sure what to think about the movie. Not too much of a children's movie. Surely he should be pursued with a parent because he includes death and death. But I was surprised that I was a little distracted by it. I was a little disappointed with the 81 minutes of my time. (and less without credits) And the trailer makes you think that rodents are a main creature. But, unfortunately, he tortures him. Right until the end of the movie. The two clips have docked the movie with 2 stars. But I recommend the movie. Even for a sequel. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span>
