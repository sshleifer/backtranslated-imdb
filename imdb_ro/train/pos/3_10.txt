"Everyone is a scene and her people have actors in it" - or something like that. Who the hell said the theater stopped at the orchestra pit - or even at the theater door? Why not audience participants have the theatrical experience, including the story itself? This movie was a great experiment that said, "Hey, the story is you and it needs more than your attention, it needs active participation." "Sometimes we bring you the story, sometimes you have to go to the story." No one will listen, but that does not mean it should not have been said.
