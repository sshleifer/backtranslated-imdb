It's not a brilliant idea to watch Hundstage if you are not 100% sure of mental stability because it will be severely tested with this movie, no matter how healthy you are. I have to say that Hundstage is an art film rather than an entertainment movie, so most viewers would not have the level of "maturity" to reach its delightful side. Kind of Tarkovsky movies, but different in a way. I, myself, can not say I had a lot of fun watching her. But it is a remarkable and exciting experience for those who are only thrilled by the Hollywood clich√©. Hundstage beats a right finger in the brain and scratches your mind everywhere. You can not just sit and take care, use the exclamations or watch your eyes wide open in the whole movie. A film similar to this style is Nachtgestalten, but it was considerably better and less violent. This, for example, is not for children or for those who are mentally or wicked. Most viewers would most likely give either a 10 movie or a movie 1. I give 9, because I saw the phenomenon with more stories in a movie in another movie and it was better. But this is a remarkable piece on its own. It's worth watching, but get ready to see something disturbing.
