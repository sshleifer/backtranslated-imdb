This is the kind of movie England can do in sleep, and that's a compliment. Thanks to the success of the very British comedies at the end of the early 20th century, especially the adaptation of the EM Forster novels, this Merchant-Ivory-like production was received in the light it brought when launched in 1992. It was an exceptional year for actress Miranda Richardson, who appeared as Jeremy Irons wife, who discovered that her husband had an adventure in the worst possible way in DAMAGE, and the IRA terrorist who eventually gives a wig and gets an ugly delivery in the CRYING game. Here she plays a quiet and quiet woman in Rose Arbuthnot, one who, along with Josie Lawrence, who plays Lottie Wilkins, embarks on a journey full of self-discovery. They joined a pair of unlikely ladies: a Caroline Dester, interpreted by the enigmatic Polly Walker, which resembles a vampire Louise Brooks (and not just the hair style she wears) and Mrs. Fisher (Joan Plowright). Eventually, the four will unite together, becoming deep friends only because the story is so full of spring and an overwhelming, dreamlike sweetness, almost foretelling it, but that's fine; is the movie he wants to be. Alfred Molina and Jim Broadbent (then relatively new to the American audience) complete the distribution as the husband of the two main characters, and as a whole, Mike Newell makes his film a living thing of nearly magical elements, full of quiet moments.
