As a fan of Paris Je'Taime, I went to see New York, I love you with great expectations. I left with pleasure with all my expectations. It was fun, sweet, fast and fun. The film starts with two hoppers (Bradley Cooper & Justin Bartha) trying to reach the same area, but wonders in which direction to go. It was funny, and then the movie goes in some of the best sketches I've ever seen anywhere. There were four of the stunning ones of all good. The four of us will start talking. One has Shia LaBeouf as a hotel bellhop who finds love in an old lady. The next one presents Orlando Bloom as a music producer dealing with a woman played by Christina Ricci. Another shows Anton Yelchin and Olivia Thirbly, as two people go to the ball, Thirbly's character being disabled. The best is Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman as an old couple. I will remind you that Nataile Portman makes an impressive directorial debut and writes a skit about a caretaker, and Ethan Hawke and Maggie Q are excellent as a flirting man and a prostitute. New York, I love you is certainly as good, if not even better than Je'Taime in 2006 in Paris. The projects are good, and the film shows how indie films really should be. The film, however, does not have so many famous directors like Paris Je'Taime, so it was fantastic to live up to its excellence. If you want to laugh, you see some dramatic dramatic effects, you see an amazing amount of wonderful performances and just have fun, then you definitely go to New York, I love you.
