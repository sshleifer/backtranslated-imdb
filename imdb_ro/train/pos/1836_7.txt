Time for a hit! Waqt Dir - Amritlal Shah Cast - Amitabh Bachchan, Akshay Kumar, Priyanka Chopra, Shefali Shah, Rajpal Yadav and Boman Irani. Written by - Aatish Kapadia Rating- *** <br /> <br /> Eureka! We have it! Yes, ladies and gentlemen, in Vipul Shah's Waqt, we probably found the first good-faith coup this year. Fitted with all the ingredients required for a Bollywood trading rate, "Waqt" has everything it takes for a movie to click with the Indian audience. It's the movie that makes a distributor feel happy and contemplate his next visit to Phoenix! In this "saga of Indian emotions" then we have a happy family (is not it always?) Three. Ishwar (Amitabh Bachchan), the transformed millionaire postman (do not ask how ... there is something about selling toys while delivering letters and everything that's serious - damn it!), Shefali Shah is a father loved by Aditya (Akshay Kumar). Ishwar must make a serious decision about his son's negligent attitude towards the responsibilities of life. His love for Aditya, however, has the consequence of postponing the grave problem. However, when faced with a situation that will test his race against time, Ishwar has no alternative but to throw Aditya out of the house - hoping that the new situation could make him more consciously in his life. But this assumed solution becomes a problem in itself, because the rupture between the loving father and the son grows, and the fences continue to grow. <br /> <br /> You do not have to be a rocket scientist to realize that such a story offers ample opportunities to infuse comedy and drama alike. So, before the interval, you have the funny, later annoying, comedy play of Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav; and post-interval there are go for your handkerchiefs between Aby and Akki! Writer Aatish Kapadia (also wrote the original Gujarati song "Aavjo Vhala Fari Malishu" on which the film is based) is doing a good job of preserving the narrative fluid. Dialogues tend to become inconsistent sometimes. It does not help that those songs appear as acne on a teenage face and mark the procedures. Obviously, some numbers could have been eliminated. On the steering front, Vip shows that he has a natural flair for stories. "Waqt," as well as his debut effort, "Aankhen," manage to keep you interested until the last drum. In a personal note, the emotion swing was boring for me. But, from the point of view of the audience's reactions, he was working on the handle. Eventually, "Waqt" is about its performance that rises to a whole point in the overall rating! Amitabh Bachchan is trustworthy as always. His energy is visible, so does his age! Shefali pitches in a finely nuanced performance and fits the superstar at every step. Boman and Rajpal bring the house with their historian. Priyanka has little to do than to perform a heroine's perfunctorial role. When everything reduces, however, "Waqt" is Akshay's vehicle. I have always argued that Akki is as good as the role he likes. Put it in a "Mujhse Shaadi Karogi" and it's fantastic, but in a "Bewafaa" it's terribly bad. Here Akki is probably the best. Whether it's his comical time or emotional performances, he's almost perfect. There is also an action scene for his fans! Ironically, his best effort was in "Aankhen" - with the same director and Big B next to him! "Waqt" is not a memorable movie at all. It is not one that will be featured in the better movies of our industry. But it's one for the masses. And at a time when the industry is desperately waiting for a universal hit, "Waqt" could just do trick! Abhishek Bandekar Trivia - This is Akshay Kumar's second consecutive film after "Bewafaa," in which he plays on stage during the peak! <br /> <br /> Rating - *** <br /> <br /> * Poor ** Medium *** Good *** * Very good ***** Excellent <br /> <br /> April 22, 2005
