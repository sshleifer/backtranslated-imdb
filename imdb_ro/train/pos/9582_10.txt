After I grew up on the streets of Detroit, MI and I had friends who traveled to New York balls, I fell into the lifestyle of a member of the House. I joined the house of Theieves. We have adapted the same rules as most homes, but we were professional brothers who would stimulate and commit credit card fraud to get the fabulous jewelery and clothes we wanted. I even learned to testify that I had checked and passed a driving license and paid them in over seventeen states until a jealous queen called the secret service and went to the federal prison. But I learned a lot from these queens in this movie and I recommend you to look at yourself. You can even read about how I grew up in Detroit homes here and about the criminal activity I paid. My Identity Schemes book is available for sale at Amazon dot com or Identity Schemes dot com. But trust me, it is much better than Paris burns because it's done since 2005.
