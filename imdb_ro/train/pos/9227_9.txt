Post-feminist display of cruelty and sadism. <br /> <br /> Sports alert! This understated jewel of a film tells the story of Flavia, a 16th-century girl of noble birth, surrounded by a monastery, after defining her father and indeed the entire society medieval Christianity by viewing an Islamic warrior fallen as a human figure, rather than a demon. Flavia can not accept the patriarchal rule of the monastery (explicitly affirmed in a scene where the bishop arrives flanked by soldiers and monks), Flavia begins to explicitly question the society in which it is found, and by opposing an entire system subjugation, repression, and violence, inevitably brings about a tragic end not only for oneself but for everyone around them. Far from the truth. This is a film illustrating the consequences of violence, the effects of patriarchal domination, the nature of rebellion and the corruption of the human spirit. I described it in the title of this work as "post-feminist," and ultimately Flavia's triumphs must always be corrupted, compromised, and perverted by men. Even the terrible end of Flavia is committed by men for men (women return and only monks look without fear.) As for the much-discussed violence: this is a description of the effects of violence and the horrors of a world condemned by religious excess. To be removed from violence would have limited the impact of the film, it would have cheated the film and allowed it to be assimilated in the patriarchal discourse it exposes. In addition, it is a realistic portrait of the medieval world. Very beautiful, brilliantly shot (especially by Florinda Bolkin and Maria Casares), which contains a wonderful score by piovani and still provocative after these years, Flavia is a classic of European cinema.
