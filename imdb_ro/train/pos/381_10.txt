I gave this film 10 not because it is a very consistent film, but for its pure ability to evoke emotions in its audience. The story of the one-woman fight against all is an old clich√© so far, but very few films have taken it with so much warmth and sincerity as The Purple Color. have shown another part of the African-American experience - showing that after the slaves have been freed, many have fallen into the path of the "white man" ugly and have been abused by their own people. I think this is an important aspect because it contrasts with the trend of portraits-white-on-black-violence-and-win-oscar. Also, the acting shows are superb - especially Oprah, who now have a new respect found for. Well worth watching - but keep some tissue at your fingertips.
