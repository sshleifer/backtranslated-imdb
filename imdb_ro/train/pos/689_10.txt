Maybe I'm identifying myself with this movie because I live in NYC and suffer from bad insomnia, but no matter what it is, I have to praise the director for an amazing job. to do what he did without a budget ... wow, that's all I can say. indeed, very good. that no money has been spent on this movie and has still let me go. i definitley suggest checking if you can. great director, fantastic score and, of course, a script that will beat you on your ass. to be seen.
