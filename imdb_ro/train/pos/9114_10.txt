Taking into account the lack of art in African cinema (or Black American Cinema). The idea provides a multidimensional perspective on a community distributed to hoods and dealers. But the funny thing is that this is not at all focused or even the subject of the short. But the unstoppable assertion of independence from these themes is the most adherent. Gender is unique and not typical. It's almost this departure that first grabs the eye, so viewing it twice is critical. The film has an aesthetic quality that gives it its true cinematic art. And this is the true art, with an extremely rare African voice. The film does not copy to reach its message, innovates and causes subtle stereotypes (not racial stereotypes, but based on characters). From the writers' perspective, the movie is brilliant. Makes multiple messages that include fast character development. We have to remember that this movie is less than 10 minutes and manages to establish its character very quickly. The use of texture and colorful music is also recommended. But given the director, Owen Alik Shahadah's last venture, 500 years later, music is expected. But from a point of view, it seems that the idea is a departure, but satire indirectly circumvents a social problem - brilliant things!
