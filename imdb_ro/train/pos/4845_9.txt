Hello Playmates. I recently watched this movie for the first time and it's also my first experience by Arthur Askey, I have to admit I was very impressed with this movie. As a fan of black and white films in general, the pimlico passport, mob lavender and Tommy Trinder (who is apparently a distant relative), this film appealed to the fact that it offered good old British humor. I notice that there are some who have criticized Askey's performance, but in my opinion the test of time is an excellent example of comedian comedy of forty and if something adds to the image by creating characters that are more than just stereotypes seem to dominate the movies now. If you manage to take on this film, I would recommend keeping it, shame, in general, these films are not presented Sunday afternoon. I am also glad to have had the opportunity to watch another piece of work by Arnold Ridley (Private Godfrey in the father's army). Thank you
