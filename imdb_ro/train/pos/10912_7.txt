"Ex-Mrs. Bradford" (1936), with the star of the Thin Man star William Powell (the movie was released the same year as the second Thin Man movie, After the Thin Man, comes close to duplicating the fun and the style of the slim, but still desirable, but it's a wonderful fun and mysterious crime mystery in the same comic life. It would be hard to call him a replacement better than Jean Arthur. and co-star William Powell is real and fun, romantic and implicit. by Anthony Vieller and production company partner John Wyne, James Edward Grant ("The Angel & The Bad Man") is almost there with an effort Thin Man, but he does not have a bit of intelligence and sizzle. <br /> <br /> While not in the thin film stratosphere (what else is it?), "Ex-Mrs. Bradford" is one of the more fun of the dozens and dozens of mysterious comedy "Who Did It" of the years '30 and '40.
