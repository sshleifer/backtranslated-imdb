This is certainly one of my favorite episodes. There are so many things that happen in this movie, that its cold madman. First of all, the guys are heading for an alien planet that will explode. They meet a strange type of librarian (very well played). Then, Kirk manages to get back to what looks very much like the sixteenth-century land. McCoy and Spock are trying to follow, but instead of frozen near death to the frozen version of the 100,000-year-old alien world. Kirk manages to get stuck and accused of witchcraft, while Spock enjoys a long time with a sexy cavalier that has been defeated by the wandering and terrifying world of a bad guy. Spock decides he is happy if hes and gives McCoy a royal appreciation when the dock suggests that he has to look for a way out. In any case, all escape, leaving behind the poor. It takes a ton of conviction before Spock finally gets out and leaves. You can literally taste the sadness at the end. Leaving the cave alone in the frozen wilderness seems cruel and even touches. Spock must have been out of his volcanic mind to leave behind his greatest hope of being human. Although, in a neighborhood that is not so beautiful! Anyway, you just got so much kick for your dollar with this episode .... A love story, the Salem witch trials, Spock as a man, the desperation to remain in complete isolation ... abandoned and three completely different settings on the planet alien. Amazingly they've managed to bomb it all in a fifty-minute film. This is a classic, do not miss him .... I want to DVD vul vulcans shure !!!!!!
