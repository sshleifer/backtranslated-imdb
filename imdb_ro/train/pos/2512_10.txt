Being a great fan of the Japanese singers Gackt and Hyde, I was very excited when I found out they were making a movie together and they made my mission alive to see it. I was not disappointed. In fact, this movie has far exceeded my expectations. Knowing that both Gackt and Hyde are singers rather than actors, I was ready for courageous performances but not really performance, but I'm pleased to say that they both managed to keep me captivated and believe in the story just like continued. Moon Child has just the right amount of humor, action, love and serious moments, hearts. I can not say that I have ever complained about a movie and these more delicate moments are admirably acting by the pair, in my opinion, proving their skills as actors. The battle scenes are absolutely stunning and although there are some moments of uncertainty to get started, you're quick to get into the movie and start connecting with the characters. I recommend everyone to this film, especially to those who are fans of Gackt and Hyde.
