Mirage (1990) is a very rare horror / cold in 1990, released here in the UK on the label "New World Video". It's a desert-based horror film about a group of young friends who are weekend parties, just to be killed one by one by an unknown force driving a blacksmith truck! This movie has some horrific scenes, and some gore here and there, but I have to say that the act was so lame, even low budget standards! But the movie was oddly addictive and I liked it, and I never fell asleep or stopped it, which is always a good sign! I almost gave this movie 6/10, but I saw how she steamed along the road, had good moments of gore and suspense, she had a good nudity and the fact that the blonde woman's main role was and she hottie! I will give it 7/10.
