It's an extremely difficult film to watch, especially since it targets the most intimate center of all our lives. But in the end it's a very beautiful and moving movie. Anyone who thinks it cynical must say that it must have lost a lot of the whole point of the movie. For those who actually look at the film, they will see that the way in which problems are dealt with is absolutely necessary and the result is ultimately exalting. Sure, it's very hard to look, a difficult and even brutal subject. However, it is extremely relevant to society and to everyone. This shows the top of the world cinema at this time (I will not limit this term to just France) and everyone should try to see it. I will say that it is better to come in with a clear head without being influenced by conflicting opinions and let the film work for you.
