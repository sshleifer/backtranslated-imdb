Read Eric's review again. He perfectly described his own feeling for this film as eloquently as I ever could. I'm just writing here to encourage you to look for it and see it. I saw her many years ago on TV, I think IFC. It's a unique film that hesitates to make comparisons. It was filmed in northern Mexico, somewhere in the unpleasant areas of Coahuila / Zacatecas / San Luis Potosi. It's not about Durango, Mexico (from John Wayne's films) in Sedona, but with a really rocky and wild place. I have to find the novel now to check the original location of the story. Like the location, this movie is weird and wild and wonderful and strange and absolutely not for everyone. It's kind of production that almost motivates me to study the film. I have never forgotten this movie, it's indelible. However, over the years, I forgot about its existence. I know that no one who has seen it has ever read about it and has seen no reference to it. Erendira is such an unusual name, even though I forgot the title. Well, I will be looking to buy a copy now. I have since the above post became a big fan of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and so regret that they did not read it before. <br /> <br /> Relative to MsMyth's comment below; the film was shot in Mexico, but the author is Colombian and has never commented on the history of Mexico or the Mexican, although Marquez is now living in Mexico for "political" reasons. This story is universal. <br /> <br /> I'm still desperately trying to find a copy of this movie for my library. Do you like the movie? You have to read the story and then everything Garcia Marquz wrote. And by the way, the original location in the story was Columbia.
