It looks like Hal Hartley's movies are kind of a blow or miss most audiences. This movie will not make an exception to this rule. Fay Grim acts as a sequel to Hartley's 1998 film "Henry Foole". The focus here is Henry's former wife (played by Parker Posey's perfection), which is ruined by the CIA about his unpublished book Henry about all his shady things. Meanwhile, Fay reaches a odyssey, deals with international spies, and so on. The film shoots a little in the second half. If you've been a fan of Hal Hartley in the past, it should not be missed. For the new Hartley stopwatch, who just heard about the film shooting technique, you might want to check out his previous films before taking it (especially if you have not seen Henry yet). I admired the camera work, which sometimes reminded me of a certain early photograph of Man Ray.
