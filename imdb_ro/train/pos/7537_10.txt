Contrary to what I hate Christianity, the 700 Club offers real answers and inspiration. It also provides reliable news, logical comments, and a different view from ABC, CBS, NBC and PBS. Unlike other programs that offer social and faithful comments, those behind Club 700 offer help to those in need, such as hunger feeding with Blessing, providing health care to those living in communities affected by poverty, and offering hope to those in need of hope. It's not ugly at all. If club 700 offends you, we suggest you reach the remote control and rotate the channel on the TV. Do the same when they find CNN Headline news or, for those things, programs that I consider biased or offensive. What seems to me offensive is how the ABC family inserts that Club 700's views do not reflect those of the ABC family.
