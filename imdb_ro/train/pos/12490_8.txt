Allen and Julie move into a mountain cottage after their daughter is killed one night. Nobody knows who killed the little girl, but that's why they moved to the mountains. So the couple moves in this cabin and is haunted by people who committed suicide there and no one in the nearby city wants to talk about it. This movie has a great thrill and has many parts that made me jump. Some parts are predictable, but from time to time there is a part I did not expect. It was a pretty good movie, which was not the most frightening movie in the world, but it was still scary enough to do pretty well. I also liked the end because it left the viewer to decide how it was going to end. It is also a kind of sad movie, but also a horror movie well done.
