*** 1/2 Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, Hope Davis, Adam Scott, Philip Baker Hall. Directed by Richard Shepard. A well-composed story and the movie together, Brosnan has never been better in a movie role outside his Bond films. After 2004, after "sunset", his newest role laughs him in a wonderful time. The professional, so to say, that Julian Noble, in a job in Mexico City, meets in front of his opposite, Danny Wright (Kinnear, possibly one of the best roles), as well as the business there. The two duo screens make a comic rebellion, laugh and fail to deliver laugh. Davis in one of his best roles, since "American Splendor" offers another charming and moody performance. One of the year's most enjoyable and best films. My final evaluation 9/10
