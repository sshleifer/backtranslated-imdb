Recently I bought the very undervalued Dreamcast and went to the city to find some games to use. I bought Soul Calibur (a classic) and then I went over Resident Evil Code Veronica. I Resident Evil 1 & 2 and I played Res Evil 3 on many occasions and I was impressed by everyone, especially the number 1 who has to go down in history has a classic. <br /> <br /> But none of them is approaching an attempt to play the Brilliant Gory game. If only for the sake of buying a dreamcast for this game, it deserves every moment of your time and effort, I've never been so excited about a computer game in the way that this excited me. , the story continues from the second story in which Claire Redfield seeks her brother (Chris - from the first story), which is supposed to be missing under the conspiracies of the ugly theme corporation. Little is known about this corporation, except that you destroyed it three times in the previous stories. So by helping Claire, Steve's super assistant, u needs to unlock the truth of your brother's true location. The second CD allows you to control Chris, that is, if you manage to get so far without getting out of the room. The control is very thin and the movement of the characters is very realistic, when the character perceives the danger, he / she faces the direction from which he / she comes. PURE GENIUS !! Overall, I gave this game 10/10 because it is simply the game of the year, the decade game and the best game in the world! Buy this game as soon as possible.
