VIVAH is in my 2006 BEST MOVIE MOVIE! PERIODA !!. In my book is one of the best 100 EVER IN Bollywood movies. It's sad that this movie does not have so many reviews and does not have that much popularity. <br /> <br /> VIVAH is again a true achievement from a director who does it again. After HAHK and Maine Pyar Kiya Sooraj once again shot a brilliant VIVAH. <br /> <br /> This is the simplest and nicer movie I've ever seen this year. After seeing Don 2, who was CRAP and later Dhoom 2, who even beat Don on this issue, I finally saw a movie that is so close to my heart and culture. I do not know why Bollywood moves away from the beautiful culture we have and we make Hollywood remix carpets like Dhoom 2 and Don. <br /> <br /> The story is beautiful and relates much to the arranged Indian marriage system, to which I would like to be part. Our system that teaches us to obey the elders, to follow them and, of course, to obey our thoughts is so brilliantly presented in this movie! Of course there is no force in choosing a life partner, and it should be a brief encounter between the couple and the decision to decide as shown in this brilliant film. <br /> <br /> Returning to the movie ..... VIVAH is a travel story between the beautiful engagement and marriage. The stage where the guy meets the face! .... They both understand each other. They try to evaluate whether they could love each other for seven generations (as our system says) and the different ones that appear during marriages. <br /> <br /> Amrita Rao is brilliant in the movie ....... Shahid is OK ..... and Alok Nath and Anupam Kher are wonderful! The tracks are BRILLIANT. ! I especially like HAMARI SHAADI MAIN HAFTE REH GYE CHARTA and Do Anjaane Ajnabi ... In general, you MUST see for anyone who still believes in Indian culture and tradition and I certainly do! <br /> <br /> Go to see this movie ...... Just say one word ....... BLISS!
