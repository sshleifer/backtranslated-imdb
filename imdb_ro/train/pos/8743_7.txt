A good movie with strong performances (especially the two causes). The movie is about two American girls who are trapped with 6-pound heroin on an airport in Thailand. They are both thrown into prison and one of them signs a confession. Bill Pullman plays the lawyer trying to get them out. All he has to do is find Nick Parks putting the narcotics in the bag of one of the two girls. Until now, for the story that is not original (has many similarities with the best return to Paradis). The beautiful photo of Newton and Newton Thomas Sigel makes this movie viewable. A 7 out of 10.
