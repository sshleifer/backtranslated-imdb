"I looked in the eye of this island and what I saw was beautiful," proclaims one of the main characters of the TV series "Lost". The series could be summed up as a drama story about a group of survivors of planes damaged on an unknown island, but this would make a show of service. "Lost" follows a large group of characters who conflict with the island, each other and, ultimately, themselves as they struggle with their new lifestyle and their dependence on each other. The situation becomes more complicated when it becomes clear that this is not an ordinary island - and that it can not be alone. My initial fear after hearing the concept of this series was the lack of new stories we could tell after a certain time, but this proved to be unfounded. The narrative naturally flows, the dialogue is spiritual, the characters are memorable and the execution is superb. The island is a character on its own, and to understand this comment you should see the series for you, which only means to show its originality and grandeur. At the time of review writing, only the first two seasons were broadcast and filled with powerful episodes. My only slight criticism is that the second season seems to slow down a bit, but fortunately comes again in an admirable form for the final episodes. If I can recommend you a series of television, you should follow now, it certainly would be. If you love excitement, adventure, characters-driven stories, an extremely powerful cast and crew, beautiful places and an island that seems more spiritual than natural, "Lost" is for you. Be sure to start at the beginning.
