In 1943, a group of RAF officers, including Eric Wiiliams, decided to flee a battle camp with a Gymnastic Vaulting Horse in the yard. In 1950, he decided to film his account and released a special British film - the story in the Military Prison Camp, which reached its peak in danger (1959). one of the quietest movies I've ever watched. There are no dramatic dramatic moments, but a steady story eventually develops into a climax that has more tension because the story does not let go of an unexpected drama, a cut of salt or a moving music to happen!). It's totally time and works nicely. Leo Glenn, Anthony Steel and David Tomlinson lead an extremely low and extremely low distribution and (suppose) non-actors. Without exception, they are all consistently quiet and quiet. They keep the emotion of their roles. As many have been, until recently, ex-service, I suspect that they have recreated their war time roles as "Officers and Gentlemen." This non-emotional approach has no dramatic tension. On the contrary, unlike most escape films during the war, the story does not end up with barbed wire and this keeps me stuck to the end.
