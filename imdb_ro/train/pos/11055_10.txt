Well, what can I say except these people are Super in every way. I really like Sharon Mcreedy, I like this pure Nostalgie series And I set the box of 9 discs 30 episodes, I did not realize they made so many also I think it's a big shame , that they did not do more. I want to be given these powers, Imagine me, take my cycle off, somewhere and be cool, then wake up in a special hospital. Later, I discover that my body has been improved. Just like Richard Barrat. These stories are 50 minutes of pure action and suspense all the way, you can not fight these three people, because they would defeat you in all forms of weapons. The music is well written, and for me, it gives me a wonderful image of 3 super-beings in my mind. The types of power that champions have are the same as our domestic dogs or cats, Enhanced View, Improved Hearing and Touch. and the power of 10 men for Richard and Craig and the power of 3 women for Sharon. Who I thought was nice and smart. When I was a boy, I had a huge passion on her! Now I see why, on my DVD. The box is very beautiful and comes with a free brochure about the series. I also thought Tryman was a good, firm boss, but he did it!
