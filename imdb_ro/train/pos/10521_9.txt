Well, I think I'm emotionally attached to this movie because it's the first one I've ever seen more than 10 times in cinema ... helping me through my masters thesis, or rather keeping me from work on it! > <br /> But we look at it again a few years later (and many more films) later - which is a well made jewel! I have never seen Gwyneth Paltrow in a more convincing performance and Jeremy Northam is Mr. Knightley perfect - where does such a man meet? <<< Sighs >>> Sophie Thompson's tower as Mrs. Bates is a virtuous act of the best (oh, napkins, I'm sorry!) and the rest of the play is no disappointment - Toni Colette brings a lot of Muriel Harriet they and Ewan McGregor are charmingly convincing - and Alan Cumming and Juliet Stevenson are a perfect "impossible" couple! Of course, the sets and costumes, as well as the beautiful soundtrack, make a great contribution to the best feeling, close to the Hobbiton atmosphere of the film - though in terms of cinema and art decoration, it is almost a case of visual overload. Very nice, but a lower austerity could have delivered a better sense of the period. But the best thing is that the movie is not taken seriously, and there is plenty of fun - and some pretty cool editions - that prevent it from sinking in the Merry Old England sugary mode. <br /> <br /> A special favorite is the ball scene - some beautiful actors and directors here, and the dance of conclusions sums up the relationship between Emma and Knightley just fine. It's a shame that the final scenario of the proposal lasts a little too much - cut two shots (I think exactly which one!) And it would have been much more in line with the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> God, I realize (by reading imdb records) that I have seen Jeremy Northam in at least three movies without being aware that he is he - he seems to have much more for him, as an actor than just being an Indian Indian gentleman! Hmm, I think I have to pay my video store a visit ... <br /> <br /> Great movie. My favorite adaptation Jane Austen so far - though Ang Lee's Sensibility and Sensibility is, strictly speaking, the best film, it is the closest to my heart - and I have certainly seen it many times! Watch if you can - and do not be too hard on its small imperfections. <br /> <br />
