This film was one of my childhood favorites and I have to say that, unlike other films I liked at that time, the Baghdad thief kept the quality while I grew up. This is not just a movie that can be enjoyed by children, but can also be seen and enjoyed by adults. The only drawback is that in the past the "evil" effects (compared to actual effects) can not be seen in the past as it might be when someone was a child. I did not remember anything about these effects, of course it was almost ten years since I saw this film when I was 11 years old. Who then follows the effects? Someone is only looking for good stories and entertainment, and that's exactly what this movie offers. In my mind, this film is one of the first great adventure films of the 20th century. Coming to think about it, I feel like Indiana Jones movies are pretty much like this movie. There is a comedy, a love story and an adventure that creates a wonderful blend that will catch you from beginning to end and although the movie is old and the music and style of the movies are not obviously modern, it does not get dusty and old. All this is mainly due to the wonderful story, good directions and good performances of the actors. In this department, Sabu (like Abu) and Conrad Veidt (as Jaffar) stand out, providing comedy and cool elements of the film for the most part. Great movie and though an "oldie", certainly a "gold". I hope someone has the brains and the courage to release it on DVD one day. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
