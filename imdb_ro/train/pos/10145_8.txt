This is a charming old-fashioned movie. The places are great and the situation is one of those Preston movies. Be you to watch a movie that requires nothing but to rest and relax then. The actress is good and I liked Michael Rispoli. And he was in Rounders. And when you slept. The cast is fun. Only what happens when two people who are going to get married meet those they really love on the weekend, planning their own weddings. I know ... it sounds weird ... but it is. And that's what makes fun to look at. It will make your friend embrace you or leave you, but at least you will know.
