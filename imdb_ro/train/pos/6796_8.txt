Zodiac Killer (2005) was an interesting film by German director Ulli Lommel. He directs, produces and collaborates in the latest production. Not only does he manage to make an interesting movie about cheap. But he reaches a new level when Herr Lommel works in films from almost his entire catalog of films. I saw movie clips from Boogeyman I and II, Birds of War, Tenderness of the Wolf, Brain Waves and cocaine cowboys (even Andy Warhol makes a cameo beyond the serious grave of this film). Even if it uses a lot of old images, it uses them well (and could even add very creatively). The film follows a young man who copies the original Killer Zodiac. he also coincides with a writer (Ulli Lommel) who initially wrote about the serial killer in the 1960s and early 1970s. The friend of the writer (David Hess) helps him try to find this Zodiac. Can this killer be stopped? Will the writer put two and two together and recover some of his old glory? David Hess is still the man? You will need to find out for yourself and watch Killer Zodiac. This movie is NOT about the original Zodiac killer. I've also heard someone crying about this movie being filmed on the video. So what. The artistic style of the director's school highlights the fact that he is filmed on the video. My only complaint was to use more of the images in Herr Lommel's previous films (but I understand why "wink wink".) You do not think hype, it's a terrible horror movie. at first, this movie does not glorify the crime. You should like this statement. <br /> <br /> We highly recommend fans Ulli Lommel.
