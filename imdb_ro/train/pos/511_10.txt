I first saw this movie nearly 21 years ago, when it was an ITV (before the cable and satellite days) Matin√©e. I was out of school with mumps and I was completely wrapped in the movie. I had it on the video I bought for about 10 years and I want to get a DVD copy of it. David Niven is my favorite actor over time and I think it's a transvestity that has long been seen when the Oscars came. I also think the queen should have played it, as she did for the film industry, if not more than Sean Connery or Anthony Hopkins. the way the film moves from black to black and back is well done, and the film has starred stars such as Roger Livesy, Marius Goring and an early appearance by Richard Attenborough.
