This film is a journey through the mind of a writer caught in his own paradoxical philosophy. He analyzes the illusory question of "who am I" and "what am I"? It's a courageous and challenging business. There is a load of beautiful dream-inspired images, Escher-like paradoxes, reminding of hand drawn or rather erasable. More and more we follow the writer in agony about what to say and what to shoot, we see him calling his wife going to Peru, letting them take care of their child, a task he performs with less attention until he is so absorbed in his dilemma that he no longer looks at the child. His wife turns around and makes a scene, destroys his notes and helps him cross the last threshold until he erases it. Intertwined with eye-catching images and destruction, the story is mainly philosophical. It's the Maya veils, the world of illusion. The paradox of the film is that it needs a lot of discussion and thought to prove that thinking should stop. During more than two hours of provocative beauty and fast philosophy, the film made me give a lot of silence or a shorter film. If this was the purpose of the manufacturer, he did pretty well.
