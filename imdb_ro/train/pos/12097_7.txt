This intricate story starts quite simply with an English journalist who accepts a bet from Edgar Allen Poe and his boyfriend, Lord Blackwood, that he can not spend a night in the haunted castle in Blackwood. Once there, the writer wanders around the rooms and corridors with dust, until the music and a piece of waltz couple take him to an empty room. He sits at the clavicle and starts singing the song he heard and is surprised to be filled on the shoulder by the amazingly beautiful Elizabeth Blackwood. He informs them in an ambiguous / brilliant ambiguous manner that he has prepared his upstairs room and that someone is always expected tonight ... Night of the Dead. Thus begins an amazing series of supernatural events that forgets the journalist for the rest of the night. SPOILER AHEAD: It will probably not surprise too many spectators to find out that the wonderful Elizabeth is actually a ghost. This does not prevent him from falling in love with the journalist, but makes things more complicated for them than for the average couple. This is a fun movie, with absolutely everything: ghosts, scary castle, repeated visions of past events, sex and violence (although both have been toned in the version that most Americans have seen over the years.) Barbara Steele, captivating, captivating is the main reason to see it. He has a strange charisma, unlike anybody else you've ever seen in the movies. Recommended!
