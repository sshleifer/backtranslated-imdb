Trey Parker and Matt Stone, creators of the South Park show, come back with something completely different. Create a new sport that combines baseball and basketball. This sport is known as baseball. It's like basketball, except the baseball rules are involved and there is another letter in the title. Here's how you play: just shoot the ball while these two guys try to distract you from making the shot. .In fact, we could try a day.After game hits on the streets, it soon becomes a huge success. Who would have known that two immature friends could invent a sport that has become so successful? a very raw and stupid doll full of a multitude of blows, but it actually offers some laughs and a lot of fun. A clear recommendation for those of you who like humor and humility.
