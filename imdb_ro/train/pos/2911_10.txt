This is one of the best music concerts that anyone will see and will ever hear. I grew up when All My Lovin was new and I hear it again today by the artist today is a measure of Sir P Mc's power to spellbind any crowd of any age. This doco goes a long way behind the scenes to show our lives on the road, not just for the band but for everyone to the roads. I saw this guy living in Aussie 1975 and can assure you that his performance here on this DVD is no less than it was almost thirty years ago. I have a large 5.1 surround sound system that makes this right and would recommend this to anyone especially a Beatles fan. This is the closest you to a Beatles concert today. Singer, Songwriter, lead guitar / rhythm / bass, piano, ukulele, just pure genius. There are few artists who can stand alone with one instrument and hold the crowd in their hands. If you want to write perfect music, buy a studio CD. If you want to hear raw music as intended and spontaneous for the crowd, with all the enthusiasm and excitement of the crowd - this DVD is for you.
