"Xizao," is the story about the clash of modern life and ancient traditions and its effects on a family in China. Da Ming (Quanxiu Pu) is a businessman who returns home when a letter from his brother Er Ming (Wu Jiang) makes him believe that his father Liu (Xu Zhu) has died. He discovers that his father is still alive, as well as his old neighborhood and his old business, the public bath. The film centers around Da Ming's family and how to learn the importance of his father's job, which he had always considered an old tradition to die soon. The film also explores its relationship with Ming, which is mentally challenged, the problems of the small community, and how the bathroom is a place that purifies not only their bodies but also their souls. <br /> <br /> The two main themes of the movie, family and progress are incredibly well-handled and the movie never misses the point it tries to do, both themes are very well developed and we enjoy society and Chinese customs. Director Yang Zhang tells his story in a simple way, leaving character characters to do the job. It's a very simple approach, but it fits perfectly with the movie and I doubt that another style would fit the movie so well. Zhang has enormous potential because he can tell a story without the help of a fake visual or room tricks. The actor is remarkable in his naturalistic approach, each acting in a very natural way and showing almost if they were real-shot actors. The three leading characters give remarkable performance, and Wu Jiang as Er Ming surely steals the show. Even when the film could have stuck to an "old days were much better" message, steady attitude, such as saying that progress is good and that we have to move on, but not we must forget where we came from and maintain a balance between modern life and the traditions of the old. and the movie that touches. 8/10
