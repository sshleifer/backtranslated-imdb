I really enjoyed this movie. Kurt manages to act without speaking, letting moments speak for himself. He does not have to verbalize or rationalize his actions, he simply decides and takes action. He is supported by a good adventure of actors and arrangements and is able to show us a more human part of the soldiers without reaching the horn.
