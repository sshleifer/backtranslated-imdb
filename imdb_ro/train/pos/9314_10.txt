He just saw this show a few times, but he will live in my memory. <br /> <br /> It is very frustrating that it is so hard to find this anywhere to buy, and yet it does not seem like endless repeat things like Friends! Especially, even more difficult to get in England I think ..? They say there has been low ratings or was it a complaint from Bakersfield PD themselves? Perhaps he was too smart for some people? <br /> <br /> Anyway, just about a single comedy I'd love to see again, but it's almost impossible to find. Did I hear it is or was repeated on another network? But unfortunately it's not here! <br /> <br /> Abstract: Ingenious.
