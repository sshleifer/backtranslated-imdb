Apart from airplanes, trains and cars, and Uncle Buck, this is John Candy's funniest movie. When he becomes hypnotized with the game card (similar to Manchurian Candidate) and becomes a horny guy who does not know what he says, he makes two very memorable quotes (both deal with male anatomy). The scene of love involving groceries must be seen, can not be described. <br /> <br />
