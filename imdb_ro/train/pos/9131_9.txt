I just wanted to see you laughing in the Purple rain. This is an excellent movie. It should have been re-evaluated at PG-13. But anyway, Prince's first and greatest film. The pursuit was sucked. But I have not seen it for years, so here's what I remember. Kid (the Prince) must juggle with winning over the love of his life, Apollonia (herself), keeping the band together (the Revolution itself) and the tension in her family. But the rival band (Time as themselves) destroys their lives. Like Morris (himself) trying to steal Apollonia from Kid. Just like Saturday Fever, Flashdance and 8 Mile. Very good. Hire it, laugh and cry, and if you take it, buy it.
