The World in War is one of the best documentaries on World War 2. The 24 episodes cover the war and how it was in the countries involved in this war. The first episode tells us how Hitler came to power and how it managed to build one of the most powerful armies in the world. They also fucus about the military actions taken during the war and the Holocaust. One of the most powerful and best documentaries ever made. You all have to watch this. Perfection! <br /> <br />
