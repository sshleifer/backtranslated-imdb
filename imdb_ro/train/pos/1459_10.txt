Wow! Wow! Wow! I have never seen a documentary about globalization until I saw MARDI GRAS: MADE IN CHINA. This film has a narrative from scratch and combines real-world recordings with sensitive interviews with four teenage Chinese workers living inside a factory complex. They play with toys, snake rope and dance. However, most of their days and nights consist of work, work and work - but their work is bright and fascinating to watch. The owner of China's plant is amazingly open, so much to hit the effects of globalization while "punishing" workers. Watching the Mardi Gras beads from China to the carnival, the film reveals how the place is connected to the world through humor and compelling, convincing images of both cultures. One of the most interesting parts of this film is the cross-entry of factory workers and Mardi Gras, which is revealed through images. Here, the movie comes in full and shows how images can be a point of communication and transformation. The film is never a preacher, it is not guilty, and it allows the views of everyone to be present. Finally, we - viewers - draw our own conclusions about the complexity of the film and about globalization.
