Yes, the rooms were in the right place at the right time. It is so interesting to see how a world leader (like Chavez) who supports the poor people in his country can be held in such scruples in the US. The worst "sin", in my opinion, deals with those who are at the bottom of the barrel. What can be so bad about that? We have always been fascinated by the American government + reaction in the media over Fidel Castro. At first, Castro was a good guy (around 1959) when he replaced Batista. Soon, however, Castro began transforming corporations from Cuba into the needs of the poor instead of fat cats. We are a decent country, but why do the media and our government have such a problem in sharing with the poor? If these guys are "dictators", then we can use more "dictatorships" especially where the poorest of the poor live in the world.
