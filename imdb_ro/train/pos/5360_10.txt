Among the standard liner action movies, where action and logic are checked at the door, this movie is at the top of the class. If the person in charge of casting would have put "good" actors in this move, it would have been worse (except for Richard Dawson who behaved well if you could call yourself acting "acting"). I love this movie! The treadmill is probably God's gift to man (well, maybe only men). Surely the most exciting film of our time, so I'll walk you through your favorite line: "It's all part of the rich lifestyle, Brenda, and you better get used to it." More people have been called "Brenda" to quote this film than I can imagine.
