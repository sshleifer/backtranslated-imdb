Haunting is a movie that boasts a really creepy house, a work of good effects and a sound work, a distribution that seems to believe that everything around it is real and that house. There are scenes that make you jump and the sinister aspects of what happened at Hill House in the past, I found interesting. There are really horrible moments in the film, and I liked the way the ghosts showed up in sheets, curtains and in the house itself. Jerry Goldsmith's score gave him the right atmosphere and the sound design had voices rising around you. What I would have wanted to happen is something more intense. Jan De Bont had a PG-13 rating to fight him and I think he was a little too busy. Poltergeist scared me when I saw her many years ago and still remains. Haunting could have used multiple scenes of pure terror. The end was for me, a little anticlimactic. Generally, I liked it. The act is good and there are moments that make you jump. I want to scare you more.
