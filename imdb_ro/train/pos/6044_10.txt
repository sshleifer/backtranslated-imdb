A great British movie Indy! The fantastic chemistry between the three main characters makes some pieces of hilarious paper that Cheech and Chong would be proud of. I'm glad to see Phil Daniels back on the big screen (even if he changed the sides of Quadrophenia!) And Gary Stretch is surprisingly good and a treat for ladies! He loved the final battle scene with an urge at Zulu, and now I know what happened to Arthur Brown after he lit up on Top of the Pops ... he does not work ... he is indeed a British bonafide hippie !!! You do not have to be a biker to enjoy this and it's right in my post-pub watch collection repeated by Friday night. <br /> <br /> Give this movie a road and you will not be disappointed.
