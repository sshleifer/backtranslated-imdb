This is correct. The movie is better than the book. Do not get me wrong, I like the book. But the movie is much better. This film has Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall at the best moments. (I did not see Scatman Crothers and obviously Danny Lloyd in everything else.) Some of the ideas used in this movie are better than those used in the book. But I've already talked about those in my commentary on the mini series. But I lost a few. The movie is shot in a better location than if the mini-series were shot. And the scenes of REDRUM are harsher than those in the book. So, if you're looking for a great movie, get Stanley Kubrick's Shining. But count on nightmares every night for 3 weeks
