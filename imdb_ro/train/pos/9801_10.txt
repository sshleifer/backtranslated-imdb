The animated original Dark Knight returns to this needle adventure film rivaling the Phantasm Mask in its coolness. There is a lot of style and intelligence in Mystery of the Batwoman, much more than Batman Forever or Batman and Robin. There is a new fighter on the streets of Gotham. She dresses like a bat, but she is not an adult batgirl. And Batman denies any affiliation with her. Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne has to deal with routine romance and detective work. But the Penguin, Bain and the local Mob will make things a little more complicated. I have not had great hopes for this "one" since it was strongly abandoned, but the poor Batman: Sub Zero (Robin isn 'but I was delighted with the imaginative and interesting pieces, the smart plot and a humorous feeling. surely a movie that no Batman fan should do. Keep your ears open for a really captivating song called "Betcha Neva", which is prominently presented through. <br /> < It's a shame that the DVD is not that great. Do not get me wrong, there are some great features (the short "Chase Me" is awesome) and a very good soundtrack Dolby 5.1, but ... the movie is featured in Bat and Batman: The Batman's Mystery was drawn and shot in 1.85: 1, but this DVD is presented in 1.33: 1 compared to the widescreen clips shown on the features there IS picture cut off on both sides. it seems ex it is annoying that the Mask of Fantasy was presented in an anamorphic widescreen. Warner had to literally re-create dozens of movies on DVD because people complained about the lack of the Original Aspect Ratio available on some titles. Why they chose to make the same mistake again here is beyond me. I would give this DVD 5/5 but the lack of OAR brings the total score up to 4/5. It's a shame because the widescreen would have completed an excellent DVD package.
