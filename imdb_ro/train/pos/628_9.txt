This movie is very fun. The actors really make the film go away, though. Without deactivating the plot, I would describe it as a favorite culture of Princess Bride, which should resist the test of time. You will see another part different from Robert DeNiro in this movie! (The admission price just for that!) All the elements are from adventure to romance and well-placed comedy. People of all ages will enjoy it. (My parents did!) Good special effects can be scary for the little ones. Good time movie. Great for a certain escapism. It's worth an A. (I hope she's doing well at the box office)
