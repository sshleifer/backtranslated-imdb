First of all, I liked Bruce Broughton's musical score, very lyrical, and this alone added the charm of the film. The best aspect of the film was the three animals, superlative expressed by Michael J.Fox, Sally Field and late Ameche. While Fox has the funniest lines, Ameche plays an otherwise engaged character (the voice of reason) and the field adds a spirit that always sees it saying Chance off. People were not so excited, and sometimes the film pulled, but this is my only complaint. This is a beautiful movie with beautiful pictures close to Canada, I think. Although the movie itself is long enough, there is never a tedious moment, and this benefits from your work and a well-written script. Generally, a charming and probably undervalued movie, 9/10 from me. Bethany Cox.
