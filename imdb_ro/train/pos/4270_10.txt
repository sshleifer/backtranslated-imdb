Ko la tamo peva is the best comedy of all time. Believe me I've seen many movies and comedies, but tell me that makes you smile every time you follow her. But the truth is that humor in this comedy is special. It is charter for serbia. And all the former republic of Yugoslavia knows it very well! So, I think the rest of the audience (for example: in Europe) can not enjoy it so much. Because subtitles destroy work on the hole. But should at least try !!!! Yes, it's ironic! This is the best film in Serbian history and the world does not understand! :-) If you have a chance to see this, it does not explode OK!
