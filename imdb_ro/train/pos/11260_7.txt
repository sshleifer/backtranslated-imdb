Well, the story is a bit hard to follow for the first time, but that's just because of all the vampires / witches painted in the 70's who danced on bongo drums. Of course, interrupted by some vampire orgies. And there are some very interesting candles and I use them. And for girl action girl, vampire or not ... this movie just stones!
