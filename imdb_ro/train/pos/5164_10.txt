I participated in Camp Chesapeake. It was located at the head of Chesapeake Bay on the North East River in MD. It was a summer camp similar to a cabin. It was established by Coatesville, PA YMCA. I started out as a young camper and later I became Junior, Senior Advisor and later the Waterfront Director. If the camp were to continue, I would have done anything in my power to become the director of the camp. Unfortunately, YMCA powers have decided to close the camp and sell it to the state of MD. I visited the former camp a few years later with the boat and I was amazed at the neglect of MD's condition and natural destruction through the nature of my mother. The 350-acre site has served so many, with all the benefits of contact with nature offers. A black man named Curtis Ford and his family were residents and carers of property. Mister. Curtis was my friend and mentor. I have idolized every being. Even though he could not swim, he was a water man. If I asked him where the fish was being thrown, he would designate the place and have a ball. It was also a family camp at the end of the summer. These memories will be with me for eternity.
