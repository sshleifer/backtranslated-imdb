Charles Boyer should be Spanish and arrived in London to buy coal in the Confidential Agent, a 1945 film, also with Lauren Bacall, Katina Paxinou, Peter Lorre, Dan Seymour and Wanda Hendrix. Boyer is Luis Denard and everyone has to stop him except Bacall. His works are stolen, he is accused of murder, but he is determined to get coal for his people so he can fight fascists. This movie has good and not good points. It is very good for the atmosphere and suspense, and it is very fun. Bacall is incredibly beautiful, Boyer is passionate, Paxinou is bad, Lorre is weak, Hendrix is ​​properly pathetic and Seymour is scandalously wonderful. Not good points: Bacall should be English and Spanish Boyer. No no. Boyer is great in his role, even with the wrong accent, but Bacall is 100% American, not upper British. The two do not have chemistry. Conclusion: Bacall is somewhat mischievous. She is not going to play the game; she is better in other movies. But she is an amazing woman and more can be forgiven. Paxinou is almost up and ugly. Dan Seymour almost steals the whole movie as a hotel guest who studies human nature. It's a great part and its performance is perfect, while part of the other actors is not as good. It was definitely a case of small parts, just small actors. Seymour was not a small actor. It is certainly worth seeing even with its defects.
