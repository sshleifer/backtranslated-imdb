Hacking lovers, a baby, a safe, a plan and a baby. Add them all and get the best comedy you've never heard of. <br /> <br /> Even with some star rating lists (at least one minus ... well, b-plus?) this movie received very little advertising. But that does not make it diminish his genius. <br /> <br /> Wonderful letter, solid delivery and a credible group of characters. Some truly classic lines and a fun twist at the end. This is not a stray comedy "Nutty Professor". They're bad boys. They speak evil bad language and do bad things. But they do it for fun and fun, and they do it well. One of the best comedies I've ever seen.
