After I developed a critical eye for the film and a love for a good cinema, I went to see Antwone Fisher with symbolic breathing. While I am a fan of Denzel Washington - both his talent as actor and his public character; I am an honest fan to recognize (very few) when he did not hit the mark in a movie or two. And I could be wrong about those - after all, I'm not an actor. But this was different - Denzel will show his career experience in a film guide dealing with one of the most sensitive subjects known to man - the abuse of a child. As his directorial debut, no less. And develop the movie to show that it will successfully present a man's triumph. I did not want to be disappointed. And I was not. What we have seen is a promising film that has connected various audiences and gave the uneducated the viewer a short but true eye in the life of a young man whose childhood was a living hell but who triumphed despite all. This movie did - and a dry eye of any color in the theater proved it. Someone needs to know the topics in this movie to know when the truth is presented. It takes a talented director to tell you the compelling story when you have not experienced it. And if he can still attract an audience and cause a public to respond emotionally, mercilessly, the director has done his job. In any movie. Black, white, purple or dotted polka. That's what makes a good cinema. Bravo, Denzel Washington, Derek Luke, Joy Bryant and, above all, Antwone Fisher - you've really won.
