First, this should not be a shining and challenging film, just as many of the reviewers seem to compare it. the first review says something along the lines of anyone who likes this does not know anything about the cinema of horror, it seems to be the other way round. If someone had to look back after the movie, it really was not meant to be convincing, it was a low-budget ipec. But it was precisely for this purpose destroying viewers with a value of shock (and all the flaws that their images were far less visible in the original VHS versions). <br /> <br /> I gave him a great score because he reached his goal and even if it was not really horrible (in a non-shock way), made me sick and completely paranoid / pessimistic ( I could not trust someone for about a week because I did not want to wake up and get tortured)
