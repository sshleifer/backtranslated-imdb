As a guy who has seen all the seasons, I can say that JG constantly surprises me. I mean, after you've seen him move from laughing to paranoia instantly throughout the seasons and after every little gesture of his doing u think he's a gangster, you were thinking about yourself: OK is a good actor and can enter in a gangster's skin. But after I saw him opening his eyes and fighting for his life, I wanted to say that I almost feel the pain she "did" to believe she was going through. I was so touched by the performance I immediately believed in Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. These guys were certainly the best of their generations and even more. But nowadays they are either old or dead (Brando), and it's good that they make fewer movies and their performances are "lighter" than they were. I can not wait to see Gandolfini in other films in which he offers a completely different role. Can u recommend me some of his older movies, if it offers a memorable show?
