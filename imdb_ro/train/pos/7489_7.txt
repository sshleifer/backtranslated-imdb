This movie has many strong points. He has one of the best horror films outside the Lugosi-Karloff-Chaney circle: Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray and Dwight Frye, plus Melvyn Douglas. It has all the right ingredients: bats, a castle with many stone stairs, a crazy scientist, flamboyants carrying flames and hunting vampires, an Igor character, a beautiful girl, even a naked burgomeister. Soft focus camera work is stupid and imaginative. There is even a good fun comic stripped nicely throughout the scenario. But it's not even a monster movie, because nothing supernatural happens in "Kleinschloss" ("little castle"). The plot spins around the generic mad scientist (beautifully played by Atwill), who appreciates his work more than human life. It's not a high-end material, due to a ho-hum plot of the plot and some embarrassing dialogues for Dwight Frye. But it's worth watching if you like horror b / w images early.
