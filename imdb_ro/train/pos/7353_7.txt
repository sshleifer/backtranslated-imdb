This movie may be one of the most underestimated films in Bollywood history. This 1994 blockbuster had all the good performances, music and direction. I remember being in Allahabad when this movie was broadcast and was sometime in March at Holi time, people sang the song "Ooe Amma" to their loudspeakers in the highest volume. If someone who likes to watch "Some Like It Hot" and "sparkle" over Marilyn Monroe should watch this movie. Trembling to Govinda. As many of you know that this movie was shot in southern India and after Sholay could be one of the few blockbuters to hit Silver Screen. With movies like these Indian comedies could never be dead.
