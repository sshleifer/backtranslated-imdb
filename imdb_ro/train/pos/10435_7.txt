My watch came a little too late, but I'm glad I looked at this as well as the continuation together ... which makes me compliments those who have done this because they offered such a pure and the basic idea of ​​romance ... and separating from the idea of ​​relationships! As it was already written about the film, it would be good to highlight a few portions of the movie I loved personally. I think that the point where Jesse and Celine make false phone calls to their friends was a very nice way of telling each other what they meant to each other on a journey without extending even 24 hours ... the curiosity of two people who think the other has made an infallible impact on the other has been very smartly treated with ... On the face of the plot, making a romantic story of working on pure conversation is not an easy task to do. I believe in romantic movies of such a flavor, the characters are not clearly projected even in the mind of the writer and the director. What actor points out is what becomes of them ... right or wrong, even if the bearers of ideas would find it difficult to justify ... becoming a character, the life the actor gives must go beyond the instructions and the story ... here the actors just do the right place! Kudos .. !!! And before sunset is another feather that makes this even more beautiful!
