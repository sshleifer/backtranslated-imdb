and everything disagree. She thought it was a wonderful movie for kids.dawn wells on the island of gilligans, and the promise shown by a dana plato.it only then known was disneylike and because hard can be neglected as fluff.less meaningless it was not scary and was not meant to be.i wont ending.but ruin was unusual how it was done.i means children's characters were great and did not know what to expect in the final.the basic plot also had much more to do with these children than telling that these children were expert fishermen is very central to the plot especially initially.it also helps them from a jam to the end.it have also being too long. I think it ends in less than 95 minutes
