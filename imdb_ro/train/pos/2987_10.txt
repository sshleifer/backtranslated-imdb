This is the cry that beaches have never been. As long as I wanted to love Beaches, I felt too rude to "feel" (the soundtrack is one of my favorite albums). Stella, on the other hand, moves at a slower pace (and sometimes too slow), and though somewhat manipulative in her story of tears about a mother of self-sacrifice, it works because Bette and the rest of the camp turn in high performance. 10/10
