Taking roles that Jack Albertson and Sam Levene performed on Broadway, Walter Matthau and George Burns are playing some comedies, a team in the tradition of Joe Smith and Charles Dale, who seem to have a different perspective on life. /> <br /> Walter Matthau can not stop working, man has never learned to relax, take some time and smell the roses. He is a wicked old man, whose good days are behind him, and his nephew and agent, Richard Benjamin, find less and less for him. What hurt him badly was that, 15 years earlier, his partner, George Burns, decided to retire and spend some time with his family. A workman like Matthau can not understand and take Burns personally. <br /> <br /> Benjamin hits a brain storm, reunites the boys and makes it on a special national television. What's going on here is pretty hilarious. Sunshine Boys is also a sad and sweet story, as well as about old age. Matthau is on screen for most of the film, but Burns received the Oscar-like kudos at the age of 79. Burns has brought a bit of staff into this movie as well. As we all know, he was the direct man of Burns & Allen's wonderful comedy troupe, which Monty Python's troops borrowed a lot. In 1958, for health reasons, Gracie Allen retired and George continued until he was 100 years old. Or at least pretty close to an active performer. Sunshine Boys rely on the Smith & Dale team and if you like the boys The Sunshine Boys I strongly recommend you to see two Broadway tickets for a look at a pair of boys who entertained American audiences at the beginning of the last century. The doctor outline that Matthau and Burns make is directly from their material. And I think you'll love The Sunshine Boys.
