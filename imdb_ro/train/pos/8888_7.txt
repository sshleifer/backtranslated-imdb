This movie started slowly, then gained the rhythm in the middle. However, the fact that the movie ran over two nights broke that moment at the top. The second part became really interesting, but then it ended at the end simply pathetic. Playing football in the yard? Indeed, could it be more sappy and maudlin? Now I hear payments for a similar movie based on the '70s. I will not make much effort to adapt to that if it's something like the '60s. "
