Unpack the funniest spoofs of precious art movies ever made. This movie exposes all the clich√©s and then some! Bad Excucant (Downs Syndrome) Actors. Dialogue very hard, self-important. Scenes that should shock, but fall flat. Editing the jargon. Unnecessary plot points. They were all wrapped in a miraculous miracle of disrespect for audience and vague psychological movement. It touches exactly what was designed. A hilarious satire of those boring movies made by sponsors encouraged to trust teenagers, show them to their parents when they ask what they have done in the past two years! After "What is it?" received the Cannes prize, it was rumored that Werner Herzog said that the movie is actually a paradise, partly out of his own movies! It's supposed to explode at info. So far, he refuses to discuss the incident. Anyway, see and laugh, it will be a classic of humor for many years to come.
