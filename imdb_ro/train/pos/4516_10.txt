Ever since I educated Rita, Julie Walters was one of my role models, and her performance as a woman who helps the man she loves to synchronize with her feminine is magnificent. I would never have believed her character in the hands of a smaller actress, but Walters is shooting it with taste and panache. Adrian Pasdar gives his best performances until the masculine.
