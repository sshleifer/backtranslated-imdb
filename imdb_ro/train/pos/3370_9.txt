Just finished the Heroic Knight's Chronicles a few minutes ago, I find you very much, but questions still remain over me. Although it seems that the first seven episodes are actually a story of Lodoss' first war, the truth is that they are not really. It seems that the creator of CotHK had a different view of how the original ended (and maybe this is why the first 7 episodes appear), but I do not think that is the case. CotHK says it begins five years after Heros' war, in which Parn was part of it. I think the director made the first 5 episodes appear as much as a recapitulation of the original just to give the viewer a small reminder and an introduction to the characters and their deeds, because they appear much less after the series hit his story Spark. Now that the series has hit Spark's part, we find ourselves 10 years ago (15 years since the war of Heros). Spark and his crew, in some cases, resemble Parn and his crew once the road begins to speed, especially the love story that occurs between Spark and Neese. I also thought several times through CotHK that I threw in the original series and if it was not for Spark's blue hair, I knew I would have stopped more than once to make sure the disk was inserted fit. Consider these major set backs, however, the writers did a good job in crafting credible characters and a remarkable story. The only thing that hurts me is that Ashram and Wagnard are coming back. Ummmm ... how ??? Do not get along well, both are great villains, even if Ashram's only negative feature is that he supports Marmo. Maybe I lost something during the rough series that explains that part. As for the continuation, however, I recommend that CotHK. I placed both CotHK and, moreover, the original version of the Lodoss War, well above the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Both are more epic than anything we've ever seen or read. I strongly recommend this.
