WAR, INC. (2008) ** 1/2 John Cusack, Marisa Tomei, Hilary Duff, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Dan Aykroyd, Sergei Trifunovic, Lyubomir Neikov, Ned Bellamy; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> who co-wrote the script with Mark Leyner and Jeremy Pikser? star as a hit man named Brand Hauser who is burned, but decides to follow through a final glaze task a Middle East oil minister called Omar Sharif (yes, not that Omar Sharif, but you get the tone here to this laugh for a laugh), commissioned by former US Vice President Aykroyd, Cusack's old grove "Grosse Pointe Blank," a Dick Cheney maniacal craze), hiring Brand to do the deed under the guise of a trade show producer in Mythical Turaqistan (read: Iraq / Afghanistan) for the private American corpora Tamerlane (read: Halliburton). <br /> <br /> While being informed, Brand faces a moment of clarity when he meets horribly journalist Natalie Hegalhuzen (Tomei) and eventually falls in love with her. Meanwhile, Tamerlane sponsors the unlikely union of teen sensation in Eastern Europe, Yonica Babyyeah (a surprisingly decent Duff, defending her own celebrity with her tongue), and the idiot son of the country's leader. > <br /> The following is a daring attempt for a twentieth-century black comedy at "DR. STRANGELOVE," but for all intents and purposes there is much more than a lack of success in this laughing attempt the middle of the political message (an unfair war being outsourced by American capitalism, read!) While Cusack riffs Martin Blank from Pointe mentioned above adds some beautiful shades of his man in black (makes Tabasco sauce shots to take (with the exception of Sister Joan, which is a cautious camp-revolt for Hauser, and has one of the funniest lines of laughter: "My mass communication skills are finally paying") for the most part. < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Cusack visited the Iraq war earlier this year in various degrees of 'Grace Is Gone' (180 degrees) and here it allows him to wear political visibility on the sleeve, while admirable in the genes The rhythm and rhythms of the film are mostly not thanks to the first director Joshua Seftel who makes his directorial debut here (and is remarkable), unless the fight with the choreographer Hauser is involved in the entourage of Babyyeah's fiancÃ©. /> <br /> A beautiful test, but a wrong failure; maybe next time Cusack will not try so hard and let the idiocy of the war speak for itself rather than make the heavy lifting itself.
