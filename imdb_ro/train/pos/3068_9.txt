I gather from reading past comments that this movie went straight to the cable. Well, I paid to see her in a theater and I'm glad I did it because it was a visually striking film. Most settings seem to be made in the early 1960s (except for the psychiatric office that was dated in a different way) and if you leave Neve Campbell's sequences, the whole movie has an ambiance since the 60s. And the use of restaurants in the movie was fascinating. For a director for the first time, whose background, I think, is in writing, has a great eye. In the first ten minutes I felt the plot was not plausible, so I freely suspended my mistrust and went for a walk. In terms of acting and description of father-son relationships, mother-son, spouse, parent-child relationship, the movie was on the scene. William H. Macy, a pleasure to look, seems to fill the gap left behind by Tony Perkins if he and Magnolia are any indication. Tracey Ullman, as a neglected wife, is moving quite a bit. It was a three-dimensional representation of a character viewed too often by society as being two-dimensional. Of course, Donald Sutherland can add this to his unforgettable collection of portraits. The image of the parents (Bain / Sutherland) reminded me indirectly of BUFFALO '66 to Vincent Gallo, though quite loud! I would definitely pay you money to see a second film from this director. He has the self-discipline of a 50-year director of b-crime film (something that P.T.Anderson will never have!) But he has a visual style and a way with the actors who pay attention to him.
