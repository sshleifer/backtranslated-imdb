I do not see the soaps. My grandmother is following her one hour glass. I enjoyed them when I was ten (it was so easy). But this film takes a parody and spells it in a new way. I found the story pretty funny. The models of the '80s - shoulder pads, sequins and polyester - just above. Huge hair, high and histrionic heels - what a combination. All the actors go to the city, chew their pieces and spit in a well-written pile. Sally, Kevin, Elisabeth - awesome! Whoopi - great! Robert Downey - refreshing to see him back when he had such potential in front of the tabloids. And Garry: Why did we have to wait so long to see the movie? Leesa Gibbons - was not deprived of her, but would it be good to include her as a true reporter in the field of entertainment (and where do you apply for that job anyway?). Of course, I could have done without Sally climbing the drainage channel. Lucy Ricardo did it every time, like every comedy from Carol Burnett did, until I knew who I was doing now, and I could spice peanuts if I had them. Looks like that's what you do when you're fun in a high-rise building in New York. I'm just grateful that they did not pull out the foot. But it was cute, it was funny, it had plot overthrows, it had a faith after the credits ended before it was ordinary, it had clothes worthy of a second look, they had a big cast and I have personal memories for me. Indeed, why do you need more?
