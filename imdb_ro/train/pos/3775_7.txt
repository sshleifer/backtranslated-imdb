It takes me: a dirty but imaginative mess. <br /> <br /> Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter return as the two punk-rock idiots in this sequel to the adventure comedy of the time-trotting Adventure BILL AND TED EXCELLENT, now a classic cult. In this sequel, Bill and Ted are given much more than to travel through time. They could also travel Heaven and Hell! At the beginning of this sequel, Bill and Ted are preparing for a "Battle of the Bands" competition, which could make them more famous than ever. Meanwhile, for many years in a futuristic civilization, the time-wizard in the first film (George Carlin always watched) leads a university that praises Bill and Ted's name. There, an evil tyrant (Joss Ackland, from THE HUNT FOR RED October) parks to escape once and for all the two rock-idiot stars. So he sends two identical android replies (in the words of Bill and Ted: Robot Us) to do the dirty work. After that, Bill and Ted face death, and they have to find their way through Hell, with the inhabitants who happen to include the duo's worst memories and then through the sky in an attempt to return to the earth, and save your girlfriends ... and their show. Along this voyage, they play table games with no one other than Death (William Sadler, from DIE HARD 2), which reminds of a similar moment in the classic film THE SEVENTH SEAL, helping the help of smart pairs much more. The range of special effects with special effects BOGUS JOURNEY is not at modern standards and even some of the humor and appearance and sense of time are somewhat dated sincerely, the film feels like it was launched in a wrong year, even for years 90). But with a lack of imagination and a lively tower both through performance and direction, BOGUS JOURNEY is fun, imaginative and yes, fake. Rating: *** 1/2 of 5.
