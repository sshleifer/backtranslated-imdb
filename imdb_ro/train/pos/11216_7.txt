The story is extremely unique. It's about these two pilots who save the Earth from alien beings, but they have to use a special speed that makes everything around them aging fast. The entire series is about pilots dealing with time loss, friends and mentors. Launch of COULD was fantastic. It started to end on a total note down and leave a real mark, but instead ended on a Super Disney Disney note and it really annoyed me. <br /> Animation is decent for 89 years, but it can not be compared to today. I have also heard many complaining about the gentleness of nudity. In fact, I found it somewhat decent. Nudity for the most part was guaranteed, except for Episode 2 where there was an excess. Generally, it's worth a look, but the end keeps it from being a classic.
