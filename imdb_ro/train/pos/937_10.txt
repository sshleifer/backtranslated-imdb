When it was first released in 1984, my wife and I recorded our first VHS recorder. I still have the aging band I'm trying to follow every year. It was the year when my first child was born and seeing a Christmas Carol in this incarnation brings pleasant memories of happy times - many hours of being spent with this movie playing in the background. Finally, I broke this year and ordered a DVD, which made me take a moment to write this short reaction to the movie. The story of Charles Dickens is remarkably surprising here. George C. Scott is absolutely amazing and totally credible like Scrooge. The support tower is just as spectacular. This is, in my opinion, an impeccable production. Small details add a lot of pleasure. The game "Simulates" Scrooge's nephew and wife are playing with their party guests is an elegant item. (Since then I have re-created it with my high school students as a short respite from class work!) Honestly, I think of some ways to have fun in vacations that I enjoy more than to fall in love with it CBS production, which was initially sponsored by IBM. (It's also fun to watch the old tape with IBM's original ads ... showing how many computers have evolved in the age of 21. Amazing how things have changed!) The bottom line: A Christmas Carol is a story timeless and teaching is a timeless classic. Enjoy ... and God bless us, every one!
