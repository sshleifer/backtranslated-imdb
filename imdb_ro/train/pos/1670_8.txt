Channel 4 is a channel that allows things more naughty than any other channel, this show was certainly crazy. The presenter of this often grown adult show was won four times by BAFTA and won the British Comedy Award (also twice nominated), Graham Norton being just the perfect host for a good show like this one. He had one or more famous celebrities in the middle of it. They had essentially an adult idea that would be either brutal, humiliated, or humorous, but some are not for the weak. There were the women who played the tape, the men who used to play a xylophone, the women in the bathroom, the men with or without pants under the kilts, and many other rough but hilarious ideas. This is only for adults, but enjoy! He has twice won the BAFTA Award for Best Entertainment (Program or Series), won the British Comedy Awards for Best Comedy Entertainment Program (also nominated), Best Comedy Show, Won Emmy Award for episode # 18 National TV Awards twice for the most popular Talk show. It was number 52 on the 100 funny moments. Very good!
