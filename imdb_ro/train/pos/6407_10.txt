I went to this film on a distribution show and crew because my friend, the filmmaker, was invited. Forget what you saw in commercials, forget what you've heard, visit this movie for yourself. I was more than surprised by that. In a world of The Grinch, Charlies Angels, 6th Day, Unbreakable, comes a movie worth a few money you earn! Glorious scenes, wonderful cinema and caste you want to eat with your heart. I found out that this is one of these years the most orchestrated film of power and motives. Robert Deniro deserves an Oscar knot. If you could offer an oscar to everyone involved as a package, it would be the movie.
