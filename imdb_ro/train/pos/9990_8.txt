I recently saw the movie and I really liked it. I was surprised and wept. This film is in the same niche as "Away from Her" - or even "The Bucket List", but deals with the whole aging theme with an incredible authenticity. It's really hard to have the main character as unpleasant as Hagar. The director does a master's work with the challenge. Hagar is hard to understand. Her world has strong margins and is not at all a warm woman. The first scene does this without compromise. Hagar (Ellen Burnstyn) is taken to the shelter by her son and daughter. She calculates it on the trail and the anger. Her edges are very heavy. She's bad. She also trusts selfishly. She is a stone. I did not like it - not even a bit. Throughout the movie, we understand. We find out why he does not like petunias, why he favors a son over the other, how they created her losses ... I started to see the angel ... and I started to like it. I especially liked it when she poured the boys' secrets from the boat. Ellen Burnstyn, you are a brilliant actor. Kudos. Kudos. Kudos. What a scene! This is not a movie "feels good," but it is certainly a movie that brings the viewer empathy. I understand more clearly that the heavy edges of a person's life are there to be protected, they are there for a reason ... Hagar is not my mother - she is not even a mother or a neighbor ... but parts of it are present in many women (and men) in my life. These parts made me somewhat more meaningful now that I watched The Angel Angel.
