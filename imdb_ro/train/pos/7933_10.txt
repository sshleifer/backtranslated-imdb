Good times work with Quiroz brothers, and all the cast on this project as "Guy on the Bench". I was amazed at how well they captured all the identifiable features of a true horror movie "B". I hope I will have the opportunity to work again with the Pumpkin Patch Pictures team. I moved to Detroit shortly after finishing and I was publicly acknowledged on several occasions since the launch. Once she was in the video store, and the girl almost lost her mind. It was pretty funny and it was my first real autograph moment when I signed up for her receipt. One day I asked the girl from Blockbuster if the movie was rented many times, and she confirmed it on her computer. At that time it was leased more than Ring2, which was also a new version at that time ... The title really captures immediate interest in more urban markets. She has often noticed that the movie was not returned by the client that made me think the movie is just so good that people do not want to give it back ... Watch ZoMbIeS when in the hood cause you!
