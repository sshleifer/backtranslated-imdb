I can not believe my eyes when I read quite a few other comments and reviews. As if it were a mediocre film of some guys who ran. The film is great, funny, crazy, violent everywhere, though with minimal gore and all the way to the base. He loved every part of him. I do not remember crazy things like this made for laughing and martial art showing. And now, the most important thing (at least for me) is the effects on the computer. When I look at some Hollywood actors who take it to the screen in the action "fuflo" (a Russian word meaning "beep * beep *") with a modern resolution of high resolution and budget, I understand that every beeping child can do it - you can adapt the hairs, add some nice effects of your PC and put them in the action movie. Here it is different. I do not think there will be even a dozen stars of physically advanced stars around the world who can repeat the battle that takes place at the end of the movie or the "Chinese Football" game. And it's just a small Hong Kong cinema made for fun, it does not pretend to be "Star Wars". Having a DVD with English soundtrack is not a problem with this movie. It did not ruin my atmosphere. I can not refer to a very beautiful theatrical play. Some of you, suppose they will not like it. As for me - it's amazing. Take a look at the Dragon's friend who bravely speaks to criminals and suddenly gets a punch on the left side of his head. His face expression turns into something whimsical and comes to the Dragon with a child's expression. And take a look at the menacing dimension of his mouth - it's close from one ear to the other long when he makes grimaces. This movie deserves a higher rating and a thousand comments from people around the world. Very grateful to our Russian industry for the release of classic Jackie Chan movies. The modern ones are much weaker in my humble opinion and do not deserve much hype. Total 10 out of 10 - a legendary film of its kind. Thank you for your attention.
