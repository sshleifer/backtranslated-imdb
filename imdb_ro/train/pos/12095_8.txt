When US author Edgar Allan Poe visits London, he is approached by British journalist Alan Foster, who becomes the target of a strange bet. Not believing that Poe's claim that all his macabre stories were based on real experience, Foster accepts a bet from Poe and his friend Sir Thomas Blackwood that he can not spend a night in Blackwood's haunted castle. Once installed in the abandoned castle, Foster discovers that he is not alone, as approached by beautiful beautiful and beautiful men and a doctor of metaphysics - explaining that all are lost souls to resume stories about their deaths anniversary of their deaths ! The first time I looked at this glorious bit of classic horror, I was fascinated all the time. I found the film really scary and sad at the same time. Babs Steele is undoubtedly beautiful. The score of music makes the atmosphere twice as the induction of terror. The topless scene threw me a loop, as I did not expect. It seems that Synapse did a great job of improving the image, because this film looks good for his age and it's the Uncut International version to get started. This is the film responsible for starting a Babs Steele and Klaus Kinski collection.
