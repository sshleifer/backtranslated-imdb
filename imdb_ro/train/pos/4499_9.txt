This engaging story of love, jealousy and generosity revenge was even more enjoyable to see on the DVD years after PBS broadcast, with a clearer picture and clearer sound. My only reservations are that the plot has some unlikely moments and that some of Manchester's stronger accents are sometimes difficult. Fortunately, a word is missing here and will not spoil the fun: primary actors are ideally distributed. Robson Green brings an enigmatic smile, a broken temper, and an athletic physics for his role as a young surgeon who falls hopelessly to his boss's wife at the hospital she's just started working on. Francesca Annis is one of the most striking women of 50 years, imaginable; her act rivals her beauty. (The scenes of love between the two prove better than the words how little the difference in age matters!) Each of the supporting characters is drawn abruptly and very well portrayed. The mix of sinister dialogue and excess of passion make it a delightful miniseries. As Russell Baker notes in his introduction, you may not be morally upgraded by watching "Reckless" - but you'll have a lot of fun. (The continuation, part of the set of DVDs, offers a two-hour but satisfying disappointment. You will not want to lose it if you enjoyed what appeared before).
