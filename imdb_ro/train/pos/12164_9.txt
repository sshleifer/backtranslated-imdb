In a year of pretentious muck like "Synecdoche, New York", a film born of Charlie Kaufman's self-indulgence, comes a film that is just as hard to follow, but about three times more important. "Frownland" is a work of love from the crew, the actors and the director, shot for years by friends. She is following a man who can not communicate through his real, real world, Brooklyn. The people you see are a step that goes beyond even the styling of the mumblecore movement. They are real people, abducted painfully in their own neuroses, who do not want to change, incapable. The real world for them is their own set of illusions and because it is a movie about people who are so deeply out of touch, it is very difficult to watch. It's a 16mm film without the right light, money or other factors that would make a movie "slick", but honesty can not be underestimated, which would cause a room full of people to reject it, and for Richard Linklater to give it a prize as she did at SXSW. This reminds of movies like "Naked" or the best of "mumblecore". It's a movie that is not for everyone, but it causes you to watch and grow as you think more about it.
