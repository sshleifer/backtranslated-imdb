This is the kind of film that, if done today, would probably be Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant; in fact, now, when I think about it, it is quite likely to be remodeled someday. It is pleasant, but without any depth. She suffers from James Stewart's almost fatal misery in a role he has for about 20 years too old, and as a result there is no chemistry between him and beautiful Kim Novak. Ernie Kovacs, in the small supporting role of an aspiring writer, is the only actor in the film whose performance is approaching what you might call "spirit." (** 1/2)
