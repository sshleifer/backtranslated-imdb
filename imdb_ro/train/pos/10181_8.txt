I first bought this DVD because it had SRK and Aishwarya Rai on the cover and I thought, hey! another film with Aishu and Shah Rukh, little did I know that Aishwarya would only appear in an article number in the last quarter of the movie in a song she shares with SRK and helps them introduce his character who is in the movie for about 15 minutes. Shakti is a movie about Mom's love and resistance. It is a film about transformations, ignorance, coming of age, passing into knowledge and embracing the harsh realities of life. The number of the element in which SRK and Aishu appear has nothing to do with the film. It is actually a dream sequence that takes place while the drunk character of SRK is unconsciously hit by the drink. He's dreaming that Aishwarya Rai is this sexy street girl who appears one day in a favorite hangout, dressed a little and begins to seduce him. The title of the play is "Ishq Kamina" (poorly translated as "Love is a bitch!") And it's just hot smoking! Do not miss.
