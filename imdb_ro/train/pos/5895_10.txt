I read an article about Dan Jansen's Olympic and personal journey before seeing this movie. I am always intrigued by a story of hope and the overcoming of life-changing events, and that was not an exception. The background of the characters you are offered gives you a sense of family approach and how they are positively affected to the lives of others. I can not talk with the exact details of this movie, it is customary to take a creative license when organizing a scenario. However, the spirit of Dan and his family is what matters here. A movie worth a story that should be said. I felt empathetic for the characters and I was glad at the end.
