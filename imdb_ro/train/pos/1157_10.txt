This is one of the best comedies ever! Writing this soap parody is brilliant and distribution, just look at the distribution name and you will understand why it is so great. If you are a Kevin Kline fan, he does (as always) a fantastic performance, and Robert Downey Jr is perfect. If you do not laugh while you see this movie, you have no sense of humor.
