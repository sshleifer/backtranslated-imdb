Immediately after the end of the Second World War, Powell & Pressburger was asked to come up with something to try to heal the rift between the UK and the US. At the time there were many kinds of "overlapping, over sex and here" comments. Somehow they came with this masterpiece. My favorite movie ALL TIMES. He has everything. Romanticism, poetry, emotion, religion, drama and very strange. I can never explain why, but it hits all the right buttons and though I have seen it hundreds of times (yes, indeed) I'm still guaranteed to be in tears at many points along the whole. Was it a magnificent action, the wonderful sets, the inspired script? Who knows. But * DO * watch it and you will see what I mean.
