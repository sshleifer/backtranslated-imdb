A warm, sweet and remarkably charming movie about two antagonistic workers in the same store (James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan) who carry a love story through the mailbox without any of them knowing it. The key to the success of this film is that Ernst Lubitsch retains the absence of any inert sentimentality and calls on his actors to provide poor and unfounded performance. As a result, you fall in love with almost everyone. <br /> <br /> There is a strong underground melancholy that goes through this movie that I've appreciated. Loneliness is a major theme, most obviously represented in the character of the owner and manager of the store, magnificently played by Frank Morgan. He discovers that he is fired by his wife and realizes that the successful life he has created for him is not enough to make him feel alone when he does not have a partner to share it. This makes the shy romanticism between Stewart and Sullavan all the more thrilling, because they both reach this unseen one, each thinking as a soul before meeting. Of course we know that everything will eventually end, but the film does not let you forget the feeling of discomfort that any of them would feel if they find that reality did not live up to fantasy. <br /> <br /> Lubitsch fills his film with a castrakjack cast, which has chemistry loads. The small group of employees of the store refers to himself in the entire tab as a small family, and that's how we feel. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful madness. <br /> <br /> Grade: A +
