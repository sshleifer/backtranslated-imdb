This movie is like a 1950 version of Brutti sporti's cats from Ettore Scola. Less sex and less realism, but a story of great humanism and warmth. I would not call this a neo-realistic picture. It's very sentimental and more like a fairytale and should probably be classified as a comedy, though it deals with serious issues (like Chaplin or 1930-comedy). It is typical of Italy, very emotional and hard to withstand, except for a cold stone person. Sentimentalism is a letdown, although this image was not conceived as a realistic drama. It's not a masterpiece like Umberto D or The Bicycle Thief. But it's an appealing and hilarious comedy with good music. 7/10
