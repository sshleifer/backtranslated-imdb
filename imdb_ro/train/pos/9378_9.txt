Dahl seems to have been under the influence of Wenders' American friend. Innocent Nick Cage is recruited for a shot. Dennis Hopper plays a real man to hit. Lara Flynn Boyle is dangerous. The hero becomes more confused as the more he tries to free himself. And little America does not seem to be safer than the Great City. Like its predecessor, this film has a lot of twists and turns that seem improbable, but all lead to cathartic self-discovery.
