I have never bothered to see this movie in the theater, although I remember hearing the name several times. I finally saw it this week and what a pleasure. For some reason, I expected it not to be very good, so I was completely surprised when I sat down and stayed with her and then I found myself completely inside. I read many other user reviews and impressed me how many people are talking about her fight in the ring, but what was wonderful about Diana is that she is a true fighter in my life. All she has to do is find her where she is and the ring helps her get there. A very intelligent story and am amazed that it's the first time for Michelle Rodriguez - what a great job she did. Adrian and her coach were also pretty good. This movie is a bit rough around the edges, but it does not matter even to the slightest extent. Story, will, and performance completely outweigh all the flaws (which usually come with Indie production anyway). A convincing portrayal of a girl found and triumphed over her circumstances and a K.O. for Michelle Rodriguez!
