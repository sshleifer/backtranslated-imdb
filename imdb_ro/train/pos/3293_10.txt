If ever I was asked to remember a song from a movie for years, then it should have been "Chalo Di Daar Chalo Chand Ke Paar Chalo" for its meaning, how it is sung by Lata Mangeshkar and Mohd . Rafi, the lyrics of Kaif Bhopali and let alone cinematic photography when the sailing boat opposes the black background and the bright stars. The other should be "Chalte Chalte". Pakeezah was Meena Kumari's last film before she died and the amount of time she took can be seen on screen. In each of the songs that are painted, she looks young but then does not. But an actor who has not changed in appearance is the late Raj Kumar, who falls in love with her and especially with her feet, accidentally entering the train and when he sees them, he leaves a note describing how beautiful I am . <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Pakeezah is a beautiful romantic story that, if possible, should be seen on the big screen just for the sake of cinematic photography and songs. The film is called Meena kumari, Raj Kumar and Ashok Kumar and is directed by Kamal Amrohi. Kamal Amrohi's nephew began to revive his father's studio by making a comedy film.
