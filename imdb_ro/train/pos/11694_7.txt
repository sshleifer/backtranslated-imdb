Chris Rock starred in this remake of Warren Beatty Can Wait (a 1941 remake of the film "Comes Mr. Jordan"), a comedy about a man dying before his time before he can accomplish his dreams and his adventures in his work new (though temporarily) body. In the Beatty version, the protagonist was a backup defender for the Rams in Los Angeles. In the Rock Hipper version, our main character is a young fight - and determined low-talent -. Comedy stand-up <br /> <br /> It's very fun to see Sharp Rocks play a bad comedian. It's kind of like seeing Tom Hanks playing a bad actor. Lance Barton's dream is to play the legendary Apollo Theater on a non-amateur night. But every time he tries his material, he has escaped the scene lustily - so much so that the nickname becomes "Booie". His jokes are blades, his painful delivery. In short, Lance is all that Chris Rock really is not. <br /> <br /> Lance is also a bike messenger and he rides the streets on the road to even try more material when BAM! It's hit by a truck. Okay, so maybe he was taken from his body a tenth of a second earlier by an incompetent angel (Eugene Levy), but hey, he was going to hit anyway. No dice, it seems that Lance is not due in the sky until 2044. So what do I do? King King (Chazz Palminteri), the Heavenly Manager, firmly agrees to find a new non-dead body for Mr Barton. The problem is that the body I find is of a white, old, greedy man. It seems that this guy (Mr. Wellington) owns all sorts of things - he is the richest man in the country! What luck! You can imagine how Lance will change things. <br /> <br /> But, of course, while in Wellington's wealthy body, Lance falls for a superb hospital worker (Regina King). We, men, know how hard it is to find a woman given to our body, but try to win once when you are an old, old, old guy! And it's even worse when it's not impressed with your money. <br /> <br /> This is Rock's first blow to a leading role, and in my opinion he performs admirably. There is still a lot of stand-up comedians in it - and of course, if he ever wants to get different roles, he could have stopped incorporating standup routines into the script - but this is not really a bad thing. The personality of Rock - his journey, his delivery, his behavior and his passion - are what fuel this film. He has a lot of fun in the role, and he seems to be inclined to make sure you have some fun about him.
