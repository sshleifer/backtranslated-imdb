I liked the movies. Another Yash Paradise movie you know will look good on screen, all the character is always beautiful or very beautiful, with the only exception that you know that eventually it will hide to be beautiful ... Another rule of Yash's rays movie is like the hero or hero; to have only one or no parent. Think of all these movies .. MPK Suman did not have Mom, HMAPK Salman did not have parents, and the final rule is that you have 90% likely to see Alock Nath crying ... The film is such good. It's a little slow at first, but it keeps you entertained. There is almost no comedy, but it makes you smile quite often. The kid (nephew of the hero) is well placed and offers a very good line. The actress is very cute, but shy you will not get that in real life. this movie does not have happy massive families living in BIG's house, which you were a good idea and allowed the film to differentiate itself from other films. There will be many women crying at the end of the movie. There is not a strong message in this movie, but a good watch. If you are married (the arranged marriage), the movie will remind you of what you've been through. And if you are not informed and can scare you ... In general, a very nice movie. There are no large plots or overturns, but a very gentle film, very similar to the classic Bollywood.
