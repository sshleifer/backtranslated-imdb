The "last wave" is much more than the sum of its parts. It's not just a film of disaster, not just an exploration of Austrian Austrians' spirituality and certainly more than just a drama. Writer / director Peter Weir manages to take these elements to the next level to produce a truly effective and thoughtful film with the same wonderful atmosphere he gave with Picnic At Hanging Rock two years ago that you will continue to remember years later. When lawyer David Burton (Chamberlain) is called upon to defend Chris Lee (Gulpilil) from the death of an aboriginal, for whom he may or may not be directly responsible, he finds not only fighting the truth of Lee but understanding what he hears when he comes. As in the case of the aboriginal belief that there are two worlds - the days of the day and the dream time, the truth exists on two completely different levels, with more disastrous ramifications than they would ever have imagined for Burton. Undoubtedly, the reason why "Picnic to Hanging Rock" is better remembered is because of its lasting mystery. We are guided in the same way, but we are forced to find answers for ourselves. In The Last Wave, we can do everything together by the end of the movie. However, even with all the information, we have to choose how much we want to believe, because the film takes us beyond the boundaries of our normal realities. In terms of production, Weir uses the budget for a great effect, gradually building a sense of doom in everything, from soft light to torrential rain, to good sound use. The incident music is discreet, never trying to be grandiose. Richard Chamberlain manages to convey a mess that the audience will undoubtedly feel when trying to uncover the mystery. David Gulpilil portrays greatly a man caught between two worlds who want to do the right thing, but he fears that he already knows the end. Put all these things together and you have a perfect example of why David Weir is a thirty-year-old name. Highly recommended.
