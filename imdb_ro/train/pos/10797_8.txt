Compressed, elegant Carol (wonderful played by beautiful Rebecca Brooke), her beautiful husband Eddie (David Houseman's lover), Carol's blessing, who constantly eats the finest Anna Anna (delighted with the infectious zeal of the adorable Chris Jordan) Pete's amorous husband (a typical Eric Edwards fine) is a quartet of freed swingers who enjoy a group of sex frequently with each other. Their routine routine is destroyed when Carol, the only aunted, but at the same time seductive, mother Jennifer (an incredible moving performance of beautiful Jennifer Welles) falls for a visit. Pretty soon, Jennifer unleashes and becomes a willing participant in a gentle, pleasant and unhindered lifestyle, with everyone, except Carol eager to seduce her. Writer / director Joe Sarno performs a sharp, profound and perceptual examination of suburban aggression and limitations of the sexual revolution of all wild 70; Sarno turns the traditional middle motifs on their heads and other spices things up with a daring and provocative incest mother / daughter subplot. In addition, Sarno plays a leading role in the bang-up: Welles and Brooke are both exceptional, with the excellent support of Edwards, Jordan, Houseman, Arlana Blue, like Shedara, Shredara psychologist, and Erica Eaton. Fields. Better, all women are extremely warm and enticing; Welles especially grabs the screen with an extraordinary voluptuous figure and a devious erotic presence. Sexual scenes are really sizzling and quite explicit, but never raunchy or boring. Stephen Colwell's brilliant polished cinematography and Jack Justis's popular and acoustic melodic score are both solid and efficient. Recommended view for fans in Sarno.
