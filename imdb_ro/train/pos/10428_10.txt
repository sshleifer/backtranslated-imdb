An amazing film that, theoretically, should be boring, but it is delivered with incredible subtlety and action that I have long despised to ever find. Instead of relying on clich√©s and extremely dramatized moments, the plot unfolds through a series of incredibly realistic moments. Driving characters are not perfect, so it's easy to relate to them as people you can meet. The film does not try to laugh or push an ideal to the public, but simply to show us the possibility of true love in any circumstance. <br /> <br /> I am now anxious waiting for the weekend to see the continuation. A glance on the move, a provocative and funny thought of love that I think should be an absolutely romantic classic with Casablanca and Breakfast at Tiffany's. It will soften even the hottest heart.
