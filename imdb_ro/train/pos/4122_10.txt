Of course I'd like to see a resurrection of the Seahunt series so far, with the technique they have today, would bring the child's enthusiasm back to me. I grew up on black and white TVs and Seahunt and Gunsmoke were my hero every week. my vote for a return of a new sea hunter. We need a change of pace in television and this would work for a world of underwater adventure. I also thank you for a plug like this to see many views on TV and many movies. So, any way I think I have what I mean. It would be nice to read more points about sea hunting. If my rhymes were 10 rows you would let me oblige or let me be doubts and I have to give up, If that is so, then I have to go, so leave it.
