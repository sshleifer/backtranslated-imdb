Bravo for the Czechs, their once-powerful film industry seems to wake up from post-communist sleep. The singers are a comedy done with all the elements you would expect to see in a modern "hollywood" production minus garbage that seems to attach to gender in recent years. An excellent story, excellent picture rendering, a beautiful panorama of Prague, to mention just a few. The story is actually composed of several sub-stories that intersect frequently and overlap, essentially is a collage of destiny, hate, desires ... A group of young people from urban youth from the mid-thirties to thirty years, through a variety of situations, from everyday life and recreational activities to career and obsession. And he's hilarious. There is a point in the movie where the theater I was in (about 100 people in a small art gallery) laughed non-stop for 40-50 seconds. How often do you feel about modern Hollywood productions? Although the entire main cast is excellent (especially the forthcoming Macedonian star Labina Mitevska as an immigrant facing the familiarities) I must point out Jiri Machacek for portraying Jakub, a constantly married bohemian whose brain is badly affected by the things he smokes and landing him in a lot of funny situations. miss that! He has a lot to offer.
