"California" is a great movie that makes us look at ourselves. The movie has a big cast, Brad Pitt (Johnny Suede, A River Runs Through It, and Autumn Legends) as Early Grayce, David Duchovny (The X Files) as Brian Kessler, Michelle Forbes (Star Trek: The Next Generation, Homicide: Life on the Street, and Escape from LA), Carrie Loughlin, Brian's girlfriend, and Juliette Lewis (Natural Born Killers, Cape Fear and Gilbert Grape) like Adele Corners, his early girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Brian Kessler is a writer who is a liberal, is preparing to write a book about killers.Brian's serial and his girlfriend, Carrie decide they want to move to California, so Brian puts an ad to college for some who want to go to California to share spending during the trip. Early Grayce is an ex cone and passport sociopath, who has recently lost his job at the mirror factory in the city, is in debt, owes his owner's money. Ely's release officer stops to visit him and tells him about a job. and sees the law notice, he later tells Adele, his girlfriend about leaving to go to California.Early and Adele on Brian and Carrie at the bus station and leave town.Brian and Carrie do not know he is a killer who just killed his owner. For a while, Brian and Carrie thought of Early and Adele happenings, but they met and became friends, Carrie and Adele became good friends. Their journey is a very learned one. though Brain and Carrie do not know earlier is a killer later in the movie.The question. The Brian asks in this film about the difference between killers and us is a very good question. Early Grayce is a sociopath who does not see the error of his ways, the hill later and pays the price. This movie is a great movie, I give it 10/10 stars and 2 fingers up. I love the songs in the film, especially at the end of the movie, the song "Look in the sky" by the Indians.
