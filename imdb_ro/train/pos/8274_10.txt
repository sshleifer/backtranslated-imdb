This movie is great. It seemed very interesting to me. I thought the Wendigo legend was pretty good. The actor was also great, as well as costumes, production, photography, direction and script. <br /> <br /> A very happy family on vacation gets stuck in the middle of nowhere after it has hit a deer. Then a hunter appears and is very upset and angered by the fact that one of the deer horns is broken. Then he begins to trace his family and strange things begin to happen to them. <br /> <br /> See this movie. It's worth it. Kudos to distribution, crew and directors. Two wings up!
