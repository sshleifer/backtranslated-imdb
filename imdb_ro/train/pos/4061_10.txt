This is the best oak I've ever heard of Disney and the best adaptation from the biggest abuse in history, theme, characters, dialogs from the Kiki Delivery Service. Urrrghhh <br /> <br /> It has a different atmosphere, especially deviation from the common heroine. She has both heroes and heroines (although I do not really support the use of the hero and the heroine here, because Miyazaki is outside the stereotype and common ground). As usual, after being introduced by Spirited away, amazed by Mononoke, troubled by Grave of Fireflies and deeply touched by Majo no Takkyuubin, it starts with a little doubt on my part. He wonders if this will be Ghibi's first Dud. Well, in the end, just like yesterday and the whisper of the heart, I came to give 10 rating. I would give 9.8 rating, but 0.2 extra is there to share the good feeling by encouraging people to see the movie. SPOILER Somehow I see this movie as a sad movie, people die in such a, the lonely robot, the abandoned place and ends with destruction. It is as if mankind can not live with too much power. The scene that collapsed gave me traces of metropolis ending. It's just somehow sad. This plot is evident in most reviews and cast iron rules (as a rule). Joe Hisaishi really belongs to Uematsu, Kanno, the Williams caliber. People who can bring a movie, a game, an event to life, even for long moments of breathtaking composition. a movie that had been part of American cinema on classical days (it's a wonderful life etc etc). Well, things are changing ...
