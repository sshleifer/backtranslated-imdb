I'm afraid it was a movie that you really need to see to get something out of it. I'm not a mindless movie that ... "LEATHAL WEAPON PART 58" Do you know where Riggs is really crazy? is not a movie that is almost the same at the end of the movie. you can run everywhere talking on the phone to do what ever and to enjoy in any way. I've noticed in the past that most people who do not like this type of movie are the guy who will do the most to follow a movie and then slam because ..... I do not understand or understand or what happened. DO NOT DOGGY take a shower!
