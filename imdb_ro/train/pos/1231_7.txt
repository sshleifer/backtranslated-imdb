I like the good and bad battle. I liked Eddie in this movie better than any movie he ever did. He was not smart, weird, he knew everything he usually plays. He shows the heart and humor more humorous. The fact that he shows that there are foreign things in Heaven and on earth, which we can tell, gives me hope.
