This is one of the most frightening, frightening and frightening EVER horror movie! <br /> <br /> Dr. Creed (Louise) and his family move to new homes with his wife (Rachel), Daughter (Ellie) and little son (Gage) Everything seems normal until Dr Creed loses a patient a terrible evil on his head, then he is haunted by the ghost that Victor takes him to Pet Sematarty and shows him where the dead come to life. Louis does not know if that was all his dream and is talking to Ellie worried about her cat who could be killed by the truck and then later, Rachel tells Louis that it's very hard to talk about death because of her sister, Zelda , who was really sick (as we see in a flashback how sick her sister really was and this is one of the most creepiest scene ever!) The next day, Louis received a phone from Jed saying that the cat was killed by the truck and Jed takes him to the place where Victor said the Spirit did not work! And bury Cat, his wife and his children go to see their grandmothers and Louise is home alone shocked to see the cat coming back and now it's as bad in her eyes so she goes to see Jed then Jed telling them that he also buried the dog there (as we have seen other flashbacks). Later, in the Family movie out having Picnic, Gage is playing with kite and Gage say I drop, "the wind blows the rod near the road where a truck comes in the past fast, Gage is getting closer to the road, Louis hurry to it, Most HEARTBREAKING scene in any horror movie will go with the jaw on the floor or Shivers will go down behind when you hear Louis cry out, Soon it loses so much, Louis buries the Gage in the same place where the cat is buried The most frightening thing about this movie is that some scenes in this movie are not far from real life. <br /> <br /> This movie is just amazing and acting from everyone was great! 10 out 10
