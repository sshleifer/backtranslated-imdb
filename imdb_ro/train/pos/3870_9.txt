This is a very dense, sleepy and complicated movie that slowly releases, revealing exorbitant details such as the attention paid in a novel and watching this "IS" movie as if you were following a novel. While I did not care about the narrator because I felt he was not in balance with the rest of the shows, this film contains some of the best ensembles I've ever seen, and Summer Phoenix lead is fabulous. Her innocence and the naivety of some people might find it unlikely, a cross between Cinderella and Alice in Wonderland. I can buy that critique, but it's still fabulous, partly because it does not look like anything I've ever seen. This movie is incredibly beautiful, shot by Eric Gautier, and some of what is so unique about this movie is how it never shows what you expect. It is always surprising and, despite its length, the film never reveals much more than it should be. At 163 minutes, it is extremely concise, for a mistake, I would say, which is one of the wonders of this film. It is full of short moments, which are simply amazing, some of the best you can see all year round and all these moments are finally added to an extraordinary movie experience. Family moments are unique, Ian Holm is brilliant, and what this movie has about theater has not been seen in Cassavetes' "Night Opening" films, or perhaps in Chaplin's "Limelight." But, believe it or not, this movie is more "conventional". I never knew where this movie is going, and now, after seeing it, she still has multiple possibilities. This is a powerful, incredibly challenging movie.
