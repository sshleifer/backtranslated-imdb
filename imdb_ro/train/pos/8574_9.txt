The film is working on many levels: there is everything from car crashes and cakes to very good jokes (still subtle) for adults Glenn Close is at. her evil sublimely best as Cruella (`tell me Ella ') by Ville. <br /> <br /> After three years at the Dr. Pavlov behavioral change clinic, she is cured of her desire for fur? even the puppy skin she'd wanted so much. She even has all fur garments placed in the extraordinary castle dungeon she inhabits. <br /> <br /> But it would not be a movie for ?? Dalmatian, "without Cruella's subterfuges and machinations, and you know something will change the behavior change. And now she needs an extra puppy (so 102 Dalmatians) to complete her bad schedule for this round. <br /> <br /> Ioan Gruffudd is instantly appealing as the hero of the film that runs the 'second chance' dog shelter. Although he was in the "Titanic" and last year's (like Pip) television version of "Great Expectations" I did not recognize him; Well, he was ?? Fifth Officer Lowe "in" Titanic "and I did not see Great Expectations, so I'm not very surprised. <br /> <br /> Gerard Depardieu makes a delightful turn like the Cruella fur-pawn. Do you have levers and posts in the most brilliant and scandalous fur apparel you've ever seen? and it does well. His "Witched Witch of the West" is hilarious. Tim McInnerny is superb is Cruel's not-so-bad henchman ?? he was also Alonzo, "Cruella's butler in" 101 Dalmatians, "and you can also recognize him from all the" Black Adder "Brit-Coms. He plays his usual bumbling, good-bye, somewhat It's unfortunate that Glenn Close's stunning apparel is incredibly detailed (notes her handcuffs when released from the Behavioral Change Clinic) and worthy of such a character all over her own apparel deserves at least an Oscar nomination.Animation has a special place in my heart, but comparing this movie to the movie The original animated is that the apple's comparison with the orangutans: it can not be done. It is enough to say that "102 Dalmatians" are even better than the "101 Dalmatian" movie that came out in 1996. There are many things which you like here: from the visual gangs, dialogue and casting suits - is a good film for the whole family.
