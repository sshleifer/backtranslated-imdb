The film starts very slowly, with Wallace Napalm's lifestyle, a companion at a drop-off photo-service station. His wife was confined to her home with an ankle bracelet following an arrest sentence. Wallace is a member of the volunteer fire department and takes a serious fight against fires. As we follow Wallace's life, suddenly something new and gossiping comes: a travel carnival comes to town. One of his stars is Wilder Napalm, Wallace's brother. He's a clown, but he has a special talent. So did Wallace. They are both pyrokinetics or "pyrophysiologists", people capable of starting the fire through mental energy. Wallace keeps his powers in secret; Wilder allows his knowledge to know what he can do. Spoiler: Some of their differences are returning to an incident from childhood, where they unfortunately caused the death of a vagrant. Wallace retains the use of his powers; Wilder wants to go on national television. Complicating the problem, Wilder wants Wallace's wife, whom they gave her years ago. It becomes a bone of controversy and becomes one of the reasons why brothers ultimately have a literal struggle. The movie is fun, but not funny-out-funny. I think it's enough to have a copy in my library. It's an excellent movie.
