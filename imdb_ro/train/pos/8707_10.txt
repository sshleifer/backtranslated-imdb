"Mechenosets" is one of the most beautiful romantic movies I've ever seen. The name of the film can be translated into English as "the sword bearer". The main hero (Sasha) was born with one exceptional skill: he can protect himself with the extremely sharp sword coming out of the leather in his hand. At first glance, he may seem like a crazy superhero in the senseless movie about unreal events and feelings. But it's not about Mechenosets. He can not even be called an anti-hero. I think he is just a person who lost the spokesman in his life and faith in good, justice and love. In his life, he has never met anyone who understands and loves him (except for his mother). Each step is dirty with blood; he takes revenge on everyone for his gift, which has become a curse for him. And suddenly she meets her. It does not need talks and explanations waiting. He loves him for what he is. He does not care what he did. The fact that she is next to her is more important than anything else. But she soon finds her secret: she kills two people (her former boyfriend and her bodyguard) to protect her just before her eyes. Even then she could not escape her feelings. He's trying to run, but it's hart to hide. Eventually, they have a serious car accident. He is placed in cages; she is in a psychiatric hospital. They know nothing about each other, but she thinks she will save her. He overcomes a lot of obstacles, but eventually finds it. They run again, but they are not invulnerable. She is hurt, she needs rest, but the police almost catch them. He does not know what to do, I travel in a corner and then the sword begins to cut trees, helicopter around them, but it does not need her, because she is already dead in her arms and is the only person from all over the world again.
