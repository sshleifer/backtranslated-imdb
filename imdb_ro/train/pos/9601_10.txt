Darius Goes West is an amazing documentary about a teenage girl (Weems) with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and the 11 friends who lead him on a country trip to see if "Pimp My Ride" will prophesize his wheelchair. br /> I recently watched this movie at the Sunscreen Film Festival. He played twice during the festival. This movie is an amazing story about the human spirit and the spirit of Weem's friends. I do not say this often about movies, but after watching this movie, I feel relieved to do something about the cause. At each festival where this movie was featured, this film won a kind of prize. He is at the Tribeca Film Festival and will meet in London and Athens, Greece. I would not be surprised if this movie went to the Academy Awards. The snow block is out of control. If someone has the chance to see this movie, wherever they play, go! Take as many people as possible and go! He heads to New Orleans for a film festival, then to Atlanta and Palm Beach, FL. Darius is from Georgia, so I expect tickets for Atlanta to be sold quickly if they are not already. Please, visit this movie! DGW (speaks about it) <br /> <br /> -Kish
