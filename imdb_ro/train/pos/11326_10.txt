I watched the first 17 episodes and this series is simply amazing! I was not interested in a series of anime from Neon Genesis Evangelion. This series is basically based on an h-game, which I'm not sure if it was done before or not, I did not play the game, but from what I heard it was doing very well. <br /> <br /> I give this series a 10/10. She has a wonderful story, exciting characters and some of the best animations I've ever seen. It also has a great Japanese music in it! If you have not seen this series yet, check it out. You can find thinned episodes on some anime sites out there, it's straight from Japan.
