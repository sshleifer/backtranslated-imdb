While it was a better movie than 101 Dalmations (live action, not animated version), I think it's a little smaller than what Disney could do. It was well filmed, the music was better suited for action, and the effects were better (compared to 101). The actor was probably better, but then human characters got much more suited roles in this sequel, and Glenn Close should not be missed as in the first film. It makes him shine. Her foolishness and her high-heeled stones are wonderful characters to play and add to the performance that Disney has given us. This is a great family film with little or no negligible material, but it still remains fun and exciting for both adults and children. It's bound to be a classic, like many Disney movies. Here we hope the third will be even better - because you know they probably want to do one. ;)
