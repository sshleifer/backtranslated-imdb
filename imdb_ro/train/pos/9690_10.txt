Paulie was nice, cool, pleasant and pretty fulfilled. I went to this film waiting to see a typical "family" movie, one that in moments would find my unconscious and salivation on the floor. My frame of motion changed immediately when I was quickly captured by the health of the movie. It's rare to find a family movie that's deep and can be invented "healthy." Most are made inexpensively, written and produced only to attract young family members who will then drag the unfortunate elders into a mind that numbs 65 minutes of gags and plots. plot. She told the story of a young girl (Marie) and her best friend, Paulie, the parrot, who spoke incredibly and often talked with her. Marie's father, dorky, found this incredible and thought Paulie was harmful to the mental health of her 4-year-old daughter and broke them quickly. We follow Paulie's adventures (and mistakes) as he tries to reunite with his beloved owner, meeting many memorable characters along the way. Yes, Paulie could really (intelligently) speak and have a quick focus on New Jersey. Cold. The land took place thick and fun all along, keeping me attracted. Paulie is the best family film I've ever found and I really enjoyed it. Ever. Seriously. Lift up a copy and stay back and enjoy a true family movie with the whole family. Sleep forbidden. I promise.
