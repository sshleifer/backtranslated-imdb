Of course not, women are extremely sensitive and need on average, which is interesting from mother to bitch, though not pseudo-artistic, extravagant or obviously living. Unlike many of you, I've seen La Maman et La Putain twice. How many good movies I noticed, my opinion about this improved after a second view. All I know is what I've seen and I have not been able to exploit until I bought the DVD. I still have not realized why I like this movie so much, but why do I care what? Although I'm sure I can and will make a wonderful explanation. Okay, so you do not agree, maybe it's sometimes boring, I'm not an expert. Blonde reminds me of a wonderful Grushenka.
