When a little hobbit named Frodo Baggins inherits a magical ring from his uncle, expert Gandalf investigates and discovers that the ring is an old creation of a dark evil gentleman. If the ring ends in his hands, he will regain his power and destroy the Earth from the middle. Frodo and his loyal friends set off in an attempt to destroy the ring with a band of warriors. This is an undervalued adaptation of classical novels, as it covers only the first half of the story. Regardless, this is an epic and wonderfully animated movie. The animation is perfectly done with the rotoscope, which tracks live shots. Ralph Bakshi worked well with the low budget he was given. The film also boasts a great music score by Leonard Rosenman, which fits into each scene. There are some plotting holes with the script, but that has to be excused, since the original understanding was to make the book's trilogy in two films, it had to crawl in the first. My biggest flu is part of the character design, Samwise was a bit too bad, while the other hobbits behave normally. The other characters are actually well-written on the screen, and the voice actors do a good job, I was delighted that Legolas is actually a bit more useful for the plot. Rotoscopic orcs are more comical than frightening, while ringwraiths are misleading and nightmare. Another problem is that the evil Wizard Saruman is called Aruman, thanks to the writers. On the whole, I think a little more money and better writers would have done this a lot of justice, but there is something charming about it. Ralph Bakshi made a great effort to make these classic stories on screen. The movie suffers terribly from being overwhelmed by live movies, but it's still a great movie for animation lovers of all ages.
