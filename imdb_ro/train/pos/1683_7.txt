I saw this movie as the second feature on a disc that usually contained "Video Blood Rites". As the rites of blood were totally terrible, I did not expect too much for this film; but, in fact, it would seem that garbage director Andy Milligan has overtaken himself this time, since the Seeds of Sinn melts the rituals of blood in style and stands tall as a slice more than adequate for sixty-six years of sexploitation for years. In fact, the plot is quite similar to Blood Rites, because we focus on a dysfunctional family unit and of course; there is a legacy in the game. The film is shot in black and white, and its look and feel reminded me of a pack of classical garbage "The Curious Dr Humpp". Almost no gore is displayed, and the director seems more daring to focus on sex with incest and hate themes. The actress is usually traced, but most women become naked at one time and, despite a bad reputation, director Andy Milligan seems to have an eye for this kind of thing, because many of the sequences in this movie are actually quite beautiful . The land is thin paper, and most of the film is filler; but the music is appealing, and the director also does a surprisingly good job with the sexual scenes themselves, because most are somewhat erotic. Generally, this is not a great movie; but it is possible to appeal to the worship fan and receive a much higher recommendation than "Blood Rites" better known and of inferior quality.
