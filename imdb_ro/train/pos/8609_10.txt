I thought this was one of the best movies I've seen for a long time. It was an extraordinary story and showed that people are so complicated in all sorts of ways. They recommended it to all my friends !! I always like a good story line and this movie had one of the best I've seen for a long time. I saw that I had a daughter and did the same things that Natalie did to find out more about her life and about which she loves. She showed how not only we have lives with our families; but also have parts of our lives that we do not share with them - because it is not in their interest to know all the details of what we do not do that we are so proud of. /> I look forward to such a film and I will keep my eyes.
