Bette Midler is indescribable in this concert. He gives it everything every time he's on stage. Whether we laugh at jokes and jokes, whether we look at the strain of an extraordinary ballad, Bette Midler moves his audience. If you can not see it live (which is the best way to see Bette), then this is the best thing. An interesting thing to look at is how incredible the voice has changed and matured over the years but has not lost its strength. The more "right" version of "Stay with Me" never loses anything in the spirit of ROSE or DIVINE MADNESS, Here it is purer than ever. I will order this concert for a very long time.
