"Man in a White Suit" is another feather in the cover of Scottish film expert Alexander Mackendrick (Whiskey Galore !, The Smell of Success). The star of the film is Alec Guinness (whose comedies include Hearts Kind and Coronets and The Hill Lavender Mob). Guinness brings his regular class into the movie and makes it far more than a typical comedy. In fact, the comedy is not entirely obvious. By the end of the picture, it has almost become a complete drama. It's a kind of Ealing studio comedy that's calculated not to produce laughter, but a sense of general fun as the best British comedy of time. The idea of ​​the whole suit is not very original, but the way it is executed is. The film is extremely original and is recommended to any fan of comedy "Guinness" or "Britsh". <br /> <br /> 7.6 out of 10
