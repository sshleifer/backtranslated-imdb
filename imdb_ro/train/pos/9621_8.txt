Last night I had the pleasure of seeing the movie BUG at the Florida Film Festival and let me say it was a real treat. The directors were there and made a Q & A afterwards. The movie starts with a boy getting a roach under his leg, a man in the car park his young boy smash it and runs to ask the baby why? Why? had to kill that living creature? in his rush to advise young people in the error of his ways, man neglects to pay his parking counter, which starts from a whole chain of events involving people at all in connection with him, some funny, some sad and some ridiculous. This movie has many laughs, much! and there are many actors you will recognize. The main actors in the film for me were: Jamie Kennedy (from Jamie Kennedy Experiment's comedy show, singing a wealthy writer, John Carroll Lynch, who plays Drew Carey in Drew Carey). Brian Cox, originally Hannibal Lecter of Manhunter, who plays the germafob owner of a Donut and Chinese Food Out Out Alcoholic Drink There is a line where Cox tells the chef to wash the blood of the pigs on the sidewalk saying "clean that death" which is quite funny, especially because of Cox's "obsessed with germs." The funniest moment in the movie comes when a boy imitates his anthem, which he heard earlier that day crying "MotherF *** ** ", while in the classroom. Another extremely fun and surrealistic scene is when Trudie Styler (Ms. Sting) and another actor performs a stage on a cable show, the plastic bubble The actor who hosts the access cable is spectacular just amazing he is so serious and deadpan and his performances both doctor and boy in plastic bubbles is fascinating. There are many other beautiful and fun actors and actresses in this film and after shooting him in less than a month, with a budget of only $ 1 million, directors Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi (who are screenwriters of the trade have crazy / beautiful writing and the future of Tuxedo with Jackie Chan) made a movie that is wonderful, funny and coveted.
