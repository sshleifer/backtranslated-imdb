Rudy does it again with this hot on the streets following up to Dolemite. This entrance is filled with Rudy Ray Moore Circle, humor and martial arts. Rudy avoids a crazy red-headed sheriff in this movie, which also has an infamous scene in which Rudy sinks on a steep hill. See this for laughs and a blow to the magic of Blaxploitation.
