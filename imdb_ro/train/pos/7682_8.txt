Holly addresses the problem of child sexploitation, which is exaggerated around the world (about 2 million children are trafficked each year) and does so sensibly and without manipulation - a high command that the Priority Films team is doing with great success . American actor Ron Livington plays in the film with the newly-arrived Thuy Nguyen, a Vietnamese actress who plays Holly and together they bring on screen what is commonplace for people in the notorious k11 redlight district of Cambodia. While dealing with a difficult subject, the film is in moments of laughter and hope, as we know the close characters, keeping the two-hour film that is too hard to track. I'm glad a movie like this brings the world's attention to the problem. Prostitution of children should be stopped and this is a very good first step. It's great and a movie that everyone has to see.
