It was only a week since I first saw my John Waters movie (Woman Trouble), and I was not sure what to expect for the second time. While the previous movie was scandalous over the top, Pecker is actually a funny film that satirize New York's art critic to a T. Anyone can not imagine what "expert" people are making appealing to both modern art, will be glad to see that these pretentious snobs become so full of Pecker's boy who just found a broken room and started shooting his friends and neighbors. Edward Furlong (Pet Sematary II, Terminator 2: Judgment Day) was surprisingly good as Pecker. There was not much meat on any of the roles in this movie, but it really shines. Christina Ricci (Prozac Nation) comes with another great performance as Pecker's girlfriend. In fact, it was an annual banner for Ricci (Buffalo '66, Opposing Sex and Pecker.) Lili Taylor, who had only a good role in The Haunting, was also a significant part of the movie and did it really enjoyable. There are many funny scenes, but I have to say that it was best when a crown gathered by shouting, "We want Bush!" "I want Bush!" I want Bush! "I thought it was a Republican convention until I saw the police pulling out of the dancer. I'll have to look more for Waters' work, especially Hairspray, now that it's news.
