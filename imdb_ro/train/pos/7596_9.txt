The first episode immediately gave a good impression to expect from the series! The mysteries waiting to be solved and a lot of good drama! I like the fact that they are gradually discovering stories about the characters! Sufficient explanation to stay delighted! Of course, this show has some flaws! In the first two series there are some characters that for some reason do not appear in the third season! Many of the characters have a decent, but some of them just are not there! Like Rose and her husband! Where the hell are they? What happened to them? Maybe they'll be back in the next episodes! But it's a bit incoherent! That being said, "Lost" manages to be thrilling every episode (especially the first two seasons)! This is a very hard thing to do! I notice that in the third season the emphasis is more on the development of characters than on the mysterious aspects of the show! This is not a bad thing! It even saves some episodes from getting boring! One of the elements that can be considered the force of this show are the wonderful characters! You will grow to love these characters! Good or bad! But, finally, I would like to see some mysteries to be solved and concluded! The danger of "lost" being canceled because of falling ratings is near! And that would be devastating!
