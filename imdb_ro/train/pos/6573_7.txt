The movie has a lot of sense of a game right from the start - I think it would make a better play than a movie because the set and dramatization make a movie version seem a bit too artificial. But, however, they are doing pretty well, and the story and especially the dialogue are interesting. They took the dialogue exactly as it is from the real game. Maybe it's a good introduction to Shaw's pieces. The main character Raina has her head in the clouds and a talent for drama, and Helena Bonham Carter's acting is doing a good job here. Her fianc√©, Serges, is a bit upset when she's supposed to be an extremely beautiful figure. Her parents have plenty of fun.
