Seven pounds play Will Smith as Ben Thomas, an IRS collecting agent, who has a reason to meet those who have remained behind the tax. Thomas caused the death of seven people as he led to talk on his phone, and the film follows his attempt to try and make an atonement for his sincerity, sincere, unforgivable. The story line is as subtle as a brick through a glass window. What you see is exactly what is happening - even the end of Titanic was more surprising than the seven pounds. There is absolutely no overturning, there is never any confusion or doubt as to what is happening. Normally, I just like Will Smith when he's in Bad Boys. The guy is the best when he shows a gun, driving a Ford GT and saying "Aw Hell Nah" that whenever he tries to act seriously, he comes just like a pathetic attempt to try to get an Oscar he's so obviously desperate for. This is probably the main reason why we did not expect the movie, although it is highly underestimated here. There are comedy moves, but they are subtle, actually was Will Smith's most underrated performance I've ever seen, and for this reason alone was fantastic and ironic should be nominated for a major prize. Also, the support distribution was very high - Rosario Dawson showed quite a lot at the dead door the whole movie and Woody Harrelson and Barry Pepper were good as if all the other players bit. Generally, it's rainy - but it does not throw away all the usual clich√©s and sentimental beauties to give you a different possibility than to cry. There have been several times that even my stiff heart almost broke. You will be hard pressed not to find one of the situations that does not relate to your own life, which makes it look so real. I would give 8/10. The Will Smith show is heading to the drama without the desperation of the Search for Happiness, and it is all the better for her.
