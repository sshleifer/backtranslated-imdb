This movie is great. If you take it too seriously, of course you will hate it; however, the amount of "dudes" and "ons online" brings laughter and bad memories 15 years ago. I like my ability to make me chicote to plain jokes and obvious meanings and the ability to make me want to watch his precursor, "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure" (1989). If you are looking for a movie full of jokes and full mature humor, do not watch it; however, if you want a movie that is humorous and silly but intelligent and hired, you will enjoy it. In fact, I want to see more of these images in today's theaters. And hey, Keanu Reeves is the one who acts the way everyone is acting like acting ... well ... it does not do much better than that :)
