This is the second Eytan Fox movie I've seen. The fantastic actor, Lior Ashkenazi, who starred in Walk on Water, has a minor role in this film as well. But the real stars are the Israeli young people who live together in a small apartment - Noam (Ohad Knoller), Lulu (Daniela Virtzer) and Yelli (Alon Friedman); and the Palestinians who associate them - Ashraf (Yousef 'Joe' Sweid). There is something like Friends / Sex in the City that happens (most of the time homosexuals) and everyone wants only to end the war in order to be able to continue their lives in peace. But that's rub. It does not matter how many posters you put or how much burst of peace you have, the war will not end. Many have tried over the years to bring the two sides to the table, but they just want to keep it for any reason. There are many on the Israeli side, both there and here in the United States, who want everything and will not take peace. There are many on the Palestinian side that apparently would be outside a job if peace comes. It is not in anyone's interest to put an end to this war, and the children suffer. This is always in your mind while watching this funny and engaged movie. It will not disappear. You know that something tragic happens and, of course, it happens. With feelings on both sides running hard and revenge as a motivator, tragedy always happens, and that makes it an adult version of Friends / Sex in the city. There is no superficiality. It is a real life and it was a great thing to see.
