Absolutely one of my favorite movies of all time. I've seen her at least a hundred times, and I can not walk through it without crying. I advise someone to follow Celie and Nettie's meeting, or Shug and the father and not feel your eyes soften. Whoopie Goldberg should have a prize for an amazing portrait. And for the person who said you could not love the movie if you loved the book, wrong! I'm a testament to that.
