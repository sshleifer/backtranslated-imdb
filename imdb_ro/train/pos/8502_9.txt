Gung Ho is one of those movies you'll always want to see. Michael Keaton is commissioned to ask a Japanese car company to come to his town, creating jobs for Hadleyville residents. What happens after that is a hilarious moment after another. The two cultures collide and Keaton has to keep things together. Look for extraordinary performances from Keaton, Gedde Watanabe, George Wendt, Mimi Rogers, John Turturro, Soh Yamamura and Sab Shimomo. Everyone is perfectly thrown away. Do not be fooled by the low rating. This is a 7.5 in my book. It is interesting to note that Hadleyville's name was also used in High Noon. Yes, there is a real Hadleyville, but in Oregon.
