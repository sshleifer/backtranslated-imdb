As part of our vocabulary in the 1950s, we have very well met Ponderosa, Little Joe, Hoss, Ben Cartwright, etc. at that great show "Bonanza." He came on Saturday night and everyone was stuck in the TV. This was a real show describing family values. It may have been a weekly crisis, but the strong family atmosphere has attracted everyone's attention. Lorne Greene was dominant as the patriarch of the family. His words were wisdom. We often let us ask that Ben Cartwright, widow, must have been the best of his spouses to his poor wife who died. He grew up wonderful. Of course, we wondered why Pernell Roberts left the show. The show was a gold mine, and Roberts surrendered a lot of money when he left. His career never took off, being associated as a Cartwright son. He should have tried to come back in series. He has definitely lost a bonanza by abandoning it.
