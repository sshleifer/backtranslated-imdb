Sitting, typing? Nothing is the last "what if?" festivities offered by Vincenzio Natali and David Hewlitt and Andrew Miller in the role of the two losers. One has relationship problems, has work-related preservation (due to relationship issues), and the police are outside to receive it (due to job and relationship issues). The other guy is an agorafob who refuses to go out of his house, is met by a loving girl guy who calls his mom claim to be molested when he does not buy biscuits from him. Yes, the police are after him, after the seeker's mother calls them to arrest him. Man, what day. does it all disappear? This is the whole premise behind "nothing." The two fools do, the policemen, the scouts, the cars, the lawn, the road, everything? disappear. There is only white space! This is an interesting concept I thought. I also looked at this moment, 30 minutes went into the film, and I got an hour left in the movie. Could the two actors do this and keep our fun for 60 minutes? Although the actors are trying, 60 minutes are a long time and there is clear air in the places of this movie. But the two actors, who are friends throughout their lives with directors, have such a large repertoire that it was fun to watch the dialogue and improve your situation around them. There are a lot of supernatural elements, but it is more their response to these elements that eventually make this movie to see.
