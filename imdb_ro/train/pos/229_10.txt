In today's digital manufacturing world, there is no computer but can replace the actor and the writer. Unfortunately, this type of "personalized" movie is far too rare these days. Duvall's performance, as well as James Earl Jones, are faithful to the audience's high expectations. I wonder if this movie was made for television? It has a "near" personal quality of the narrative. It is undervalued that performance is all remarkable. The only thing that keeps him from being a Masterpiece cinema is the lack of a great cinema, but beautiful pictures are not everything. How can talent such as Jones and Duvall continue to produce such a good work in an era where actors are for digitization?
