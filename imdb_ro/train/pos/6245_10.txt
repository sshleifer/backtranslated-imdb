"Hundstage" is Seidl's first fiction film (before that he directed the great documentaries as "animal love" or "models"). Seidl has been working on this project for over 3 years, but costs only $ 2 million. the actors are very good, especially the unprofessional actors who played almost in themselves. cinema is also good. the whole movie is shockingly disturbing and some scenes may be too much for "ordinary" viewers. the film shows a lot of sex and violence, but also the fact that people are alone and can not communicate with each other. Finally, I must say that this is one of the best and most successful Austrian films in recent years. please excuse me for the English evil. <br /> <br />
