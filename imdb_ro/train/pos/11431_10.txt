My third-grade classes have benefited from this movie very much. In a multicultural high school, the film offered many topics for discussion (in French in class but I know a lot of discussions continued in English after hours). The most obvious is the relationship between Protée and Aimée, compared to that between Protée and France. I have always mentioned that I felt that this movie had one of the most "sexy" scenes I've ever seen in a movie. One year, a 17-year-old African American, shouted, "Yes!" when he realized the scene: the one in which Protée helps Aimée to make his evening gown, while both examine the other's reflection in the mirror. Directors use the "mirror" technique when they want to focus on the inner conflict of one or more characters in a scene: this is a perfect example of the technique and is "sexy". <br /> <br /> Most students had trouble understanding the end of the movie. One suggested that the theme of the film was "Africanism" and that no matter how much he loved Africa or Africans, he could not "become" African (just as the driver tried to do): you must be African.
