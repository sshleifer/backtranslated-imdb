If you want a Scream or something like a great studio product that we're pushing for today, do not bother. This well-written film made me think about everything she had to say. The importance of the myth in our lives to make sense, how children interpret the world (and the violence in it), our kidnapping in the environment and the ignorance of its history and legends ... all here, but not on the surface. You can technically call a "monster movie" even if Wendigo does not take the physical form to the end, and then it depends on yourself and your beliefs about what happens to the legendary spirit / animal. Some standard thriller items for those looking for basics and the movie never have pits, though, in fact, the less you see the creature, the better. Fessenden continues George Romero's tradition of using the genre as a parable and discussion forum, while we continue to keep dragging.
