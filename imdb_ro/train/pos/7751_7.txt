I really liked Tom Barman's AWTWB. You have to let her come over and enjoy it while it lasts and you do not expect anything. It's like sitting on a caf√©-terrace with a beer in the summer sun and watching people go. You will certainly not doubt it afterwards, it's true, but that's not a prerequisite for a good movie. It's just a movie experience that's great. I felt there were a few threads that could have been solved a bit longer, but being a Lynch fan, I do not care so much :) <br /> <br /> And I * loved * the style, or flair of this movie. It's slick but fresh, and the soundtrack is a beauty. Any music lover will take off the AWTWB, I can assure you. <br /> <br /> I will give her 8 out of 10. <br /> <br /> (wise musical 10 out of 10)
