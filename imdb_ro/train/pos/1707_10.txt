This movie is not for everyone. You're either bright enough to get it or not. SF fans, who do not take seriously, will enjoy this movie. I recommend this movie to those who can appreciate spoofs and parodies. We all recommended that this movie be enjoyed by him. If you enjoy the movies of Monty Python or Mel Brooks, you'll probably enjoy this movie. Voice characters are made in a clear manner, and unique vessels fly fast and angry.
