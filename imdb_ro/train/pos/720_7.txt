Imagine what school would have been in a world like this: kids are a big band that have a really good taste in music and unite against evil directors and teachers. "Rock 'n' Roll" High School takes place in this world. It's like a Ramones record that comes to life. The characters are as silly, innocent and charming as the Ramones songs, and the music itself is, of course, fantastic. High School Comedies have really changed over the years by comparing a movie like American Pie with this classic 70s, where there are no sex jokes. Because a remake seems to be in the factory, one can expect the charm of the original to be lost along the way and replaced by the vulgar, half-funny jokes, as Bill Hicks calls them. However, the main problem will be that Ramones CAN NOT be replaced. They were the perfect band for this film and no one else could get close to taking their place. So the best thing to do is leave the original alone, as strange and charming as it is. Gabba-gabba hey!
