I slept with my gf last night and, while brushing my teeth, I overturned the channels until I came across the Chinese movie called The King of the Masks. At first I thought it would be a Kung Fu movie, so I started looking at her and then captured me immediately and had to finish. absolutely adorable. He was such an actor to be so little. Perhaps it was in Chinese, so the English were called harder for me, but it really seemed to have a perfect character. I felt so bad for the girl as she tried to like the "boss", but it turned out to be rotten. LOL. Even when he brings him another nephew, just to transfer his art ... it seems the kid has been kidnapped, so he is arrested and has 5 days to live. lol ... no matter what she touches in an effort to be beautiful with her grandfather, she just returns. Finally, he sees how much love he is in it and teaches the mask art ... which is just so enthusiastic about all the unpleasantness of the movie. Definitely a jewel, and totally original. <br /> <br /> Scott
