Cliffhanger is what seems to be Slyvester Stallone's latest action movie before he becomes such an undervalued actor. This is a mountain mountaineer who must help his boyfriend after being held hostage by mercenaries who want to find three suitcases with over 100 million dollars of money. It has a great sequence of action, fun on the chair and excellent movie time.
