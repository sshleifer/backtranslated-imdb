Wonderful Barbara Bach plays Jennifer Fast, a television reporter who travels with his crew (Karen Lamm and Lois Young) in Solvang, California to cover a Danish festival. The problem is that their accommodations have fallen and all the hotels in the city are full. So they travel from the city to a remote location and take advantage of the hospitality of seemingly friendly friend Ernest Keller (a phenomenal Sydney Lassick). You did not know that, Ernest and her gentle partner, Virginia (Lelia Goldoni), are hiding a big secret in their cellar: "junior" (Stephen Furst, with remarkable performance), deformed, deformed, diabolic, finally terrorizing girls. <br /> <br /> An unparalleled Lassick plays the true monster in this horrifying little horror movie. It builds slowly but surely in intense confrontation / climax, giving horror in low doses until the last half an hour. The hotel and the preconceived cellar - the big echoes of "Psycho" here - are great settings. Moreover, the perverse plot presupposes incest and patricide, allowing the film to have a truly dark quality. And yet, she also becomes painful, as we realize that Junior is not a bad one-dimensional bogeyman, but as much a victim as the girls. The final picture is very sad. <br /> <br /> "The Unseen" is a little awful movement of discovery.
