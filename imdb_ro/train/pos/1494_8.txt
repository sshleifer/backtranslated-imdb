A classic offer from Amicus, producer Milton Subotsky and director Peter Duffell ("The Far Pavillions" etc) turns into a smart "four hands" with a strong cast (Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Jon Pertwee, Ingrid Pitt etc. ) all offering stylish performances despite a low budget that results in some "special effects". The most remarkable contribution, however, is that of the 7-year-old Chloe Franks that turns into a refreshing reaction on her part that makes the blood cool. Only spoiled by the crazy title the film wants from its distributors, this undervalued release, a cut above the film "blood" n 'guts' shocker, is for those who appreciate a little thought with their horror.
