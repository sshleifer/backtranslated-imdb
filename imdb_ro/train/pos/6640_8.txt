This one minute movie is undoubtedly the first ever movie ever made. Other inventors have previously shot actions - such as Edison's motion picture of endeavor - but the Lumiere brothers have developed equipment that is advancing enormously in the environment. At that moment, of course, their "cinema" must contradict their colleagues, including their subjects. In this first instance, the brothers record employees leaving the factory, some of whom wisely struggle to conceal their conscience about the room. Lumieres tries to make the movie more fun by introducing animals and a bike, but "La Sortie Des Usines Lumiere" does not match almost the ingenuity of their subsequent films. The most interesting aspect of this short film is selecting the brethren from an ordinary ritual of working class as a subject. Their choice is the initial proof of their curiosity about all the world's people, a quality that makes viewing their experiments extremely satisfying and fascinating today. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8
