The Internet database displays this as a TV show. And yes, it was a series on MTV on Oddities, after "The Head" and before "Aeon Flux" if I remember correctly. But the version I watched this time was a VHS tape with all the episodes that run together in a movie without having annoying credit to each other or waiting for a week in the next fifteen minutes. Maxx, Julie Winters, Sarah and Mr. Gone. Maxx is a super hero or boy, Julie, a social worker or a leopard queen, Sarah a girl who should listen less than The Smiths and Mr. Gone a guy who does not seem to keep his head. And then there are the other strange creatures ... I use "or" with Maxx and Julie, because some of the fun is trying to figure out which parts of the story are real and which are dreams. Maybe they are all real or dreams. Perhaps one of the characters does not exist. Perhaps there is only one and the dreams of others. You will have to wait and find out. I had the comic books before the show came up and it was one of my favorites. The artwork was spectacular and the story was original - unlike anything you find in Superman or Batman. It will bend your mind and will have powerful tones for adults without being obscene or offensive. And the show has practically used the exact same (just now moving) work and the same story ... ensuring that the intrinsic beauty found in the comic would be reproduced with fidelity. This was the best show that appeared on the "strangers" with their hands down. If you like comics of a darker nature or need a good mind trip, this is a show to check out. It's "Donnie Darko" before there ever is such a thing. The most surprising thing is that this has never gone to become another movie or television series, but I do not say this in disappointment. By keeping it simple, they sealed this film in gold and kept it free of stains caused by successive failures.
