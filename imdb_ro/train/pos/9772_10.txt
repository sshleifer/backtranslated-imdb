Theodore Rex is probably the greatest cinematic experience of all time and is certainly a milestone in human culture, civilization and artistic expression! In this appealing intellectual masterpiece, Jonathan R. Betuel aligns himself with the great filmmakers of the twentieth century, such as Francis Ford Copola, Martin Scorcese, Orson Welles and Roman Polanski. The special effects are not surprising at all, and they do anything by Spielberg to show tribute and elementary. At the time of his release, Theodore Rex was a revolutionary jewel that lifted the shooting bar to levels that were not anticipated by filmmakers. The concept of making not just a cinematic image of a dinosaur but the adaptation of a novel of action-oriented detective coinciding with a "speaker" dinosaur with a post-modern name such as "Theodore" humanity as we know it . The world could not be the same after experiencing such magnificent beauty. Theodore Rex's view is akin to looking at God and hearing it saying, "You are the most beloved creation." This is one of the few movies that is simply to die!
