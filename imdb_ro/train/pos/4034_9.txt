Pinjar is a really good movie with a good adventure, good narrative, good presentation, emotional emotions, etc. It seems to me that the quality of the films Bollywood produces is pretty good nowadays and this movie is proof. Not the Bollywood movie that I remember having had such an impact on me - I was literally thinking about the movie for hours - marveling at different emotional situations that test people in a man. The film is based on the great actor of Urmilla Matondkar, as well as one of Manoj Bajpai. Following is a girl in North India in the background of the partition and all the troubles seem sweet compared to the problems they face. <br /> <br /> A movie must-see. A technically superior Bollywood product I feel is comparable to the best films from other countries in the world.
