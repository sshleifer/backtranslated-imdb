It is expected that between 2000 and 2020, 68 million people will die prematurely as a result of AIDS. The projected fee is the highest in Sub-Saharan Africa, where 55 million additional deaths are expected. Beyond gloomy statistics are personal stories that we rarely hear. Christophe Honor√© describes one of the most moving ones in the movie Close to Leo, a film produced for French television, as part of a series dealing with the problems faced by young people. Although fictitious, it deals with a situation that, unfortunately, is too frequent - the effect of an HIV diagnosis on a loving family near. After twenty years, Leo (Pierre Mignard) parents and two teenage brothers, Tristan (Rodolphe Pauley) and Pierrot (Jeremie Lippmann) say he has AIDS, the family is devastated. For reasons of concern for youth, I decide to keep the information from my youngest brother, Marcel (Yannis Lespert) for 12 years, but he hears the conversation and begins to fight and act erratic. When Leo goes to Paris for treatment, he takes Marcel with him, but the boy faces Leo and asks for the truth. Leo tells him he's sick and that Marcel is sad, but he accepts. When he brings Marcel to former gay friends, the tension between them boils to the surface, setting the scene for an enduring conclusion. <br /> <br /> Although I did not feel comfortable with bed scenes involving physical contact between brothers, I feel that Close to Leo's sincerity and Lespert's and Mignard's brilliant performances are more than the end of the balance in his favor. Seeing the events that take place from the boy's perspective, the film offers authenticity that reminded me of Quebecois Leolo and Truffaut's The 400 Blows. Unlike some American movies that dance around AIDS pain, Near Leo says a tough truth, but does it in a way that is wonderful and really wonderful.
