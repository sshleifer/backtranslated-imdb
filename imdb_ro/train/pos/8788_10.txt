Well, I'm delighted to hear a rumor that this can be released on DVD. When this happens, I do not know, but I'll take it when it's released. In my humble opinion, this is Errol Flynn's most entertaining film, especially when the "Gentleman Jim" Corbett ring begins in the movie. Then it goes from one good movie to another. Few people could play arrogant men and yet they came as a good boy as well as Flynn, and this movie is a perfect example for that. Apparently it was Flynn's favorite role and I think so. You can feel how much fun it has here. Ward Bond also seems to be genuinely enjoying his role playing the famous John L. Sullivan. Bond has also never been better. <br /> <br /> There is only a good amount of box action action and here they are pretty good made. Corbett's family is fun to look as well, as they unfold in the stands during Jim's matches. From the game, Corbett's constant arguments and arguments may become a little too loud and annoying, but they have set the right conclusion. And speaking of the conclusion, Sullivan's speech at Corbett after the big fight is very moving and the climax of the film. Some top critics (such as the variety, for example) did not like this, or the fact that much of the film is fictionalized, but - most of the films are fictionalized, like or not. And in this case, she made a beautiful story and a beautiful ending. (In real life, Corbett was a true true gentleman, not something like Flynn's portrait, but Flynn still makes him a good guy.) This is one of the most fun classic movies I've ever seen and I look forward to DVD.
