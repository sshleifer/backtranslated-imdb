I think Lion King 1 1/2 is one of the best sequels ever, as if it were not the best of the three Lion King movies! In Timon and Pumbaa, tell us where they came from and have trouble getting along with others like Timon, who has trouble tuning tunnels with other ladies! Timon and Pumbaa travel to find their dream place to find and find him soon, and also to Simba, who raises but soon has to choose between their dream place or help them Simba to face his uncle Scar and proclaim his Rock right! Filmed with wonderful new characters like Ma (Timmy's Julie Kavner) and Uncle Max (Jerry Stiller). I think my favorite character was Uncle Max because it was very funny and was expressed by a funny comedian Jerry Stiller, Ben Stiller's father. Disney was smart to play Stiller in that role! Complete with wonderful characters, animation and story and music Lion King 1 1/2 is, in my opinion, the best of any sequel and better than Prida's Simba, though I admit that I really felt that way! Lion King 1 1/2 is a great Disney whole family can enjoy! It has a good story and it's very funny! 10 out of 10!
