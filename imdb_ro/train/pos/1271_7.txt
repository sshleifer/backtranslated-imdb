We have never seen this movie, based on Nicholas Katzenbach's entertainment novel and taking into account the first assembled scenario for production, we decided to take a look. "Just Cause," while not a terrible movie, takes too much of the original material that Jeb Stuart did not manage in his treatment. Arne Glimcher. <br /> <br /> The first thing we think when a black young man is shot in the local premises for questioning is police brutality. After all, Sheriff Tanny Brown and police officer Wilcox show no mercy in beating Bobby Earl, who is accused of killing a white girl. We feel terrified of what the officers do with the prisoner. Then the scene changes. Evangeline, Bobby Earl's grandmother is sent north to ask a professor at Harvard, a retired attorney, the young man wants Paul Armstrong to defend him. She's old enough is convincing enough for Armstrong to look at the case. He is also convinced of the young man's innocence. Things are not exactly what I thought. When Blair Sullivan, a man in charge of time in the same unity as Bobby Earl, goes on to say how he is tied to the assassination of the young girl and changes the dynamics of the case. The way it plays in the movie serves to confuse the viewer and distract Armstrong's attention from reaching the truth. This thriller is made good by Sean Connery, who plays Armstrong. Laurence Fishburne, an intense actor, makes a wonderful impression like the sheriff who, as far as we can see, is guilty of prisoner abuse. Ed Harris has a great opportunity to show why he is one of our best actors. Blair Underwood, Kate Capshaw, Ruby Dee and young Scarlett Johansson are seen to play roles. The film, even with its mistakes, will not disappoint.
