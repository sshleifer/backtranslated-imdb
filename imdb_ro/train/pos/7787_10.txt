This movie captures the essence of growing up in America for a young woman on its own. Realism and subtle nuances offered to Ashley Judd's character, Ruby's story, capture what can only be described as a true living set in Florida's panhandle. From the slam of a screen door, to the lack of work, the echoes of what is really life on the "red-necked riviera" offers rough choices to the young girl. Paradise did not come easily. But she slowly overcomes obstacles and deception and learns to be her woman with a power flowing from within. Ashley Judd's winning smile and infectious gait strikes warmth and respect and admiration. The careful character development of the character resembles "Ulee's Gold" in 1997, with Peter Fonda and directed by Victor Nunez.
