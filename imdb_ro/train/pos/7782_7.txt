the photo was beautiful, but I had difficulty understanding what was happening ... was a lot of symbols? ... the 2 golds - is it something in Thai culture? there are not too many plots, not too much happening and just moving. no real beginning, no real means, no real purpose. quite unsatisfactory indeed. It was difficult to get into the characters you never felt to know ... it was hard to know which scenes were imaginary and real. The movement felt chaotic and disjointed. I do not know what the Pangs were hoping to get. Perhaps if I were Thai, it would make more sense ...
