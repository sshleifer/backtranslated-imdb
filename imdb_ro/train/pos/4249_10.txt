Whether there are three boys in their crooked whites, singing to a guy in a string or a girl saying, "What's up, dog?" to a piece of roadkill, it's something that I pray to everyone in Knuckleface Jones.

And every night after I return home and follow it again. Forget about Coyote Ugly ... this is the movie that cemented my passion on Piper Perabo. See ... before it's too late!
