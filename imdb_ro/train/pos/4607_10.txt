My favorite film Jackie Chan will always be "Drunken Master" (1978), followed by this 1985 film Police Story. In it, Chan plays a Hong Kong super-policeman who bombs a notorious murderer and a band, and is then assigned to protect Brigitte Lin's girlfriend so he can turn the state's evidence. As the story continues, the gangsters send his friends to send Lin, but Chan takes things in his own fists and legs, while keeping Maggie Cheung's girlfriend. Like "Drunken Master," "Police Story" has many of the signature waterfalls and martial arts / action choreography from the beginning that Chan has become famous, culminating in a royal battle in a crowded mall. In his role as director, Chan surpasses excellence, delivering a charismatic and fun performance that emphasizes action. While the "Drunken Master" general humor shines on the heart, Police Story is precisely that police story, a thriller full of trees that would have copied over the years to come. <br /> <br />
