I really have to disagree with the yardley-rees pattern that would have seen an absolutely stunning Scottish landscape (some of the best scenes ever shot in Skye) and found a movie with a start difficult to bring together a really painful ensemble. This is not a great budget movie. Rather it is a movie that has a strong sense of community. I can not say how many "standard" movies I've been carrying - pushing the same polished things back and forth. Seachd does not seem to be at all about it. It seems to be trying to offer something more real and certainly more gaelic than any Scottish film recently. OK, so the act is not a blockbuster. That's because the actors are seemingly real people. I thought the key roles of his boy and grandfather were really compelling - and sometimes unusually beautiful. Seachd really has a second view because there are many yarns that become clearer for the second time - that really feed in the end. On the whole, the combination of amazing music and (sometimes) astonishing visuals plus a community approach to acting and non-normal make Seachd a memorable film. More of these please!
