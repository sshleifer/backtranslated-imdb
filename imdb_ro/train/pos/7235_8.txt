"The Folly's Girl" is a kind of half-comedy, half the faculty of cinematography in the mid-10s. I was looking at life at an early filmmaking studio, where we are witnessing assembling a set, going through a scene, manipulating fanciful adventures, even lunch at the commissioner. We are also known for little known cinematic facts - for example, did you know that "movie actors often do not know the plot of the image they work in?" this film is basically the discovery and animation of Kenneth Driscoll's movie star about a young starring star who he discovers while filming on location in the country. I think the 30-minute version I watched was prescribed, included on the same tape with Cecil B. De Mille's Cheat. It's a very credible movie - a lightweight watch with a large cast. As a bonus, it includes some of the best illustrated titles I've ever seen with a silent movie.
