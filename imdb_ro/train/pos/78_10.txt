Even if it has one of the "Revenge Price Plots" standards, this movie is my favorite of Vincent Price's work. Gallico has the quality that is missing in so many horror film characters - likenesses. When you look at him, you feel for him, you feel his frustration, the injustices against him, and cheer him when he goes to revenge, even if he frightens you a little with his initial anger. As the movie continues, his character becomes tragic. She committed the crime, but now she has to kill her to cover that. And again to cover this. And again ... your stomach sinks with his soul as he descends spirally - as if looking for a beloved brother to turn into a hood. Even if the story of revenge is old, the devices of the plot are original - Gallico uses his tricks to kill more and more inventive. Shame it is not available for your trip.
