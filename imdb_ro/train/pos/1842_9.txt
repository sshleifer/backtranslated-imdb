Series 2 descended to a wonderful start! I do not think I have to watch the 1st series to understand what's going on, but like any other series, it's nice to feel a character's feeling and care what's happening to them. And this show makes you think so! These four 30-year-old women seem to lead charming and enchanting lives, but the premise is credible and realistic. So the breaths that come from their love and sexual life are interesting to look at, but you also know that these are issues that happen to real women as well. It is about the decisions that we make as women, and how sometimes we are led on certain paths in our lives, rather than making those choices conscious!
