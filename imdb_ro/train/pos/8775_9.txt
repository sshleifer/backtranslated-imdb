Warner Bros' great effort plays Errol Flynn in one of the best interpretations of his screen. It is often quoted as the best and I can not really fully judge until I have seen Dawn Patrol. However, his work in "Dying with their boots" takes some beatings. I'm a great fan of Flynn (he's my favorite actor after James Mason - he also helps him to be an Aussie) and I think he's just great, an excellent screen presence and also a great actor. He is the central element of "Gentleman Jim" as a legendary boxer with a lust for his hand, but he is also supported by a hot, funny script writing by Raoul Walsh. Every Walsh movie I've seen never loses a rhythm of rhythm, he was really a born producer. Walsh guides the ring scenes nicely, as it does with the lighter moments and the fine, fine scene between Ward Bord and Flynn. Add to those extraordinary production values ​​("Gay Nineties" never look better!) And a delightful song of support and it's a pretty good fun. Alan Hale usually played Flynn's brother, but here's his father, and yet everything works. Alexis Smith is the interest of Flynn's love. The pair has head over the heels, in love with each other.
