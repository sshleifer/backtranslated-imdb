This film is one of the crosses of all time. I gave him a rating of 10. The story is the renowned "Bushwhackers" in Missouri, who fought on the southern side during the war between states. The clothes they wore were authentic, history and why they fought are very precise and well researched. It was actually one of the battles that did not take place as described ... but not bad for Hollywood. The actors were well-played and they were the brightest of the actors or the director really knows how to get the best out of them. I guess it was a combination of extraordinary, super-casting directors to find the right people and the excellent performances of the actors. Not just one or two ... this movie has mourned! It has action, romance, suspense, good boys and bad guys (sometimes depending on your individual perspective), and history has turned into a single film. Even the future of Spiderman and Jewel. And it's good!
