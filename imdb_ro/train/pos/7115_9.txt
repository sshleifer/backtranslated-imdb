A wonderful and serious war movie that focuses on the inner anguish of Marine's blind, Al-Schmid. Although it is difficult and unpleasant, it is ultimately heroic - Schmid's triumph over disability and depression. The battle scene was superb. But a bone to choose. No matter how many bullets have thrown 50 times, I have never seen water or dirt that has been hit by impact! It affected realism, but I can live with it. Good performance by Eleanor Parker, again as his girlfriend.
