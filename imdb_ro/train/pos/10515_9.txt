A small, charming little film to be sure, but an extraordinary handicraft. Gwyneth Paltrow shines in this early presentation for her British accent, and the distribution that surrounds her has gone through the dialogue. This has appeared around Sense and Sensibility and I'm sure I do not know why it attracted the attention of the Oscar. Emma is Jane Austen's most accessible and less confusing story, she said well.
