Black comedy? Humor bullets? How is a crime comedy made? It can be a risky business because the viewer has to give up moral values ​​and laugh at the antiquity of a man who kills people. So, the story is solid, with much of the suspended reality, to make it work. So, Pierce Brosnan, the Irish response at 007 is now presented as an alcoholic who consumes alcohol, driven by people who kill people to live their lives and have a life crisis. He meets a businessman in difficulty, Greg Kinnear, and after a rocky start, finds out he needs a friend. But, Greg is happily married to Hope Davis and Brosnan, sees in him the basic things he does not have, love, home, and life. Add the character actor, Philip Baker Hall as the striker manager and we're racing. Brosnan is marvelously cracked and brutal as an anti-hero and delightful Kinnear as his counterpart, the very human businessman. Hope Davis adds a glow as a very conventional wife of Kinnear, who is fascinated by this desert that sneaks into their lives. The end is delightful and with some surprise. You should leave the feeling of theater, at least partially good ... if you can go mad when you kill people.
