TRICK OR TREAT is an excellent example of Hollywood jumping on the "broad band of metal music messages" that Tipper Gore and Washington Wives began in the mid-1980s (other less successful entries in this mini-gen include awful ROSE BLACK and silly at the gate). I was a high school student when TRICK OR TREAT went out and could not wait to see her. It seems to disappear from the video stores by the late 1980s, but finally I took a DVD copy at low prices a while ago and brought me back many nice metal memories that day. Any adolescent metal wizard can refer to the studies of Eddie "Ragman" Weinbauer (Marc Price of "Family Ties") in this film, being persecuted by "beautiful" high school men for their great weight and musical taste. Eddie is the favorite of rock Sammy Curr (which looks very much like Tommy Lee of Motley Crue), who is killed in a fire at the beginning of the movie. Eddie is inconsolable until he receives a press release of Sammi's latest album from a radio DJ (Gene Simmons of Kiss in a short cameo). Eddie soon discovers that this LP, when rendered, allows him to communicate with the remarkable spirit of Sammi Curr! Soon, Sammy gives Eddie advice on how to get even with his torture, but when the messages climb to scarcity ("Waste'em ALL ... no metal false!") Eddie tries to destroy the album, the life of stereo speakers from Eddie. Sammi struggles with the big dance from Eddie's high school and takes the stage to stir the crowd and disintegrate a few "fake metalists" bad luck before Eddie arrives to save the day and face of his dreams. (SIGH) No, it's not terribly scary in 2006, it was not even scary in 1986, but TRICK OR TREAT is a movie that will bring a smile to any metalist in the 1980s and has a fast track clan. It's good to look if you ever hit your head or have a taste for B-grade horror movies (or both, like me).
