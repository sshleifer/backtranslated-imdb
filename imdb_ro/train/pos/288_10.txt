This movie was so great! I'm a teenager and I and my friends love the series, so it just goes to show that these films are drawing attention to all the age groups. I recommend it to everyone. My favorite line in this movie is when Logan Bartholomew says "red cheeks" when he talks about his child's daughter. He's such a great actor as Erin Cottrell. They mate so well and have such a great chemistry! I hope I can work together again. People are so appealing and they are very good actors. We finally found films that are good to watch. Lately, it has been hard for me to find good movies and show good morals and Christian values. But at the same time these films are not cheesy.
