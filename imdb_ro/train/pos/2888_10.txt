Any older child big enough to sit in front of a screen will be totally captivated by the beautifully drawn pictures and the wonderful music of this dynamic and humorous Grimms fairy tale. They will sing "Bibbity-Bobbity-Boo" before they can even make a full sentence and continue to sing until their dead days. It is a classic for all children, especially those adults who are young at heart.
