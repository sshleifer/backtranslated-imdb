As an informed fan, I recommend this film as loyal and factual. Beginning with the age of 11 living in Istanbul, I heard some friends talking about a new sensation of music that made the girls shout. I figured if the girls like it, it has to be shit. My only records ever since were Haley Mills, Brothers Everly and Ricky Nelson. Soon after I was on holiday with my family in a military canteen in Ismir, I heard a song (which I later found out "Love Me Do") and was covered by the difference between her and every song I heard until then. When I heard the album "Meet The Beatles" of my older brother, I was drawn to life. After reading the defining book of their beginnings (by Davis), I was surprised that this film followed very well the facts, except for the exclusion of most of the sex and drug use (it affected the use of methadrine / dexadrine ). >
