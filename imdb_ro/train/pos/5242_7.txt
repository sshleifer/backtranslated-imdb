I enjoyed this film for two reasons. The first is that it provides a perspective on the world of loyalism in northern Ireland, which is rarely treated in films, most of which tell us about the republican struggle. The second reason is the performance of the actors. I thought they gave a very honest and convincing interpretation of a very dirty underworld, which many people do not have besides my native shores. On the whole, it's a funny movie starring from who's who in the Northern Irish actors broadcast. It will not move the earth, though it can easily open people's eyes to the troubled world of loyalist paramilitaries.
