Just like TALK RADIO, BOOTH is actually quite predictable (TALK RADIO, because we know the truth about what happened to get in, THE BOOTH, because we have to face it - the kind and the basic set). This is not necessarily a bad thing in this case. It essentially means that filmmakers do not jeopardize the way they could have, say, an American version of this story. BOOTH moves inexorably to its conclusion, but it is so beautifully crafted on all levels that you can enjoy walking, as you can make a familiar cruise along a well-traveled (very picturesque) road. She reminds me of Harlan Ellison's spooky story FLOP SWEAT. Claustrophobia is sometimes almost palpable. It's worth a nice look.
