Part of the perceived need, it feels to include a conventional love story in the plot to make the film more commercially available for a 1950s cinema. <br /> <br /> The film begins with some funny characters of upper class bureaucrats who run the Foreign Office - the British are punished in the way that only the British can bore themselves. But after that, the film is losing its way into a fake plot. Terry-Thomas can be watched as always, but great talent in distribution (Peter Sellers, et al) is largely wasted. A devious film, but not great.
