The last Dutch film from Verhooven made me laugh good. As a film director looking for all the small details and cross references etc in any movie, I can assure anyone interested in film art that this piece amuses all the senses. I did not read Gerard Reves's book on which the film is based, but I still think we have a sincere picture of a self-indulgent poet / writer who takes (somehow - not spoil here). An anti-hero surrounded by characters who have ambiguous intentions, like him. All this in a gorgeous packed cinema, Paul Verhopven manages to transform the Dutch locations "Gesellich (?), Pretty Cute" into an impressive film, an impressive film, impressive work!
