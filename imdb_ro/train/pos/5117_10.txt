Very few films have had the impact on American culture as Urban Cowboy had. Thank God it was temporary. But UC is almost in a class of one as one of those movies that when flipping channels at 3:00 AM I can not take your eyes off .... My top three are Animal House and Walking Tall BTW but that's it near the point. I remember Urban Cowboy hit the theaters and there were not any harasses on every corner, the men were doing cowboy hats, and if you did not know how to make two stages, you were considered a social madman! Personally, I think it's a great movie. Travolta really surprised me on the SatNiteFever heels. Who had a thunk. In fact, it's also credible. The soundtrack is great. It's a shame that Charlene Tilton, from Dallas's fame, destroyed Johnny Lee's career because the guy was great. The show theft here is Scott Glenn as the cowboy grevis ex-con redneck. And I do not have anything against cowboys greaser ex-con semi-being one, but I always envied what I feel is the biggest power line of all time .... "Pack-at S * # t!" Un kind of "make my day" to Clint. And I look at Sissy's palm around me is the closest thing I'll see in my fantasy Julia Roberts so ..... As I said, beautiful. 9/10
