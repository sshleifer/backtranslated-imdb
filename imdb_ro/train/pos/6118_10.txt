Jack Frost is really a cool film. I myself ... Funny. His violence. and very enjoyable. Most people say it's rated B, but it could not be further from the truth. It has great special effects and good action. The only strange thing is, of course, the killer snowman. I think the movie was actually one of the best movies of late years. Most movies these days do not have the criteria of a master Clive Barker. That is, Be original and give the viewer what he does not expect. Jack Frost is very cool. 10 out of 10. Grade: A +. Ed also recommends Sam's Uncle Sam to Frost's fans.
