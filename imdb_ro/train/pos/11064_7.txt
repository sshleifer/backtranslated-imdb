"I'll take you there," he tells of a vicious man who loses his wife to another and finds an improbable ally in a blind encounter. Unlike most romantic comedies, this little indie is more of a situational comedy in language, with Rogers and Sheedy, with little emphasis on romance. A sort of road movie, with lots of fun and painful moments, keeps on moving, stays fresh and is a valuable watch for Indian lovers.
