Story: On the island of Texel, photographer Bob, who takes a photo for a magazine, meets the mysterious Kathleen. Her free spirit and lust for life intrigued Bob, who suffered a very traumatic experience shortly before. Her life is not as simple as it seems. Through Kathleen, Bob is embroiled in a dangerous network. Kathleen will be able to gain confidence? Revision: The dialogue in this movie is very natural and the story unfolds nicely, although it remains a bit superficial, and it would have been nice if the character of "psychology" had been elaborated a little more. Why do these people do the things they do? What motivates the elections? This is what gives a depth of film and something to think in my opinion. The story never touches an emotional climax, even if the characters go through enough to justify it. So you do not know the characters at that deeper level. The actors do a good job and play in a very natural and "credible" manner, but I think it would have been better if Kathleen had been interpreted by a younger actress, because the naivety of this character does not work well for an adult, woman. Room service is beautiful and there are some beautiful nature photos on the island. I give it to the film 7/10.
