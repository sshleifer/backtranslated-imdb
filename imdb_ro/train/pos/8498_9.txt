This is a wonderful movie with a fun, intelligent and dynamic cultural differences, and the theme that plays about what's important in life makes it a highly underestimated movie. Do not let the cynics of the world stop you from seeing this. Keaton has wonderful moments and I wonder that comedy is never appreciated, because actors such as Keaton go from humor to serious bits look extraordinarily easy. Great movie on all!
