This is one of the best animated movies I've ever seen in my life. This is not just a fun movie or a well made movie. This is a landmark in the art of animation and, if not, only the technical skill that began to do would give it a place in the history of animation. Wladyslaw Starewicz has created a stop-motion movie about the secret life of beetles. He imagined a coherent world of insects, with jobs, houses, nightclubs, film houses, props even as posters and bicycles and paintings. In this film he tells a simple story about hypocrisy and revenge. Mister. Beetle has an adventure with a dabbler, much to the noise of a grasshopper; but he is a cameraman and decides to shoot the flick. Mr. Beetle returns home and finds out that Mrs. Beetle has her own business. Mister. Beetle removes her boyfriend, but forgives her wife. The two do and go to the movies. And the movie I'm watching is Mr. Beetle and Dragonfly. As described, it sounds trite, but once seen it becomes a cinematic work. Together with Emile Cohl and Jiri Trnka, Wladyslaw Starewicz invented quite a lot of what future animators will use in their work. For this reason, he must not remain forgotten.
