I liked this movie so much ... the time needed for character development, attention to detail, superb performance, amazing lighting and cinema, wonderful soundtrack ... <br /> <br /> The combined intensity and ease of touch that it will not work for someone who wants a typical quick action move. If I lived in Elizabethan days, I'd say the movie's about like a Shakespearean tragedy. But since we do not, let's say it's more like a Drama-Suspense movie. Plot is simple, but the story is complex. The movie is intelligent in how relationships and problems are explored. Much of the story is shown rather than said, which I think is more subtle and moving - and that works well for a story based on a comic book (or a graphic novel). Sometimes I felt that I was actually there in the 1930s, part of this story - it was a realistic yet dreamlike style in its style of telling. the books on which they were based, but in this case they do. (Although I also enjoyed the book) I bought the DVD, which is great because it has some wonderful deleted scenes and inspired comments. (I also took the cousin, a little younger than the boy in the movie, to see him after seeing him for the first time because he has problems at home and I wanted to use this as a way of start a discussion about father-son problems with him - and the discussion.)
