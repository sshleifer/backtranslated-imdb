One of the things that interest me most about this movie is how their characters and their associated history are being developed on the road. I suppose the writers wanted us to win the interest for the characters by not forcing them to feed their characters. The premise of using art and craft to design and build furniture was a unique theme and / or an analogy for what families / siblings live in life. The complexity of having a twin serves as a surrogate father, and even her husband added a lot of tension to make this emotional movie interesting. Also, although the story was not one that the masses could have a direct link (ie, Jews / twins / family businesses), the themes are quite universal, because each family has a black sheep in it. That made it very interesting.
