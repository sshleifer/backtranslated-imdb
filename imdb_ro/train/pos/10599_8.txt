SPOILS Nowadays, many different comedies have experienced at one point the idea of ​​obscure independence. In an early episode of "Family Guy" cartoons, the Griffin family finds that the home is an independent nation in the United States, and the story is progressing from there. But in 1949, Ealing Studios produced a wonderful film alongside the same idea. After a kid's joke, the inhabitants of Pimlico discover a small fortune in treasure. In the investigation, it becomes clear that the small area is a small starting point for the long lost period in Burgundy. Withdrawing from London and the rest of the UK, small street residents live the joys and problems of being an independent state. Based on a rationalization that was still in operation, this story is brilliantly said and inspired. With performances by Stanley Holloway, Betty Warren, Philip Stainton and a young Charles Hawtrey, the film is well-stocked with some of the best actors of their generation. These actors are well helped by a gorgeous scenario with a few crack lines. Feeling remarkably fresh, despite being over 50, the story never feels weird and always keeps the distracted audience. Ealing Studios has been one of the best exporters of British film ever. With movies like "Passport to Pimlico," it's not difficult to understand why. Funny from beginning to end, the story is always fun and always worth watching.
