I was lucky enough to get a DVD copy of this movie recently and I've seen it now for the second time. The first time he was on television late night in Australia more than 20 years ago, but I could never forget this strange and gloomy film. Not many people prefer this movie because it's so unconventional - that it's not there is almost no dialogue spoken in this movement - we just hear the thoughts of the characters - is just an unconventional aspect of it. Looking for a copy of this movie we found out that the producer was dead, the main actor died, was not kept on any British television or in the film archives, it was never released on video or on DVD that television networks from around the world they fired after their copyrights fled in the 1980s. When it was first introduced to television in Australia, there were no consumer recorders. At my second recent view, I could see why it was unforgettable. Sometimes he is very tense and useless of claustrophobic, very similar to a stage scene by Harold Pinter. Again, if someone wants a DVD copy of this message, please send me an email and I'm sure we can work with something. (Whiteflokati@hotmail.com)
