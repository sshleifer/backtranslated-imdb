Eric Valette is obviously a talented filmmaker, and the two guys who wrote the script. Therefore, Mal√©fique is an extraordinary movie, made with just a few dollars, and imagination tones. Well, I'm a little exaggerated, but still I'm honest. So if you like the dark and naked movies, go and see this. It's really worth it.
