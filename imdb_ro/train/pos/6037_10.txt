What is a great British movie, a good laugh and sexy laugh and Gary Stretch and oh, a lot of bikes and a wonderful Welsh country. Members of our club ARROWHEAD Bike and Trike Social Club appear in it as well! Hurray!! <br /> <br /> There are really hilarious bits, good action, a good idea. You met the director, Jon Ivay at a Wareham show, Dorset. A great man on earth and a good laugh. This movie must be supported, as all British movies should do! <br /> <br /> So please go and see if you can, they have a movie website that shows it, to find one next to you! /> <br /> I can not wait to receive the DVD. Some of our bicycle friends have seen the movie two or three times already and can not get enough. Amanda
