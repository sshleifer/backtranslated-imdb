Simply the funniest and brightest film comedy of all time ... is definitely on my top ten list. It also receives ten voting points on the voting scale. Archer boss Arthur Bach (Moore) is a "middle-aged child" who refuses to take the mature path in life and avoids all the necessary responsibilities. He also refuses to leave the bottle. One day he and his personal mercenary, Hobson (Gielgud), go shopping at Bergdorf Goodman's and meet little girls, Linda (Minnelli). Arthur and Linda's chemistry add electricity to the rest of the film. There are pieces of hilarious set aplenty. In such a scene, Arthur (drunk along most stories) knocks on the door of the wrong apartment and receives threats of bursting the ears from a human mermaid ("My husband has a gun !!!!"). Geraldine Fitzgerald plays Arthur's loving grandmother, but ruthlessly, Sir John Gielgud almost steals the whole show with his acidic islands (he took the Oscar home for it), and Christopher Cross offers the main theme song (Oscar winner "Best something you can do "). It is a shame that Dudley Moore's legacy died last month (March 2002).
