The premise may seem odd, but since Murphy's character does not take it seriously, it helps the public to embody this mixture of mysticism and kidnapping of modern, hot children. The excellent cast, especially Charles Dance and Charlotte Lewis, and Murphy are at the top of their 80-year comedy / action age. There is also a great f / X, a highly surreal dream sequence and a pretty original plot. Often overlooked in the pantheon of Murphy's films, but it's worth watching.
