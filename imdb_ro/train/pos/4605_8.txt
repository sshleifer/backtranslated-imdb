This is not only one of Jackie Chan's biggest movies, but one of the greatest kung-fu movies of all time. We have come to expect the crazy stunts and the quick and creative action of Chan Movies, and this has set the benchmark for others to follow him. It's about two hours of pure entertainment that impresses to the end. Besides the superb action, we have a viable story and credible characters, Chan taking what seems to be a more western approach to writing, blending the eastern resolution method (for example, kicking the ass). Generally, it is fun, serious, fun and revolutionary. A must for any kung-fu fan, while still being accessible to the broadest in the cinema community.
