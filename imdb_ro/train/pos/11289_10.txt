There is something wonderful about the fact that a film made in 1934 can be the head and shoulders above every Tarzan movie that followed, including the Greystoke, shadowy and boring piece of the 1980s. Once the spectator passed the first three scenes, often boring, Tarzan and Matthean disconnect as a chance, offering non-stop action, humor and romance. Maureen O'Sullivan is charming and beautiful like Jane and leaves with the movie. Weismuller is also solid. Highly recommended.
