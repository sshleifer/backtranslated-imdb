If, unlike some commentators here, you are not conducting a class war and you do not mind seeing the lives of other people who have a rather big, extrovert, bohemian (gasp) success and are not extremely English at the party and get into all sorts of trouble as a result is not a bad film, closer to the Euro cinema than an imitation of the usual American carp ... I think the minimal sound design and the cheap camera are more a conscious decision than a bad movie, A (Kate Hardie - I think it is her name, as the sarcastic drink is spot-on), with the exception of David Baddiel, who should never have permission to appear in serious things! It's light, and we're not going for this kind of anatomic nonsense of relationships in this country, but if you do not have real friends to go to the party than you could do worse than staying and seeing this.
