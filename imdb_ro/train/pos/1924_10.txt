This show was great, not just for the children I thought at first, but for the whole family. The first season was especially about the father who takes care of her is a daughter and daughter, he unfortunately died in season 2, I could believe when I heard it. I'm dressed as they continued with the show that what really would really happen in life and I must mention The Episode Goodbye was so well done, it must be so hard for them to shoot this, you could say that there are real tears in their eyes. I am a 24-year-old man and this episode made me cry, knowing how they felt my dad died when I was 13 years old too much like Roy. Season 2 and Season 3 had a big comedy there, too, season 3 had some of my favorites, such as Freaky Friday, Secrets. I still think the show was strong enough to continue, I was disappointed that it was over, it was the best one was not the best home comedy show at Home Improvement and could have been the next ones. It should never have ended, but still love repetitions every day.
