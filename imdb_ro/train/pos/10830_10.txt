I liked Still Crazy more than any movie I've seen for years. A successful 70s band decides to give it another try. They start playing in some European concerts with hilarious results. The music is fantastic, the script and the acting are wonderful. The characters are on the scene, especially the singer full of voice with great voice, makeup and personality issues. The final concert was unreal. Go and see, preferably in a cinema with a good sound system :)
