Cinderella is a beautiful young woman who is cruelly treated by her stepmother and stepmother. One day, a ball will take place in honor of the prince, but the Cinderella has no chance to go, because her stepfather and unworthy mother will not leave her. With the help of her birth and her animal friends, she is gone to the ball, with the warning of returning home until midnight. At the ball he meets the beautiful Charming Prince. When the clock reaches midnight, he runs home, leaving behind one of the glass slippers. With her animal friends, her true identity is revealed. She and the prince married later and live happily afterwards. Cinderella, launched 56 years ago, has been a huge success in boxing and continues to charm the audience to this day. It has a well written script. Characters are memorable. The songs, including "A dream is a desire your heart makes," "That's love," and the great "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo" helps tell the story. This was my favorite movie that grows and has not lost its charm. A true Disney masterpiece! Recommended. 10/10 P.S. The latest version of DVD is the best way to appreciate this movie, including scenes, deleted scenes, music videos, episode radio shows, and the restored movie of the movie!
