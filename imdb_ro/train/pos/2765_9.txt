This is French and Belgians doing what they do best. It is a strange, inventive visual, emotional and emotional narrator. Director Jaco van Dormael takes us to the world of Georges, a sufferer of Down syndrome and his search for a meaningful relationship with someone, just with anyone. This is not done in a patronizing manner, but with a sense of fun and honesty. Georges' intersection with corporate management guru, Harry is manipulated with blindness - switching from comedy to tragedy back to comedy again, easily astounding. Eighth day sets a similar Hollywood prize like Barry Levinson, Winning Oscar, Rain Man, or Robert Zereck Gump of Zemeckis well and really in the shade. Sometimes, she evokes the humor of Milos Forman's film, "The Bear over the Cup's Nest", with Dennis Potter's shades well disposed. As Harry, Daniel Auteuil still sublime performance. But it is suited by the brilliant Pascal Duquenne as Georges. It's a film with uniform performances and so many memorable pieces - the shoe store scene, the showroom scene, George's dance with Genesis "Jesus knows me", the conference scene, the fireworks scene. If you have not seen it, you only have to do one thing. Rent it or go to a retro movie theater near you and see what you've lost. Better, buy this movie. Genius ...
