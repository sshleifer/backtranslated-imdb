If people did not know who was Barbra Streisand before that, ... (is it possible?) ... they surely knew who was after! This show continued to win 5 Emmys, & it is remarkable that one of the best things Streisand ever did. It is made up of 3 acts .... ACT I ... Barbra sings the standards from the room to a room full of musicians, including a segment in which she is a little girl again, all ending with a splendid version of her signature song (at that moment) ... "People". ACT II .... A Bergdoff-Goodman's musical tour, while Barbra plays songs of poverty ... it's better than it sounds ... ACT III ..... The best part, Just Barbra, musicians , and some great songs such as ..... "Happy Days Are Here Again", and a "Funny Girl" medley ... all in all, a great part of the history of television, made by one of those the greatest performers in the world!
