Jörg Buttgereit goes a bit too far with his films and themes sometimes, even for my taste, but his films are always something special and difficult to classify. They are artistically made, with meanings often deep deeper for their themes. This film is a perfect example of his work. It's also very hard to tag this movie. It's not really a movie with a story, in a sense of having a beginning, a means and an end in it. It also has no main character, but focuses on 7 different suicides and killings in 7 different days. All the different stories are spoken with a lot of class, although some of them are of course more "interesting" and more realistic than the others. I'm not necessarily connected, but yet together they still say a story. The film does not feel disconnected at all. All the different stories have a different attitude to it, and Buttgereit tells without using any word (also typical of his style), but instead allows the obvious characters and emotions of the characters to tell the whole story. This helps turn this movie into an effective movie. <br /> <br /> Again, production values ​​are not too high and this could be something that could scare some people. However, this movie helps you set the tone and atmosphere for the whole movie and its dark, disturbing and depressing themes. A Buttgereit movie I liked to forget. <br /> <br /> <br /> 7/10
