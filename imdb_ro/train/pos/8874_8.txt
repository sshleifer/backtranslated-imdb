Higher learning is a slap in front for those of us who have been in the closet too much, regardless of ethnic origin. is a topic that most of us would like to ignore, but we can not afford it if there is to be a real progressive change in the way we embrace and understand diversity. Some have criticized this film as impatient or bad, but the fact is that ignorance reigns supreme in the world, and a few continue to help it dominate our society. Each of those involved in this film has done a good deed in showing what measures should continue to continue to have to make more movies learning.sure sounds like a pipe dream, but we have to start somewhere work helps.
