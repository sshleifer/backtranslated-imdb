Last November, I had the opportunity to see this movie at the Reno Film Festival. I have to say it was very fun. Several technical errors aside, was an extraordinary experience. I liked the writing and the actor, especially from the guy who played the lead role. There is a lot of heart in this movie, a lot of spirit. I had a chance to talk to some of the people who made the movie after it was done, and they looked very nice. Everything in the whole movie was just a positive experience, and I definitely recommend it. The story was fun and cool, like a woman I've been through many problems like the lead, and I really could understand her problems because of that. The film has a good job of providing people with whom we can sympathize. The friends in the film are very well prepared, they are realistic. I know people like this, I just want them to my friends and I could call as cool as these people when we talk. The whole movie is very cool, I want to have more movies out there. - Jayden
