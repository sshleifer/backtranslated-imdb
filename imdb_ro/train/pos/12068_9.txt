If you have some kind of appreciation for character and dialogue and for any sense of American cultural history, you will find a lot of very absorbent materials in this movie. Probably it was originally a play and that's why the dialogue is hard, but I can not stress how these icons that we have only a shallow understanding turn into a truly complex and wonderful character. the movie is better than any college course to tell you how to create a personalized story. <br /> <br />
