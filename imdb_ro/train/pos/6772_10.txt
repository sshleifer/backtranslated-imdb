Unlike another user who said that the movie was sucked (and that Olivia Hussey was terrible), I do not agree. This movie was amazing !!!!!! Olivia Hussey is wonderful in everything in it! Yeah, she can be older now, because many people remember Romeo and Juliet, but she's great! <br /> <br /> This story line can be used quite often, but it is a unique movie and you will fight against anyone disagrees! I liked this movie as much as any other movie Olivia Hussey. Olivia is "my girl" and I like her work. I saw this for the first time on Saturday (4/14/07) and I fell in love with her. Not only because it's an Olivia movie but because it's a unique story line and a wonderful direction.
