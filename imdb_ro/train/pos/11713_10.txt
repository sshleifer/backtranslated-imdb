I think it took a lot of courage to get it. It is regrettable that when a celebrity suffers, this helps most. But in her case, what she did was remarkable. I have been in mental health for five years and I think it's wonderful that mental illness is no longer a terrible word and I think she helped. I always thought it was wonderful and it will always be. I'm glad he wrote this book and that the movie was done. She is a remarkable lady, and I hope she continues to act. She has gone through many and faced her. I would really like to see her work more with children, especially with children's actors. Her search should not have happened and I think it would be wonderful as a mentor for the young. The movie moved so much that I was very touched. Having a TBI that caused the onset of my disease and having PTSD, it's good to know that someone has the courage to expose her life like her. I think it helped this nation and people in general understand that there are others like them and that there is help. Thank you, Mrs. Duke, or Anna, who you ever prefer.
