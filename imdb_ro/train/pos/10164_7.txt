This is a great movie. I agreed to watch a chicken movie and end up with it. I have never heard of him or anyone in him (excpet Mike from friends). But it is wonderful! Eve, Lake, and Paul offer amazing performance. Humor is constantly dry and full of spirit. Paul Rudd plays pretty much Mike's character from Friends (which works great). The other characters are stereotyped, and the plot is formic (that is, we are not talking here "Revelation now"). But the characters are full of love, the story is engaged, the soundtrack, the production and the direction works well. <br /> <br /> In a great movie I feel really worth a lot more credit than it gets. Everyone has their own tastes, but I really do not understand the comments one star for that.
