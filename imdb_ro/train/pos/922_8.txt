At least half an hour a week. I have not been interested in any of the three major networks (ABC / CBS / NBC) for years. All lions are interesting, although Larry can sometimes become annoying. I really like the action figures of the Earth that they brought with Hunter. Most other characters are interesting. Siegfried's and Roy's Sideshow is sometimes entertainment. Animation is a top note, and certainly the best CG that was made in a weekly television show. Usually, when hiring big names to play in a show, they try to hide a script or bad characters. It's not really true in this show, though, there are some characters that have been weak and improved by the acting voice, but generally the characters are on their own. This is definitely for 16 and up. There is nothing here that most children have not heard before, and most jokes are likely to fly even more. It's definitely not as brutal and powerful as South Park, but it also brings some of the same "Bash everyone". One example is that they have both Dick Cheney and Barbara Streisand at the same time in one episode. Pride father and other Dreamworks productions, like Shrek, also feel like the spiritual successors of Animaniacs, Pinky and Brain and Freakazoid. It's the same kind of increased humor. Maybe it's not as spirited as Spielberg's classic television series, but it's still good. I hope it will end this season well and will be renewed for future seasons. Otherwise, I may never find a reason to look again at the Big Three.
