What can I say about this movie? I've seen it a few times since I was 6 years old. I saw the English version and do it very well. It's a great movie for all ages, but it's more targeted for kids. I like the child's humor and I appreciate it. If you have not seen it, you should try to rent a copy, you will not be disappointed!
