For those who did not follow the case of Anne Marie Fahey Murder. You lose one of the most sad and complicated murder of all. The murderer is the popular lawyer in Delaware, Tom Capano, and the victim is the Delaware governor's secretary, Anne Marie Fahey. Their relationship was a well-kept secret until her disappearance and killing. He wanted to leave it, but do not let it go so easy. On the other hand, he had a mistress and a wife and four daughters. Where did she find time to have two mistresses and a family life in the family? In addition, the case is extremely complicated and fascinating for a series of mini-4 hours. While the actress who plays Ms. Fahey does a good job, she does not have her dark hair. Another mistress is certainly more attractive than the real woman. Mark Harmon looks better and makes an Emmy award like Tom Capano. It would be better with the current locations in Delaware and Philadelphia. With Ann Rule's executive production, she adds precision to Anne Marie's organization and her personal struggle with an eating disorder. These pieces of information could be ignored by any other manufacturer or executive director. If you have not read the book, it's worth it. Ann Rule is a fascinating narrator of real crime. It is ironic that Mark Harmon plays Tom Capano. He also starred Ann Ann's former friend and subject, Ted Bundy, in another adaptation of the book many years ago. It was brilliant now and now. He does a job above average with a stunning story. Even President Clinton offered assistance to Anne Marie Fahey. And now, former governor Tom Carper is now the senator of the United States for Delaware who defeated Senator Richard Roth, an old dignitary popular during the November 2000 election. If you do not think the movie is interesting, then read the Rule book.
