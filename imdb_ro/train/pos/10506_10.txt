I never owned a Nintendo 64, but I played one more times. In my opinion, along with the Conkers Bad Fur Day, Super Mario 64 is one of the best video games for the Nintendo 64 system. I have played this game many times and its good every time. If you have a N64 and you do not have this game, you should try to find it. The original Super Mario Bros games were video scrolling games, but Super Mario 64 has a 3D Mario in a beautiful 3D environment. The game is kind of weird, but there are a lot of things you can do in the game. Play as Super Mario and once again you have to save the princess and 120 stars from Bowzer.Now it can do it in a 3D environment. Super Mario 64 is a very fun and good N64 game and I recommend it.
