I liked this movie. you must observe the stones that dress like tiny Martians. Surely the story could have been thin sometimes, but you can not get away from the way it was done. I used to look at it again and again when I had 8. a children's film and, in addition, has some of the greatest quotes ever. Blanzee's "Home on Interval" is great. <br /> <br /> Very well done if you ask me, 8 out of 10.
