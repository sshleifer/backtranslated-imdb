Just read the original story written by Pu in the eighteenth century. Spectacularly, the film clears the original spirit very well, although the plot has changed a lot. The language of the film, the rhythm, the special effect are all from Hollywood, but there is still a Chinese core. It is amazing how Hark Tsui managed to combine them. The result is pure beauty.
