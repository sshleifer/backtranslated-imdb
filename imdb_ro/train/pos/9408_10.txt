Often labeled as a comedy, The Man In The White Suit is much more than a giggle here and there. Sidney Stratton is an eccentric inventor who has no chance to bloom his inventions on the world, because nobody pays his observation, he is simply a strange man of strange job jobs about the place as he was . After creating his way into Birnley's textile mill, he uses his lab to achieve his goal of inventing a fabric that not only never uses, but never has to be cleaned! He is initially proclaimed a genius, and those who have ignored him at first want a great deal of it, but then the commands from an industry where the bust worsens his head and appreciates quickly turns into something much more frightening. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> Conflicts related to the emergence of technology are a crucial issue here, do we want inventions to save our assets while closing down the industries? We need to see just what happened to the UK coal industry to know what I did. In the decade in which the film was made, it is important to note that nuclear weapons production has become more than a hearing, science progressing to new frightening proportions. You will watch this movie and you will see the rapidity of the events for the protagonist Stanley, from the hero to the enemy in a wrong fight, a victim of his own quest for a better humanity, is so dark that the movie should be called The Man In The Black Suit. Frankly, I can not find anything wrong in this movie, Roger MacDougall's script, John Dighton and director Alex Mackendrick could be filmed today and would not be beyond that, the clarity and thought of her mind. The sound and setting are extraordinary, the direction is uninterrupted, with the tonal shift that Mackendrick manages to adhere to. Some of the scenes are great, especially the tugs with hearts, and bring somebody to think of a certain scene in David Lynch's Elephant Man after 29 years, and yet, after such a fall in the events, the movie still manages to watch as the genius who is Alec Guinness is closing the film to keep the audience forgetting not only Stanley's future, but also the rest of us in this rapidly advancing world. An atemporal masterpiece, thematic and as a piece of art, 10/10.
