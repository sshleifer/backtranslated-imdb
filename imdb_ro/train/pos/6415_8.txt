TIllman Jr.'s story about Gooding Jr.'s first American Wildlife Master (Gooding Jr.), defying all chances and reaching his goals despite a ruined coach. The scenario is not bad, sometimes extremely extreme, but direction and acting are of the utmost importance, and this film is inspired and accomplishes what it should do. I liked DeNiro at the forefront, though not equal to the master's (taxi driver, godfather and all others), is as good as his other good performances, such as King of Comedy or Angel Heart. DeNiro is always convincing and credible, very good performance, Gooding Jr. is not bad, certainly one of his better performances. --- IMDb Rating: 6.6, My Rating: 9/10
