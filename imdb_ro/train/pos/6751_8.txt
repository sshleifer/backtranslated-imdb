Pretty good film from Preminger; sometimes exploring sets and locations from different angles and perspectives as if it were a natural film about modern city dwellers and the way they live. In this sense, it is visually and spatially satisfactory, as a hero, a good temper of a bad temper, gets into very hot water when accidentally killing a guy with a plate in his head. Dana Andrews plays the lead as if it were Hamlet and has never been better. The story may be pure melodrama, but Andrews puts weight on it and almost raises it to tragedy. As a girl, Gene Tierney is appealing, but no doubt. Gary Merrill makes for a very interesting character with his natural warmth, offering a beautiful contrast to Andrews's cool; his smile, the friendly guy, seems to continually provoke his nemesis by simply being emotionally open, as opposed to the wounded and moralist policeman following him. <br /> <br /> There are no major surprises in that movie, which seems to be transient for all those concerned. For Preminger's director is a reunion of the genre with his stars Laura, Andrews and Tierney, who have passed their career peaks around the time the movie was made. Supporting music, Merrill, Karl Malden, Brand Neville, is, of course, more optimistic as everyone was on their way. Preminger, as a clear observer observes as never, allows events to unfold without expressing a strong point of view, since the ambiguous moral end is somewhat disappointing, since the cat and mouse game between the two antagonists seems larger and more archetypal than any simple film contains, much less solved. <br /> <br />
