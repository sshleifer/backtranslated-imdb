This Chinese film has made me feel so much like the members of a culture I do not belong to and are far from being. In an almost Buddhist approach, the film helps one to relate to each character and to the happiness of doing simple things routine. All actors are brilliant, and Xu Hzu emanates goodness and wisdom, yet vulnerable and medium. Er Min, the retarded brother, shows that intelligence and wisdom are not equal, and that wisdom comes from and from the most disparate people in this universe. Another China, this is far from Chinese realism, yet has a lot of humanity and realism of another kind. Take one. You will not be disappointed.
