As far as I know, this show has never been repeated on UK television since its initial run in the late 1960s / early 1970s, and most of the episodes are now unfortunately "undepressed". The 6th Series of 1971, however, still exists in its totality, and recently I had the chance to look at all, the best part of the 4 decades. After going home from school, Freewheelers was essential to me and many of my contemporaries back in those halcyon days of burning pants, Slade and the Chicory Tip. And looking again, he brought a piece of nostalgia to his neck. Do not disturb wicked actors / horns on unintentionally funny battle scenes, building holes wide enough to pilot a large ocean yacht and "angry, angry" RADA accents of the leading players. <br /> <br /> Do not forget everything. Since the Freewheelers return to an age of children's television drama (who dares to say "gold"), when the shows were simply fun and not taken seriously. Before becoming obsessed with all the "ishoos" loaded with aggression that today's screenwriters promise their protagonists, such as relationships, pregnancy, drugs, ITS, etc. a modern audience "in these days of perpetual political correctness, the figure of the boss would be a black woman, one of the young male heroes would be Muslim, the other would be a confused white boy about his sexuality and the girl would be a call of action action, with an IQ on the scale that would make those left to make the wicked and make them look foolish - that is, a million miles away from the Wendy Padbury wash . <br /> <br /> It's a show that's very "in time." But is it a bad thing?
