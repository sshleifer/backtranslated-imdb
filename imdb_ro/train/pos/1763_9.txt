this is one of the funny movies I've seen. they had cruel moments, but they were full of charm. is the Altmanesque script, brilliant physical humor and relaxed friendships was a pleasure to look at a slice of life that most of us can have. and I can say with a measure of honesty that I was afraid of Steve Carell's nipple ... I really was. Surprisingly, this is a good and unforgettable comedy, which is essentially about love and about many relationships we can find along the way. Catherine Keener was wonderful as Trish, and all Steve Carell's friends were erroneous but amiable and so fun. the idea that they suspected that Carell was a serial killer is a hilarious metaphor for a forty-year-old virgin. but the simple truth was that he wanted to be in love first. original, charming and very funny. highly recommended.
