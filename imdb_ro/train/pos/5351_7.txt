Although this film is somewhat filled with cheese in the eighties, I have a place for this on my DVD and I do not know why. I think I like it because the moral of the story is that "the TV is garbage, so stop it and go and get a life." For those of you who decide to listen to the message, then you should try reading the book, nothing like the movie. To destroy it at the end of the story, a mortally wounded Richards ends up crashing a plane into the network building, killing himself, everyone in and closing the network at the same time. I read it many years ago, but today it would be hard not to compare it with 9/11.
