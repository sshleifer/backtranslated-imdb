Although it is certainly politically incorrect to be distracted by a drunkard, there is a charm of Dudley Moore, who shows the lush portraits, Arthur Bach, who can only help to feel this unique and wonderful character. How can you not have the fun of that infectious laugh, giggle and diligence. Although I'm not really a Liza Minnelli fan, she was really great because Linda Marolla and I could not imagine anyone else in that role. Sir John Gielgud was the heart of the film and he deserved the Oscar. The rest of the distribution also excellent and that great song "Arthur's theme", wow. That was one of the best comedies in the 1980s. Great movies get better with every viewing and this is the case with "Arthur".
