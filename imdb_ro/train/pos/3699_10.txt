"Who loves the sun" does his job through a subjective subject, with enough intelligence and grace to keep the story not only to engage, but often hilarious. It's been a while since we found such an exciting, exciting film. <br /> <br /> The film is superb, drawing the eye with beautiful landscapes and tranquil landscapes. The peaceful images contrast greatly with the tension between very human characters, very erroneous and yet extremely pleasant. Thanks to the excellent casting, all five major players are wonderfully interested and dynamic. <br /> <br /> I recommend "Who loves the sun". It's a very funny film that has a stunning look at the pains that we can cause each other and the amazingly difficult but equally rewarding forgiveness.
