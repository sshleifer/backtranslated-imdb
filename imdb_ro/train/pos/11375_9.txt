This movie tells an amazing story with history and compassion. From the careful description of the murder scenes to the mental investigator's principal health, you will be delighted. It is absolutely necessary for anyone interested in criminology. Interpol relations and how agencies collaborate are also wonderful. Not really done. I recommend it to anyone interested in the history of Russia. How the police work with the political party being what it was ... It's really fascinating and frustrating. The settings are beautiful. It's been a while since I first saw this movie. It does not diminish the impact. It's not too dramatic or graphic, it leaves enough imagination, well, you will see.
