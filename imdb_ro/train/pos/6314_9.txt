I went to the cinema with two of my friends and I chose this movie from the hat without knowing what to expect. And it turns into a very pleasant, laughing experience! It's an excellent movie with a very unexpected story, very good dialogues and crazy humor. All the characters are obviously made in the style of "Alan Ford" (satirical comic), but I do not mind for a second. In fact, this type of loser-bums line-up made a rather unique and exciting movie. Sam Rockwell gave a very good and convincing role, and to Willian Macy, Clooney is hard to recognize and brilliant. But the real star is actually Guzman. He played the role of his life in this movie! The scene when Cosimo's character dies in the movie is so hilarious that it made me suffocate and almost die with him! Highly recommended for all Alan Ford fans!
