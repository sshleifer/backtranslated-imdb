Four stories written by Robert Bloch about the different people living in a beautiful and old mansion and what is happening to them. The first one is Denholm Elliott as a novelist who sees the killer that he says will come alive. Some frightening moments and twisting at the end were good. The second has Peter Cushing becoming obsessed with a wax figure similar to his dead wife. The third one has Christopher Lee who has a baby (Chloe Franks) and he feels it. Everything leads to a pretty scary end (though the end in the story was MORE Worse). The last is an outdoor comedy with Jon Petwee and Ingrid Pitt (both to chew the landscape) and a trap that turns men into vampires! There is also a nice line about Christopher Lee who plays Dracula. This is a good anthology of terror - nothing terrifying, but the first and the end of the third gave me some pleasant chills. Also the fourth is actually very funny and Pitt makes a very sexy vampire! Also, the house itself looks beautiful ... and very creepy. It is well directed with some beautiful atmospheric touches. A very good and unusual film score. All in all an anthology of horror is a little worth looking for. Try to see it on DVD - The Lions Gate looks fantastic, with strong colors and great sound.
