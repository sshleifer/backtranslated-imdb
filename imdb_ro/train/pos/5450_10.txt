Barbara Stanwyck plays Lily Powers. She is a waitress for her father's speakeasy in a wonderful little mining town. He also sells to men. She escapes to New York and literally sleeps to the top. By the way, I only saw the 71-minute version, but it's quite extreme - for its time. Nowadays he is quite tainted. The movie moves very fast and has tons of sexual inconveniences - some of them are happening quite silly today (but funny). It moves so fast you can easily ignore that most could never happen - even in 1933. There is nothing classic or monumental about it - it's just a small, fast and dirty movie that's really fun. It only breaks at the end, with a little "moral end" that censors require. It happened incredible and stupid (I saw it in a theater and the audience laughed at him - a guy rightly said "No way") I just saw the unfinished version of 75 minutes that has another, somewhat tragic and much better end. This version was considered lost until 2004 when it was discovered by mistake! I think this is the only one who has been released - but you have to know. <br /> <br /> The actress is good - Stanwyck jumps into her role and plays it on the top. Makes you think he likes to be cruel and sleepy. There is also strong support performance from beautiful Donald Cook and George Brent. Also look for a president John Wayne in a bit hilarious like a gentle and gentle desk worker! Fun, dirty and fast. I gave a 9.
