It is well known that when Gene Roddenberry first released Star Trek to NBC, the original pilot episode, The Cage, was rejected because it was "too cerebral". When the series had another chance, Roddenberry thought it would be fun to set the events of the episode rejected as a canon and did it writing The Menagerie, which has the unique distinction of being the continuation of what was still at the time a unwanted episode. This time, Kirk and his crew, instead of exploring a new planet, are on Starbase 11, a visit to former Enterprise commander, Christopher Pike (Sean Kenney) now terribly disfigured and paralyzed by an accident. Pike joins his successor on the ship's ship, where he is expecting an unpleasant surprise: Spock, who served under Pike, actually hijacked the ship and set the course for Talos IV, a planet that is off-limits (punishment is death) Pike and last visit to Spock 13 years earlier. Of course, as a logical creature, Spock returns and organizes a martial court to justify his actions. There's no need to say more about the plot, since the rest will play in Part 2. What really impresses is how Roddenberry creates the connection between The Cage and the rest of the Star Trek universe, coming with some kind of flashback telling more would be too much) that allows everyone, on the screen and outside, to see what could have been from Trek, NBC did not reject the original project. In particular, it's fun to see Jeffrey Hunter (who has failed to return to The Menagerie) to play Pike as a captain more serious than Kirk, and he is usually in Nimoy's time as Spock, whose personality is still has not yet been established. just the time in the whole series that Vulcan spontaneously favors everyone. In short, not just a big "mystery" episode, but a treatment for those who can not be disturbed to follow The Cage in its original form (available as part of the Season 3 box set).
