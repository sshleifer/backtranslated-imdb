Love Trap is not a short one, it's quite obvious a feature film, with a 105 minute running time. As I write this, I could talk more about Love Trap. I am often asked what the Difference of Love Trap ... so I answer this question: 1) Introduces characters - especially - that have never been seen before in the movie, period. <br /> <br /> 2) More truth is revealed about love and multiplies deeper into the concept of love than any other American film ever made, in my humble opinion. 3) Structurally, like in the way the story is said, it is different from any love story you've ever seen. 4) Provides an extremely timely perspective on various cultural issues, both inside and outside the Black community. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Over time, people will come to see Love Trap as a genuine original work in this age, enchanting, refreshing, authentic and honest. It is a playful morality game full of food for thought. Please visit www.lovetrapmovie.com for complete and accurate information about this movie.
