The mere fact that I'm thinking about the film a decade later is what I really talk about about this movie. For me this demonstrates Grand Canyon as a movie that will touch you in one way or another. I really think that before the Crash was Grand Canyon. The major difference between the two films, in my opinion, is the moment of their release. I will not argue which one is better, but I will resist the idea that they have the same message. I would like to hear from those who have a say on this subject. I'll start a comment that you can find at http://www.myspace.com/62229249. You can also find me there to post any other topics about the movies we can share, because I have a real love for the movie.
