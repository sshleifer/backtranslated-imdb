Okay, I would not normally look at a Farrelly brothers' movie. I can not remember I was ever looking. I also do not remember watching a Jimmy Fallon movie. Okay, I looked at the taxi, but I said repentance and was forgiven for that mistake. But this movie had Drew Barrymore and I think it's the nicest thing to do. I do not know what she is with her, but I smile all the time when I look at her. She captivates me this way. I mean, I just watched Adam Sandler just see her in 50 meetings. How sad is this? It was not the biggest baseball movie - it was not supposed to be. It was a love story about a sad puppy who hung on the one thing that did not let it fall until it found something worthwhile to give up. It had a predictable ending, but it was so much on the way it did.
