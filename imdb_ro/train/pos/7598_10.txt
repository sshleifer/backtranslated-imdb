"Lost", "24", "Carnivale", "Disperate Housewifes" ... the list goes on and on. These and a bunch of other high quality shows demonstrate that we are in the midst of a golden age in television history. "Lost" is a pure genius. Striking layers of personal and viable psychological stories highlighted by sublime cinema (incredibly use this word when describing a TV show), a criminal score, performances and edits. Anyone who is not attracted to this, ever misses one of the most important creative expressions on television. You may have problems when watching just one episode per week, but the DVD format is actually an incredible way to follow this. I hope they will keep it up (as I'm sure they do).
