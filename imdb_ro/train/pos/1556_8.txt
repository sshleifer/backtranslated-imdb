Like the other people who commented on "FrÃ¤ulein Doktor", I accidentally came across this little jewel on TV late at night, without having heard of it before. The strange mixture of a story of fiction about a sexy, but unscrupulous anti-hero, on the one hand, and a realistic and well-studied picture of the war in the trenches, on the other hand, made me start from the beginning . /> For me, this is one of the best five films about World War I (the others are "All quiet on the western front", "Glory paths", "Gallipoli" and post-war "La vie et rien d'autre") . And the scene with the poisonous gas attack is really cool; horses and men seem like horsemen of the apocalypse with their gas masks. I just want to record the movie.
