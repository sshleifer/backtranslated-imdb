It was a decent film. This movie is good to sit down and watch and have fun. Just a typical Hollywood movie. This movie will never win an Oscar or something and certainly does not deserve one, but I thought it was good enough. It's kind of a show 24, but it's in film format. If you like everything, you have to stop the terrorist from killing some sort of president film, then you will enjoy this movie. I personally think the story was done too much, but The Sentinel adds a little twist to the Secret Service swamp. Overall, this movie will not leave your jaw on the floor or it will change your life, but who says each movie should be like it is good?
