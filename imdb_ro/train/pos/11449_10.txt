this was by far one of the most beautiful portraits of a person I've ever seen on the screen. Andy Goldsworthy is a kind of man who's gone. he looks at the earth and nature with such admiration and respect that he is primitive in a good sense. purity, honesty and kindness clearly breathe as you watch him work in so simplistic but lively pieces of art. I was amazed at how patiently he created his pieces and how patiently he accepted their end. sometimes prematurely, but the sense of his Scottish humor overlooking his disappointment. the film is elegantly drawn and contains the same flow of Goldsworthy art. combines nature and art in a minimal way, as is in itself. Fred Frith's score is organic enough to mix everything without interfering with naturalistic sound. this is generally a great work in every aspect. has no age limits.
