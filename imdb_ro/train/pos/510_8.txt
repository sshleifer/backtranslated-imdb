I just looked for the first time in a long time - I forgot both the imagination of the images and how big the film is. I have not forgotten, however, the opening scenes that are (with the stage at Candlelight Club in Waterloo Bridge) among the most romantic ever-filmed. Anyone interested in politics or history, anyone interested in romanticism will be moved by Hunter-Niven, and anyone who loves visual images will enjoy the image of the world after. My favorite movie remains "Odd Man Out" done almost at the same time - but it is superb. <br /> <br />
