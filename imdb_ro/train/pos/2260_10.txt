A nice movie! One who is seriously underestimated. The songs the children sing in the film gave me a sense of pain, but also their hope for the future. Whoopi Goldberg offers good performance here, but the best performance throughout the movie is that of the actress who plays the title character. I'd like to be in more movies. This movie should have a higher rating. I give it a 10/10.
