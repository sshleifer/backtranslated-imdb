I have personally seen many Disney movies in my lifetime, though none of them fit in any way with Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Although I would not have been personally involved with the animation, it was an improvement in trying to dress people as animation characters. The film finds three evacuees from World War Two who are sent to sit with a socially strange and strange woman in the country. I would say the casting was brilliant. Angela Landsbury made a perfect Miss Price, while David Thomilson made a great interest in entertainment. Conclusions always surprise me and it was no exception. He was neither happy nor sad, though I do not know if this was intentional. The dialogue was not great, but since it was designed to be a children's movie, it's good. On the whole, I would give the nine out of ten performance, six out of ten dialogues, ten out of ten distribution, and eight out of ten outfits.
