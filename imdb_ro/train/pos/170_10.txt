Do not listen to the cute critics on this, it's a jewel! The rich young man, Joan and her brother wake up without dying after their father dies - and now he has to work for life! She, of course, becomes a reporter and, naturally, a crowd driver! By wild coincidence their careers meet, thanks to gangster Clark Gable. Meanwhile, there is a chance to swim in the underwear for a bunch of pretty young things, and for Joan to make some risque dance numbers (with the mercy of a steam bucket). But none of these things should be taken seriously - it's fun from those wonderful days of pre-coding, when Hollywood was really naughty. Joan looks great and shows much of the emotional range that would give him such a long career (thank God for stopping dancing!). Gable is remarkable as a thin gangster - he was not yet a star and so he did not have to be the hero. I'm glad to see him play something different. And William Bakewell is excellent as a poor, confused brother. And there are a few big footage and follow-up pictures courtesy of director Harry Beaumont, who moves the song with a cracking rhythm - and an occasional look for the audience! Big fun!
