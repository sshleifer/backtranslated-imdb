Far from the second favorite cartoon of Spielberg, after Animaniacs. Even though the ratings were low, everything I liked and liked was so funny and I worshiped the piece that Jess Harnell and Tress Macneille were there and they were just fantastic, all the casting was brilliant , especially the legendary Frank Welker. I would love to see this cartoon again, it was so great and the jokes were brilliant. I also remember the funny moment in which Brain came to him, you heard his voice and played PATB themed instrumental, which was fantastic, I love those cartoons when pop comedy comed. I wish this cartoon and Animaniacs came back, I loved them
