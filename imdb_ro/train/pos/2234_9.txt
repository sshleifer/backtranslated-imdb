While the "special effects" and technical attributes of this movie may actually be ridiculous for some, I have never managed to delete the images of this film engraved on my young and impressive mind when I first saw it at the age of 8 . The story of the survival of this girl and the trials she has suffered have stayed with me all these years, and I first thought on several occasions about how the little girl did in situations far beyond what I saw. The fact that this is a true story and the fact that I was just a child when I first saw this may be the reason behind my high-end evaluation of this movie. Every time this movie was broadcast on TV in the 1970s and 1980s, I would ride on television, drinking in every scene with an interest I can not explain. I suppose I see this for the first time as an adult (and with an unpleasant view of the world), maybe it is not as pleasant for some. Actually, I got out of my way to get a copy so I can show this movie to my son. This, like many other movies, is not for everyone. If you are impressed with remarkable human survival stories, you are part of Peru / Macchu Picchu and / or Amazon, then I think you could enjoy this movie as much as I enjoy it in the last 30 years.
