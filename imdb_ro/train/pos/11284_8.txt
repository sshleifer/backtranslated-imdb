When I was a kid, Lex Barker's time was like Tarzan. I've often heard from the elderly that Johnny Weissmuller "was" Tarzan, and I would not understand why since we've seen some of Weismuller's last films in that character and I thought it was something untouched. Not after many years I met Tarzan and Matthew and then I understood. Weismuller is in shape in this image and has the sharp appearance and appearance, the character required is not consistent with other Tarzani, such as Barker, Gordon Scott, Jock Mahoney, Denny Miller, Miles O'Keefe and Cristopher Lambert. /> Regarding the film, I was surprised by the sensual presence of beautiful Maureen O'Sullivan, a strong, self-supporting, active and "uninhibited" woman, as Jane was in front of the time the film was made (Tarzan pushes her into an empty pond as she is amused, one of explorers kisses her by surprise, and though she does not kiss him back she kind of let it do for a bit and does not do much of it) ; such behaviors have been unthinkable with the "Janes" of coming, such as Brenda Joyce, Vanessa Brown, Virginia Huston, or Dorothy Hart, all playing a kind of vulnerable sweet women, making it hard to believe they can survive, a hostile place like the African jungle. <br /> <br /> The sparkling personality of the character O'Sullivan steals Tarzan himself, except, of course, when it comes to action and Weismuller takes the lead with ease; the combination is perfect. Another highlight of the film is Cheeta's secondary role and not as the main advantage of Tarzan's later images, where he often saves the day. "Tarzan and Matthew" is a fine product in the genre of Tarzan) and perhaps best, although I must admit that I enjoyed the "greatest adventure of Tarzan" (1959), made with a larger budget and a strong distribution (and despite the fact that Gordon Scott, with his physical appearance too "perfect gymnasium", which does not fit a rustic monkey man). Hi to Jane and her partner!
