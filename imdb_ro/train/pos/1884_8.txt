This is one of my favorite comedies ever. I do not want to condemn those who do not inspire her hero's lifestyle, but take for what they deserve and not as delusional alcoholism, the movie is simply very fun. She tells the unlikely story of a thing that a bachelor named Arthur, whom he will inherit a great fortune but who marries Susan, chosen because the family thinks he could do something out of it. Arthur proposes, but then falls crazy for Linda, a waitress and a small thief. Dudley Moore is perfect as Arthur, the most beloved drink in the world, whose antique is a laugh. Of course, Moore IS Arthur and I agree with those who can not imagine other actors in the role. The ladies of the play are also well illustrated. Liza Minnelli shines like Linda, and the chemistry on screen with Moore is great. Jill Clayburgh plays Susan, the rich and fit woman for Arthur. However, this film is literally made by Sir John Gielgud, who portrays Arthur's sarcastic, but moral architect Hobson. It is obvious that these two have had a great deal of mutual affection during Hobson's long-term employment. Hobson is Arthur's best friend and provider of unsolicited comments and advice. The most interesting relationship in this film is not Arthur's love, but his unusual relationship with this wacky servant and, of course, disapproving. It's the butler that you'll remember the most after the closure of the closing credits.
