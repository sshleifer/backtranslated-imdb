I have arbitrarily taken this from the library last night, without having an idea about the cult, the influence of the movie that it is currently presented as a musical (!) Most of the comments here are on target, they are moving, funny, sad, and yes, a tad exploiter, despite the best filming intentions. The extended Chriterion edition is a must for anyone who loved it when it came out. <br /> <br /> I think you can see in the little Edie the fall of a class that has disappeared, you can also hear it in Jackie O's old movies; people will not talk like this. I think, as a documentary, it would have been interesting to get more information about how the house fell desperately, Old Edie at least still seems aware of what is happening to some extent; could not see how the once-spectacular old house disintegrated? <br /> <br /> However, the subject of the film is the life that the two women have now built, a true Tennesse Williams life. Well it's worth the time.
