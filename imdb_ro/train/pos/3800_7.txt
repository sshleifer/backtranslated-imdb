The world of dragon hunters is a world of 3D gravity. Planetoids, pieces of buildings and strange planted plants float around in the atmosphere, while the soil to most characters is shrinking is nowhere to be seen. It's a world that reminds of the story of Neverending, when Nothing has come to eat the world away. Funny enough, the bastard here is also World Gobbler. This time is a giant dragon with fire-eyes. Heroes are a great but taciturn warrior, an annoying and greedy bully who manages the duo's entrepreneurial side and a strange weird animal. They joined the youngest girl in the world who, for my noise, did not die a terribly painful death and hopefully dead early. The animation is wonderful. Voices and sounds are top. Too bad the story is as simple as it can be imagined. They go to stop World Cobbler, approach him almost immediately, face him. The end. No real development of character or overturning of stories. I did not even expect a movie with such a plot. Bottom Line: It's a nice thing to look at, kids will probably enjoy it, but that's all about it. No depth in this world (intended for the game).
