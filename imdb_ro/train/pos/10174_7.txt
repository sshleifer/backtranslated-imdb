This was another message during the Second World War to soldiers and allies to be careful to spread rumors. These were called "instructive" cartoons because it was a mixture of serious messages alongside a funny character called "Pvt Snafu". We all have imaginations, along with fears and what you have, and that's what happens here as Pvt. Snafu incorrectly adds two and two to something he hears and comes with "five". You can start panic and all kinds of disasters if you spread enough rumors and enough people believe them. This includes the loss of confidence in your country and in your cause, as shown here in this cartoon. A good way to lose a war is to demoralize the enemy. It's still done today. <br /> <br /> "We lost the war," says a great baloney at the end of this cartoon. Amazing how some Americans have not yet learned. This cartoon can be 65 years old, but it is certainly relevant today. As I write this, there have been two terrorist bombings in today's Europe, and some people still think that "War on Terror" is just a slogan for the sticker. Amazing. The writer, the famous "Dr. Suess," uses the analogies of "hot air balloon juice" to present the above message. With Theodore Geisel (the real name) you know that the rhymes will be smart. Nothing's hilarious here, but it was not intended. You need to understand the climate of 1943 and the justified paranoia that was there during the Second World War. People forget that the war could easily have been broken with the other winning side. It was a tense time
