"Bend It Like Beckham" is a movie that has very few exposures here in the United States. It was probably due to the fact that the film was a strong British in dialogue and terminology and he was very busy with football, which some may have problems in the US as well. It is regrettable that this movie is absolutely fantastic and deserves much more coverage here. I think that the basis of the story (after a dream) is something that many people can refer to, and ultimately "Bend It Like Beckham" turns out to be a good, inspirational and action-packed movie. I was not too excited to watch this original movie, but now I regret not seeing it earlier. I highly recommend this movie!
