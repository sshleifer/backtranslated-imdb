For someone who only saw the version of Beauty & the Beast, or even the surreal vision of Jean Cocteau's fairy tale, they will be quite surprised by the French version of 1975 (but with a Polish director). The plot refers to a French family of aristocracy who marries a good thing to make the English family. The main capture is that the groom carries an ancient curse on the family. The film also includes many retrospective (potential) sequences that explain this family curse. From the opening credits to the end, it is an almost uninterrupted erotic walk with very explicit and graphical sex content (that's why the US movie X rating in its initial run, which is now under evaluation). The somewhat contemptuous feeling of the movie in the dominant class will probably recall one of Bunuel's flights on a similar territory. If you have a really bizarre taste and you are not offended by the taboo, then this movie can just scratch you for you.
