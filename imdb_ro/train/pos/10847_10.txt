I am 60 years old, a guitarist (lead / rhythm), and in the last forty years, I have been in four bands, everything is there, fights, evil, rotten food, I always travel, little or no money, and each was drunk or tall. But clubs, fans and music have done everything worthwhile! Like Strange Fruit! I'm too old for this now, and arthritis in my hands and hips does not mean more balancing, but for the length of the video, it all came back and everything was there! Birds, beatings and drinks! And I was young again! It's like Billy Connolly's voice, God likes this stuff of 70! Rock On Forever!
