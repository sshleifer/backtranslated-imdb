Kurt Russell IS Elvis, simple and simple. Dedication to this role has led to what I believe is the best bio ever. If you're a fan of Elvis, see if you can. The film for television was made two years after Elvis's death. One tip, there are two versions - one at 180 minutes and one at 117 minutes. The only thing to follow is a longer one. The shortest has more than an hour of edited film. It does not work because the scenes from it often depend on scenes that have been cut. This masterpiece takes you from Elvis's childhood through its appearance as the greatest star of entertainment. Shelley Winters and Bing Russell (Kurt's real father) are excellent as Elvis's parents. And Pat Hingle offers a colonist Tom Parker very competent. <br /> <br /> Long live the King!
