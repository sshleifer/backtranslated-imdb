A surprisingly good movie! He has some good jokes all over the movie. The only negative thing is that some scenes go to extremes to show how stupid the two main characters are. We understand her, silly blondes, go on with this! <br /> <br /> The plot barely escapes being called 'corny'. And boobies are always a plus of another film for a weird reason not playing with this book a lot, even the plot line introduces two black-haired women who act as counter to the part of our two blondes. <br /> <br /> So all in all, a good movie to watch. I almost gave her 8/10, but let's not leave us crazy.
