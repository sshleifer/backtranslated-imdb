I only saw the first part of the series when it debuted in the late 90s and only recently had the chance to watch all three parts through Netflix (convenient roadside service). Generally, I liked this mini-series, very challenging, often sex-driven. The story of a younger man falling for an older woman seems to work and the actors are fine. Yes, he has some love punches to run in the rain or a train station, but the characters have a chance to be explored so they do not look like cheese, as if it were a Tom Hanks or something similar. Robson Greene, who sometimes reminds me of a separate appearance at birth, Scott Bakula, does a good job of a person who has a heel in love, and the sunset and the wave of desire and rejection throw the series into the fare. Personally, I think the series could have been made with two episodes, but that's in the debate. There seems to be a sequel, and that should come tomorrow through Netflix.
