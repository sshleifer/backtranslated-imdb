For those who have read Rohinton Mistry's highly respected novel, this film will surely impress because of the honesty of an adaptation. With the exception of a minor subplot, Sturla Gunnarson's debut debut is a close-to-death recreation of the book (to the last line). For those of you who have not read the novel, this movie might be a bit difficult. It's definitely not a big dramatic story. Instead, it has a strong element of realism, but I would not have any other way. The best way to describe such a long journey for fans of the film would be to say that it is a Hindu version of "Fiddler On The Roof". Instead of a Jewish / Russian military, protagonist Gustad Noble is a banker in Bombay since 1970 during the Muslim / Hindi war with Pakistan. He is forced to deal with a series of unexpected problems in his life, including his sick daughter, his biggest individualist son, a distant friend who involves him with dirty money and an unhealthy neighborhood. The end is not a happy one, nor is it a sad one, but in essence it is what realism implies. <br /> <br /> Such a long journey is a wonderful little movie, but if you want to see it, then you can find it. Unlike the Roman, he received a very small release.
