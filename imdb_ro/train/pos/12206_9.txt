Of all the 1940s and 1950s, this must be one of the strangest and most fun to watch. I say this because of the four main actors: Orson Welles, Rita Hayworth, Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders. <br /> <br /> The first two names are familiar to everyone but the last two have made this movie so fun for me, especially Anders. His character, "George Grisby," is one of the weirdest people I've ever seen on the film. His voice and some of the things he said must be heard to be believed. Slaone is not long behind in the "weird" category. Hayworth is not as glamorous as her short, blond hair, but it's Hayworth, which means a lot to shine if you're a guy. Welles "is as fascinating as ever.An tip: If you have the DVD, start English subtitles.Your character in this movie is an Irish and you need subtitles to understand everything he says <br /> <br /> <br /> Welles also directed the movie, which means you have extraordinary room angles and wonderful facial frames. You also have a unique, visual ending with a fireworks in a mirror house. As bizarre as this movie, I thought the atmosphere of the buffoon carnival at the end of the process was too much, and it escaped the seriousness of the scene. <br /> < br /> This is great fun, which is the name of the game.
