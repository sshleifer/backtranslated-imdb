It may or may not be interesting that the only reason I checked this movie first was that I wanted to see the performance of the man who beat Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca (the role on 10/10 for the best actor Oscar (I had just given Oscar to Bogie, but Paul Lukas did a great job and deserved the nomination at least.) I'm glad I checked this movie because I enjoyed it very much that the film preached a little, but not only did not bother me, I liked the speeches and I was never bored with them. "The actor was remarkable in this film." I especially liked Paul Lukas, Lucile Watson (nominated for an Oscar), Bette Davis (the wicked was not nominated), George Coulouris and, strangely, Eric Roberts, who plays the middle child from the philosopher, he cracks me, even the characters (Bodo) It's funny. Endin g, in which character Lukas was forced to do something that he considered wrong, even if he did for all the right reasons, he also worked for me. I agreed with the reason why he felt he did what he did and I understood why he could not explain it very well. The message this movie makes is a good and noble one, the landscape (that is, the house) is beautiful and the acting is excellent. Watch this movie if you ever have a chance. <br /> <br /> 9/10
