I like all of Michael Landon Jr.'s films. And Dale Midkiff's cast of Michael Landon Jr as "Clark Davis" was no better. Dale Midkiff has ways to shoot this character. This movie has kept me spellbound from start to finish. The death of the girl from Missie & Willies, with Clarks' calendar visit was only God's time. How did they do to death and how Clark helped to do it was the love of parents. Although there are 3 films before that [Love Comes Softly, I Love You Enduring Promise & Loves Long Journey] I feel you can see this movie and you understand it easily. But go ahead and want to see the 3 previous films because of the history that all the characters have behind them. Michael Landon Jr. is an excellent director <br /> <br /> I am looking forward to many more movies from him in the future.
