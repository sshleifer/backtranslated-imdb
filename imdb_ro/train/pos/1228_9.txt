This NBC-TV film from 1991 was broadcast six months before John Goodman's big screen version of Babe Ruth's life. For my money, there is no comparison between the two. TV production is not perfect, but it portrays Babe's story with more depth and complexity than Goodman's one-dimensional story. I especially liked the film about the complex relationship between love and hatred that Ruth had with Yankee manager Miller Huggins, who always understood the shine of his star and also tried to point out why Ruth's personal faults did not he would never have left the manager or the leader of the players. The TV film correctly observes how Ruth has never fulfilled his dream of managing the Yankees because of his flaws, while Goodman's orbit version tries to push the lie that Ruth was denied what should have been for him. /> This film makes an extraordinary piece of "Eight People Left" because the story begins with Ruth's arrival in New York in 1920, one year after the Black Sox scandal, and when his exploitation originally exploits literally the salvation of baseball to ruin. Indeed, the continuity between the two films is even accentuated by John Anderson reiterating his role as "Eight Men Out" as Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis.
