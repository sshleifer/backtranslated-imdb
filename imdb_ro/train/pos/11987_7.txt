Since it's been a couple of years since I've seen this classic, I've decided to go back and revisit it more in the department, but first some insider notes from a movie critic. This animated series is one of those that I grew up, made me joy of childhood, she did wonderful, I miss these things today that we do not see as much as we did today, and until the review ... Talespin or Luftens Helte called in Denmark is a great series of animation, looks like chip and tiles, ducktales and many of the old ones, so it has that strange feeling that surrounds it, can not remember how much I would like to remember this series. But, in my opinion, it was very great, it came with a kind of message, not with the wildness of a message, yet it is one of the old ones so it can be forgiven. Now I do not mean old or something, but I feel as if time has slipped out of my hands with these cartoons, today we see something like Ed E dd and Eddy or anything strange as such, we have all these new or near new shows like Hannah Montana or something like that, but I feel like we do not have the same spirit in cartoons or real shows as we did in the early days. Now maybe I'm wrong, but I feel like time has changed a lot, to conclude I would be delighted to see these series as Talespin being released again on TV instead of all new ones, give me back cartoons from childhood, I give the children one day, I give them again ...
