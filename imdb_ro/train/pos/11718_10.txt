Those who love Elizabeth, as we did in the hostesses of the new night movie, will love this movie - it's just cool - her car is wonderful and she's a bit of Dolly Parton from Transylvania - it's so innocent and naive sometimes - and sexy all the time - plus, more than a touch of Mae West - the sets are well done as well, and the comic distribution is great with Edie McClurg at her best usually - plus Sally Kellerman like Patty is hilarious. Every time I have to chronose something for a topping, I'll think about how Elvira absorbs potato chips - This is one that needs to be watched again and again - just for fun. Now I have to get the continuity, Elvira's Haunted hills and see if she lives up to that -----
