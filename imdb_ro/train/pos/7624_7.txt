A quite memorable movie of animal-killing-people, similarly to Willard, in the sense that it represents an elderly character actor (in this case, a step down to the level of Les Tremayne, who puts in the performance that I have seen) in a role as a man whose life is unbalanced and then decides to use his animal friends to avenge exactly those who have wronged him. Yes, this is one of those movies where almost everyone is despised so that you get angry when you die, and even the selection of actors, locations, etc. it would not be better to give the film an atmosphere of shaky decadence. <br /> <br /> Tremayne's character is "Snakey Bender," and is certainly the most interesting thing about the movie: a snake collector who is obsessed with John Philip Souza's music. When the local preacher gathers his practice of collecting small animals from local schools as a snakes bait, and his boyfriend marries a striptease (upsetting the ritual of Wednesday night's band concert), he goes to war creating a memorable bunch of clunkers under the cliff, where he destroys the wrecks after he has destroyed their unhappy owners. A funny game you can play while watching "Snakes" is to place bets on which the cars will land farther into the cliff. All in all, very cheap and exploiting, but really will be a lot of fun for the fans of these types of movies.
