I was adopted at birth and I certainly did not have the problems that Antwone Fisher had in the film but still share some emotions and this movie really helped them get out and force me to deal with them . It even made me realize I had a "missing piece" and I'm going to look for our parents now. I cried almost a day after seeing her for the first time. Antwone's confrontation with his mother's mother, juxtaposed with his father's family's reaction to his sudden appearance, is strong for those of us who do not know what will happen if we find our parents born. And self-confidence and his own statements about his mother and the abusers of his past were so strong. I could really identify myself with this and my need to tell people "Yes, I was left by my parents when I was born, but another set of parents took me and they loved me now I am a success! <br /> It has also helped my wife understand me and our adopted children who have experienced tragic experiences before coming to our home. It has helped me to figure out how much If you remember reading last year's story about Florida's foster child who was "lost" and then about the story of "Miranda & Ashley" in Oregon, where the SCF ignored multiple complaints about sexual abuse the man who finally killed him and the week of this movie was released, yet another story in New Jersey of three children who were ignored by the system One died, the state apparently believed home was okay because the guard was employed (ca. stripper) and "just occasionally" used heroin! There are just so many problems that are presented in this movie - and they are treated so well by the script and the fact that Antwone Fisher should be a nominated "Best Film" . Whether you are adopted or not, it is a heart tug that can not be ignored by anyone who is worried about the children in our society.
