One of the things about the movie that heated my heart was that dry fly fishing was an important part of the scene. I occasionally spent my dry fly fishing, my own flies and, together with my brother and my father, we spend a day on a river or another trying to tempt the evergreen brown trout to get up and to take the hand that was offered to them. When we had opportunities like this, any differences between us disappeared, and any of the pressures of the world melted to be replaced by the glory of being absorbed in the activity and the surroundings of the place where I was. This was one of the wonderful things I was presented to in the film, while the minister and his two sons, Norman and Pauly, performed the ritual. For there is something ritualistic about flying, because there is something ritualistic about so many fun. You can not start to throw your fishing line and hope for the best. You have to give yourself where you are, you have to scan the surface of the water, considering how it flows and where it would be the best point to place your fly and, depending on your level of skill, you could get Even you fly to land there long enough for a fish to take note of it and hit it. "The art of flying fishing" has been pointed and represented so well that they themselves can be classified as artists. The title of the film could not be chosen better because the river actually executed through the life of the father and two sons. This film is more widespread than the Montana family and community near the Blackfoot River, where the film unfolds. It has the ability to attract, delight, surprise you as family history, community and period unfold. The story said is not just a family history, but a life story. What can be classified as a "river of life"
