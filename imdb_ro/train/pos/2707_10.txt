Cor blimey. This movie really surprised me as a comedy masterpiece. Billy Zane is amazing as the central character, and everyone manages to play fair enough to make the comedy natural and easy. The soundtrack is very good, and the pieces are a joy to watch. We recommend that you watch this movie with a bunch of colleagues, a few bottles of favorite liqueur and get ready to be amazed and extremely entertained. This works so perfectly in the kitsch masterpieces as Plan 9 From outer space lies in the true tradition of "B". But what makes more than that is the caliber of those who have participated in the film. Ron Pearlman for example. I still find my self-chuck in the place where Zane prepares a set of steps without an apparent reason in a ballet style. All a little crazy, and the better for that.
