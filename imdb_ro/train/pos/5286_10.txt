Part of what was so great with classic Looney Tunes cartoons was their irritation and how they were not afraid to do what they wanted. In this case, Marvin Martian has a task to bring back a land. Sure enough, he meets Bugs Bunny, who warns of a riot from Marvin's dog. After Marvin finally catches Bugs - through a tight jacket of Acme - pulling out the bazooka! - Bugs has several things planned for the trip back to Mars. What I mean is that if you think there was a major change in the solar system when you plucked Pluto out of its status as a planet, then you see nothing! Yes, "The Hasty Hare" goes everything. How to buy Acme products in outer space is probably beyond most people, but the point here - I mean "rabbit" - is having fun. And believe me, you will certainly be. After all, a little space-out never hurt anyone.
