I saw this on an 8-hour flight and (probably because of pressure and altitude) I really found it fun (emphasis on "easy"). The idea behind the film was brilliant: a woman dies, her fianc√© falls in love with someone else, she decides to make sure they do not meet, but eventually lets her do it. Unfortunately, the real movie was not as good. Okay, there were a few laughs and the actors worked out well. But from the beginning, the plot was as predictable as the destination of the flight we were at. I think the whole part of the gay, but not homosexual story could have been much better. The parrot spoken was a nice idea, but to be honest: it was not really funny. In conclusion, the movie was more exciting than watching the chair in front of me, but it was almost a call.
