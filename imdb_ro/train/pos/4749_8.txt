I really enjoyed this movie and it was a little difficult to do when your brother makes stupid comments in it for 30 seconds. But I liked this movie, especially because I'm used to regular HK films. Most of these movies are not watching it at the story line, watch it for mindless action. And the mindless action is correct. You can see Jet Li Jump, spin, kick, blow, shoot, jump in impossibilities and dodge countless bullets. It is true that this movie was released to a wider audience after Li was in Lethal Weapon 4. This is one of the reasons why the film's rating has fallen. Most probably expected to see a movie that was as polished as a North American movie. But you have to remember that most of HK's budgets are not nearly as big as a movie in North America, and style in an action film HK is usually very different, usually requiring works of wire in many of them. If you want to see a good action movie, you should see this only try to ignore the duplication. <br /> <br /> My rating was 8.
