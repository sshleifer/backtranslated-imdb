The "Great Goodbye" introduces us to the first adventure of the Holodeck, in this case, Captain Picard, who presents himself as private detective Dixon Hill. These episodes create a kind of standard pattern repeated several times on TNG as well as on DS 9 and Voyager. After entering the holopuncture, something goes wrong and the characters have to deal with the program under different conditions, beyond playing a game (represented by the failure of the Holopotel's security program). <br /> <br /> This concept is used to extend the possibilities of Star Trek and allow a kind of gen-mix. Picard's stories about Dixon Hill are examples of fictional crime in the 1940s, and their representation on the screen is called Film Noir, often with antihero stereotype at the forefront (see, for example, Chandler Marlowe or Chinatown stories). Star Trek never focuses on the story (in most cases, it's a simple "how to do" scenario), but it allows actors to take a different approach to their characters. Those "Holodeck" games are commonly used for recreation and reflect the particular interests of crew members. Therefore, the technical aspect is always neglected and, from this point of view, stories are never certain (but Star Trek has ever had a technical, scientific point, that is, besides some utopian concepts?). "Good-bye" shows a relaxed Patrick Stewart, a McFadden who does not look any better in a Star Trek episode (at least in the first), and Date has some extraordinary scenes (although I find it hard to believe that pulling the lamp leaving the wall would have been really surprised by him, because he did research at that time and his habits). Wesley continues to turn the Trekkies into potential killers (why did not they take him to the holopette and let the gangsters finish it?) But everything is fun ...
