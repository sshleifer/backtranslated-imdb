"Read my lips," says about a strange symbiosis that develops between a simple, socially maladroit worker (Devos) and his trainee at work, a raw exon (Casel). As the movie creates this unlikely duo up to their identity, they blend into a smelly fusion of minds, each using the others for selfish reasons, with an extraordinary result. Good work for anyone in strong-pioneered movie movies. In French, with easy-to-read subtitles and good translations. (B +)
