Preston Waters, an 11-year-old boy, has problems with his parents and brothers, especially because of money problems. He is crazy to have his own house and his own rules, because his brothers have always stolen the saved money and his parents neglect his wishes. On a terrible day, Preston was riding his bike; That same day, the bastard in the story, Quigley, tried to get rid of the police and accidentally ran the car over Preston's bike. Being forced to be away from the police, Quigley is in a hurry, a check to cover the damage caused by Preston's bike. The problem was: it was an empty check! Preston is a smart boy and decides to have a high price on that check: $ 1 million! All this money gives Preston things he always wanted, like a mansion with a pool, lots of toys, and even a limousine! Problems start when the FBI and Quigley want to know where the money is, making Preston in a difficult situation and facing many problems. This movie was one of my childhood favorites. :)
