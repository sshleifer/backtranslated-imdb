This movie is amazing! While fun and fun, it is also profoundly deep and eye-opening. I will follow her again and again. Bruce is a guy who is unhappy with his life. He has a job and a life, but he is not what he thinks he will take to bring him happiness. Bruce is bitter, unhappy, and felt that his life is not the way he assumes it should be. As a result of this mood, Bruce stops losing his job and blaming God for everything he thinks is wrong with his life. God comes to Bruce and gives him divine powers. Bruce uses these powers to get everything he always wanted. His life is ultimately exactly what he imagined he would take to make him happy ..... with one exception. In the process of winning everything, he loses the only person who really loved him. As the film unfolds, Bruce finds out that the real change that had to take place in his life was not the circumstances but his perception of what was really there. This movie was inspired and profound. If you truly give attention, it forces you to look at your life with deeply humiliating respect for the fact that much of the time we are much blessed than we recognize. As my wife says, "How long does anyone know what it takes to make them happy?" and my humble assembly, "Let's not lose ourselves and those who matter while we try to find out."
