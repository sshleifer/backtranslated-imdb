I found out that this is the most enjoyable Muppets movie, because I felt he was the most bold and had the best comic performance on most of his lines. Muppets is trying to go on Broadway to sell an original music they've written, but along the way, they encounter the usual problems, including Kermit's memory loss here. While there are not so many big here as in the original "Muppets," there are a few among them Joan Rivers and Dabney Coleman. Just the moment and delivery of so many rows is great, and the situations where Muppets are found are hilarious. The original songs are also good here, and the conclusion is satisfactory. There is not much to say about the movie, but fans of Muppet should certainly see it. It's the funniest Muppet movie and it's sure it'll be nice to everyone. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 of ****
