This movie is one of those "WOW!" movies. Not because it is the biggest film of all time, but because it surprised me. Not only was it a Tv movie but he was on Elvis. I can safely say as many imitators as there is a single Elvis, but I can safely say that Kurt Russel came very close to being the real thing. He was one of the biggest impersonalists I've ever seen. He had believed he was really him. I learned a lot about Elvis's life watching this movie. And do not drive some of the television that lets you redeem - it's actually a fantastic movie! And Kurt Russel could have been twins to Elvis :)
