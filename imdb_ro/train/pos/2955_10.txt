There is a certain hint that I have always found in the discovery of the (semi-) unknown film. These discoveries have almost always been dramatic films - in my experience, unknown sci-fi, action and horror are unknown for very, very good reasons. I found "High Tide" on the video at a junk shop, mixed in countless dozens of boxes of different qualities. Of course, this is the only place I'd find it, because it's not yet on DVD. While watching Judy Davis (like Lillie) throughout this movie, I was somehow sure I watched great undiscovered performance. Yes, I've seen Davis in several small parts - and a leading role in "The Passage to India." But, although she was superb in the aforementioned film, "High Tide" is a different animal altogether. Since I've recently seen Gillian Armstrong's "Charlotte Gray," I was extremely aware of the genre of actress that impressed her. Davis attracts much more than a similarity with Cate Blanchett - both in the manner and sensitivity. Judy Davis's performance is amazing, I can not say enough good things about it. She shares an amazing relationship on screen with young Claudia Karvan (like Ally), the greatest actress of this film. There is a lot of drama and a quiet humanity that I share together, details that I will not suppose to reveal here (see it alone!). It's too good in "High Tide" to cover in a single review. Indeed, I would hardly take care - the movie speaks quite well for itself. In conclusion, I would like to praise scriptwriter Laura Jones for his amazing dialogue, director Gillian Armstrong for the understanding of actors and great Russell Boyd for his brilliant and undervalued cinema (please see his work in "Mercy Tender").
