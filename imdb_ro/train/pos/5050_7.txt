We really enjoyed Gray Owl: a simple story well-known in the classic Attenborough style: a little over-romance, with archetypes, humor, and a stress of dignity and values. <br /> <br /> Beautiful shot and said at a beautiful pace is the real story of Archie, an Englishman who became native Indian and went to live and draw in Canada. Strong performances at all make this movie an easy-to-read message. <br /> <br /> Two of the stars of the film are undoubtedly the nicest ones I've ever seen - and the message is a good one with its eclectics. It must have been great to meet or read Gray Owl in the 1930s, a unique character and this is a tribute to the movie.
