I've heard some not good things about this movie, and I've probably seen the low score here at IMDb and that's why I avoided it. Today they showed Vanilla Sky on TV and because I did not have the best ... and, as it turned out, it would have been hard for me to find something better to do. Vanilla Sky is a scary, sad and exciting movie, in fact, one of the best I've seen over time. I was surprised at how I was affected by looking at me. It's hard to explain, but during your movie your feelings about your characters and your perception of what's going on is changing and it's a pretty emotional journey. Vanilla Sky really touched me in a very rare way for a movie or any media for that. I really recommend to everyone to watch this movie. No matter what you heard about it.
