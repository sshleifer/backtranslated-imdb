A young woman comes to her husband's hometown after she died in an accident. She is just settling in this little town, but shortly thereafter, she loses her little son in a kidnapping and all his hopes ... This could lead to all sorts following plots in a normal movie: finding a new partner and happiness in the end; or sufficiently depressed to fight and commit suicide in the end ... She tries to commit suicide, but not after a series of serious battles with God. He trusts God, only to find that God seems to forgive everyone, even the killer. Well, I should be careful here about God, the movie does not mean anything against God. The way in which the film deals with the problem is quite interesting: not from the woman's point of view or from the perspective of God (this would be a lot of grass, the clouds flying). Rather, it is from a third-person eye, the film allows us to perceive and not explain anything. The movie would not be so exciting if there was only a woman. It is the man who is all over the woman and obviously in love with her, but in his own way. He's a funny guy, like a clown I should say, that's shameless about our heroine. The combination of these two, the woman full of tension, weeping and throwing always, and the man, smiling and speaking stupidly, arrives in a good balance of emotions: nothing absurdly wrong or too exhausting. <br /> <br /> We recommend a lot.
