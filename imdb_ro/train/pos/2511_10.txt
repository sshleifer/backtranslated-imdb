I've been looking for this movie in the usual obsession of fans. I just wanted to check it out. I did not expect anything. After all, a musician, an actor and a screenwriter? It is not possible for such a talent to live in one person. Right?? <br /> <br /> Gresit! Obsesia aside, has quickly become one of my favorites! The story line and characters are not lost in the Hollywood special effects. The story hits your emotions and pulls you. As credits roll down, you suddenly realize that you have been stuck to the end. Sometimes the drive seems slightly above the top. However, I think it is done with the intention of comedy and character matching. Otherwise, I would not have expected the level of action to be confessed. It's worth seeing you several times. I find myself hysterically laughing or unexpectedly panting on something that I missed or forgot the first time or twice around. I recommend this movie. Feel free to come in with the doubts, but I'm sure he'll find a place on your shelf.
