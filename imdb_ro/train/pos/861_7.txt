What can you say when you see a good French film trying to draw a suspense story according to the social background of the characters? The major point is that we believe in those characters and, once we have met, we want to stay together. It's simple and very effective. The background story is less important. Why is the script part of a semi-developed thriller? It helps not to get stuck in those social demonstrations that most French filming likes to do. Not too much ambition, justice: Sur mesles is just a good French film with good characterization. For all the intelligence points of the scenario, the end is far too easy. It's easy enough in the back window (an obvious reference and certainly not a noir movie), but with a less convincing context. Where I am amazed to see that the character of the probation officer has not been erased. He brings the story very little; when it appears alone, we wonder if we did not miss a part before. Jacques Audiard is not yet a newcomer. Strange and weird.
