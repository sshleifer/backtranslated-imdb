I liked this movie ,, cute and funny. I found this movie to be a good family movie. The dirtiest part of this film was when referring to the New York Yankees. You have to be in the Red Sox nation to understand that NY Yankees is a dirty word. You're sorry to say that to the Yankee fans. I recommend this photo for the whole family. Of course, with your typical love / comedy movie, there's a long time in the movie, with love and what they do, but the movie does that for all moments of slapstick. The movie show has a few moments about how the Red Sox nation (in Fenway Park) fans felt around 86 years from Sox always wounded at the end of the season and how Sox's love and love with another man go hand in hand.
