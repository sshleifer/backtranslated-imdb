I saw this little gay movie at the age of 10/11 in 1979 when it was broadcast on CBS. I did not know he was in a theater at all. To evaluate her from the point of view of the children, I would give her 4 out of 5 stars, because I was a little boy at the time, it looked a bit "girlish." The climatic scene where Gazooks glimpses the daylight from all over the world was a little annoying at that time, but you outgrow this kind of thing. <br /> <br /> When I re-discovered a Blockbuster movie in 1995, I had to revisit it! I still liked it despite the fact that it looked a bit "old". I do not know where another commentator here gave the idea that he was not VHS. Is there. It could even be on the DVD so far, at least I hope it is. I want to share it with the kids someday! 10 stars here, is still a great movie for kids. (end) <br /> <br /> 09/08/2009: Finally found a VHS copy! Woo hoo!
