Here's a vengeful revenge story that played a relentless and tough Denzel Washington. There are three personalities here: a mercenary, a drunkard and a drunkard, then a father-loving person to a little girl and then a brutal maniac in search of answers and revenge. The story is that Washington was hired to be a bodyguard for a small American girl living in Mexico, where kidnapping occurs regularly (at least according to the film). He gets attached to the child, playing actress winning actress today, Dakota Fanning. When Fanning is kidnapped in front of him, Washington goes after the responsible men and does not spare anyone. Beware: This movie is not for squeamish. This is the elegant movie, which is good and bad. I liked it, but a number of people found it too frantic for their tastes, because working with the room is one that could give you headaches. I thought it matched the tense story and it was fascinating to see, but it's (crazy room) not for all tastes. Apart from the two stars, there is always the exciting Christopher Walken, in an unusual way playing an important role, and a number of other finite actors. The movie lurks the basic emotions in us all, but it works.
