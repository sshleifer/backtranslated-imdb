The Best Treasure Island ever made. They do not make such movies anymore, not even now. No one makes such movies. More than a novelty, this movie is fun, honest and fascinating, but moody, mysterious and morose. This is one of my favorite photos. The director must have an idea of ​​what it is, but it certainly leaves room for your own impressions and interpretations, leaving a little to the left of imagination. Why not make more movies like this, I have no idea. While I remember some of the best noir, it's unique. But this is not for lazy or simple.
