The man on fire was hot. I like a classic story of good revenge and what better reason for revenge than kidnapping an innocent girl. The writers have done a great job in building the relationship between Creasy (Denzel Washington) and Pita (Dakota Fanning), so the viewer actually understands and feels that Creasy has had to save Pita. It was also good that Creasy was not a choir type, trying to save Pita through the "correct" channels, but instead used tactics of torture and street smarts. Some may say, "Torture is wrong," and you may be right, but when you see the pain that Creasy crosses because of Pita's loss and pure passion she has to get her back with Creasy, pulling him to be even ruthless. He would have made no progress if Creasy used diplomacy to deal with the various gangsters and criminals and knew that. Creasy's search ended when Pita returned to her mother, and Creasy was dying in bad guys. But Creasy's death did not diminish the effectiveness of the movie, actually improved it by demonstrating that Creasy was willing to die to bring Pita back. His death was actually noble. Denzel does a great job as writers. This movie deserves good marks because it was certainly a good movie.
