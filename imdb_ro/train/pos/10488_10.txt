After her Oscar-nominated line in "Secrets and Lies," Brenda Blethyn played in the "Salvation Grace" as great. And, let me tell you, it's not the kind of movie you find every day. After her husband suicides, Grace Trevethyn (Brenda Blethyn) discovers that her irresponsible financial decisions have left her massive debts. Fortunately, she finds a way to make heads: marijuana. That's right, Grace is starting to cultivate it. Every aspect of this film has been played with great effect; it's not a boring moment anywhere in it. And I did not see the end scene coming! But anyway, you have to see this movie. You could feel more than festive after you saw it. If not, it could function as a good lesson about knowing finance. But, of course, there is more than that!
