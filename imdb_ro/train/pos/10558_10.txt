<br /> <br /> Charlie Kauffman has made a strange metaphysical anger, but this Canadian jewel makes her hilarious. <br /> <br /> Like the strangest movies, less to say about the plot better, but to put the scene, two friends Anthony and Dave have been together since childhood, can not cope with the world and finally this means you do not have to. But there are even more problems here. I liked this movie, made me smile a lot of the final credits and it is a rare experience with so many pieces of "nothing" produced in the mass. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this. <br /> <br />
