The producers of this great movie have done an extraordinary job of engaging in characters as they have suffered through this horrible horrible. The horrible scene in the woods was so great that you forgot that these men were just actors playing the parts. have never been so submerged in a movie like me. Burt Reynolds and Jon Voight have never been better on the screen, as well as fine performances by Ned Beatty, Ronny Cox, Bill McKinney and, although shortly appeared, James Dickey, the man who wrote the book on which the film is based , like Sheriff Aintry. It is somewhat disturbing and children, of course, should be protected by it, but this is a big and dramatic cinema.
