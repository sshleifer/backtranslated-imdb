Not to be confused with the British black comedy of the same name that came out in 1994. But this Grave Shallow is a plus to the 80-year-old slasher. <br /> <br /> The park goes = 4 sorority girls in the monasteries plan a spring break in Florida, but the plans are stopped when one of them witnesses a man who kills a local woman and when he realizes that it was seen, let's say it becomes a deadly cat and mouse game and things get worse when it turns out to be a local sheriff. <br /> <br /> Shallow Grave in my opinion is one of the most enjoyable slashers that came out in the 80s, 80s, which was when the slashers cam came down, it was one of the few who did not have this the film should be better known, it is a shame that it is not. this is a movie that actually confuses stereotypes (just try to guess who will be the last girl - I was completely mistaken). The main cast is totally enjoyable and is one of those films that you all hope to escape, which, of course, they do not. This, accompanied by the fluctuation of the first film jars for half an hour (in a good way), with some real glitters (the second murder gives a real jolt) and some inconvenience (even if it is not a big one I did not expect the topless scene where a woman is strangled with her own bra (accompanied by a religious hysterical religious show) in a movie from the early 80's. One or two bad things about this movie, well not just minor minority, such as the sublot with the two teenage boys who do not go anywhere and the end was bad and the deputy's inability to follow the logic. There are no sharp instruments in SHALLOW GRAVE, but the one little in my mind is a short blow through and over The scenes in which the girls are hunted through the forest by the evil sheriff are tense and exciting All in all are very pleasant and meritorious with excellent performances from all over it's the four main faces and that psycho sheriff.
