Only after a certain contemplation I decided I liked this film. And after reading reviews from all the other posters here and thinking more about it, I decided I liked it a lot. I like American movies - probably because they are so narrative. They usually have a well defined, middle and ending. "Presque rien", on the other hand, does not make such an attempt. I disagree with other posters that say "too artistic." In any way, this movie is meant to evoke sensitive memories. So often along the movie, you feel like you are there ... feel the summer sun, the breeze, the heat, the winter cold, the company, the loneliness etc., etc. <br /> <br /> In any way, the director takes you into the life of the characters - that's why many people feel so strong that the film has disappointed them. After I finished watching her, I felt the same. But after some reflection, I admitted that this is what the film should be like: "the story" is not the story but the emotions that you feel (the viewer). The lighting, the landscape, and the camera angles take you on stage - they are rich, refined and come with details and nuances. Though normally I can not cope with movies without a fully developed plot (after all, it's not a "supposed" movie to tell a story), this movie is definitely one of my new favorites.
