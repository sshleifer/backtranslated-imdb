Branagh and Fishburne offer excellent performances in this version of the classic Shakespeare. Branagh plays Iago better than I saw the character played in the movie or on the stage. Some might say that this movie is too Iago-centric, but I do not agree. Fishburne, the first ironic Othello in cinematic history, offers strong performance. Fishburne has always been a good actor, but this Moor show in Venice can be one of the best. <br /> <br /> The only problem I have with this movie is the simple decrease of a number of important scenes. Desdemona's character is given less depth than she is in the game. In this movie, it could not be added at all. One of Branagh's most serious cuts in this film was the decline of a conversation between Iago and Desdemona at the beginning of the second act. This part of the play shows that Desdemona may not be the innocent child he is portrayed as in this movie. There have been a number of subtractions that have affected the integrity of this film. <br /> <br /> However, if you have not read the play or seen a movie version of Othello before, I recommend this movie. The story, whether cut or not, is still incredibly charming. The actor, as has been said before, is very good. If there were some important scenes added and Desdemona's character was prioritized a little longer, it would be a great movie. Currently, it is an admirable version of the original. I give it a marginal recommendation.
