Let me start by saying that "War, Inc." is not the whole cup of tea. It's, however, very nice (and thinks - "Oh, nonsense"). Comedy involves the movie is not at all obvious - it is subtle (Tamerlane tanks, dry cleaning service, etc.) and changes with the twists and turns of the field. just one, but I will not compare it to "Grosse Point Blank" because it's different. John Cusack - I would not say it was "amazing" or "brilliant" - but it was good. On the other hand, his sister (Joan Cusack) was incredible in delivering lines and during comedy - even if she was not in the movie (I would say the same about Ben Kingsley). Marisa Tomei plays a compelling reporter and manages to get him out. Hilary Duff is very commendable for her Asian central star role, Yonica Babyyeah. Duff's development as an actress is very visible in the film and she does a very good job (even if her accent is an unread tad). Generally, the movie is what I would call "fun". It does not have a private story and it's pretty stupid at times, but it has a subtle message. I'd say it's worth an hour.
