This movie is absolutely amazing. A New Blade Runner - Future Noir at the Greatest. Paris's vision is superb, so recognizable and visionary, with breathtaking visions, pieces of luck and futuristic virtual reality. The story line is pretty simple, with few surprises, but I do not like the most about the movie. It's a visual treatment. <br /> <br /> Made in 3D and rendered in black and white (gray without!) with only one short point of color, it is less eye-catching than it sounds. There are many "art" photos - strange approaches and points of view - but this adds to the temperament of the film. In general, you get the impression of a graphic novel in film form. I was originally under the impression that the film was rotoscopic, so was the level of animation and detail in the character's expressions. But, unlike the "Dark Scanner" - who suffers from (or even increased) defining inconsistent character (just watch how some of the hair changes shape!) - Renaissance is consistent and precise throughout. When the character is in the foreground, details and textures can be seen, but when shot in the middle or farther, details are omitted, but not at the expense of defining the character. For me, the only part of the film is that in a comment we are told that this is a unique project. Such a shame, as I would like to see more about this futuristic film-noir story and especially in this cutting-edge graphic style. Oh, and the English oak is also great. <br /> <br /> All in all a great and highly recommended movie.
