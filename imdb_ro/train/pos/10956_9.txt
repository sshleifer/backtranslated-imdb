For those who think it's humor and immaturity, you're not mindless. While the show contains some of the pottery banknotes, it also contains a lot of satirical materials and has fun with social problems, racial barriers, clich√©s, stereotypes, etc. Just read some of her material more to get it. <br /> <br /> What I also like is that not everything is a punchline. For those who are waiting for a joke formulated like friends (I LOVE friends fyi), you will not find it here. Instead, Sarah uses situations and other ways to achieve humor, which is more realistic. We do not walk in this world and we have spellbills for everything he said, which is in most comedies. Instead, the Sarah Silverman program makes it more realistic in this respect. <br /> <br /> So do not take it as a mind-humor, because it's much more than that.
