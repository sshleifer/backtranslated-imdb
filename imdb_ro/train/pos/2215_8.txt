I bought "The Feast of All Saints" and it's not really a horrible movie, but many things could have been better. It has a lot of historical value, played by very talented actresses / actors, and it is not an everyday event that actors can play in such a role and can be somewhat credible. There were a few parts that were a little mediocre and confusing, but I would not say the whole movie was horrible. Once you think about it, by capturing New Orleans in the 1800s, and doing something out of it, it's hard and harder to get actors that can signify these parts. But the only big problem I had with the movie was that most of the actors who played the blacks were largely open-skinned Africans, not very universal in throwing others who were not fools; one of the old creole stereotypes that still exist. Whoever did the casting could have chosen a larger variety when it came to the hue, despite the fact that many creos are aware of the colors. The actors who chose the actors that seemed close to white in a certain sense could have been more thoughtful. The actors did an excellent job, it could have been better written, and on the whole we found out that the performances were very credible.
