As for the Muppet line, it is not the best, nor the second best. This has been marketed to children, but it has some dark and moving adult moments where parents can not expose their children. One of them shows that Miss Piggy goes "postal" to a jealous fury that lasts practically for the duration of this work. Beyond that, the story is progressive and extremely fun. A scene where Joan Rivers and Miss Piggy go berserk into a universal store is just hilarious! And there are other parts of this work that contain the same level of laziness and fun. I like it very much and I enjoy it today. / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
