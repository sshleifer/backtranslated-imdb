I did not see the restoration, or some version for that, of "Baby Face" with Barbara Stanwyck until I caught the TCM. What a great movie! In a word, Lily lives in a speakeasy, was pulled by her father at the age of 14! Then he still blows up and he killed leaving Lily (Stanwyck) only for her black maid Chico, played very well by Theresa Harris. Lily leaves for the big city (New York), deciding to use her sex to get to the top. She does this in a great style! Seduces a wrong clerk to go downstairs and go to men like one-time candy! One feds his fianc√©e and kills his father and mine, his Lily's sugar father, then he sucks! Lily blinks barely! STanwyck is great as a girl who does not really know what love is. Then in Paris, she falls for Courtland, played by George Brent, marries, but when she is in financial depth she screws. Almost free with Chico and half a million, he realizes he loved the Court! Lily goes to find him, but will it be too late? <br /> <br /> This is Hollywood pre-code to the best. Stanwyck is great and the look and the music in the movie are perfect. This reminded me of "Original Sin" with Angelina Jolie, another ignored shot, with an amorous woman, those who did not like those ultra-romantic movies, will not better the Baby FAce, those with belief in sex, love and power love. Highly recommended! See it!
