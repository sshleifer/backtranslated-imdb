I saw this movie on the cable, it was very funny, from the police chief's stereotype to the big stereotype of evil, jay leno and mr mayagi from the karate kid in this good comedy about a prototype part of the car. We compare the movie with "RUSH HOUR" in which a local policeman has to associate with an Asian policeman to solve a case. Tracking through farmers in detroit city center brings back memories. Nice sound card, good script, I gave it 10/10.
