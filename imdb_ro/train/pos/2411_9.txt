This film sees me as one of the most successful attempts to come up with plausible answers to some of the questions that arose in the recent scholarship on the "Passion" accounts (Christ's suffering and death) in the New Testament. (What would motivate Judas if the money would not have been the problem? What could bring the Sinedrius to meet on a holy day ?, Why did he do the Pilate?) It is a movie for serious Christians and thinkers: fans of the "Passion of Christ" will undoubtedly be disappointed with the lack of show and the characterization of the arc. As far as I am concerned, I find the portrait painted here - the desire of ordinary people to sacrifice so gently the common decency when their own interest is at stake - more realistic and profoundly disturbing. (Disinterested, "just doing my job," on the face of the man who drives the first nail in Christ's wrist, is as cool as any moment in the movie.) The film makes no claim to "authenticity," but the settings and costumes feel invariably more "correct" than many other highly appreciated efforts. It is a slow film, but if you accept its self-imposed limits (it is, after all, "Death" - not Life - "of Christ"), eventually a very rewarding one.
