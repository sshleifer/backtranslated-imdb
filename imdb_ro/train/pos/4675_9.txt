I saw the "Shadow of Brother" at the Tribeca Film Festival and I woke up thinking two more days later. The story of a prodigal son (Scott Cohen) who returns to the family furniture business after a break in jail offers all the qualities needed for a solid drama - memorable characters; Sharp, observable dialog; the sensitive use of the camera by a visually reflective filmmaker. But, moreover, it presents something that is rare in the multiplex of our day: the uncompromising vision of a mature sensitivity. The talent of director-scriptwriter Todd S. Yellin seems to come out, but we understand that he (as his protagonist) has paid his contributions. He knows how real people are fighting in this world, and he knows how we want to see - or, at least, experiment vicariously - success. Yellin, however, keeps his audience too much to cast the smoke up to the back end. Finally, we see that Jake's triumph is not in commissions or even in respect of his family, but in the "work" he can not abandon if he tried. an essential theme in a world (and especially a cinema industry) that can not rise above the "bottom line". This film deserves a wide audience.
