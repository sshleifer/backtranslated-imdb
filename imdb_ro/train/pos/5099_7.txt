The only reason I came across this movie was that it's on the LITTLE MISS MARKER DVD, and I recommend watching it, though you will not like it, even on the most famous film. We have Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard as a companion man. The film starts quite easily, but it becomes more dramatic as Coop plans first to use her daughter to exhaust a considerable amount of money from her brother-in-law but to meet her face and see the discipline she would be subject to her brother - in law chooses to keep it. However, he has problems staying straight and narrow and thus the theater is developing. Cooper and Lombard are good, and Shirley still manages to steal the scene they are in. There is little music in this, and Shirley has only one song. However, this is fun and is worth watching alongside LITTLE MISS MARKER.
