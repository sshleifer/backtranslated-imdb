And not because of her days on "Clarissa Explains It All" I had a little in love with Melissa Joan Hart, who at the time this show was popular was already well in 20 years but was still in measure to get teenage roles. "Sabrina, the teenager witch" was Hart's next big leap after her days of "Clarissa." Based on comics, Sabrina Spellman is - you guessed it! - a teenage witch who is trying to balance his witchcraft antiquity with the requirements of the daily life of adolescence. She is helped in her efforts by the two aunts and a black cat, cracked by wisdom, while going from high school, college, and ultimately to her career in journalism. As usual, Hart is the soul heart show. "Sabrina, the teenage witch" is pretty cool and very funny, and it's a shame that it took me so long to figure out how big it was. I just wish there were a few new episodes that we could all enjoy. 10/10
