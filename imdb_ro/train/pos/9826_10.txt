This low-budget erotic thriller that has a few good points but much worse. The platoon revolves around a lawyer trying to free her lover, who is accused of killing his wife. Being a soft base movie, that means he's going undercover in a strip club and doing sex with suspects. With regard to plots for this kind of gender, not bad. The script is all right, and the story has enough sense for someone at 2 AM to follow this in order not to notice too many plot holes. But anything else in the movie looks cheap. The main actors are not so bad, but almost everyone who supports them is incredibly bad (a girl seems drunk and / or raised). The cinematography is very luminous, it looks great and ugly. The sound is so terrible that you can hardly hear what people say. The worst thing in the movie is why you follow it - sex. The reason people follow these things is for hot sex scenes with really hot girls in the Red Shoe Diary. Sexual scenes are not hot, they are crazy, shot in that porn style where everything is just a shot of two people going to him. The woman also looks like they are refugees from a porn movie. I'm not trying to be rude or misleading, but they all have breast implants and a burned-out look. Even the title, "Deviant Obsession," sounds like a Hardcore movie. Not that I have nothing against porn - in fact, I like it. But I want my soft-core and hard core separate. What has ever happened to actresses like Shannon Tweed, Jacqueline Lovell, Shannon Whirry and Kim Dawson? Women who can act and awaken you completely? And what happened to erotic B thrillers, such as Corp Chemistry, Nighteyes and even Stripped to Kill. Sure, none of those where the masterpieces, but at least they felt like movies. In addition, they pushed the envelope beyond Hollywood's relatively cautious position on sex, sexual obsession and perversion. Now they're just making hard-core movies with no hard sex.
