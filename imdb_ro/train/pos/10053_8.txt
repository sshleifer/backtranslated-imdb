I have to admit, when I read the description of the genre on Netflix as "Steamy Romance", I was a little skeptical. "Steamy"? In a 1968 film? I was ready for disappointment. And when I realized she was shot entirely black and white, I knew my erotic hopes were shattered. Well, I was wrong! Not only does this film have all the elements of a delusional story - the discovery of the first love, the fear of secrecy being discovered, an unexpected ending suddenly - but sometimes this film was even erotic. Soon you will forget he is shot in black and white. Cinematography deserves to be recognized over the years. And the performances of the two stars (Essy Persson and Anna Gael) are intense and memorable. OK, so we both try to play school girls in the mid-20s. It's 1968. Do you really expect teenagers in the 1960s to be able to effectively explore a lesbian love story like that? Many adult women were still trying to confront their sexuality ever since. Anyone looking for real teenagers here is waiting too long. I think this movie was long before its time. The level of eroticism was an unexpected pleasure; but still managed to leave a lot of imagination, opting instead to give us poetic descriptions to add to what has been shown to us. I have no doubt that lesbians will identify with the characters here. As for you righteous boys who love watching lesbians in action: Though it will not be all you expect, I do not think you will be too, too disappointed.
