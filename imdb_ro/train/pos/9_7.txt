Martin Ritt's romantic warfare is as incredible as it comes, but there are times of pleasure, especially due to the charisma of stars Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro (both wonderful). She is a widow who can not move on, is illiterate and inventor of cabinets - you can guess the rest. Adaptation of Pat Barker's "Union Street" novel (a better title!) It's so limited that it's leaning towards a weak level, and editing the film is a mess, but it's still nice; a fantasy of blue blue collar. There are no prerequisites for serious problems (even the angle of illiteracy is just a plotting tool for the love story that unfolds) and there are no real fireworks, although the characters are deliberately a little colorless and the pipes are toned down to a interesting level. The end is a clean puff - and cynics will be hard to swallow - although these two characters deserve a happy ending and the picture would not really satisfy any other way. *** from ****
