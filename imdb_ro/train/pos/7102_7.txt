And other reviewers seem to think it's a terrible movie. This is simply not true and a little unfair. The act is of good quality and the direction moves with a decent fluidity. I do not think there is anything wrong with how to interconnect Tarantino-esquire stories. Maybe it's just a new tool for directors to try. I thought it made the movie a lot more interesting. Perhaps some elements of the scenario need tightening, but it's the only mistake I can find. Nestor Cantillana offers great performance like Sylvio, too, Antonella Rios is amazing and deserves the admission price alone.
