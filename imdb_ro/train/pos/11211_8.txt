I liked the innocence of this film and the way the characters had to deal with the reality of having a strong animal in their midst. The Gorilla looks great, and the eyes were really realistic. It's even a little frightening and should have the children slightly scared without going over the top. Rene Russo plays her wonderful female role. Typically, these types of Hollywood movies that have taken place in the past feel the need to create a straw bitch, but the only opponent is the gorilla. It's an interesting look at how close animals are to humans, how they feel the same emotions we do, and how we can not really treat them as humans because they are not. Not many movies venture into this territory and it is worth seeing if you want to contemplate the animal-animal similarity.
