On the MTV encryption, all the players in the ballet and appealing players fired the classic Scarface movie from their DVD collection. This can give you an idea that Scarface is a "gangster movie." Sure, there are gangsters and mobs in it, but that's not Scarface. Tony Montana (Al Pacino) is just a Cuban refuge that seeks a new way of life. He falls into the crowd group and becomes a well-known drug master. Montana was all about doing what you wanted to do with your life. The classic phrase: "Greet my little friend!" is in Scarface. This quote is what always comes to mind when I think of Brian DePalmas, Scarface. This fits into the best 10 of your favorite movies. I would evaluate *** 1/2 (from ****). Definitely a movie that you have to see. PHENOMENAL.
