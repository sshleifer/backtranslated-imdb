Fifteen years later, Paris is still frightening. This is a classic in gay black movies, right up there with the other black black films, The Color Purple and Mahoganoy. This seminal work captures black and Latin black and Latin culture and culture, as well as no other work before or after, including all retrospectives and sentimental renunciations from Harlem Rennaissance. They are good, but this is the best I say the film "Relentlessy Cunty" (classic invention of home music) comes to the Hollywood camp, non-stop, hilarious (as we do it only) and social criticism a white female director (who obviously must have been a sister Gurl or Mizz Thing in a previous life.) We could go further, but I think you will get the point yet: I like this movie!
