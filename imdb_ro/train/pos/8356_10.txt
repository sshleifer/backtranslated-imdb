I'm not sure if this matters as a spoiler or not, so beware: <br /> <br /> Just a small but essential thing to watch, an exciting opportunity: boys steal a green Citroen at a time, for a joyful walk, and return it to the owner who made intentional hidden damage and revenge to the car, hoping the owner will collapse. Is that the same car they steal much later than the picnic family? We know the owner originally sold it. They end up on a dangerous road, one that I understand has been closed for all, except for pedestrians, in the last ten years. A completely new movie to the end of the movie. In another issue, this movie could have been called "A Woman's Flavor." I do not remember another film, certainly not American, which treats the smell of a woman in such an open and open manner as the "nose" of a fine Bordeaux.
