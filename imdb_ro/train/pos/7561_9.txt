The version I saw about this movie was Blockbuster rental with a similar title, but a word of oath in it. This movie was funny. It was also true for the bone. If you have ever spent time in Hollywood or the area around it, you will understand the humor. If not, you may not "get" at all. The story of two businessmen striving to do it until they eventually reach a point of breaking is a rare piece of jewelry. It is said to be a drama, but it is a drama as much as Deer Hunter is a comedy. Loren Dean is wonderful, as always, as a supporting actor. Jamie Kennedy managed to keep her good. Its performance is particularly impressive during the poodle scene. The only downside was Carmen Electra, but we can not have it all.
