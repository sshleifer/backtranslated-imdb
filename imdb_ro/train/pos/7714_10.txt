There have been many SF films for 50 years. There were big dramas for Drive-in theaters. Many of them were tangled even then. This film and "The Day the Earth Remains Still" stands out and both have aged well in their own way. From the very beginning, with its brilliant musical score (which sounds strange since it's never used again) The forbidden planet takes you where no one has ever gone. Speaking of Star Trek, there is so much material in this movie that it entered the Star Trek TOS as a pilot for the series; from Interactive Captain / First Mate / Doctor, Mad Scientist, Alien Beings, Short Skirt Babies, Computer Intelligence; everything is rigeur now, but this was the first of its kind. In addition, she has a good adventure and a well done work, which even today evokes a certain awe of the image. Consider how the huge Krell car is successfully described with real depth. I saw this as a child (at a drive-in: 0) when it was a new movie and scared me. Of course, every movie that was even scary had in the past, but I remember that I was worried about the invisible monster. Forbidden Planet is a movie that a science fiction fan can watch several times and find something new with each viewing.
