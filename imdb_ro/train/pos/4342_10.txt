This movie did not really surprise me, as a result, it just got better and better. I thought, "Paul Rieser wrote this thing, right? Well ... we'll see how he does it ..." Then I saw Peter Falk standing in it. I appreciate Colombo. Even though I have never been a big fan of the show, I have always liked to see Peter Falk. <br /> <br /> Peter and Paul's performances were so natural that I felt like a tussle on the wall. They played each other so well that I felt really joyful! ... I did not drink! The movie was so good that I wanted to call Paul and let him know how much I liked it! but I did not find my number. They have to be unlisted or something like that. It was one of those movies that I had no idea what to talk about or who it was or not. I just went in and I thought, "Eh, why not? Let's see if I do not like it - I do not have to look at her ..." ... and I came to love him!
