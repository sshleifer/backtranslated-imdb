As an astronomer of the original Kolchak series: Night Stalker from the beginning of my childhood, an aspect that was not really mentioned is the degree of urban exploration that Carl takes during series. He has always managed to wake up in a great abandon, channel or tunnel after another. Armed only with his green light (loaded, so he had several missiles in the tunnel of the monkey's episode) and the camera, he never carried any other speed to protect himself or make exploration easier. <br /> <br /> Many here, I recently bought the set of DVDs from the two pilot movies and the subsequent TV episodes and I reviewed all the shows. And although I remember seeing them back in the early 70's when they first broadcast, it's been over 30 years ... so many of them seem to us again. Campy, dated and cheesy - but charming and extremely fun. They just do not do things like this nowadays. Now, all his spin-offs regurgitate with predictable characters and plots. Fortunately, my 16-year-old daughter sat down to see what episodes with me and developed an appreciation for them (enjoying the genre). It gives me hope and faith, the series will continue with new generations of fans for the coming years.
