All Kira Reed fans MUST see this. The premise of the film faces Romantic romanticism Kira unable to come up with new ideas. She also gets a divorce. However, she meets this guy at a restaurant and helps her out of shell (and clothing). They enter a corner room and do it. Fortunately, Kira gets a condom (Now do not tell me that these Playboy movies are countless piles of soft base puffs. Remind your children, sure sex). Later she marveled to her journalist how big she was, but she did not get her name. Despite this, the guy finds him and continues his wicked games. But he finally worries about trickery and wants to know more. When he does, all the hell comes off and I'll let it go. This is easily the best of these soft Playboys movies that I have seen. Check out this and marvel at Kira's majesty.
