Yeah ... I'm going 1-0 on this and here. In recent years, I have watched many comedies and I have only a few laughs and some late movie rental fees because the movies were so easy to forget. Then I block "nothing". It seemed exciting, but she did not expect too much. I was wrong. This was probably one of the funniest movies I had the chance to watch. Dave and Andrew make a good pair of comedy, and humor is quite appealing to remember, but not too complex, to the point of losing his joke. I do not want to notice on any of the current scenes, because I feel it's a movie worth seeing once. With more and more unnecessary concepts that come in the movies (you know, such as killer military jets and "fresh" remakes that destroy old classics), this movie will make you happy to say it's good to laugh at "Nothing."
