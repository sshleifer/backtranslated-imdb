I agree that Capital City should be on DVD. I watched this show just accidentally in 1994 and I fell in love with Rolf Saxon as Hudson Talbot. It was nice to see the Americans working abroad in London in the financial industry for a change. I loved Rolf in this role and loved the other players in the role he played. I can not believe the show lasted only 13 episodes. I liked William Armstrong as Hudson's charming friend in the series. When they broadcast this show in the New York City area, it was always late at night or out of time. The show has a duration of less than an hour. I felt that this show was supposed to go longer, but the casting changes in the second season made the show a little more interesting. I did not care about Sylvia, but I missed the actress, Julia Phillips-Lane last season. I felt that this show had chances and often worked. The Americans who loved and chose to live in London showed. The American characters were not arrogant or trying to overcome their British counterparts. I also liked the fact that they tried to internationalize the distribution, rather than doing all the British. I loved seeing Julia Ormond in an early role. I felt that the show should have lasted longer. I sometimes felt that the previews lasted as long as they looked in less than an hour. He could have transferred the distribution to New York City and it would have been a blow to America.
