I enjoyed this film very much, but four things really stand out: Sam Raimi's timing and performance, such as the handy man of the camp, the wonderful characterization of Alan Arkin of the camp's owner, best cinematography. The wonderful golden sceneries of the outer scene attract me into the film as a sunset at the shore of the lake that draws me in my summer memories. Dialogue and mood feel very natural and credible. Some commentators criticize the lack of a more "profound" scenario. For me, it's just that lack that makes this movie work. Their characters and problems seem real and that's why I care about what's going on with them. The bottom line is that all parties come together to create a whole that feels right.
