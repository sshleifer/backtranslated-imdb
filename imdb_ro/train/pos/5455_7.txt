The infamous film of the pre-code, indeed the only film that made people insist on the strict application of the Hayes Code. Barbara Stanwyck plays the role of a girl whose father who sells alcoholic beverages has no problem getting her to his clients. When she died in an accident, she was released into the world with the knowledge that her nubile body can take her whatever she wants. He goes to New York and continues to climb the corporate ladder, one bed at a time. Although obviously there is no real sex, the movie is pretty unpleasant. Unfortunately, after the initial shock is blurring (while Stanwyck screws up a railway car inspector so he can travel for free), the film becomes a bit repetitive and dull. Stanwyck herself is the only thing that keeps the movie worth standing. As always, it's fantastic.
