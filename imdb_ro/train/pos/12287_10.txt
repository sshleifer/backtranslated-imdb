Although the story is fictitious, it draws on the reality not only of the history of the Latin American countries, but of the whole of the third world. This is the true, pure and recent history of these countries summarized in this novel / film. Outstanding supernatural things ease the intensity of the historical events presented in this film. After all supernatural things are part of the culture of the third world. Although not critically rated (probably because of supernatural stuff), this is an excellent movie with a wonderful story and great action.
