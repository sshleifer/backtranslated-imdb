With a relatively low budget for an animated movie of only $ 60 million, people at Fox Animation and Blue Sky Studios have done incredible work. They combined cutting-edge digital animation, vocal talents talented by Ray Romano, John Leguizamo and Dennis Leary (among many others) to create an extremely entertaining entertainment film with a strong message of cooperation, friendship and care for other members . And sometimes it takes a lot of different creatures to make a flock. As you watch this movie, we received a strong political message about how to join people who share your space - maybe it should be needed for all world leaders! David Newman, another member of the Holman's Newman composer, offers a superb score that is not intrusive but serves to move the action, and sometimes it's positively touching the feet. <br /> <br /> The overall aspect of the movie is incredible; a fantasy of snow, geysers, mud, stones and ice. The individual characters were also delightfully credible, with Manfred's Ray Romano's facial expressions being a special experience. The whole sequence with DoDos will leave no doubt as to where the phrase 'Dumb like a DoDo comes from' This is a good family film that keeps things that could alarm or scare off children pretty much disinfected - but real, however, a great movie to see in the theater and to buy home.
