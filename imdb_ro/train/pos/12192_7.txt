In 1947, this film was directed and written by Orson Welles (with a funky Irish accent) and also plays Rita Hayworth with less blond hair. So, I was hanging up with Orson before being in contact with evil, with Citizen Kane and the third man, but that was my first interaction with Rita Hayworth. Our first encounter went well, she did a great job playing Elsa scared / cagey, married to a millionaire wounded lawyer. Mike (Welles) and Elsa collapse each other. She wants to run away with her, she does not know if she can live without the money she can buy. Elsa, her husband and his partner get stuck and bite, just like the sharks that Mike describes by attacking each other, and his prediction proves to be too true. More twists and turns are following in this mystery of murder as we get to the climax in the fun house. (Think of the final shots in "Man with Gold Gun", who borrowed much from this scene). I was not sure who the killer was until the end. This movie is like shrimp in garlic and lemon. The food is centered on the sea, it is subtle, sour and prickly, all with great effect. These may not be the best, fresh shrimp, but good quality shrimp from Costco. The aromatic sauce adds to the naturalness of the pink shrimp as you fill up on a healthy but complete alternative to the more common, common tariff. 7/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
