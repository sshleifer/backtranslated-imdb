Road to Perdition, a tremendous movie in that year The Oscar is the second work of Sam Mendes (and, in my opinion, his best work), a director who, three years ago, won the Oscar for its American beauty, appreciated but controversial. This is a wonderful movie and, at the same time, ultimately painful and sad. It is a story of a relatively rich and happy family from the outside during the difficult times of Depression when Michael Sullivan, a father of two children played by great Tom Hanks (I'm not his admirer, but I should say that) is a successful man for the local mafia mafia played by Paul Newman. His eldest son, thirteen-year-old Michael Sullivan Jr., played perfectly by young Tyler Hoechlin, after years of happy ignorance, finds out what his father is and what his family lives. Promoted by his curiosity and aspiration to know the truth, he accidentally becomes a witness of a crime committed by John Rooney, his father's son. Such a discovery hits an innocent soul and causes many events that have changed their lives forever. The atmosphere of the period, all backgrounds and decorations are perfectly created, editing and cinema are almost flawless, while the story is well written. But the main line of the film, the most important moments and points of the film, and the key factor in the film's success are difficult father-son relationships in hard times. They are so profound, powerful and credible. Tom Hanks does excellent and has one of the best performances of his career in a role quite unusual for him and all acting on board are superb. Finally, it is worth mentioning a very good score by Paul Newman and the result of getting a remarkable work of all the people involved in making this beautiful masterpiece (but still sad). I think Road to Perdition belongs to the greatest achievements of the film this decade and undoubtedly one of the best movies of the year. My class 10 out of 10
