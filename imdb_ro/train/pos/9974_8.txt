Of course it was a remake of the film in the 1970s, but it had the suspense and action of a current movie, says Breakdown. Escaping, desperate to be with his wife hospitalized, police are the least concern. The chases were very good, the part with him being marked at a stop of rest was well done, at the end of the film was a great cliffhanger. This is better than Bullitt, a boring film with what, a muscle tracking machine that was filmed badly? The character of Vigo knew what he had to do to get rid of Johnny Law, some movies had the effects - the night vision, the CB radio - well, I forgot the name of the movie, the guy was upset, toys with a guy who upset him. The end is great, you can not tell him if he suicides suicide or not, a very good doing-do-or-no.
