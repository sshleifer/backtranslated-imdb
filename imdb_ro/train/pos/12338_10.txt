Joan Fontaine plays the role of a villain in the Victorian movie. She convincingly plays the married woman who has a lover on her side and also looks at a rich man, Miles Rushworth, who is played by Herbert Marshall. Mister. Marshall is pretty good like Miles. Mrs. Fontaine fulfilled her role in perfection - she was at the same time cunning, calculated, innocent, frightened and charming. An actress with a tremendous talent is needed to get this out. Joan Fontaine seemed absolutely gorgeous in the elegant costumes of Travis Banton. Also in the film is Joan's mother, Lillian Fontaine as Lady Flora. I recommend this film.
