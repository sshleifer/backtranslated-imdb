Pushing Daisies is just a wonderful story, with the nuances of Amelie's aesthetics and romance. It has a beautiful palette, well-thought-out and detailed pictures, its capricious name and dialogue and too cute to be real, its wonderful imagination and its deep romance. Look blue in pop sky out from you, because blue can not be found in the rest of the sets or photos (with a few exceptions). Look at a weird and satisfying piece that comes out of a scene. <br /> <br /> Its score is superb, its distribution is extremely enjoyable, there is great music, and the two top romantic stars can not touch each other or die. How much do you have more sexual tension? (In fact, I wanted to find a way around this, but c'est to live). It's just a show that it's a pleasure to spend an hour with, and I highly recommend it. There was no other television, and I would like to see more. I caught the flu for a week because it's a good company. Bring it back!
