What a great movie! This reminds of the wonderful classic Disney family movies from the 1960s and 1970s. I was so pleasantly surprised, after the last 20 years of absolute detritus, Disney's live production crews broke out. This movie is an absolute joy. The child's stars were just that; professionals, quality actors. I am most impressed by the quality of this film. Sigourney Weaver was a totally siphophantic * introduces hyperbole here * running into a prison camp for lost guys. Siobhan Fallon was wonderful as the star mother. I'm not going to give up the story here, because there's no point in doing that once again, but the story is great, the direction was extraordinary and the quality of the act was superb! This work reminds you what it is like to be a child without dressing or being too bleak. Scenes removed on DVD have been deleted. They were too harsh for this movie and would have taken a lot of it. While abuse was suggested in the finished product, it was not clearly presented to a certain extent. This was the best one. <br /> <br /> It was an absolutely exciting movie to watch. It becomes a 9/10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
