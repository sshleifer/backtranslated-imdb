This is a wonderful film about a brothel in a fishing village that can be best described with the scenic constellations and direction of Kurosawa's old works, combined with Dostoyevsky's human psychology (O-shin-Sonia Marmeladova) drama Shakespeare and Hans Christian Andersen tragic and cheerful. The scenario is wonderful, the scenes are colorful and beautiful, some scenes are really imprinted in my mind. The plot is interesting and unpredictable - each of the characters is very well developed and interesting - there is also a small action, so if you do not like all the feelings that you also come to your costs -. It's not about the mysterious geysers and pride of Samurai, Bushido, who sheds all of them, but about life, work and the kind of people found everywhere at all times. An admirable and fascinating tribute to Kurosawa is certainly worth seeing.
