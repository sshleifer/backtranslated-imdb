This is the best image about baseball, because Redford hit The Natural on our way. Dennis Quaid and Rachel Griffiths illuminate the screen with a wonderful story and a cast that seemed real enough to attract you into their lives. <br /> <br /> Dream-related - which actually drops, the American dream reigns after 9.11, with a true story about Devil Ray's beginner, Jimmy Morris. The Australian born actress, Rachel Griffiths, plays a native Texan from the West better than a lot of texans I know; and Dennis Quaid was perfection? played as wannabe, gonnabe and humble winner, with as much psychological baggage as the average viewer in the audience. It's real. The chemistry on the screen works. If you like baseball heart heaters, you'll love this movie. Ingredients for American and apple pie were all there. My popcorn has become "a la mode". <br /> <br /> And hey: buy the CD! Music rocks and wears the magnificent story! Synchronizing words and music pushes the story forward exactly as it should, an area that disappoints me more often than not. Critics: I would have given baseball to someone else. But Quaid has something to teach us about character and heart. St. Rita and the nuns were a pleasant decoration, but never found their place in the story to open and close around them. A little long. It's worth every minute in the last analysis. 8 / 10. <br /> <br />
