Made only ten years after the real events, and put into Bunker under the Reichstag, Pabst's film revolves entirely. It is triggered by the sulphurous death awaiting the authors of the World War. I have not seen this in over three decades, but it remains strong in my visual and emotional memory. The characters seem to be waiting to be buried in the cave. Dissemination of the dialogue between two generals: "Is there God?" "If she did, we would not." Shame is not readily available for exhibition or purchase, as it would be interesting to see and compare this film with the documentary about Traudl Junge, "Im Toten Winkel" and "Downfall" with Bruno Ganz.
