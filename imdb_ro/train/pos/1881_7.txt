As playboy beat millionaire Arthur Bach, Dudley Moore is perfect as a man grown in a trap in childhood. As it turned out, the role fits so well with Moore that he also captured him as an actor. Many disappointments soon followed (including the paltry continuation of this film), but this does not diminish the charm or appeal of this image, which is intelligently written and directed. Some of Moore's moon scenes are forced, some parts of the movie are tumultuous, but the song plays so gratifyingly that it's a difficult film to resist. He has a very big heart and gives John Gielgud an Oscar winner, a funny, slightly funny role as Arthur's valet, Hobson; his relationship with Arthur is delicious and has a miraculous relationship. Liza Minnelli (as an interest in love-blue collar) is sassy in a low-key and Moore is brash but abil and lively; he has never shaken Arthur's shadow, but at least we have this top-notch document to cherish. *** from ****
