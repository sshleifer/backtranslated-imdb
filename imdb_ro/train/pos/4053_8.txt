I remember more than Nausicaa in the valley of winds at an age where the tone of the story was too serious for me. Laputa, whose title seems to have affected his release in the US, to avoid confusion with his broad-based public of Hispanic origin, has animated talent for Conan's debut production. In fact, Pazu has Conan's thick bones and immortal vitality - who jumped from a thousand stories that carried his little girl in his arms and landed on his feet, then began to run. This makes him the most animated and enjoyable character to watch. Techie fans in Nausica can be disappointed with flying bugs and retro technology through Laputa - the only exception is the robot. Unlike Princess Mononoke and Wind Valley, the Laputa theme is not directly related to greening. If it has a theme at all, it is anti-war. The importance of living naturally - this is related to the flying castle, it is discussed soon and is not really pursued. On the whole, I now look at the song as being at a junction between feel and good.
