Jake Speed ​​(1986) was a funny parody of Indiana Jones and other adventure films that were popular in the eighties. Wayne Crawford plays Jake Speed, an adventurer who always struggles with the wicked wherever he goes. With the help of his assistant, Desmond Floyd (Dennis Christopher), they travel around the globe in search of action (and decent story lines). The duo meets a young woman named Margaret (Karen Kopins), who was kidnapped by a bad white villain (John Hurt). Can she find him and convince Jake and Desmond to help her rescue her brother? A healthy and cheesy film that does not claim to be something that is not. I have to give him a recommendation. This is whether you enjoy movies that like to have fun and for those who do not take everything at face value. Recommended.
