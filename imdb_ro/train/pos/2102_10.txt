When I sat down to see "Largo Winch", I only expected action scenes and fascinating cars. When I got up, I saw both of them; much more. <br /> <br /> Karl Roden was not finally the antagonist in a movie to get started. Kristin Scott Thomas played well, but in my opinion, the two real stars were Tomer Sisley and Miki Manojlovic, both acting superbly. In Radivoje Bukvic played Goran well. Mixed linguistics has brought a beautiful color to the film, but I understand why people would get bored of it. The scenery in Hong Kong and, in particular, the stunning Croatian seaside amazed me so much and I just wanted to take my eyes off the screen when Largo entered the incredibly beautiful island. Rolls Royce Phantom; Mercedes S500 and BMW 7; if someone loves expensive limousine cars; this is their movie. It is also a film for those who love sequences of action, good acting, extreme beauty sceneries, and above all, a fast and well written action movie with a dazzling struggle and a close inner drama. /> My vote, as it blew a gloomy day, is: 10/10
