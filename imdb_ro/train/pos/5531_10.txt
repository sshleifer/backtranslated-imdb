Watching "Fox and the Baby" was a poisonous experience. The lush images, the integrity of the point of view and the total beauty of the decor and the characters left me in a month of pleasure. The land is uncomplicated. Simple to deceive. In the container of that simplicity opens a world that draws you and leaves you breathless. I laughed. I cried. I learned. This is a movie in which you can trust yourself - let it go. I dare say it is an act of love for any innocent heart. It reaches the heart of the spectator - of any age - and reveals the world through new eyes, as if seen from the heart. Adi Da Samraj once said that true Art attracts the viewer beyond the point of view of ecstatic participation in Reality. I feel like I was privileged to see - not to participate in - this film, a true artwork.
