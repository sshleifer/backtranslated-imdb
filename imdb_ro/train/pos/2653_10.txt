Kubrick proved his brilliance again, now in a horror-suspense film, based on Stephen King's book, titled in the same way. Jack Torrance is a 40-year-old man, married, with a child and with past trouble and alcoholism. Overlook Hotel in Colorado suspends service in winter due to extreme weather and there is a well-paid job for the person in charge of the facilities in these five months; and Torrance, who wanted to become a writer, found it perfect. But the manager advised Torrance about the loneliness of this place in the winter, potentially dangerous, and told him that a pastor of the past became crazy and killed his family. Even before he got there, his son Danny, who has a kind of imaginary friend who brightens him in the future (the glow), knew that the place was not good and he did not want to go. Once they settled into the hotel, things started well, but in a month, Jack began to behave strangely, irritably and depressed. At this point, we know something will happen, but we do not know when and how. Fearful things happen, such as the appearance of two twin girls talking to Danny and someone who violently attacked him. They are not alone in this place. Later Jack began to see other people and immediately felt good to them as if he were his family; including the famous psychotic caregiver Delbert Grady. Grady tells Torrance that he has to kill his family because they're "intruders" in the hotel. By following this order, Jack went for the lens and many of the most scary things I've ever seen happened here. The end is spectacular and the spectators will remain interested and shocked until the last minute.
