Family Wife Dan Burns (Steve Carell) writes the column "Dan in Real Life," giving advice for families in the New Jersey Standard and raising only his three daughters. Jane (Allison Pill), the oldest, has just gotten his driving license, but Dan does not allow him to drive; Cara (Brittany Robertson) has a passion for her high school martyr Marty; and young Lily (Marlene Lawston) loses her mother. When Dan and his daughters travel to Rhode Island for a family reunion, she meets Marie (Juliette Binoche) in a bookstore and spend hours talking to each other. They feel attracted to each other, but Marie gets a phone call and leaves Dan, giving him his first phone number. Dan immediately falls in love with Marie, but when she returns home to her father, she discovers that Marie is the girlfriend of his brother-in-law Mitch Burns (Dane Cook), who is also in love with her. Over the weekend, the attraction between the Dan and Marie stinging grows and needs to make a decision. "Dan in Real Life" is a great surprise and an exciting movie with comedy, romance and drama. The chemistry of the gorgeous Juliette Binoche and Steve Carell is great and it is very easy to know why everyone loves Marie. Trio Allison Pill, Brittany Robertson and Marlene Lawston are fantastic and their characters are responsible for some of the best moments of this story. The script is wonderful, and the performances of talented actors and actors are stunning, with a realistic behavior of a family meeting. Follow the advice from Dan's column and plan to be surprised by the Burns family meeting. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Me, Irm√£o e Nossa Namorada" ("My brother and my friend")
