This is not as violent as I expected, making violent scenes seem even more brutal and more effective. There are a lot of twists and turns and back stabbed and double crossing all the way through the movie that makes it hard to know who is a part a certain character is on. Plot is peace with some good dialogue and character development and provides an interesting view of Triad tape is the next. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Violence when it comes is brutal, not weapons or martial art scenes with special effects, this is credible in the face of violence and for all the dialogue you never allow to forget that the triad is a criminal organization violence. <br /> <br /> The end is surprising, but completely consistent and credible.
