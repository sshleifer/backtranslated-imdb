This movie is great. What separates him from the sci-fi for the next 50 years is that the alien has no features, no face, no eyes, no, but can not be killed. I especially like the idea that this movie does not take place in a few days, takes place in one night, which is supposed to happen until midnight. It's also scary that once the blob reaches you, you can not get it down. you are stuck in it because it separates you from the meat and slowly depletes your body. My favorite 50-year-old SF film, and sometimes considered a quintessential one. I see why this made Steve McQueen come back. All this and a captivating theme song! How can you be wrong?
