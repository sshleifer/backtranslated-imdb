This is David Zucker's only film that does not spit nothing of the first of its kind. The funniest 98th movie with Night at the Roxbury right behind. But I did not think that theres something about Mary was funny, so it does not matter, except for the franc and beans that she did. Do not listen to critics, especially Roger Ebert, he does not know that solid fun looks at his comments. Whatever you see, you will not be disapproved
