Ogre is a film made for television in Italy and was not meant to be a continuation of the Demons, as Lamberto Bava even mentions in the interview on the Sheirk Show DVD, but was named Demons III to be part of the Demons series. The music of Demons and Demons 2 has been rock music for 80 years, while music is more terrifying and while the first two were terrible horror Demons III: Ogre is an architectural horror, so the way Demons III is not a proper continuation of the Demons, like this movie. The music is creepy and adds a tone to the castle where the film lies, The Ogre is another thing that I like the movie. There are two other films that are ranked as Demons III and which are Demons Black (Demons 3) and Church (Demons 3). Demons III: Ogre is a good movie, as long as you do not compare it to Demons and Demons 2.
