I have no idea how IMDb sorts my reviews, but I know that, as is often the case on Amazon.com, there is a remarkable number of very negative reviews for this movie that repeats the same, almost obscure speech points, almost verbatim. A campaign? Only IMDb knows. As for this movie: it's good. It's a funny, cute and very simple movie. It's been over a decade since I worked in Brooklyn, I lived in Queens and I visited relatives in the South Bronx. But I found nothing unnecessary or exploitative about these children. Grandma is a bizarre character? Yes. Does the dialogue and the plot recognize this? Yes, fortunately, they do. Are other films set in SES and featuring Dominican / Puerto Rican girls possible? Chicken bet. What makes this movie a crime? as would suggest some of the comments (in my eyes, astroturf)? Hard. Let a thousand plastic flowers bloom. It's better than any episode of Degrassi JR. Great or Degrassi High. It is a comparison, but I have never had that and are at the bottom, by the humiliation of this film of spirit and purpose. <br /> <br /> That said, I would love to know backstory beyond all that! :-D
