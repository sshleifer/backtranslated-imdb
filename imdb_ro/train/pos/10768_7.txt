I saw this age when I was younger and could never remember the title until one day I ran through John Candy's credits on IMDb and noticed an entry called "Once upon a Crime ... ". Something called a bell and I clicked on it, and after reading the plot summary it brought back a lot of memories. I found it aged quite well, despite the fact that it is not a "big" comedy. It is, however, quite pleasant and it is a good riff on a Hitchcock formula of wrong identity and global emotions. The film has a large cast of characters, including an American couple who finds a female dog during a holiday in Europe and decides to return it for a reward - just to find his dead body on arrival. From there, the plot becomes more crazy and more forceful, and they go on escape after the police think they are criminals. A kind of mix between "Mad Mad Mad Mad Mad" and an easier hitchcock feature, directed by Eugene Levy and managed to make good friends - such as John Candy - play his role . The film is largely committed due to its distribution, and the ending has a little funny move that is not totally unpredictable, but it's also kind of unexpected.
