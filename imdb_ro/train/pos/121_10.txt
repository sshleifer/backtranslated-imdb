Critics must review what they classify as a quality film. I think critics have seen too many action movies and gave up the Matrix movie style. Europe is a breath of fresh air, a film with so many layers that a view is not enough to understand or appreciate this remarkable film. Lars von Trier shows that old film styles can produce great cinema and create dramas and tensions. The back projection effect he uses during the movie sparks and improves the characters and the focus of the conversation they have. Other effects she uses, such as black and white in a scene just like Hitchcock, and the red-faced face attracts attention and enhances the drama and significance of the scene. The commentary is superb and has a hypnotic effect, retaining the emphasis on the central characters in the scene and there actions. We could talk about the effects more, but I think you would all agree that pushing this movie into a category of it, and even exalting the dramas drama drama. A movie you buy, if you do not already have one and see if you did not. 10/10 Do not miss this artistic noir movie from one of the great film directors.
