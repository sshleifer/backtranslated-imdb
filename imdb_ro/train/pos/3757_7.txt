Like a bunch of boys at school, we have to offer this with a big finger. Even Grim Ripper made us smile. These two extraterrestrial things made me laugh, Bill and Ted were the most stupid and yet funniest in the whole movie. This is much better than the first one. And yet, for some reason, I feel she's missing something. Something big. Something important. He made a better home and friend. No, I'd say some better offenders. Use clones instead of robots. I gave them 7 out of 10 because of these two robotic doses. Grim Ripper, do not be scared he's not kind, it's funny. When he fell from heaven, we divided an intestine. I'm not sure about strangers. Where are they? Scientists? No way.
