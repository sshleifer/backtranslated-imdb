Even if you are not a big fan of Ramones, Rock 'n' Roll High School is * still * the biggest rock 'n' roll ever made. Why? Because under all campaigns, respect, contempt and adolescents are treated with fear that they often (and justifiably) feel in the boring, stupid, fascist world of adults. This final scene is one of the most glorious and uplifting scenes for a movie I've ever seen. "My eyes saw the glory ..." Rock 'n' roll!
