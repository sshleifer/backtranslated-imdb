Religious bigotry is everywhere. Australia is not immune to it. One dingo pulled a child and the mother was tried and sent to prison for "killing" her own baby. I do not want to ruin the story, but you need to know the basics before getting to your knees in what caused this woman to find herself inside a prison. Buy or rent the movie and discover how much human hatred of those who are different continues to grow around the world. This is a very moving motion picture with a terrible adventure of actors. Meryl Streep (with his accentuated Aussie accent) and Sam Neill, whose accent is his native pronunciation, are remarkable. Those with supporting roles are also pretty good. <br /> <br /> You will remember this movie for many years.
