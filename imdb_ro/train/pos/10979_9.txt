This documentary follows the lives of Big and Little Edie Beale, mother and daughter, who lived as reclusions in their family mansion in East Hampton, NY from the mid-1950s to the late 1970s. Until the directors find them, the manor breaks down, and the women, 78 and the other 56, share a frightening room. Old Edie Beale is aunt Jackie Kennedy Onassis, and the youngest is her first cousin. The women were initially evicted from the house due to their descending condition, but Jackie sent them money for repairs in order to stay there. Sometimes this movie may seem workable because no woman seems to be the best of mental health, but at other times, the movie is hard to look away. Little Edie blames her mother for her current condition, and her mother opposes the fact that Edie will never be the success she believed to be. "Little" Edie seems often caught in the past, focusing on the choices he made decades ago, and loves the presentation of pictures from his youth, where he was a beautiful beginner. Her mother seems to resemble her fate, to live the rest of her life in terrible conditions. There are clear signs of a glamorous life, both to women and leaders, from photos showing a happy family to the bigger portrait of the older Edie near her bed. From what we see about the house, most of the rooms in it are empty, the walls crack and collapse, and the "little" Edie leaves the kitchen in the attic for the coffins to be celebrated. And, of course, there are many cats running around. In his center, this documentary is incredibly sad. While no woman seems particularly depressed by their lives, the curse they live in is absolutely terrible. It is not particularly clear if there is water in the house and you have the impression that they were essentially abandoned by their family. However, as a documentary, the movie is a wonder to look at, and is highly recommended.
