I started to watch the movie waiting for nothing, just another movie to watch, but for the first twenty minutes, the artwork and the main character, which is enigmatic, does not talk much, really put me in this movie. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie very much, it was dark, it was handsome and very emotional. It's a little slow, but the immersion has been completed. The director was wonderful by letting us know bits through a story that led to Joey's conviction and his life behind the bars. The music was very big and very well embedded in the scene. The end was unexpected, with a twist I did not see. It's not the kind of movie we often see.
