This is a military drama I love! Tom Berenger playing military assassin Thomas Beckett. This sailor is not a nonsense in front of you, and no question asked a kind of person doing the job. There you have Billy Zane ("The Phantom" and others) who plays Richard Miller, a former SWAT format D.C., working for the government and taking orders only from them. Who needs a bureaucrat? I do not know! When these two are associated, the sparks should fly. And how. However, Beckett teaches the young bureaucrat how it works. When the other sniper strikes, it's intelligence, intelligence, cat vs. mouse, pistol against gun. And when the sniper is caught, it's Miller's duty to put politics aside and save him. Whoever needs politics when you are a professional like Beckett, has taken orders from none other than himself, is playing by rules and not in the book, and mutual respect is brought in despite of politics. The movie was a direct shot. Look. Rating 4 out of 5 stars.
