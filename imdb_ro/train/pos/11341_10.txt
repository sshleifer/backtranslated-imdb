This can be just the most nostalgic journey back in time and time when childhood begins a journey to reminiscences back and forth, back and forth, up and down and everywhere. Boy Jimmy, H.R. Puffinstuff, Dr.Blinky, Cling & Clang, Leu Ludicrous, and even evil Witchie Poo through and through. The last day of Lidsville's inspiration, "The Brady Kids Saturday Morning Preview Special", Sigmund & The Monsters Sea, and Land of the Lost, both new and old, are what this show has overtaken the difference, as well as Show- Donny & Marie, Brady Bunch Hour Variety aka Brady Bunch Hour and even Paul Lynde Halloween Special. Perhaps even other things between & Beyond the Buck continue to go further and even beyond expectations and unexpected limits. Now that we've updated in March, 06 we know that Jack Wild has gone and so makes it even more symbolic to become truly nostalgic. Including now in August of '06, both when guest Jack Wild plays as himself on Sigmund and The Sea Monsters as well as when in a last episode HRPuffinstuff does too and remember all the other the nostalgic journeys of all Syd & Marty Kroft characters, and the HRPuffinstuff Goodtime Club, the Donny and Marie Show, Brady Bunch's Variety Hour, The Hour of Bunch of the Brady, etc. True, Stephen "Steve" G.
