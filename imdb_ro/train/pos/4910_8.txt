This very good movie crackles with tension. The stakes are, of course, raised - police and Dr. Widmark, the public health doctor, will take into account criminals who do not know that they give rise to an epidemic before a large-scale epidemic broke out? But smaller items of land put tensions in every scene - between Widmark and the police captain, between the bad guys playing Palance and Mostel, between Palance and a man suffering from a plague that Palance mistakenly believes to be the subject of a smuggling criminal prosecution with some valuable goods between Widmark and his wife, and with the public's question whether it is better served by the public, informing them of the danger or concealment of the situation to avoid panic on a large scale. The film is beautifully shot by Kazan in an extraordinary well-choreographed film that takes place in New Orleans and ends in an amazing climax, where Palance runs like a rat from his pursuers through docks and warehouses of the city . The commentary is superb, perhaps the best one I've ever heard, covering cinematography, framing and enlightening photographs, production design, casting small, nonprofessional actors, plotting irony and parallels, such as an insightful seminar on film techniques from the 1950s and the noir movie in general. Watch it once to enjoy the movie yourself and, if you're interested in shooting, a second time with the comment you should teach.
