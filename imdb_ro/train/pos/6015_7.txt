In the early 1970s, many of us who hugely embraced hippy / acid / alternative culture, realized that mass society would not change as we thought. For me this film has defined the tension "now what?" that many of the people I knew then. Do we move towards the commonplace and create our own vision of utopia or radicalize and push change? From unnecessary gestures to the police, radical rhetoric, Pink Floyd's music, love - making explosive images in the desert - so much is there. It captures a significant moment in time.
