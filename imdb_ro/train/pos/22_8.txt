If you advance through horrible singing, you will find a classic fairy tale underneath. Christopher Walken is very humorous and surprisingly good in acting. His acting style behaves well for the best boys in boots. The other actors are good for their parts. We have not found any of those who act terribly foolish or weird. The Emperor, in particular, seems a real dune, though, and I wonder if it should be. I do not remember the original story. The special effects are typical of the eighties, but at least they are not too fake as some of the computer-generated tariffs we see today. Generally, I recommend this movie for children and adults who are a heart-hearted child.
