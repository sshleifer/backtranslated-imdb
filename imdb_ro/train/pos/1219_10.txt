The second Care Bears movie is far better than its predecessor. It has a deeper plot, a better evolution of the characters, and the songs (especially the closing song) are appealing and appealing. Of course the movie tends to bear the worry, but to come, it is a beard care film. This movie is a wonderful picture to show children, because it focuses on friendship, love and, again, caring. Not to mention Bears Which are too adorable!
