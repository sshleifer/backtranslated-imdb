A short comedy OAM GANG. The gang forces Spanky to pursue his younger brothers. Caring for these BABIES FORGOTTEN turns out to be quite a chore, leaving the little bull without any choice but to come up with ingenious solutions to the problem of children ... Spanky is in his glory in this little hilarious film, certainly the best. Highlight: Spanky tells the plot of TARZAN, which he recently saw at the audience of children. Movie people will recognize Billy Gilbert's voice in the radio drama.
