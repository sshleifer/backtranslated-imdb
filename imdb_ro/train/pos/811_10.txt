When I think of the Jedi Return, I think the epic. Yeah, Ewoki were there and what? I'm an interesting film (not to mention that they are like Vietcong, who also managed to take over a technological advanced army with primitive acts). The Jedi is definitely darker than the rest of the movies. Emperor Palpatine (portrayed by the amazing theater actor Ian McDiarmid) was one of the best parts of the film. Palpatine is so bad and vicious, Vader looks like Mr. Rogers compared to him. Speaking of Darth Vader, what a wonderful end to such an iconic character. Vader is truly a modern Greek tragedy and I think people can now understand and appreciate this especially after the outbreak of the Sith Revenge. His redemption at the end is moving and really brings a happy but sweet feeling. The best part of course was the special effects. It's amazing how a movie from the early eighties can still be the test of time with its graphics. The scenes from Jabba's palace (Leia looks amazing in metal bikinis) and, of course, the epic battle in three directions at the end of the year are still stunning. In all the emotional moments of the Jedi (primarily between Luke Vader and Palpatine and when Luke reveals Leia's truth) and incredible special effects is a fitting end to one of the most beloved franchises in the history of cinema.
