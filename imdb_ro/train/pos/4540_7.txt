This film calls Jay Leno as a Detroit policeman, Tony Costas and Pat Morita, as a Tokyo cop sent to Detroit to recover a stolen prototype of a car engine. A Japanese man traveled to Detroit, hoping to sell it to a car company backed by a man named Derrick Jarryd. Unfortunately for him the men who had to negotiate this business killed him and took the prototype. An angry Derek Jarryd tries to distance himself from Phillip Madras, who led the people. But Madras (played by Chris Sarandon) has nothing of this and threatens Jarryd to force him to continue his partnership. Meanwhile, in the same junk yard, where the Japanese man had been killed, a friend of Tony Costas was killed by the same men. Tony's boyfriend had seen the garbage bay. Tony decides to find the killer against his superior's order. Tony is in the robbery, while obviously homicide should investigate the case. While Tony is investigating the murder the Japanese policeman is leading and is facing a mistake, he arrests him. Eventually, they get to work together on the case. They make a strange pair and there are some really funny parts, as well as some ridiculous scenes, such as Pat Morita, jumping and kicking even through a windscreen of a moving machine and hitting Madras in the head. But it ends up being a nice movie of a friendly policeman, at least in my opinion. Jay Leno is not an actor, but is full of role, and Pat Morita is also good. However, they make for one of the less likely policemen enemies in an action movie. If you liked cops, 80 movie cheese or you want to see Jay Leno as an actor, then I recommend this movie.
