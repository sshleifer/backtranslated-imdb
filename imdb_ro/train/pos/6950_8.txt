On the day of the California Presidential Hall between midnight and 1:00 pm, spy Victor Rovner sends a message from Kuala Lumpur to the US. Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, federal agent Jack Bauer returned home and had trouble at home with his teenage daughter Kimberly, who accused her mother Teri of taking Jack out of the house. Teri and Jack decide to have a serious conversation with Kim and find out that the girl ran home. While trying to solve the internal problem, Jack is called to the counter-terrorism unit by his colleague, Nina Myers, for a meeting with their boss, Richard Walsh, which reveals a threat to Senator David Palmer's life, find a shooter. Later, Walsh has a private conversation with Jack and says there's an agency conspiracy against David Palmer, and he tells Jack to find the conspirators. When a plane explodes over the Mojave desert, Jack has a further problem to worry about. The first episode of "24" is a promising start of a successful series, introducing Jack Bauer. This is the first time I watched this show and I confess that I liked what I saw: a complex and dramatic story with multiple and realistic characters. Kiefer Sutherland is perfect in the role of a family man and a trusted agent dealing with three difficult assignments at the same time: finding a killer to protect an important politician; find a traitor in his agency; and find his teenage daughter confronted with problems trying to save her marriage. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "12:00"
