The true story (which took place in Kansas in 1959) of a murder (Perry and Dick, two former convicts who entered a remote house on a rainy night to steal and kill all the people they met). Richard Brooks directed Capote's book about the disturbances that led these children to murder (are the natural killers?). The crime scene is very brutal and haunted because of the lack of senses and the reasons for what we were witnessing. The impressive black and white cinema from Conrad Hall, an excellent country score and road music from Quincy Jones, stunning performances in two main roles by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson and for the first time in a movie, a sad comment about capital punishment in recent times. Jones, Hall and Brooks (as adapted and directed screenwriter) are nominated for the Oscar. Gripping, superbly directed and frightening, one of the best movies of this decade
