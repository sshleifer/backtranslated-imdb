I put this on my TIVO for a rainy day because of distribution, some really hard working people in the industry, and when I finally saw I was not disappointed. This film has some Altman-like flavor (he is mentioned in the final credits as a "thank you" person) using seemingly independent independent parallel lines that intersect as the movie approaches the climax. Macy is pure, clean and honest as a man who does not seem to escape his "destiny," Sutherland plays and portrays how few can, Neve adds splash in a deliberately trimmed environment, adds Tracy Ullman, Barbara Bain Impossible on TV? ) Not to mention John Ritter and have all the ingredients for a good FILM. The script is unclear, the dialogue is free of clich√© and thoughtfulness (especially between Macy and David Dorfman). Suspend faith and rejoice, this time is really well spent.
