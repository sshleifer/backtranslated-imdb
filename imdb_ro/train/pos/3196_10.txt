This movie is amazing for many reasons. Harris takes a very strange documentary and turns it into a relevant social commentary. Groovin 'Gary is a small child in the city who is well-liked for his many impersonalists. When he decides to play Olivia Newton John in a local talent show (for which he is very passionate), Gary's actions show that he is in contradiction with the conservative social environment he lives in. This leads them to make various justifications for his actions, so that people do not believe that he is, in fact, a transvestite or another such social defeat. In the second installment, Harris exploits the struggle between Gary and Beaver in a new attempt to make a narrative from the original documentary. The third and final cut of the trilogy is truly amazing for Harris's extreme sensitivity to the subject. Unlike the second installment, "Orkly Kid" shows Gary as a really troubled person. He strives to gain acceptance in his own community without any result. His secret passion for clothing such as Olivia Newton John distances him even more than people who already see him as a social people. The film is illustrated so realistically that, like reality, it spreads in many reactions. Surely we can see Gary as a ridiculously pathetic character, but he can also identify himself as a deceiver.
