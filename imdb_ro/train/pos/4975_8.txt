By God, it's been a long time since I saw that. Probably about 18 years ago? The film tells us (everything about the human blood and the circulatory system). Very professional put together - Disney-style animation plus human actors - was directed by Frank Capra for his sake of stains! Some kind of overburdening. I wonder if the very high production value is worth what information about a movie about a human body is about? But the boy will follow these children: even now I clearly remember that Dr. Baxter was challenged by Hemo himself to name what common material resembles the most with human blood, to which the doctor immediately responds to "water of great".
