Running Man is one of those movies that, if overwhelmed, would become boring and depressing even. My advice is to watch it once or twice a year with a few colleagues and a few drinks. </> The current climate of TV dominance and capitalism in society really works as a revisionist social commentary after the 1980s boom. Forget it! There are other brilliant and better reasons to watch this movie. Schwarzenegger is on the first position as Ben "Richards Butcher" Richards, and the inclusion of a Bond-gasket was completely inspired - they are truly legendary-end-dary (with Killian in a big room) . Stalkers design is authentic American, and mirrors the characters seen on TV show "Gladiators", and WWE, too. The Buzz-saw will cease to cool all viewers at midnight (as a footnote, why is his death remarkable as being particularly worrying in what is apparently an optimistic shareholder with a bitter sense of humor? ) <br /> Jesse Venturer and Sven Ole Thorssen are great as a support fly (and are Arnies shoots in real life), and even took Mick Fleetwood in it too! What could you ask for? <br /> <br /> I highly recommend Running Man if you are looking for a great action action action with a glossy finish and some great characters. Just do not expect education from me (at least at the surface value). Quality, I really love her bloody. And you'll be too little if it's not you. 7/10
