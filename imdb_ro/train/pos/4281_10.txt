One of my favorite "domestic" movies. I do not know if there is someone in our country who did not see this movie! It's amusing and sad at times ... I do not know how this movie was accepted around the world (who had the opportunity to watch it) because you need to know some moments in Serbian history and Serb character in the first half of the century XX, to understand! But, as I see here, there is someone in Canada who has pursued ... and I liked it. I think I'll try to put all the good quotes in the movie on this site, but first to find out how to do this ... Race.
