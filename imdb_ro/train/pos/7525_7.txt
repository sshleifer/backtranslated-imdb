Bettie Page was a repressed icon of the 1950s when it represented sexual freedom, which was still ten years old, but largely in the hopes and dreams of adolescents and young adults. Gretchen Mol makes a great job of portraying the scandalous Bettie, who was a small girl with ambitions that act as well as a great body. Her acting career did not go anywhere, but her body brought her to the top of fame in an accepted margin field. With a colorful black and white interlude with culinary interludes, when it comes out of New York's exploitation world, HBO has good production values ​​and a very credible distribution. The problem is that it's quite emotionally flat. It's hard to form an attachment to the character, since Bettie is portrayed as a rather superficial and naive person, given the business they are in. Governmental self-broadcasting investigations are long on the screen, which slows the film to the end. But it certainly deserves to look for the history of the weather and to see the cumbersome government repression that was a feature of the fifties. 7/10
