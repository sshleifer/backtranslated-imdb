As you probably already know, Jess Franco is a prolific type. He made hundreds of hundreds of movies, many of which are nonsense. However, he managed to slip into occasional quality work between all assembly line operations. "Succubus" is not the best piece of work ("Dr. Z Zabol" or "Vampyros Lesbos"), but he has many of his brands that make it a must for anyone interested in diving in his big catalog. It combines eroticism (alternating between showing full-frontal nudity and leaving things left to imagination) and perfect surrealism. This is a very dreamy film full of wonderful atmosphere. I especially liked constant appointment. Despite the fact that it came as incredibly pretentious, fun to hear all the influences of Franco. However, there are many users who do not like "Succubus" and can see where they come from. He was walking, but I can handle it. More incoherent is more problematic. The scenario here was obviously rushed, and in five minutes in the movie, I had absolutely no idea what was happening (and never happened). Those who want a substance with their style look elsewhere. Also, if it is a horror film, it will never become scary or even suspense. However, I was distracted by all the psychedelic wisdom that I did not think too much about these major failures. (7/10)
