I saw yesterday the new and edited version and I loved it. Then I went home and watched it with subtitles and liked it. I'm ready to look at her again. Am I a sucker for gentle secret identity and what could be easier to handle than a pacifist librarian? Scenes revealing the superpowers of his friends or absent, forgetting to be gentle, are my favorites. Of course, martial arts are amazing. I can not really say about them if you are familiar with the HK style. However, if you are not ... we stopped playing briefly and Walker, Texas Ranger was on. I noticed that after each strike there was a cut. Not in the black mask. <br /> <br />
