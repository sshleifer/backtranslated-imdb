This is a cartoon that should have won the Cousin of the Country. Visibly well made and much more fun and memorable. It's worth watching just for music! Although there are elements that will undoubtedly crush the sensibilities of such days, the cartoon has to get a little perspective. He is over sixty years old and is, after all, just a cartoon. I'm off and if I'm as hyper-sensitive as people who look at things like this cartoon and get the shine, I would have been long frozen in a fetal position and gone. Sometimes you have to relieve yourself, turn your head back and float! Cartoon celebrity cartoons were common in the 1930s and 1940s and were almost never terribly flattering. Bing Crosby would have hated him when he was used more than once. *SIGH*
