I have to admit that I am a big fan of South Park and we expect Basketball to be fun, but nowhere as good as it turned out to be! I think that's what happens when you mix David Zucker, Matt Stone and Trey Parker together. This movie has so much value to resume and never bothers to take seriously. The humor of stick style, blended with Stone and Parker, works perfectly. The type of humor present in basketball was not popular at the time of its release and if it came out today it would be a blow. Do not worry trying to be critical, leave your brain at the door and wait for endless laughter. Recommended for all who have a good sense of humor.
