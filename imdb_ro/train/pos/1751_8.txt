A 40-year-old virgin is about Andy Stitzer, a forty-year-old man working in an e-shop, who does not have much social life and is very strange about women. Some of his colleagues in the store invite him one evening and discover that Andy is still a virgin, so he intends to help him lose his virginity. One day in Andy's store, she meets a woman named Trish, who gives her the phone number and eventually Andy, she works pretty courageously to go to a meeting with her and they really start to love, but Andy is still very strange when it comes to sex and he has to tell Trish much about his embarrassment if he can really get the courage to tell him before things get weird. The 40-year-old virgin has a good direction, a good script, good comedic performances of the entire distributor, good cinema and good film editing. The film collaborates with Steve Carell, who has a very good comedy performance, and his writing for the film is very good. I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie. It is sweet, fun, fun, fun, pleasant, intelligent, good and lively. This movie is as good as this year's wedding, and both of these are two of the best comedies we've seen for some time. The 40-year-old Virgo has truly a lot of talents and is used and works as a comedy and love story and is sweet and fun. One of the biggest surprises and one of the best comedies of the year.
