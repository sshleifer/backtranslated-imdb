In Paris, the shy and uncertain office, Trelkovsky (Roman Polanski), rents an old flat without a bath, if the former tenant Egyptologist Simone Choule (Dominique Poulange) has committed suicide. The unfriendly goalkeeper (Shelley Winters) and the tough owner, Mr. Zy (Melvyn Douglas), set strict rules of conduct, and Trekovsky feels rioted by his neighbors. Meanwhile, she visits Simone in the hospital and is friends with her friend, Stella (Isabelle Adjani). After Simone's death, Trekovsky feels obsessed with her and believes that the owner and his neighbors plan a scheme to force him to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> Strange "Le Locataire" is a disturbing and scary story about paranoia and illusion. The story and the process of madness and the loss of lonely Trelkovsky's identity develop slowly in a nightmare atmosphere in the terrible location of his apartment, and what really happens is totally unpredictable. The performances are wonderful, and Isabelle Adjani is extremely beautiful. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Inquilino" ("The Tenant")
