The film looked like a walk for the "Immoral Study". Most likely I did not get involved too much in the ardent need of the female artist to immortalize male nudes and therefore all that is about "Who now drew this penis!" it seemed a bit free. The dialogues in this movie are pretty awful, though this movie has visual moments. I almost got tired when Tassi started painting a mental picture, but then the film went back to the penis. Highly recommended to those who have never seen it from time to time.
