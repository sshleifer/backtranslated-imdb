This film is forbidden in almost any foreign country I can think of. The Japanese people (?) Who played in this must have been really desperate for a job or we are just friends. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They use torture (forcing her to listen to a static sound for over 20 hours! It does not sound so bad, but it can make you nuts). They throw courage (perhaps from an animal) to her while she's beaten her, and she angrily when she wakes up. And who can forget the ultimate grandeur The biggest torture we've ever seen! If you have not heard of these movies and watch, without knowing it is a simulated movie of snuff, you will think it is! (just ask Charlie Sheen) This is guaranteed to scare people and make some sick! Like I said purely underground. Check him out if you are a fan of underground terror or a foreign gore. If you do not recommend reading the series carefully before watching! From the gore look, shock and creativity becomes a 10, but from the story and all those things is 1. A classic underground ... My final rating is a 8/10 <br /> <br / >
