Here is an innovative television drama; which easily combines a compelling story, shining in each episode the development of character, humor, romance and drama. Here is a show that plays his own song, whether the audience chooses to follow or not. How many other television shows these days change so boldly in the tone from one season to another? If most of the other top performers on this site have found a working formula that brings viewers and dollars and sticks to that formula (Prison Break, 24, and Disperate Housewives come to mind) - LOST takes another route where, even after the playlist and the winning formula have been achieved, the executive producer team is brave enough to reinvent the show to meet its higher story goal. Here LOST differs from ordinary television. This is so defying for conventional television. That is why LOST is one of the most creative and innovative creations of modern television. Watch the naysayers - LOST is, has been, and will always be, there to calm down his cult after the first and the next broad public. But it is proof of his inventiveness that he has won a fan base that is composed of the best in both audiences.
