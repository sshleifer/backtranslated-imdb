When I first saw the movie, it was a long time ago on VHS-Video. I liked this movie because it was fun and exciting. A few years ago I saw another movie, called: * Andy Colby's Incredible Adventure * In this movie were included parts of * Wizards of the Kingdom lost *. They called this movie "KOR the conquerer". I started searching for "KOR" -Movie for many years, because I wanted to see the full movie, not just the songs used in * Andy Colby * -Movie. No store rented this movie Kor-Movie and no store knew this movie. For many years I've looked at the old VHS tapes I had at home and wonder ... I had this movie for many years, but the movie had a different title because in Germany it has 3 or 4 titles. So I was happy to find this box at home and this time I had a lot more time to follow KOR Conqueror again. The music is wonderful during the movie with the hole, but the best part of the shooting in combination with the music is this moment, when KOR walks through the green field. Background music had a kind of magic. I love Bo Svenson and also the boy who played Simon in the movie. They both did their job very well. Manfred Kraatz, Germany, 26.10.2004.
