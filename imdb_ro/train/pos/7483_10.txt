Vanilla Sky is a 1997 remake of 1997's "Open Your Eyes" by Abre Los Ojos. And in my opinion, a much more human and emotional version. Tom Cruise interprets David Aames, a selfish Egoist who accepts the feelings of others and thinks only of himself. Jason Lee plays Brian Shelby, David's best and in many ways just a friend. Penelope Cruz plays Sofia Serrano, Brian's girlfriend, who accompanies him at David's birthday party. Cameron Diaz plays Julie Gianni, David's occasional friend. Kurt Russell plays the role of Dr. Curtis McCabe, a psychologist interviewing David. All their interactions, as well as their consequences, make Vanilla Sky one of the most emotional and complex thrillers ever made. I will not explain the plot anymore, because it is much more convincing, the less you know. Ignore all people who call this movie too confusing to follow. If you pay attention, you will not be confused. The film is very complex but not confusing. And, in my opinion, one of the best movies ever made.
