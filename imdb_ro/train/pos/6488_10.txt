War is hell. But this documentary of the Second World War is heaven. Not only is this series an amazing story, almost exhaustive about the Second World War, it is a poetic masterpiece said clearly and gorgeously by Laurence Olivier. /> <br /> This documentary series defines the genre. It's a long time, no doubt, but you will enjoy everything and want to go back and forth. (I have the DVD series and probably watch the series three times a year). True, this is a bit impeccable shooting. Besides Olivier, the best part of the series is listening to the veterans telling their stories; whether it's a real battle or finding a pig at the butcher's shop, so they can have something delicious for dinner. I'm going to look at her right now (again, ...).
