To be honest, I had to go see this movie back, I did not expect that, but hey, I was not wrong, I had a good time. I would say that this film is a kind of fresh breeze in spite of some facts that they tried to modernize on Nancy Drew, but that made me remember these youth films from the 60-70s in Europe and Quebec, where they succeed in making children interact with adults. In this case, a 16-year-old teenager tries to do justice trying to solve a mystery about the death of an actress who died 25 years ago. Anyway, because her dad had business in Hollywood, why not rent a house with a mystery behind the doors? Well, at least Emma Roberts does a good job here. Just like the kid, who was initially naive to support Nancy's sister's fury, but at the end he found Nancy cool enough to stay with her, even with her stuff ... <br / > The rest of the support distribution is great and was happy to see Rachael Leigh Cook in a different role this time: a single mother (she did it in Family Rescue, but this time , she plays a mature woman ...) Anyway, do not dump this, it's fun!
