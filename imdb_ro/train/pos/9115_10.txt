The idea takes a very short film with lots of information. Interesting, fun and let the viewer want more. The producer produced a short film of excellent quality that can not be compared to any other short film I have ever seen. We rated this movie at the highest possible rating. I also recommend that it be presented to office managers and business people in any facility. What comes out of it is that people with ideas are not obedient, their voice is never heard. It is a lesson to be learned by any office that wants to go further. I hope the product will produce a second part of this "idea". I look forward to seeing the sequence. Once again, we congratulate the media in Halaqah for producing a film of excellence and quality with a lesson in mind.
