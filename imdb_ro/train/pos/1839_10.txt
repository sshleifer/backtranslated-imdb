An excellent movie about two cops who love the same woman. One of the police (Périer) murdered her, but all the evidence seems to incriminate the other (Montand). The madman Montand does not know who the other lover might have killed, and Périer does not even know that Montand has a girlfriend adventure. Montand must find the killer absolutely ... and the end is over! Highly recommended.
