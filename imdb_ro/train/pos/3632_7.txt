As predictable as a hallmark, but not without merit, The Rookie makes for a solid trip. Dennis Quaid, the most reasonable jock actor working today, is absolutely perfect as the science professor turned into baseball player Jimmy Morris. The film is never corrupted for children, as would be expected from a rated G movie. As a sporting movie, The Rookie is one of the best I've seen since Sunday Any Date.
