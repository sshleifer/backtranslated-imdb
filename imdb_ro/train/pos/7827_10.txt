This movie is simply brilliant. Cinema is good, gorgeous act and stunning story. This is the story of Donald Woods, an African South African white man who was believed to be liberal until he learned the reality of apartheid. Kevin Kline is totally convincing - so much so that when Donald Woods himself appeared on television a few years later, I recognized him from Kline's portrait. Denzel Washington is also turning into a stupid performance, as ever. I urge you to look at this. It's long, but it's worth your patience because it says a story so incredible. Remember, folks, it really did.
