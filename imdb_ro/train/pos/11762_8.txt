You've ever had in your life, you went out for a sporting activity, tried everything you could and found yourself in an important segment of her, where for a short moment you were given a chance to be hero and champion and . . . has failed? I think many of us have had that moment in our lives. This is the premise of the film, "The Best of the Year". In this story, a middle-age banker named Jack Dundee (Robin Williams) suffers from the profound melancholy of a football mistake that happened years ago, inspired by the resumption of the game. . again. To do this, he has to convince Reno Hightower (Kurt Russell) to make a comeback. For Reno, who is pleased with his batch of life, you do not have to change past history, which is better as he ages. Added to both problems is that the years have passed and, in addition, both marriages are flaming and need re-design. It's not easy when his father-in-law (Donald Moffat) usually reminds him of the biggest fall. However, Dundee is persistent and will do anything to try to correct the biggest blunder of his life. Have fun for anyone who wants to enjoy their youth again. ***
