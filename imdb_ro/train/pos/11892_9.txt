Pilate shoots people in extreme emotional situations, usually with more violent scenes. In La Gueule ouverte, he deals with devastating effects on a woman's husband and son as he dies of cancer. In moments of love, the sexual experimentation of the girl leads to violent confrontations with her family. Here we have a spoiled young woman who abandons her husband to take on a sexy ex-con. Her motivation is a bit cloudy because Loulou is unable to read or speak anything more challenging than TV shows; on the other hand, has a fabulous body (I wonder why Depardieu never made a sports movie to show this physically - he would have been great as a rugby player). Casting is impressive. Isabelle Huppert is not allowed to offer gentle, inexpressive performance (she has given many); Depardieu plays Loulou with all the dynamism and charm you may want - see the bar scene where he is stabbed in the intestine, run away and seek treatment, then re-start with Nelly. Guy Marchand, with those dark brown eyes and a frightening glance, interprets Nelly's husband nicely; is a thorough repetition of coupling in Coup de foudre.
