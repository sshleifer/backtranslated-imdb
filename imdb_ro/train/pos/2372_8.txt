I looked at this after my mother brought me back from America for me, was afraid to look at it after all the negative comments here, but I have to say yes, the action is the thing, some of the effects are ridiculous. /> But you have to remember that this was meant to be the year 1898 not 2005, and for such a low budget I thought it was good enough. I enjoyed this version much more than the Spielberg version that I saw last week. I read the book so many times, and I woke up "ahh yes, that's in the book" almost all the time, with the other version barely there was anything in the book. <br /> <br /> So well done for at least trying to make a real version.
