This movie is about a fictional digging. It's very fast and funny. Telling something else would ruin the movie. There are several plots and sublots in the movie. This movie has an ensemble distributed with the greatest stars today. All of this provides top performance. This movie is my favorite since 1991. Soapdish is perfect for fans of any soap during the day / or spring soap! If you watch soap go check this movie is hilarious!
