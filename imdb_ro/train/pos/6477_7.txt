"Five Days" is billed as something special, a crime of crime that consists of a series of episodes, each set on a particular day of police investigation. But, in fact, this element of the story proves to be less significant than it would have been from the beginning, because the fact that the action of each episode is limited to 24 hours is hard to notice and very little distinguishes the program of countless other stories of murder. In fact, one can hardly help to make comparisons with the last "Prime suspect" because one of the sub-plots focuses on a single cynical policeman approaching retirement: and not just the absence of Helen Mirren makes comparisons to be unfavorable. There are a lot of exaggerated emotions, manipulating music and a set of seemingly threatened characters, so each one is in a somewhat sympathetic sense to another suspect. And it is possible to guilty the guilty party long before the end, not because of the internal dynamics of the story, but rather because of the construction of drama as a whole: certain things must be true to justify how the series focuses on certain characters in certain moments. Despite these failures, the series grew up on me: until the end, I was pretty caught up. But it is a sad sign that the BBC, who once made The Singing Detective, praised the "best drama of the year": because there is not much genuine originality and the offer reveals a lack of ambition that is terrible disappointing. "Five days" is not actually garbage; but it's a form, and it would be hoped that the best thing the BBC would have to offer would be a little more innovative and fresh.
