I think I've seen that a dozen times over the years. I was about fifteen when I first saw him at B & W at the PBS local post. I bought a DVD set for the kids to see them and make them look. They do not teach history in school, and this explains the most important event of the twentieth century. He extends his critical thinking. Impartially, with participants from all sides explaining in their own words what they have done and why they detail what led to the war and the current war. <br /> <br /> Buy it for kids, along with America's Alistair Cooke. Follow them with them and make them understand. You will be so glad you did.
