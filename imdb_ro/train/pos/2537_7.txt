Boris and Bela are doing well together in this movie, whether they are against each other, or on the same boat. I saw it in 1972 and I just bought it from Frontier this year. This time when I looked at it together with my children, I took note of 2 things: she kept the attention of 3, 4 and 5 years; and I caught some things I did not have when I saw it for the first time. Very fast story, with an unpredictable ending. A must for film lovers !!!
