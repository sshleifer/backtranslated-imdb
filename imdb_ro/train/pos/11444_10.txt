Visit this movie for the gorgeous Andy Goldsworthy sculpture images and enjoy a great opening and relaxing experience. Music completes the movie perfectly, but never draws attention to it. Some commentators have called the fragments of interview with the artist a weak point, but consider this: Why would you express yourself in a movie, if you can read Andy's books or attend one of his excellent conferences? This environment is more appropriate to show the ephemeral nature of the artist's works and is especially used in this respect.
