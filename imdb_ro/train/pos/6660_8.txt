"Gandhi as husband and father?" has always been discussed by people in India. "Gandhi ... my father" is a story that only a few would have known about such details. Surely a perspective on Gandhi's personal life. Generally, I liked the movie for story and cinema. Jariwala, Akshay Khanna and Shefali Shah did a good job. Most movie scenes would be beautiful desktop wallpapers ... a commendable job. Traditional Indian folk music, as a base score in some parts of the film, offers a good feeling about happenings. However, what I did not like enough was the narrative style. At some points, I found the over-dramatized tone. Overall, good work by Anil Kapoor Productions. I would recommend this as a "must-watch-once". 8/10
