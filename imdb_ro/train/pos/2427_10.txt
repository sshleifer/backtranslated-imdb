This is really an excellent movie. Dialogue perfectly without typical clich√©s. This film was based on actor's talent and was retired. He even had a little comedy in him, but he was not overcome. is what should be a crime of murder, and not a particular special that affects garbage with sex threw. Especially I loved the interracial aspects of all. Now, the actors themselves. Laurence Fishburne was great when he played a fine career crime. It is a shame that he only allowed himself to show his talent in his own film. Titus Welliver was fabulous as Fishburne's half brother. Eamonn Walker added the aroma of the already perfectly spiced film. Paul Calderon was perfect as a fat monkey / drug lord. I liked the quality of "King of New York". But the best act in this movie came from Gregory Hines and Michael Paul Chan, who were perfectly matched as two of Calderon's cousins. Once in a lifetime a porter is sure. **** 1/2 * of *****.
