This is a CGI animated film based on a series of French 2D animations. The series fled Cartoon Network briefly, but its run was so short that its inclusion as one of the Oscar nominees for the best animated film this year has left most of the people they know going "Huh"? This is the story of Lian-Chu, the type of heart muscle, and Gwizdo, the brain of the surgery, who, along with Hector, their fire-dragon who is struggling, resembles a dog. They travel the world by offering their services as dragon hunters, but they never pay. In their life comes Zoe, the fairy-loving niece of a blind king. It seems that the world is devoured by a giant monster, and all the knights the king has sent do not return, or if they return, they return as ashes. Desperately, the king hires dragon hunters to stop the world's consumer. Zoe of course labels along ... What else can I say, why is this movie hiding under a cliff? This is a very good movie that is completely out of the radar, unless the Oscar is unlikely. It's a beautiful, fantastic movie (The world takes place with floating terrain and crazy creatures) that constantly led me to "Wow" to her. The English voice was distributed by Forrest Whitaker as Lian-Chu (one of the best vocal interpretations I've ever heard) and Rob Paulson as Gwizdo (I think Steve Bucsemi) is the first rate. Just as great is the script that does not refer to his audience, using some real expressions that are not normally heard in animated movies (not Disney and Pixar). Everything is very well done. It's perfect? No, some of the bits go too much, but at the same time it's fun. If you have the chance to see this. It is one of the best animated films in 2008, and it happens on my beautiful list of surprises for 2009.
