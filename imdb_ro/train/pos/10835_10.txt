I love this movie. It's one of those movies you can watch from time to time and again and you still find hiring. Congratulations!! I think all those involved in making the film and the script should be proud of themselves. It's so dizzy, you feel like watching a real life band. I'd like to see more movies like this. I'm glad they did not pick the famous Hollywood star to be in this movie, because it probably would not have worked. And even if Billy Connolly is pretty well known, he really did stay and I did not think anyone else was playing it. Congratulations again, I really think this movie deserves the Peter Sellers Comedy Award for Bill Nighy. And when you get to the final stage ..... well what can I say !!!!
