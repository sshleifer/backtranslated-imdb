The message of a world on the brink of war is not taken into account by the masses; the mythical town of Everytown in 1940 represents England in general, but it could be as good for any nation in the world. When war finally arrives, the ravages continue to last for five years, but until 1966, when Everytown is completely destroyed. Adding to dilemmas and taxes on humanity is "wandering disease," a plague that continues for another four years. "Things That Come" balances both the fatal and the futuristic world perspective, a hope for a revived civilization. The Wings Over The World concept plays a little more, though Cabal's spokesman (Raymond Massey) is steadfast in his mission and dedicated to his cause. If he fails, others will follow. This message is constantly reinforced throughout the movie, convincingly brought home at the end of Massey's film. Man's insensitive need to test the limits of knowledge and realization requires a "whole universe or nothing" mentality. The images of the automation film and the second half of the movie remind of the grand silent movie "Metropolis." While Everytown is rebuilt and transformed until 2036, the show of the city's rebirth has a resonant chord, because the architecture of contemporary modern cities suggests that the prophetic vision If the film becomes mistaken for sixty-seven years, although it is the first human mission per month, but in 1936, one hundred years probably seemed more legitimate than 1969. Things to Come is one of those rarities in the film, a picture that makes you think, where do you go down, the forces to advance to uncertainty, or to maintain the status quo - is not a comfortable question because both choices offer inherent dangers and unknown results. Those who choose to pass are likely to be hit by forces that are out of control.
