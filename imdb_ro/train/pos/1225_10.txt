Does anyone know where or how can I get a copy of this movie? I've been looking for too long, someone helps! In 1997, my girlfriends and I were taken out on this Long Island-based film, and we have not really come to see him. :( I was hoping I could find a copy somehow, so I can finally check it out and share it with the girls! Is there anyone who knows where to get a copy of this, so it does not matter if it's in the format VHS, I'm still in the ice age.) If you, or anyone you know, has a copy of this movie please help, I would be willing to pay for a good copy of it!
