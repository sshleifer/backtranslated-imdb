Pufnstuf is what it is. I saw that in the cinema at the age of 4, and I have very interesting memories and live about it. Seeing this as adults, you allow it to capture the references that are far above the target audience - such as a bit where Jimmy's gray witch's wig is squeezed out and Witch Hazel (Cass) laughs "I know he has brown roots! ". It is, of course, heavily influenced by the floral power culture of time and, in some respects, quite progressive. Various songs, for example, send a clear message to young viewers about being alone, not running with the package, and cherishing what is about you that is different. This could be a hymn to the gay community, it should be a great piece. Martha Raye, Cass Elliot and Billie Hayes are all wonderful as a witch, and Living Island plays it all in (including Billy Barty, Felix Silla and other known names). There is a lot of action in this movie - there is nothing subtle, and when little Jack Wild has to express his concern for the villagers abducted from the Living Isle, it is really a little more than the cry. This is drama and comedy spread with a trowel. As I think about it - I could never resist the flute. I like the soundtrack, especially the above mentioned Different, but also Zap The World, Pufnstuf and even Jack Wild's touching If I could. Moreover, it is now released on CD by the good ones at El Records in London. See more here: www.cherryred.co.uk/en/artists/pufnstuf.htm
