As for many here, I can not boast, but those who developed Talespin and others that they did during my childhood, as I commented here, enjoyed the quality of not only animation, but also the quality of storytelling lines and characters. To classify this artwork as a "Cartoon" could never make talespin justice, it is actually an insult to classify it as a "Cartoon", Talespin is an animation and nothing less, It is obviously the highest a work of genius that must be produced at Disney so far, when Disney "pulled it" out of the air, realized what they had done, and I'm sure their souls have been tortured by regret ever since. br /> <br /> I'll take a moment to explain, From the first one that is ducktales to the last one I think is Darkwing Duck, Disney has been affected by failures due to political correctness and have taken a Quantum Leap back to, They prefer Quality Above Quality, not to mention the Monkey's room for my story, I could not follow my children to watch the "wonderful" cartoons they are throwing now, Homer Simpson will prove to be some time in the future and 50% of the guilt would be on me to allow me not to let it happen, that's why I have all the shows from the late 80s to the mid-90s on a harddisk, one day My kids could not be corrupted by "Cartoon Crap" today and to get rid of the last piece of childhood I have and keep it and I owe it to Talespin. Talespin for me is undoubtedly the best animation ever produced in the world because of depth, charm, intelligence, compassion, excitement and lack of true bad lines and story, many of whom today see any of that content in "Ed , Edd and Eddie or something else you can think of today's garbage can be similar to a 3-year-old Hyroglyph that can not be deciphered Imagine Picasso The next time you watch a Talespin episode, take a look at the wood on any object or wooden building such as Higher for Hire and salivating over the quality of the work and effort made in this animation. Even the unique background was made as if used again and again, The Buildings look real Art Deco movement that was popular in the time period described, Even vehicles are true for life, OK not ALL Episodes were fantastic in animated but inferior scenes have been covered by top scenes, so everything in everything has done everything by the end of the episode, and you probably have not even noticed if you were not focused and paid attention to the details. The only thing I love about this is what I would call "intentional mistakes" or "intentional mistakes" in each episode, and some have two, for example, in sheepskin deep where Rebecca says "you are at something Baloo "and Baloo responds" Who, as innocent as a schoolboy, "takes a look in Rebecca's eyes, breaks the rest of Baloopers, but keeps an eye out next time. <br /> <br /> The comments of all elses are bang and 100% correct, I have nothing else to add that others have not said before, Disney, WAKE UP and smells coffee, You've been asleep for over a decade, produce garbage and you have not been able to bring back Quality in animations and stop producing "Cartoons", we have seen the evidence of what you can do and we want it back as quickly as possible.
