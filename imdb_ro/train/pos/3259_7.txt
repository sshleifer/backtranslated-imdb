This is not the best romantic comedy ever made, but it's certainly quite beautiful and cautious. It's guided in an old-fashioned way, and that works well. Cybill Shepherd as Corinne is not bad in her role as a woman who can not overcome her husband's death. She has a sexy maturity. But I can not say too much for Ryan O'Neal as Philip, because it is, most of all, unjust. He may be appropriate in the role, but that's not good enough. However, I have the feeling that some characters, especially Alex and Miranda, are not written with a sufficient thought in depth. We do not know anything else about them, because a few minutes after the story comes, it becomes thick and the writers do not tell us too much beyond what's going on. But this problem has been saved because Mary Stuart Masterson has a fresh jam to brighten him, and Robert Downey Jr. is so charming that he melts on the screen. Even his smile is infectious. And it happens that his big dream eyes are perfect for already vu and flashback scenes. However, this movie is easy and easy and if you like this, why not try. <br /> <br />
