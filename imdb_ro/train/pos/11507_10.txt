I remember the original series alive, especially because of its unique blend of tired humor and the macabre subject. Kolchak was a news story from the Ben Hecht school reporting to the big city, and his tough decision and wise wisdom made even the most ludicrous episode, eminent to follow. My staff was "The Murders of Spanish Moss" due to its original story. A young poor Cajun, troubled by the country of Louisiana bayou, is participating in a sleep research to analyze dreams. Something goes wrong inexplicably, and he literally dreams of living a swampy creature that lives in the dark folk tales of his youth. This malicious manifestation follows all those who have hurt the dreamer in his conscious state and suffocates them brutally to death. Kolchak investigates and discovers this terrible truth, much to the sound of police captain Joe, the "crazy dog" Siska (awesome experimented by a Keenan Wynn) and the head sleep researcher played by the founder of Second City improviser, Severn Darden,. The wicked and funny finale takes place in the Chicago sewer system and is a highlight of the series. Kolchak never had a better time. Timeless.
