I liked every moment of this wonderful movie and I was intrigued by this female painter I never heard of before. So I started exploring my life and working afterwards. As expected, I found out that the movie was not exactly accurate from a historical point of view. I was a little amazed at the very negative comments of the film because of this inaccuracy. Come on, guys, a movie is not and should not be a biography (no novel!). Any historical film distorts reality, because it should be a work of art itself. A film director has the right to use elements of reality and history to create his own world. Artemisia is a great movie and I think it has brought many people (including some who give negative feedback) to explore the life and work of this fascinating artist.
