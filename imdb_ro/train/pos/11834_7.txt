I like horses and I admire hand-drawn animation, so I did not expect anything but the astonishment of the animated image of Dreamworks Spirit: Cimarron's Stallion. I think you could say I was a little disappointed. You have great animation and at first what seems to be a perfect story. A story about absolutely nothing but a horse in nature. Animals do not sing nice songs or even talk - a big plus. Unfortunately, the film does not need Matt Damon narrative; a Bryan Adams soundtrack; and enough action scenes to compare it with a Jerry Bruckheimer production. If the filmmakers were left with simplicity, we would have a masterpiece here. This is not a great movie, but it's a good fun for little kids. I would recommend this movie to families, because it has the heart in the right place and it's the only thing that right now is not offensive for young children. It's not bad, but it could have been a lot better. Very pretty visual, though.
