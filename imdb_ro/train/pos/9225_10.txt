Bo Derek's beauty and John Derek's revolutionary direction make this movie worthwhile. <br /> <br /> Bo, searching for more than ever, is a recent widow woman who faces visits from her dead husband (Anthony Quinn). He has a plan. Bo has to buy a young man's body so that the spouse's ghost can transform the transformation from specter back into body life. Can he find a suitable candidate? How will he do it, so Tony can do the job? <br /> <br /> With Bo's attributes, John's unique direction, Quinn's presence in the film and, thanks to John, a very exotic aspect of the whole movie, this movie is a pleasant viewing.
