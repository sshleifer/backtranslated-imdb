Fabulous movie! Hired the DVD recently and was paved with this amazing piece of work. Douglas Sirk was a film genius and performed the performance of Rock Hudson, Dorothy Malone (Oscar winner), Robert Stack (Oscar nominee) and Lauren Bacall, whom I can not describe the words. Paul Verhoeven awarded a glorious score to this film, starring Dorothy Malone starring Sharon Stone's inspirational guru who kills him in his basic instinct. What a great joke! Through the transformation, the movie is hilarious, riveted, camouflaged, biting, trashy, convincing and rolling eyes! It's definitely the grandfather of any telenovela telenovela, but none of them has an orbital style, as you will see here: working with the camera is smooth and polished, using color is breathtaking, opening fitting set to title title is beyond memorable , non-dimensional characters are unforgettable, and the final picture will scratch your head as to how the censors back then let it make the final cut! While the oldest, extremely watched movies can sometimes be a boring task to stand, writing on Wind contains so much and goes so fast that it's actually a shame when it's over. Thank you Sirk for crafting - and Todd Haynes to draw attention to ... what has become one of my favorite movies of all time! Watch this movie!
