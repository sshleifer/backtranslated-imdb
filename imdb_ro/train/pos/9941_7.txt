You know the story - a group of countless people entering a competition that apparently have no chance of winning - is a story that was made to death by Hollywood (Bring it on, Karate Kid, Escape to Victory, Best of the Best etc). Now, Korea gives her a chance with a Taekwondo team fighting for glory? and guess what? the result is predictable, but ultimately satisfactory. The fact that this movie does not collapse on the face is down for talented talented young people who really worry about the characters, and this, in turn, keeps you looking all the way. Do fans of your typical martial arts movie be disappointed? Taekwondo does not offer the usual movement of movements and acrobatics observed in most Kung Fu films; the action is limited to striking (but impressive) blowing the occasional fist. This does not matter, however, because it is the interaction of the characters and their struggle to do something by themselves which makes this film a success.
