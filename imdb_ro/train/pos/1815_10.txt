"May contain spoilers" <br /> <br /> "All the dogs go to heaven" is a great movie. I saw it in 1989 when I was two years old. I did not understand so well but as I saw it more and more times I started to love him, I like the songs in this movie, my favorite songs are "Let me surprise" and "you will soon come home." the movie is Charlie's death When I was little, my sister could not even watch that part .. Apart from the fact that this movie is wonderful .. My favorite part of the movie is when Annabelle and Charlie fly around the sky is beautiful in the film and "watches" are very smart, I also love Itchy, in fact, I have 3 teckles of mine are so cute. and suggests that everyone should see it.
