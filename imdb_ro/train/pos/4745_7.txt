I do not understand why they decided to launch this movie to bring the American audience to the dynamics of Jet Li. Fist of Legend would have been a much better choice. However, the Black Mask is not terrible, but it is certainly not great. The final battle sequence is well set up by Yuen Woo Ping, who co-ordinated the Matrix. But the English version suffers from rough editing and dubbing. (I apologize for Hollywood studios to release these uncountable movies with subtitles.) Jet Li presents her characteristic charisma in the lead role and Francoise Yip has a cool but short role as a 701 female. Black Mask has a strange Gothic style which adds a certain interest, but is overloaded with battles and explosions. More focus on Li's fantastic physical abilities was in order. Black Mask is a decent film, but do yourself a favor and pick up the Fist of Legend if you want to see a great movie that really shows Li's skills.
