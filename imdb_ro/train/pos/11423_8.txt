This film presents life in northern Cameroon from the point of view of a French young woman, France, Dalens, whose father is official for the colonial government (French) and whose family is one of the few white families around. It gives a feeling of life for both colonists and natives with whom they have been associated. It is a sense in accordance with another film I have seen about Africa in a similar period of time (Nirgendwo in Africa (2001)), but I can not know how realistic or typical it is. It's not just an impression - things happen in the movie - but the plot is undervalued. The spectator is left to draw his own conclusions rather than to force the directors, although the framing of the story as a retrospective of the woman's visit to Cameroon as an adult gives a certain perspective.
