The truly amazing film, the concept as a possible prophetic vision of the future is terrifying. A very overpopulated world, unbearable heat because of the deteriorated ozone layer and all our natural resources spent. In this nightmare degenerate society, we have the great Charlton Heston, an ungrateful detective who tries to understand the truth behind a crime, in front of the legend of Noir Edward G Robinson, which turns into a fine performance. One of the pictures that will always remain with me in this movie are the masses of people who populate the stairs and how Thorne (Heston) has to get them every time they use them. <br /> <br /> The use of film music is also noteworthy, although it does not contain any score in the usual sense. The theme of opening is good, and the success of the music we have here in Simonson's apartment, and especially Beethoven's at the atmospheric euthanasia clinic.
