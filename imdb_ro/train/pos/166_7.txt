This was the first film that Joan Crawford and Clark Gable brought together and continued to do more. Crawford plays a wealthy young woman, the father who is blown away in the collapse of the scholarship, and nothing left for her and her brother. They never worked, and brother, William Bakewell, is doing a job with Gable, who is a gangster, and Bakewell thinks it will be easy, but he's going too fast. Crawford becomes a newspaper reporter, but he wants to work on big stories, but he's given no value to work. It is a massacre in which many Gable men are killed, and Crawford was a witness of the whole thing. It's a good movie, but not one of the best.
