No one will hurt this work better! Great movie! Experienced by Ira Levin and described with the best interpretation of Christopher Reeve's career and one of the best of Caine's, this is simply excellent. I wish I could get a version on the stage somewhere ... maybe I'll someday do it. I hope the underrated movie, the past movie has not become too difficult to locate because it is a must for any type of Hitchcockian, Agatha-fil or a great movie amateur. One of the very few movies I could not solve instantly and worth a second or even third watch, "Deathtrap" gets 9/10 and wins each jot. We need and deserve more movies like this!
