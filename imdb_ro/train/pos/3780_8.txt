Only in my second view, years later, I did two things about this movie: 1) I liked it very much and 2) because its execution is much clearer than the premise itself. I ripped my way through the movie before I understood to renew my initial protests - valleyspeak and loogies and airheadedness (even * airheadedness * good *) are not intrinsically funny, especially when drawn to length. But, although the rhythm of the film starts to scatter, Reeves and Winter and Sadler (and Hal Landon Jr. in an unforgettable scene) display such a remarkable sense of comic time by the fact that even more jest eg Ted failing to recognize a certain inhabitant of Hell) works as effortless as those who are wandering (eg the challenge). And Winter's and Reeves' fears are so good that Bill and Ted's fear (who spend only one separate scene in the whole movie, disaster if they are not right) seems absolutely unrestrained. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> (Side note: I found the first movie to be just sporadic entertainment - it seems there are different comic sensibilities out there, it seems.) I give it a 7.75. Surprisingly fun.
