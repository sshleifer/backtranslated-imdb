I did not know the real events when I sat down to see this, just the fact that it was based on a true story. After the death of the child's father, Rhonda tries to help her daughter Desiree (... I did not know anyone calling her own descendant to) to face the loss. This is really done for children, as is often the case for "family" movies (with that you said, go and go everywhere for a view, although you will keep your teens out, if you are not sure they are to buy the concept), but it does not attenuate that the death of a parent is, and does not talk to anybody. The plot is interesting enough and moves pretty well. The actor differs, with excellent Burstyn, who shone most of his colleague, Mathis following pretty well, and Ferland and his colleagues (with few exceptions) being the least convincing (and, frankly, irritating, I'm not really in the public for this). Editing and cinema are standard, and certainly not less than that. While humor is limited to a handful of funny lines or not, the tone is not unpleasant. There is an intense or two scene in this respect. I recommend this to fans of these types of movies. 7/10
