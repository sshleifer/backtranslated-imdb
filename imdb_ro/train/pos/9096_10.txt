Adorable! I saw the internal import in Philly in October with my children. We all enjoyed so much that I saw her the second time with my parents. I have not heard them laugh for years! It was the first time I remember seeing a movie that my parents and children could enjoy. It's very cute and we can not wait to appear on DVD. They have to make more films as domestic imports. It's refreshing to go to a movie that three different generations can enjoy (and not be embarrassed). I have not seen such a nice movie from my Greek Greek wedding. I loved Mindy Sterling as my mother. He was also in Austin Powers. Howard Hesseman is also in this case and is hilarious. I remember him from WKRP.
