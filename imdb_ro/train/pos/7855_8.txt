Tess in the Country of Storm was a Mary Pickford vehicle I was planning to get for some time. Finally, I found a VHS copy at a reasonable price and I enjoyed it. Mary gives her a typical, innocent, sexy story of a wrong girl who wins the heart of a rich heir. Only this time, the stakes are higher: a false charge of murder, an illegitimate child (and a case of mistaken maternity) and supposedly commit suicide. One can see why Pickford wanted to get it back. The story is a true story of morality, like she loved staring. Controversial topics are not always clearly formulated; a viewer must pay attention and raise suggestions to catch everything involved in the first view? although everything is more or less explained in the end. The only negative remark I can do about Jean Hersholt and the dog. Hersholt, whose character, Ben Letts, seems to be about 6-2, 200 pounds (bigger beside Mary, of course!), Is sent to panic when a 60-pound chocolate lab is going to him! Then, to the end (or perhaps to justify his fear of the dog) he manages to catch him and hurts him so badly that he still struggles to rise much later, like a storm bad! This is the same attractive lab that sleeps with Frederick (Lloyd Hughes) and dresses up with Mary! Still, Mary throws boiling water later in front of Ben, which slows him down! Okay, I've aired about Ben and the chocolate lab! Besides, the movie was quite exciting and surely kept my attention. Pickford supported a strong and credible distribution. This is certainly among her best movies.
