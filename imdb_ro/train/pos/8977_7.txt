Being a movie, this is very difficult for a cinema fan of the 1940s, it is almost necessary and shows a number of 9 as a variety! I was attracted to seeing this through the presence of Richard (Captain Midnight) Webb, who plays the role of Colonel responsible for the event. What surprised me was the amazing spectacle of Doris Day. Outside "Calamity Jane," I've never seen her put on a song better than her. Randolph Scott is also memorable even though I do not see much time on the screen. It's been a while since I saw the movie, but I was almost sure Humphrey Bogart appeared. With so many familiar faces, it's hard to follow. If ever it appears on a television station next to you, make sure you've caught the Doris Day sequence, if nothing else! <br /> <br />
