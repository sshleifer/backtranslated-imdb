Looking at some negative posts, you have to ask yourself what some do for fun ... I was lucky enough to see the movie during its very short theatrical round. The audience laughed. I'm looking at a tape I'm writing and it's still funny! It also has a sweet side, with unexpected changes of authentic pathos. Later, the great Dano Royal is particularly effective as the farmer alone, happy, Wrenchmuller. Ariana Richards and J.J. Anderson are wonderful as lead kids. And the actors in the Martian costumes, although limited to the mime, do a good job. Another thing you need to look for is the details of the background. The film is full of tributes, pastiche and references to other SF and fantastic films. Take a look at the Martian costumes next time. One of them is wearing a Marty McFly suit, another is a Ghostbuster, the third one is a House Atreides uniform, and the fourth one is a Ultimate Starfighter flight.
