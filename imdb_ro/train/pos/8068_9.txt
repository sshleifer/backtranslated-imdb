To watch this film from the beginning to the end without breaking into a laugh at a certain moment, it takes almost an act of faith, as we must continue to say "it's old," "it's classic," " be good, "not the movie is so bad, but because it is so good. This is a dated film. It's also a classic if it's a thin one. I'm not inclined to laugh at people, anyway, basically, and I have more than a little irritated when others do it. Having fun with The Informer in my mind is a bit like a giggle to an idiot scholar when he dribbles the orange juice all over the table. Yes, someone tells you he's an idiot, and yet, when he's at the top of the game, he's a real scholar. The same is true for The Informer, which is sometimes very scary and still has a splendid photo, a good adventure, a wonderful score, and a decent, decent story. Finally, which I will not give, politics, religion, and psychology reunite in a church, so the scene seems to be crushed over the top, and yet life is sometimes. People who are unbelievers of simple faith behave differently from new (probably brilliant) modern people, and the scene is not so incredible (I buy it, but I know the Irish) as embarrassing. However, people behave like this, say such things. Not everyone is hip and it may not be all right for everyone to be hip. Are today people much higher than those of seventy or eighty years ago? And in what way? I do not think. We are different. Now watch the movie.
