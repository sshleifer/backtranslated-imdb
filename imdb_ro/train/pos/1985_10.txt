I'm not usually a musical lover, but if I had to choose what my favorite would be, it would certainly be Oliver. This movie is so well done, the characters are well described, the costumes are spot on the action is good and the pieces are great, being my favorite "Review of the situation by Ron Moody, which offers a brilliant portrayal of Fagin. I was not quite old to see Oliver when it was released in the late 1960s, but my sisters were, I had to get together with them singing bloody songs, usually it was "Who will buy my wonderful roses," so already I knew all the songs before watching the movie It's an uninterrupted music that you certainly could not remake on its own It's not right for the book and I do not think it would have worked so well if it had been I do not think Charles Dickens was disappointed because he wrote Oliver to describe London's poverty, orphanages, workplaces, and what the poor had to use to survive, and the movie describes it is very good. Another very good reason to watch this movie is the Bullseye Old English Bull Terrier-type, observe its long thin legs, it has been raised since the race many years ago, they had to and he is exactly how an English bull terrier would have shown in victorian times.Notice has scars (which is probably makeup) on his face, Bill Sykes probably have him used to fight the dog or for the rat pit. Terrier had a record amount of kills in a pit of rats. He is a beautiful dog in any way and he observes that he does not respect Bill Sykes after killing Nancy, obviously having his standards, not Bill Sykes's boss thought it was. great music to watch if you like music, and if you do not like music to try in any way, there's something for everyone in this movie.
