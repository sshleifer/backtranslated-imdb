Clean the family-oriented movie. I laughed, I cried ... I liked it. I was worried I could not see Steve Carrell as anything but a lame Michael from the Office. Well, I was wrong. He should win an Oscar for his show. I will definitely buy this on DVD when it comes out. My husband enjoyed it and is not in this type of movie. I saw her with two more couples in the 30-year-old range, and we all agreed that it was the best movie I've seen in a long and definitely the cleanest time. Just 1 word of cuss! Not even sure why PG13 was. I would recommend this movie to everyone who likes comedy, drama, romance and more!
