When I first saw this movie in London in 1958, I was overthrown. I've never seen a movie like this. It had a strange, hypnotic effect, quite different from the movies I've seen before and left a lasting impact. I think Odile Versios and Marina Vlady are sisters, if not twins. Of course, the interaction is amazing in its power to influence the spectator. If it was converted to DVD - in Region 2 - and in the original French language, I would love to hear about it and where it can be purchased.
