A lot has been written about Mamet's "House of Gaming"; most of it is good. I decided to review the movie to see how she resisted after 17 years and was surprised how much I like to look at it again. The success and durability of the film probably have a lot to do with two main ingredients that are always fun on the film; a good story and a good scam. Mamet manages to bring his moodiness signal and an obvious highlight of the film, while scamming our audience and branding simultaneously. Then he explains the art of conning just to do it again, etc., always building the story. The "Gaming House", now a freebie on cable, deserves a look for the first timers and a good repeat for Mamet fans. (B +)
