I had the privilege to see this movie at the Rotterdam International Film Festival. "Xizhao" or "Shower" is a $ 200,000 movie about a father and his two sons. The father has a traditional bath somewhere in a traditional Chinese village where local men, most of them old, come to relax and bathe. The father has a son: a "retarded" son who lives with him and a son living in a modern city and coming to visit him. For this son, his traditional village, his bath and his "retarded" brother seem strange and annoying, but this changes throughout the movie. Though the story may sound cheesy or clich√©, it is not. With very good performances, especially of the father and son "retarded" (I'm sorry, I do not know their names) and a great story, the movie was appealing and fun at the same time. you have a chance to see this movie do it. It's a great alternative to Hollywood cinema. <br /> <br />
