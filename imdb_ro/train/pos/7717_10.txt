I've loved this movie all my life. It's such a smart story, with many classical allusions. e.g. The ship that lacks decades earlier was called Bellerophon. Well, in classical mythology, it was the man who killed Chimera, a legendary beast composed of two or more other creatures. In FP, Walter Pidgeon is clearly the hegemon and monster of Id. <br /> <br /> I like movies where writers have clearly created their audience with little intelligence, unlike most modern blockbusters that spend 150 million dollars for special effects but about 1 , $ 50 per scenario. /> Cheers
