This is probably the best short crime drama I've ever seen. The actress is gorgeous, especially Amanda Burton, the character that goes from scary to sweet, to disturbing and then to some ... She does an amazing job balancing Rachels / Carlas feelings and acting on the pain of someone who has lost a child, both to believe it feels more like a real life story, then a drama. The other actors are, of course, too big, usually in British TV / Film. The end I do not give is fantastic, mainly because you can not get one ... (you get what I want to say after you've seen it) It's good to buy and see again and if you are not touched by it, you are a cold-hearted person.
