After some negative reviews I've heard in this movie, I had doubts as to how to make a way, but I had 3.99 pounds in my wallet and I was thinking of buying a budget like the movie and I saw that and I gave it up and I'm glad I did it, I liked it. Directed by Star of the movies, such as Chain Reaction, Ring, Bourne Identity (Brian Cox), I had to play with it, even if it was a garbage but it was not at all, I found some amusing fun, especially Alfred Molina Star Spider-Man 2 The character of Doc Ock. It was great the most enjoyable part of the movie. Of course, like many other people who bought this movie, I saw Matthew's name and that made me understand! and no part is not big at all, is very short at the very end of the movie, it's not much that makes me think that's why people hate the movie. I suggest you give up. Some parts are a pitfolding pit that requires polishing, action and less action. But he's pursued.
