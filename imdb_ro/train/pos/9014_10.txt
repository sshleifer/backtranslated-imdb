Unfortunately, before seeing this movie, I was not familiar with Helena Bonham Carter. I had to do some research to make sure she was not affected at all, like her character, okay?) With what she was affected. I was in the absolute amazement of this beautiful lady. She pulled it without blemish. Who would have thought that the explicit sexual circumstances involving the end of the desire and the needs of a single young woman could be interpreted as romantic and trendy? Well, they can be, when the right artists present them in the right way, as they did in this wonderful movie. I forgot to mention how beautiful Miss Carter was in this movie. I have often said that she was the most beautiful creature ever to have made a beauty of our earth, but it seems she did it in this movie. I hope any of you who are watching this movie enjoy her as much as I do. Thank you for allowing me to express my opinion.
