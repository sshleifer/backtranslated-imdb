This musical is definitely mixed, and none of them really fit together, but in a way it is largely enjoyable. The plot contains some of the elements of Wodehouse's novel, but none of his virtues, though he wrote the script. The songs, though charming, have nothing to do with this particular film and are unusually spoiled in the plot, even after the pre-Oklahoma standards. Burns and Allen make their usual habit, but lack the tone of the rest of the film with about forty IQ points. There are some high points. Reginald Gardiner does a good job when he remembers it's a talkie and he's not as strong as a silent actor. And there are a few fragments of writing that could only have been written by Wodehouse, although most of the film feels like the production of a Hollywood meeting she later parodied.
