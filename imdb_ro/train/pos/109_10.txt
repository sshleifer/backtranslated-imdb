This is the film for those who think cinema is the seventh art, not a entertainment business. Lars von Trier creates a nocturnal atmosphere of post-war Germany, captivating. It absorbs you in the dream and you are only released at the end of the credits. Plot is necessarily the second, but it is still a thrilling story with high problems. Just awesome.
