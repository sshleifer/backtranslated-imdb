"Amazing Mr. Williams" calls Melvyn Douglas, who made five films in 1939, one of which was Ninotchka with Garbo. His co-star was Joan Blondell (Maxine), who also made five movies that year, three of which made together! Douglas is Lt. Williams, and he and his cohorts are presented with a corpse and they have to figure out what really happened. Spectators will recognize his colleagues - actors (Clarence Kolb, Donald MacBride, Don Beddoe) have always played positions of authority ... senators, bank presidents, policemen. Whoever has a fantasy comedy - the cops are always throwing lootings between them, and even Williams and his girlfriend are verbally fighting. Some funny gags - Williams even takes the man they arrested at a meeting with his girlfriend. There are many fun things here, so go from the very beginning and wait later for fun. You do not want to reveal any spoilers, so you'll have to catch it on Turner Classic movies. Director Alexander Hall made mostly comedies and was hired at Lucy at one time.
