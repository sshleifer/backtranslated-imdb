# 3 in John Travolta's trilogy about blockbusters. He dances at disco, rock'n'roll and country. He heads to Houston to find a job and love. Gilley's is the hot spot and is the moment of the bull. Not to be outdone, I traveled to a Nashville club. I have recently seen this movie almost forgotten on television and I recalled how good it was and how good it was a 1980s. I wore a black cowboy hat that year just like Travolta. Debra Winger was at the forefront. She looks amazing at her red tip. There are a lot of charisms. Both Bud and Sissy seem to be the ideal couple even if they are trash. They just broke up because they feel so good to come back together. Urban Cowboy has a stunning soundtrack. We arrive at Lyn 'Eyes by the Eagles and we look for love by Johnny Lee.
