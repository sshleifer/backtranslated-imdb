No matter what you become in your life, you should never forget that you have roots. This is the story of the true facts that have been made in a beautiful and moving movie! I dare say that this movie is well underestimated. This shows us a reality of life ... the worst you surround, the better you become. Encourage your instincts and know that the ideal of life is to live happily ... without prey, without living "under a rock". The concept of film is more interesting ... connecting the story to real life events ... keeping us aware of everything ... from facts to emotions! Bless these people and make everyone happy! See this, I recommend it to all young people. It's not about racism, it's about how to live your life!
