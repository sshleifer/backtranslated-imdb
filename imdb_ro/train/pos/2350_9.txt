For some I enjoyed shamelessly from each episode of Pushing Daisies this season and I hope that the writers' strike will not end the brutal end of the beginning of a very good show. Ned is a producer of pies that owns a restaurant in the middle of the city and has a secret talent. Emmerson is a private investigator with his own unique strangeness, such as his love of knitting. Charlotte (Chuck) is the childhood boyfriend, once dead, but no longer, and a sunny place in Ned's life. Olive is the waitress, but a blessing of goodwill. And add the dog. Jim Dale brings all the characters together with his wonderful narrative of the show. Chuck, Ned and Emmerson along with Olive, and sometimes the dog solves the multiple mysteries of murder with Ned's special frame of life. The show is fun, clean and romantic, in a very cute and heartfelt way and I would recommend it to anyone.
