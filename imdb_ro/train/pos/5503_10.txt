The material in this documentary is so powerful that it has brought me tears. Yes, tears tell you. This popular struggle of a traditionally exploited population should inspire us all to stop for our rights, to highlight the good of the community and not to apologize cowardly to not challenge the establishment. Chavez is weak and unhappy in the same way that Bush is the face of dirty corporations, and capitalism has remained amply. Indeed, Latin America is remodeled, and most marginalized has a voice in over five centuries. However, in the case of Mexico, the election was clearly stolen by Calderon. Chavez is not perfect, away from him. It is trying to change the constitution to allow it to pronounce indefinitely. This can not be tolerated. Enough with politics and back to film; The rhythm is breathing in moments and profoundly philosophical to others. He portrays Chavez as a popular hero without fear of contesting the US hegemony and the domination of the world's resources. If you think the author is biased in favor of Chavez, nothing prevents you from doing your homework. A crucial message of the film is questioning information sources, as it was clearly demonstrated that the sniper's victims were shamefully accused by Chavez's supporters. Venezuela prey to supposedly American democracy. Hasta la revolucion siempre!
