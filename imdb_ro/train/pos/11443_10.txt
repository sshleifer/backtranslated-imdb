This movie is fascinating in its beauty and creativity. The deep vision of the artist, his intuitive source of art from his natural source, brings us inspiration from Hosanna, mingling his creations with trees with white water that shines with stones, fields and rain ... Andy Goldsworthy makes the spectator enjoy to be alive, aware that we are all made of the clay of this glorious land. He does not get rid of his occasional frustration, but on the whole we see the miracle of joining art with nature. Faith also goes, of course, to director, Thomas Riedelsheimer, who directed, photographed and edited the film with incredible sensitivity and a perfect calendar. If you have any sense of beauty, nature and art ... do not miss this fantastic movie!
