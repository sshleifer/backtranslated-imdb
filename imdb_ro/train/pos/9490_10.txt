The first time I saw this movie was in the eighties, but now reviewed this thriller is still real. Some newer films focus on similar topics but do not match this French milestone. A president - obviously JF Kennedy - is shot in an open car during a public appearance. The enormous investigation that came out revealed that Lee Harvey Oswald's film is guilty, but a jury member insists on further investigation. He reveals some surprising evidence ... Unlike Oliver Stone's JFK - a film with the same plot - it does not play with emotion but focuses on an interesting description of a conspiracy and how it all fits, drawing a new one image of the assassination. Even a real psychological experiment is used for this explanation of the crime scene. Compared to JFK, this movie is more reasonable, intelligent and thrilling. Parts of the plot can be found in a lot of newer movies, I had some sort of vu, which sometimes I sit in the cinema. <br /> <br /> "I ... comic Icare" is a "must see". The unique and brilliant, and Ennio Morricone's music is great. This film deserves a very good ranking, if it were a Hollywood production, it would certainly be famous. <br /> <br />
