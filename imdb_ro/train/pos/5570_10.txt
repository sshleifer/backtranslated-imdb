Sophmoric this movie is. But it's funny for all to come out. It shows "the mentality of the locker room" being played by "the other side". It's good to see how the waves turn and how stupid they are. But it's probably not news for most women, because (you just ask one) "they've heard them before." Look at a small group or a mixed gender party and 97.3% of the room will laugh for two hours straight. And the other 2.7% ... can you ever pay for them?
