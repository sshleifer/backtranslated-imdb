I just saw the drug years on VH1 and I like it. I think it reflects very well the history of drugs and, most importantly, has a strong message for all generations. There is trout, there is the death of Joplin, Hendrix and Jim Morrison, there are many examples of drug use and drug abuse. It fully covers the time line and the evolution of drug use in America in both good and bad ways. In my opinion, this documentary is well done and I would like to congratulate the creators because it is exactly what is needed to play on TV these days. I'm waiting for the release of the DVD. You should definitely see it! This movie is amazing - BIG TIME!
