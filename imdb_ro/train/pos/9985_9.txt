I've recently seen this movie in Winnipeg - right, given the location used. I first read Lawrence's book in the 70's and for me, has always been a very powerful picture of aging processes in our society. She resonated when I was young and resonated even more now. When the movie came out, I wanted to see if the story could survive. and was impressed, especially with Ellen Burstyn's performance. It manages to give us a full human being, even if the character is generally mischievous and judged - someone you do not want to live with. It's great to see your favorite characters who come to life so authentic.
