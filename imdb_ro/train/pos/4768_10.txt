I loved it and it was so shaken that it does not make another season anymore !!! I would like to do it! was the best show ever !!!!!! there is probably no chance that they will not decide not to cancel the show there! ha ha I would have wanted it was still! I would be so excited! I would even be! I miss! and he was especially shattered not to know what was going on with Jason! I think he should do another ... I think his fool has to write ten lines to post a comment .. make your comment to draw .. and no one will read it! I really want to know what would have happened between Jason and Nicole ... maybe he could make a spin off!
