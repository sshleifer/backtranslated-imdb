I've never been a big fan of television until I've seen 24 for the first time. We came in very seriously very late. Season 5 ended before seeing my first episode. It was a 3-episode episode on the DVR (digital video recorder) from my parents, while I was staying home for the weekend. It took me a single episode for me to be a hook line and get out of Jack Bauer's world. And the boy was swept up! I followed the next six episodes without blinking an eye. The next day I went to Blockbuster and signed up for an unlimited month of twenty dollars pass, and I no longer need to say it was the biggest gain of money I've ever had. I watched the first three seasons in three weeks. That's 72 episodes of forty minutes! I'll say the discovery of what's going on is easier on DVD than to wait for a whole week. I can only imagine the anticipation of watching the season 6 weeks a week! It seems to me that it is slightly torture and cruel, but I will try to pursue it just like the rest of America! The DVR is set up and you can bet that I will be at some point!
