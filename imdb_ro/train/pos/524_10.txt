I saw this movie years ago in the late television. At that point he passed the title "Stairway to Heaven". Even as a little boy, I remember being deeply moved by the story and astonished by the visual effects of the trial (those who saw that they know what they are talking about). Such an imagination! A perfect combination of romance, drama, humor and fantasy, this movie is right up there with the greatest classics ever made: Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Gone with the Wind. This film is highly rated by IMDB voters and rightly so - over 51% of voters rated it 10 out of 10; over 84% rated it as 8 or more in 10. I was surprised that it was not listed in the top 250 films until I realized that so few had seen / rated this film compared to those on the list. What a shame. I hope this movie will be released on DVD for Region 1 (North America), so 1), I can buy it and 2), others discover this hidden treasure.
