Unlike many other movies that are disturbing either because of their bare bites (the Bites Bites dog) or because of their pure violence (most of the Peckinpah movies), Deliverance is shocked by its plausibility. Of course, the buggery scene is pretty simple in its inconvenience, but the effect of the film derives much more from its delays and from the tangible sense of isolation that surrounds the four leaderships, both before and after everything starts to go wrong. The moment the canons pass under the child on the bridge, who does not even recognize the men with whom he played earlier music, to show no sign of human affection for them, is among the most sinister in the modern film. The tension increases steadily during the canoeing and persists even after the final credits - the end makes the significance of the characters' attempts to be horribly real. The plausibility of the film is largely supported by the main play, especially Ned Beatty and Jon Voight, as a victim and reluctant hero. And Burt Reynolds has never been better. The cultural influence of the film is demonstrated by the number of people who will understand a reference to "banjo territory" - maybe only Get Carter has done such an effective activity in the tourist industry of a region. I'm just thinking about a handful of movies that put me in such a deep depression after they've finished - Se7en's oppressive atmosphere is the best comparison I can think of. Although so much is excellent in itself, Deliverance is a classic especially because there are no suitable comparison points with it - it is unique.
