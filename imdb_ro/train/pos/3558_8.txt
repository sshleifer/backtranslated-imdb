Together with the South Pacific, boys and dolls are for adults - they are sassi, sexy, and full of men being men and women who are tightened along. There is an energy and unity that makes this go out of the pack - the power of Jean Simmond's performance and the charm of a young Brando and an already sincere Sinatra adds much to the overall look and appearance of the play. Boys and dolls win because it's no doubt what it is: MGM music. It is still good to look and listen to too much songs and dance numbers - it will remain one of the cinemas of the 20th century cinema and will be watched with pleasure for years to come. <br /> <br /> Warmly recommended.
