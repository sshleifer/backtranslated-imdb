I first saw this movie as a pre-teenager, about the age when children start thinking through their identity. I was greatly affected by the scene of the man and the children he raised as his own. The biggest boy was suspected that his mother was a prostitute and that none of his brothers had the same biological father (which Kurosawa makes evident, having children that do not resemble the same). The man still persuades the boy that he is their father, by the only definition that matters. Man is appreciated to be the father of all children, but one who still prefers her brother. Each of the winners is also convincing for their own stories and conclusions. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie, even if it's not the biggest Kurosawa movie.
