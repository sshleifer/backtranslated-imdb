"Luzhin Defense" is, in the forefront, a story of an idiosyncratic Italian scholar (Turturro) who becomes consumed by the game and, in the background, through flashbacks, his childhood and the forces that created the man he has become. A good and bad factor in the form of his love interest (Watson) and former "mentor" (Wilson), respectively, you have a robbery drama with humorous and delicate moments mixed with the scenic picturesque beauty of Lake Como in Italy and the intensity of the high chess game. An excellent movie for those in antique drama, the author's euphemistic chess metaphor for delicious orgasm is an indication of the subtle spirit of the film.
