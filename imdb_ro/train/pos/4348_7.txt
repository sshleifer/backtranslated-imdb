Paul Reiser removed spotlight comedy to write a humorous and tender story about family - what we see and what we see, what we expect and what surprises us. Things about my colleagues set new standards for the film, but it's a great story well told that reminds us of the significant links that represent the family. Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) was a muncogol sometimes pushing his wife, Muriel (Olympia Dukakis), daughters (Mackenzie Connolly and Lydia Jordan) and his son Ben (Paul Reiser) in the background. One day, Muriel leaves a note that, after years of marriage, he leaves! Her daughters, along with Ben's wife, Rachel (Elizabeth Perkins), immediately begin to seek her location, leaving Sam to disturb, hurt and unhappy, in order to sort things out on a trip with his son Ben. Road trip becomes a time for the two men to learn who is the other, and what they themselves are considering the status of father and son and family. Sam relaxes for the first time in his life and now introduces Ben's work on pleasure and fun to live. The journey ends with a phone call to Muriel's location and why he left, and the regrouping of the wiser family draws the hot end of the story. Everything is not what it looked like: it's better and different. Falk and Reiser play each other as professionals, but in many ways the film belongs short moments when Olympia Dukakis is on the screen, reminding us that it is one of the most powerful matriarchal film. Well, worth watching. Grady Harp
