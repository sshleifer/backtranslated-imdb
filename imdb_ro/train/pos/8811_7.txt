Some different cinemas from different parts of the world are gathered in this film to present their views and ideas about the WTC attack. This is one of the best efforts you will ever see in any Movie. Such films are rarely made and appreciated. This movie tries to reach any possible core of the WTC. Here are some of the most important stories in the movie that make this movie so unique. There is the story of Samira Makhmalbaf (Iran) where somewhere in Iran are preparing the attacks in America. There is a teacher who tries to educate their students informing them that innocent people are killed in the WTC massacre. Then comes a story from Youssef Chahine (Egypt) where a film maker meets a face-to-face conversation with a dead soldier in the WTC attack and a Dead Terrorist Core Dead who was involved in the WTC attack. Then we see a story at Idrissa Ouedraogo (Burkina Faso), where a group of Five Innocent Children sees Osama Bin Laden and plans to kidnap him and earn reward money from America. Then we see the story of Alejandro Gozalez Inarritu (Mexico), where you see a black screen and slowly see the real pictures of the WTC buildings that descend. And the people who are stuck in the building get out of it to save their lives. The most important story is Mira Nair (India), where a mother struggles to gain respect for his Dead Son, whose name is falsely captured in the WTC massacre! After the September 11 attack, our heart beats automatically start pumping if we hear two names anywhere in the world. First is the World Trade Center and the second is Osama! This movie completely changes our perception and makes a strong point by claiming something more. I will definitely recommend this movie to all who love to have such Home DVD collections. It certainly deserves every penny you spend. But please do not expect anything other than the Movies on this DVD. There are, of course, movie movies by filmmakers, but without additional features.
