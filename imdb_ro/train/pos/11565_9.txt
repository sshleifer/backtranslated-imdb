SPOILERS <br /> <br /> In the words of Jean-Paul Sartre, "Hell is another people." In The Weird Couple, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau demonstrate how accurate this can be. Felix Ungar and Oscar Madison, Lemmon and Matthau, respectively, create two good friends who decide to live together. As the two begin to grow more and more and more frustrated, the laughs grow thick and fast before Felix leaves, leaving Oscar a change and more pure character. Jack Lemmon as Hungarian is absolutely gorgeous as a neurotic, divorced cleaning obsessed with life as one man. Walter Matthau, as opposed to Lemmon's character, is as good as a sloboc writer who simply wants to play poker to earn money for the benefit of his child. Lemmon and Matthau are magnificent in their selected parts, the degree depends on Neil Simon's beautiful screenplay and, at the same time, because they work well as a team. As two friends who are different in lifestyle, although similar in their relationship with ex-spouses and children, these two, late and great actors create a virtually impossible partnership to recreate. So great is that the world screamed so much for something similar, two years before Matthau's death and three before Lemmon, the characters were reunited in a lower continuation. This idea, while pursuing Hollywood's irritating obsession with sequels, could have worked to a certain extent, but at the same time could never come close to replicating the genius of this original film. Finally, it is not really possible to say anything else. With Simon's amazing scenario, humorous and laughing, the creators of this film were already in a shot. The Tower of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau as Felix Ungar and Oscar Madison are the most important part of this film. "The Couple Odd", with the traditional soundtrack (which won a tribute in "The Simpsons"), is an excellent script and is a genius who leads the men, is a tribute to cinema and a historical feature to remember.
