Excellent honest film with Peter Falk and Paul Reiser joining forces as father and father. The father turns up one evening to say that after more than 40 years of marriage, Mom (Olympia Dukakis) has left him. The rest of the film describes the father and son on a day trip to get the father's thoughts out of what happened. With them away, daughters can play detectives. The story shows the adventures of father and son in their discussion of life, what they should have, why the mother was complaining about my father while discussing their philosophies about life. We will see an unexpected fishing trip and pool game that leads to a close battle. Both men seem to burst out of their everyday life. The end is a downer while we find out why my mother left at once. It becomes a story of courage and human spirit in the face of adversity. It is never too late to change.
