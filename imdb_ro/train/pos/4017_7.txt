This is a very memorable Western spaghetti. He has a great story, interesting characters and a great action, especially from Rosalba Neri. Her role as the bad daze in this movie is truly classic. He steals in every scene he is in and expresses so much with his face and eyes, even when he does not speak. Her performance is very credible. It manages to be quite fascinating without being over the top (not that there is nothing wrong with being over the top). Mark Damon is surprisingly good in this movie as well. The musical score is excellent and the theme song is the kind that will play in your head constantly for a few days after seeing the movie whether you want it or not. There are some parts that are very funny. I especially like the side where Rosalba Neri is undressing in front of the parrot. There are also plenty of slick-play guns, which is very well done. I probably would have given this movie 8 or 9 stars if it was not for two things. The first is a bad beat in the bar room, which occurs about 25 minutes in the movie. This is one of the most ridiculous battles I've ever seen in a movie. It is badly choreographed and looks more like a number of bad music than any real fight. Some might overlook this if it were a comedy Terence Hill / Bud Spencer, but this is a more serious problem for the West, and the battle had to be more realistic. The other thing that upset me about this movie was Yuma's Mexican transporter. I think it was supposed to be a fun comic or something, but the character was stupid and useless in a movie like this one, and it was not funny at all. All I can say is where is Tuco when you need it? <br /> <br /> All that has been said, let me assure you that everyone reads that Johnny Yuma is a classic Western spaghetti despite the flaws I have mentioned, and all fans of the genre must to see this movie.
