"The Jedi Return" is often remembered for what he did wrong, rather than what he did right, and this is a shame because the last chronological installment of the Star Wars Saga is a brilliant example of epic stories. She manages to conclude all the story lines of previous films in a great final and makes her very convincing. Yes, there are the Ewoks - cute and cute bears, which undoubtedly widened Star Wars demography - and in the middle of the film tends to slow down a little. But the last hour is probably the best piece of the whole saga, in which Luke finally comes face to face with Darth Vader, the most grateful character in the history of the film. The Return of the Jedi has done so many things people tend to ignore: it has made an incredible conclusion with Darth Vader's story (which has gone from implacably to "Empire Strikes Back" to very convincing here), an extraordinary opening at the Jabba Palace, a proud performance of Ian McDiarmid the Emperor, Luke finally reaching out to himself, the resolution of Solo and Leia's romanticism, and the extremely powerful moments of Endor. Yes, there are some inconveniences. But they are the inconvenience of a generation of movies that have had time to straighten out each scene. It is still a moving and moving cinematic piece that also serves as a great final chapter. It's not a "good" movie - it's fantastic!
