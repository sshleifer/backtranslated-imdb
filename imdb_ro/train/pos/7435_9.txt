I first saw this video 15 years ago. I thought it was excellent then I still do it. I am a former English teacher (high school and college) and a romantic romantic poet, so Coleridge is very much with me. Anything that could distract the beauty of poetry or the power of the story will not get my vote of excellence. In this case, everything works well to attract the viewer, especially high school students. The story is well illustrated for a generation that grew up on television. In addition, Michael Redgrave's voice adds a sense of authenticity and authority. Okay, so there was a big budget for the project. So there were no Star Wars and there is no CGI in it. But who can reject Gustave Dor√©'s illustrations as part of the presentation? The above comment, which only four times rejects the video as a piece of garbage, is extremely inequitable and unperceptive. I'm a friend of the manufacturer, but it's not my reason for this comment. Rather, I defend an art thing that I think has value at all levels. It is very appropriate to bring Coleridge's poetry to students in a way that arouses their appreciation and awakens their sympathy for the lesson that the ancient sailor sends them.
