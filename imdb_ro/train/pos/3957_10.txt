The Three Stoogi have always been some of the many actors I've ever loved. I like almost every one of the shorts they've done. I like all six of Stooges (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe and Curly Joe)! All shorts are hilarious and also play many other great actors and actresses, many of them in many shorts! In my opinion The Three Stooges is one of the biggest actors ever and is the funniest comedy team! <br /> <br /> One of my favorite Stooges pants with Shemp is no other than Beware Wives! All those who appear in this short are beautiful Christine McIntyre, Dee Green, Doris Houck, Alyn Lockwood, Johnny Kascier, Nancy Saunders, Lu Leonard, Maxine Gates and Emil Sitka. Green and McIntyre offer great performances here! There are so many funny parts here. This is a short hilarious. There is another similar Three Stooges short as this one called Groom Brideless and we recommend both!
