Martin Sheen, Michelle Phillips, Stuart Margolin and young Vic Morrow are the human stars of this film about a young man looking for answers to his brother's death. Mister. Sheen, Mr. Margolin and Mr. Morrow turns into first-rate performances in their roles; Ms. Phillips has a little less enviable task to try to bring a television movie (twenty-five years ago), providing "sexual interest" in a sex-free movie. The real star, however, is the "California Kid"; a 1934 Ford coupe, borrowed from "Jake" Jacobs, in front of a room and given a workout that would leave the viewer panting, panting and holding the edge of the chair with a breathless anticipation. scenes are spectacular, (although some of the dialogues are a bit lame), making a beautiful evening deviation. This is how all "car movies" should be made. Try to catch it on the latest movie channel; well worth the lost sleep.
