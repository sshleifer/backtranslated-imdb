I fell in love with Laurence Olivier in the last few weeks, and I was thrilled to discover this jewel. I always seemed wonderful when I went through a movie where I did not have to put my finger on the remote control if the nudity raised its head ugly. Divorce Lady X is charming up to the final stage and must have been a real delight for viewers in 1938. I just want people today to accept and love true humor instead of terrible words that talk to people now funny. Divorce of Mrs. X is well worth everybody.
