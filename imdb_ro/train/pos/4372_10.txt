Rob Roy is also underestimated the epic of passion and action! Liam Neeson offers prominent performance as Rob Roy MacGregor, one of the best of his career. Jessica Lange is written as perfect as his wife Mary. It has the greatest passion and chemistry I've seen in a couple of screens. the best show aristocrat snotty.Tim Roth portrays one of the best screen players. The kidnapping of Mary is repulsive and disturbing. He is indeed a magnificent bastard in this film. The ultimate duel between Rob and Cunningham is one of the best fighting spades ever. scripted ans, and Michael Caton-Jones's direction is flawless. 10 out of 10.
