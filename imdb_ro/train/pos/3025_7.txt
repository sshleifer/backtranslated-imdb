Bacall does good here - especially with regard to this, it's just the second film. This is often overshadowed because it falls between two great successes: "Have and Did not Have" (1944) and "The Big Sleep" (1945), both associated with Humphrey Bogart. Given that this is not consistent with other films, but I think I have no fault on my own. I think there was a misery in presenting a British lady of crust. No accent. I think all the strange accents were distracting - Boyer was certainly not Spanish. It was hard to keep directly which countries in this country were from. I really liked the black and white cinema. Mood is accustomed to affect a lot - I especially liked the fog scene. Also, lighting makes an excellent job of adding to intrigue and tension. <br /> <br /> Bacall is just gorgeous. Boyer just does not fit the romantic driving role for me - so along with Bacall together it was a little weird. No great chemistry - and, of course, no magic Bogie and Bacall. But I still liked this picture. There is a lot of tension and it's moving pretty well. I have to say that I found the murder of the girl quite daring for the film of that time. Katina Paxinou and Peter Lorre stand out as a supporter. Paxinou, as the hotel's goalkeeper, is absolutely wicked and evil in her portrait. Her only scene in which she maniacally laughs as Mr. Muckerji leaves after she shows the child killer is quite disturbing. Lorre is doing pretty well in his slim, conteras serpent - a coward to the end. Wanda Bendrix is ​​doing pretty well in portraying the Else child - especially since this was her first photo and she was only 16 years old at the time (although she seems much smaller). Apparently, he later married Auie Murphy, who turned out to be a short-lived, married life.
