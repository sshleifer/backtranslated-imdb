A family (Patricia Clarkson, father-Jake Weber, son-Erik Per Sullivan) goes out for a family to meet in a distant house in the middle of winter. They accidentally hit a deer while driving there. This disturbs some locals - especially Otis (John Speredakos) and things slowly (very slowly) are not going well. I was expecting the worst thing when I started looking at this. Most reviews for this on this site are extremely negative. Well ... I do not agree. First is not a horror movie. Horror does not start until the 30 minutes are over. Rather, it plays a family drama with horror elements thrown in. At this level, it's pretty good. <br /> <br /> First, bad things: The rhythm is too slow; Jake Weber is a horrific actor; MODELS too many fakes of fear of dreams; Wendigo is barely in the movie and the clear vision we have about wendigo at the end is ridiculous. Good things: dramatically good enough scenario; Clarkson is excellent as a mother; a great direction with strange sound effects that are a little frightening; a fairly explicit sexual sequence between Clarkson and Weber (which is actually required for the integrity of the plot); quite well acting by Sullivan (only 10 at that time!) and Speredakos and an extremely unexpected tragic ending. I think many people are annoyed with this movie because it is pushed as a horror movie - which is not. So if you can ignore this, I think you like it. I give her a 7.
