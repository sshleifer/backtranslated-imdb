An example of how a World War II documentary should be made using the first-hand accounts of the actual troops and civilians who participated in this terrible conflict and archived images gathered over time. I caught this in a re-broadcast on the History Channel about a year and a half ago, without really knowing about the Second World War at that time, but it surrounds me and now I consider myself a world war 2 , looking at me and reading everything I can find about it, but nothing comes close to this reference document, it certainly deserves to buy the box set of ............. This is pure simply a documentation of the highest standard.
