Generally speaking, the plot was much better than I expected. The laughing trail was sometimes annoying and tended to cross; however, in this episode there were enough chuckles to make up for. My biggest surprise was that I found some of the best lines and the situations were not presented in the trailers. Spade, in particular, was not presented in the best light in previous promotions, but his character is pretty good in the pilot. There are plenty of eyes for you to enjoy almost anyone and all the regular characters seem to fall in front of them. Now if writers can live up to what they started.
