This movie is really good! The actor is fine, with an excellent cast of Corbin Bernsen as a perfectionist dentist who scares and tortures his patients. At first he sees his wife with the pool and then goes crazy. He also takes revenge on his wife and the guard, along with the patients he tortures. The most special effects are also beautiful, although some are really false (like a pierced tongue that has been set for a night off and still red in the morning). But the scenes of torture are absolutely well done. Although this film has the weak point that it is very slow; between heavy parts are sometimes only extremely boring parts. But for the real horror / thriller fan this is a must-watch!
