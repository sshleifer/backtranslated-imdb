Our song is a wonderful example of passionate shooting, at the best aesthetics. It is, in fact, an authentic wonder of a movie; a penetrating and inspirational artwork chronicling the life of three young girls in the inner city (Heights Brooklyn Crowns) during a private summers of their lives when the perplexities of their close maturity will cause everyone to make a number of difficulties by altering the choices who will probably redefine who each is, and how they will continue to relate to each other in the coming years. Jim McKay's writing / direction is graceful and unclear. There is no sentimental feeling, no free, no clichish solutions in this movie. What we see here sometimes seems to be heart of reality. There is a naturalism - a credibility if you want - in our Song, which surpasses that of other giants of this genre, including American Graffiti and Cooley High. Much of the credit for the spirit of the film goes its main actors. The combined presence of Melisa Martinez (Maria), Kerry Washington (Lanisha) and Anna Simpson (Joycelyn) is stunning. It would be easy - and, obviously, obscene - to reject, as some seemingly, the performance of these three as apathetic or nonemotional. In fact, their quiet charm, the instinctive sense of their dignity and their gross intelligence, sometimes unconventional, throughout the film, are absolutely riveted. One should be completely "without contact" with or completely indifferent to the adolescent's behavior of losing the resounding authenticity of what these three young ladies bring to the screen. Also, support distribution, especially Marlene Forte as Lanishe's mother, compliments the work of the three girls as well as the general tone of the film. Our song is a movie that should not be missed by anyone of any age.
