A magical journey created by Alexander Korda and Michael Powell. The two TITANIs of British cinema have mixed some fabulous ingredients to produce a cinematic masterpiece! Some of the boldest Technicolor early, a musical score SUBLIME and shining music for Miklos Rozsa, along with the exuberance of Sabu's youth, Conrad Veidt's theatrical and malicious disgrace and June Duprez's beauty and distinct voice as a princess, work great. Miles Malleson, who plays father Duprez, the sultan of Basra, also wrote the perfect script, which is appropriately grandiose. DO NOT LOVE THIS! From posting the comments above, I got the recently released DVD and I can honestly say I did not see the correct image until I saw this DVD version-The clarity and resolution are so precise and the colors are so vivid that I was amazing - the amazing classic can be watched again and never manages to charm and delight the viewer. Again, you have to see!
