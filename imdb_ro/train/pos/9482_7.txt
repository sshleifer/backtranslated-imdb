Henri Verneuil was the commercial cinematographer in France from the 1960s to the 1980s. Always strong at the box office and, as a rule, the story of drastic and suspicious stories about casino robberies, the disappearance of mafia scores and World War II battles, Verneuil could be counted to give us two solid hours of entertainment Saturday night. She worked with the male actors of his days: Gabin, Belmondo, Fernandel, Delon, Sharif, Anthony Quinn. I ... Icare is the only time he directed Yves Montand. It's a strange static film, mainly in offices and conference rooms, which does not contain a chase scene and no violence. Montand offers good performance if it is somewhat dry, and is well supported by other actors. I could not wonder what Costa-Gavras did with this story, based on Z (assassination of Lambrakis) and L'aveu (torture of Artur London in Czechoslovakia by the Stalinists).
