Much has been said about Shinjuku Triad Society as the first true movie "Miike" and I thought this type of description could have been a cliché. But, like all the clichés, it is based on the truth. All Miike trademarks are here, violence, black humor, homosexuality, taboo testing and the central character that is difficult to desire. Shinjuku is nevertheless one of Miike's finest movies. He says in an interview that if he did it again, it would be different, but not necessarily better. I think what he's saying is that the movie has a really exciting energy and a crude advantage that looks so fresh that although it could capture a much more complex video from a visual or technical point of view it could not replicate or better the purity of this movie. <br /> <br /> As you might expect, violence is absolutely visceral, beatings and beatings are complemented by a fantastic scene in which a woman has a stool thrown on her face. (Only a movie Miike could leave you with a sentence like this.) The film has a fantastic rhythm, unlike Dead or Alive, which begins and ends strongly and falls in the middle. Dead or Alive deals with similar issues, Miike is clearly worried about the relationship between the Japanese and the Chinese in the post-war era, and this emotional subject is dealt with here, the central character that really comes when you begin to understand his past. <br /> <br /> I can not sing enough Shinjuku's praise. I do not want to give too much. This is Miike before he starts using CGI to animate his films and almost recalls anything like Kitano Sonatina. The central characters are gorgeous and the last twist guarantees that as soon as the movie is finished, you will resume it again to solve everything.
