"Tenant" is the biggest film by Roman Polanski IMO. And I like "Chinatown," but it's more original and unconventional and even creepy. It's also a great black comedy. Some people have shown me that this movie was * very disturbed * by him afterwards so that he is warned that it affects some people this way. Polanski does a great job, playing the lead role in "The Locator" as well as directing it.
