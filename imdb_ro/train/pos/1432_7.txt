He was really looking forward to seeing this movie, because it was announced as a movie must-see for those who love movies about nature. The film shows different climates and animals associated with them from the North Pole and heading south while the film progresses. The recordings in this movie are often wonderful and I often asked how they could have taken some pictures underwater or in the sky. No matter how beautiful, much of the movie I've already seen on the TV series "Planet Earth," reported by David Attenborough. We found Attenborough's narrative about Earth Planet to be much better than Earth's narration. "Earth" is an easier movie. It ignores much of the scientific details that Attenborough covers in its "Planet Earth" series. For example, Earth will tell you that a tropical sea is an ideal garden for a young whale because there are few predators. Planet Earth will tell you that a tropical sea is a good kindergarten because the water has a low oxygen level and does not contain enough nutrients to support very large animals such as big sharks, etc. For me, there is an important difference. This, along with Attanborough's much larger voice, makes Planet Earth a documentary document much better than the Earth. Still, I think the Earth deserves to look for beautiful footage and the fact that it's easier to understand makes it interesting for kids too.
