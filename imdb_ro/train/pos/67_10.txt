The industry has lowered the ball on this. The trailer does not justify the movie and when it was opened on a screen full of screens. If people had the opportunity to see this, mouthwash would have done it successfully. The 2 actresses lead you with a special emotional performance that really attracts you to the story and especially to the characters. I checked this on the recommendation of Richard Roeper or (Ebert and Roeper) in his book. An example of a great movie that was not fully released on just a few screens. Which did not give a chance to be seen. Some movies go fast to video because they are not that good. This is an Oscar worthy and is a tragedy on many levels that most will never hear. Perhaps word by mouth will win a message on DVD or cable. If you have not seen this movie, you should. The great performances of the 2 lead actresses make this film. It could have been another adolescent film after a special school, but in return it is good for other remarkable films. The interrupted face comes to mind. If you like that you will like it. <br /> <br /> Both girls are in an amazing emotional scene after another, without moving away like melodramatic. Even though Alicia is angry and Deanna is crying through most of the movie she's done is a way so real that she does not come out as stereotypical or melodramatic characters. The movie will move you in many scenarios, and if you are an aspiring actor, use this real performance as a school. Erica is even better in this case than in Traffic. I hope both actors get more roles that use their talents and let them shine. Watch this movie and, if you like it, recommend it to your friends so that they do not get lost among all the crap that appear every year. This movie was buried while Spiderman 2 recorded charts. What kind of word do we live in? AGHhh. So, to make the world see this again and recommend it.
