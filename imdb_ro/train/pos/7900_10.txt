I admit, the first time I saw Even Cowgirls Get the Blues, I did not think it was very memorable in every respect. But now, after seeing her the seventh time, I admit it has grown so much on me. The characters of Sissy, Mrs. Jellybean and the Countess became very bold. And the love between Sissy and Jellybean seems very sweet. Although the plot is very weak, I think satirical humor is more than it does for him. Then there is the kick-ass soundtrack, which features extremely talented KADs. Lang (which reminds me a little of Patsy Cline) for the best. I can not think of any movie that "grew up on me" after a first inactive impression, just as much as Cowgirls.
