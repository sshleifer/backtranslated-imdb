This show is great. I thought the two episodes in which Paul died were so sad; I actually cried. But the other shows were wonderful; Kerry was my favorite character because he was in the "dark side". I also thought Bridget was fun, because she was very perishable. I also thought the guy who played Kyle was really cute. I liked when Kerry made sarcastic remarks about everything. The guy who played Rory was cute, and Paul, played by John Ritter, was very funny. The entire TV show is funny and I'd like to be still on TV. when they showed it on TV, though, I saw it every time it was. The next time I look, I'll follow it again and again.
