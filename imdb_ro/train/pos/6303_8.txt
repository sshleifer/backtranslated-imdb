After I heard positive reviews and saw the trailer, I had to see this movie. With William H. Macy, Luis Guzman, Michael Jeter and Sam Rockwell, he has to be good. And he gave it. Generally, the movie is not funny, but there is a scene that really stands out and is, in my eyes, a classic. SPOILER At the end, where they break through the wall to get to the safe and see Rockwell and Washington look at Jeter it's fantastic. This is as good as the Big Lebowski scene where The Dude uses a chair to barricade the door, but forgets the door is turning outward! END SPOILER Just go see this movie, you will not be disappointed.
