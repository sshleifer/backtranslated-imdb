I do not expect this movie to be well understood by viewers in Romania. This certainly says about the value, or perhaps the lack of universality of the film, but also about the way in which the history and even the lives of ordinary people were in Romania compared to other countries, even in Eastern Europe. <br /> <br /> The film is a adaptation of a novel by Marin Preda, a controversial novelist who died during the communist regime shortly after publishing the book. She tells of an intellectual, professor of philosophy whose life is crushed after being imprisoned on false accusations at the end of the Stalinist era. In fact, the first part of the film tells about his struggle for survival in prison, the second describes his attempt to regain his life after being released. His release is in fact only apparent, Romania in the 1960s demands different types of compromises and crimes, but yet his struggle for survival is as difficult as in prison. The film is splendid by some of the best Romanian actors. Stefan Iordache, who plays the main role, would be at another time and another place a mega-star, we can get here a good glimpse of his fabulous art. Although it suffers from a hesitant story and sometimes falls into non-essential details or comics, the film is still an important landmark for Romanian cinema, as well as for the process of recovering moral and historical values ​​in Romanian society.
