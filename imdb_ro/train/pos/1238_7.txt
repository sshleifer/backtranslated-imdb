While this film has many flaws, it's actually a fun movie from the 1980s. Eddie Murphy rises during the 80 films here. While its character is indistinguishable from previous films, its calendar is almost flawless, with perfect partners and foils. Young this with the hypnotic beauty of Charlotte Lewis, this makes for a fun daytime action comedy rain show. <br /> <br />
