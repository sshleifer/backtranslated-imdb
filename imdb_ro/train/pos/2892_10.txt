Cinderella .... I have not been looking at this movie for about five years the last time I saw it. Magic remains. There is something that surely contains that story book, the songs are entertained, and the secondary character is everything I pray for. The villains, in the form of stepped sisters, are perfectly evil and upset. Then it is the most magical of all Disney, the mice that make the dress, and you know the rest. To summarize the four Disney princess movies are all wonderful, but this is a charming magical experience, watch and enjoy yourself. Oh and, of course, Cinderella is great as the main character in the movie. If you think about it, Disney movies can lose their charm. With Elene Wood and others the movie has such a sense, you just can not smile. They say the moral of this story is that dreams come true. Of course, in the real world, some are believers and others are hoper. In this movie it is even more magical when her rainbow comes smiling. <br /> <br /> And of course the rest is ... Cinderella
