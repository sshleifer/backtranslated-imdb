Another very good film by Mann due to the combination of father-son of Walter Brennan and Jimmy Stewart. Brennan (Ben Tatum) is often the comic consciousness of Stewart or Wayne (Red River / Rio Bravo). He is there to see that the younger man takes a stroll or a bend. "You're wrong, Mr. Dunston." Jeff Webster (Stewart) gives the impression that he only cares about himself, but it is clear that he can not leave Brennan. John McIntire is excellent as Skagway's law, with respect for the pitfalls of justice over his reality. Another key theme is to help people and, in their turn, be helped by people. The only one can not and does not suffer for it. The above legend plays in Tatum's statement that he can not live without his coffee. This addiction to nicotine turns out to be fatal. Probably the first and last time on the screen. We recommend this movie and now you own the DVD.
