I just want to say that this can be biased because I'm a producer on film. However, I will maintain a sense of dignity. The star of the film, Oscar Ovies, offers stellar performance as Jeff Grinderlin, a crazy hypocondriac, who spends more time worrying than living. He brings a certain touch to his character, which really allows the audience to connect with him, often expressing his mind and a sense of tough comedy. His mother, played by Christine Haber, is the steady support beam that, without him, will collapse upon him. His friends also give a hand to Jeff's life, often making choices for him rather than letting him use his free will ... which he often neglects is anyway there. <br /> <br /> Writing is gorgeous, and conversations flow like scenes from a Kevin Smith movie with half the boo-hoo celebrations Ben Affleck. at some points, and the sound could also use an impulse, yet the performances did not shine the minor details. It is also supported by a beautiful soundtrack, with local talent and an exceptional composer. On the whole, this was a living. A rare jewel among many jewels.
