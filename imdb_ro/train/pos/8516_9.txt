This movie is an extremely fun and unimaginable story about an orphanage who has financial problems. When the director goes on holiday, his father agrees to temporarily go into things. This is positive the best work that Leslie Nielson has ever done. His idea in the movie to rent children is immediately innovative, and his selling techniques will certainly make you laugh. The little girl in this movie is so sweet and charming that I know I will never forget it. Just make sure you do not miss the first five minutes of the movie! <br /> <br /> Such a great family entertainment is so rare these days. If you go for easy horn pictures with the happy end, go for it! I could see this many times, and I often do! My only complaint about this movie is that it's so difficult to find a copy.
