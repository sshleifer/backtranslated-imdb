I never knew about a movie that arouses such a debate in my life. Believe me when I say that this movie will eventually be remembered as a classic all the time. I've been waiting for this movie as I've loved Lock, Stock .... and Snatch so far, but after a few negative comments I thought she would be very disappointed. I have absolutely loved this movie and can not wait to see it again. This movie is completely different from both the Ritchie films mentioned above, and also much better. I have my choice of favorite directors, but none of them has made a move as big as Guy Ritchie has just made this movie. I think he made the film on another level (I know most people will laugh at this commentary that guides the reaction to this movie, but I think time will prove good to me). This movie is very confusing and it went on far more than the running time of about 2 hours because I could not think of it or try to do things together. I now have a pretty good look at all that's happening in this movie (some of the unlimited hours of thinking, some answers from reading others on the film) and now I can not wait until Sunday when I see it again. I hope people go to the cinema with an open mind and, hopefully, be rewarded as I and many others have.
