Stack should have received the Academy Award for this performance, period. It's a crime he did not do. Amazing how humanizes a rich, worthless character. <br /> <br /> Dorothy Malone has earned her a well-deserved Oscar for her performance. In fact, everything that works in this movie is great. The plot begins with a taxi ride, then with a plane ride, then continues to go on an emotional walk that will keep you going all the way. You will be entertained! <br /> <br /> However, this is just a soap opera. One-dimensional, 100% smaller. You may call it "the last", because the action is so profoundly triumphant on the material. Excellent acting, well-directed, but strictly in his soap type. I would not even call a melodrama (such as "Mildred Pierce" or "Imitation of Life"). Although it does not deny the extraordinary entertainment value of this film, you can only imagine what could be accomplished by this talented and talented director with a more substantial subject.
