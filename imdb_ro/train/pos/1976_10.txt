The man who directed "The Third Man" also directed the movie "Who will buy" in "Oliver!" Now, this is the talent. I pick up Carol Reed's hat. I know there are "two units" involved, but still ... And he had to deal with Orson Welles and Oliver Reed ... I assume the quality will come out. (It shows up in the final scene with Nancy [avoiding the spoiler - everyone needs to see Oliver for the first time].) How many lines I have to type. <br /> <br /> Encouraging people to write too much should not be encouraged. <br /> <Hope this is considered "line 10".
