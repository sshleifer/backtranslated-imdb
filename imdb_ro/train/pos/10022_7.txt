Aro Tolbukhin burnt seven people on a mission in Guatemala in the 1970s. He also said he killed another 16 people (killed pregnant women and then burned them). This film is a documentary portraying Aro's personality through several interviews with people who have met him and through certain scenes played by actors based on real facts. "Aro Tolbukhin" is a serious, so analytical work, is not morbid at all. Such a frightening testimony of how a trauma from childhood can transform a man into a monster. <br /> <br /> * My Ratio: 7/10
