David Beckham is a British football star and Victoria Beckham's husband ("Spice Posh" from Spice Girls). His mark is a blow to the field and the net. The soccer equivalent of a non-slip ball in a baseball. "Bend it like Beckham" means doing this kind of spectacular shooter. Besides, a small shrine for him in the main character bedroom and a faux-cameo at the end, the film has nothing to do with it. The movie is full of soccer in a little buy-in, such as the presence of one of the character's parents giving him a 9th shirt on him (the property of great Mia Hamm, to those known), references to "Posh 'n' Becks" a video tribute to WUSA, one of the characters, playing for an unbelieving friend ("they have that"), lesbian gangs, sport-bra gags and so on. The story is about a teenage girl in England who idols Beckham and wants to be a soccer star. It has a real gift, but the two seemingly insurmountable obstacles to overcome are the absence of a professional women's league in the UK (and hence the fascination with WUSA) and her Indian immigrant parents in very old ways that do not allow daughters, among other things, to get involved in contact sports. The family of the girl is portrayed as ironic, but with great affection - think of the Greek wedding "My Big Fat". The girl loves them and respects them enough to go through the sitcom's hell to hide their role in football more and more.
