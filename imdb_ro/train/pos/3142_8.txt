As a truly diverse distribution, this show hits the FOX. It's kind of a sitcom that grows on you. If you watch just one show, you may not like it too much, but once you look at two or three, worry. This is because some jokes hit and some miss depending on how you see them. As is usual today, the themes are very mature. Humor is usually very mature. Often, the funniest parts are the parts where mature themes collide with the innocent. Red (Kurtwood Smith), a veteran actor, has a very good humor in this show. Debra Jo Rupp plays well in this whole. Danny Masterson, the oldest actor of "children," is also very good. Laura Prepon (Donna) looks better in previous shows as a natural redhead (who had the idea of ​​making her blonde?). It often shows very good talent and comedy time. She looks good without doing too. This is one of the best entries on FOX in the sitcom department and is the most successful live action from Married with children
