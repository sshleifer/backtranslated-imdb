I liked very much. In fact, if I see it again (and I'm going to), I can love it. I will repeat other commentators saying that this movie is really developing as you look. It starts quite slowly, but the way it is dressed is very natural and has a mood. You just got into it. I really liked the summer movie atmosphere and I thought the movie was very moving overall. Characters have a strong element of realism, and the movie very slowly and delicately carries a spell while engaging in the various interactions of all and you want to know how it will eventually prove and what trails the characters choose. <br /> <br /> I am very surprised that there are less than a dozen comments on the subject - there are obscure TV films that have more reviews than Rich In Love. One thing I'm going to say is that I miss the end that creeps me and I have to see it again to see it. This is a movie that may not be for everyone, but I feel strongly underestimated (even some of my lucky friends, who have seen almost every movie, have not seen this), nor does it seem to have a great part of a message board, but I liked it very much, and to all those who enjoy family-based dreams that are warm on the landscape, atmosphere, and an undisturbed, deceptive rhythm, they should probably look at it. Especially since it is worth noting that it is taking place in South Carolina, for those who (like me) who love the South and the films that take place there is a jewel. I will add my vote in the great comments of few and I recommend that you make this film little known.
