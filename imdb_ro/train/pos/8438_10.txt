HLOTS was a remarkable series, which NYPD Blue will never be, on HLOTS plots are real, dialogue is real, relations are real. With HLOTS back as a movie, Joining all the free ends, it was good for the whole gang to come back together, even a few who died to show up (not to say how). The story was fast, moving and moody the series had one week a week. Homicide, Life on the Streets, Network Drama at BEST !!!! 5 STARS !!!! Thumbs UP and all this. Thanks NBC for giving us in the end we did not get!
