The wonderful story of romantic comedy about an Italian widow (Cher) who intends to marry a man she feels comfortable (Danny Aiello) until she falls for his tough and angry brother (Nicholas Cage). The script is sharp, with lots of wonderful lines, the acting is wonderful, the accents (I'm told) are perfect letters and the cinema is beautiful. New York has never looked so good on the screen. We have to look first for Cher and Olympia Dukakis - both are fantastic and they deserved the Oscars they received. A beautiful, funny movie. I need to see!
