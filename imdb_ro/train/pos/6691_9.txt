This movie is very fun. What makes it particularly important is two things: one is the way the characters embrace stereotypes, discussing their costumes and superpowers. There is a charming seriousness to the parody that is very appealing; the second is the basic joy of the characters and the quality of the chemistry. Claire Forlani deserves a special note as an object of Mr Furious's wishes. There are a lot of talents here. I realize that some with great expectations could have been disappointed, but this movie is very fun and sweet.
