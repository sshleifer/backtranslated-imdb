This movie certainly has a big finger from me. There are jokes full of witchcraft and even occasionally, stereotypical and disturbing opinions about the Eastern European people, have been sewn on me throughout the film. The land is smart and 100% original and will guess you throughout the movie. The only person I was impressed with was Hilary Duff. It's simple and simple to see that he's made a leap of faith that came out of the "chicken-flick" genre he used to. Her accent is excellent, and her interpretation was surprisingly clear and well executed. It's the best interpretation I've ever seen from Hilary and I've seen most of her films. Her character, Yonica Babyyeah, is described as "Britney Spears in Eastern Europe," and this is seen in some of her manners and the song "I Want to Suffer You ... ... ... Up". You are also sorry for her, because her interpretation really understands you, Yonica is a very complex and confusing character. Joan Cusack has made me laugh all along the movie, with her humor sometimes harassing, but also with facial expressions and so on. John Cusack's spiritual dialogue will probably make you laugh. I strongly recommend this movie.
