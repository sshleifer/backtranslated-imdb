Joseph H. Lewis was one of the best directors of the noir movie. This is certainly the best. It does not have some of the standard features of what we call film noir. Although it is made by Americans, it is entirely established in England. It's free of gangsters. She lacks a fatal female. There is no crime. <br /> <br /> The character of the title responds to an ad. She's happy to make some money as a secretary. Instead, she wakes up days later as the pawn in a frightening plot. Only a very strong person could survive such an unpleasant terrifying attempt. And Nina Foch gives the meaning of a strong woman like Julia. Part of the enthusiasm comes from casting against the guy: Mrs. Foch has an elegant manner. She is not a screaming victim. It's actually a little frozen and patrician, though impeccable. This makes the story of her character even more credible. The most fascinating element is certainly the casting of Dame May Witty. She was (and is) probably the most famous for the charming title character of The Lady Vanishes. It has a sweet and innocuous way, easy dithering. But here he is far from a heroine. George Macready is excellent as her extremely troubled son. All distribution is, in fact, superb. It seems that this famous and brilliant film was made almost accidentally. Undoubtedly, the director knew exactly what he was doing. But he did it at a low budget. This is the thrill and charm of the film noir, the real movie: it is small, convincing of low life, and, in this case, unforgettable.
