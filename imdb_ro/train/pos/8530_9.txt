You're not sure why it's not played in Peoria, it seems, but this is a very funny, intelligent British comedy. It is at the end of the '60s. Peter Sellars is fantastic as a rich woman for forty years. Goldie Hawn, who has a 19-year-old girl in London, is originally Sellars' catch-up. But the urban television critic can not stop falling for the blond American blonde. Humor, patos, great scenario, strong driver performance and support cages. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie, and the best gag is the last line. <br /> <br /> Try it, you will.
