Get ready for this: this is one of my favorite movies of all time. I am relatively unaware of other works by David Mamet (writer and director), but after watching this movie a dozen times (it's always a joy to watch), I can say without hesitation that he is a genius. This movie is extremely well written and draws you quickly in its environment of deception, consolation and agitation behind the camera. The film's feel is very similar to The Sting (1973) and also deserves a tribute to the noir movie. It's a psychologically complex film and it will surely make you think about the different intuitions and motifs of the shaded characters. It is sometimes predictable, but the shocking climax is always interesting to watch. Generally, the actor is great - especially Joe Mantegna - but someone I watched the film remarked to me that it's not a good idea to have a heroine (Lindsay Crouse) who is not just a player, a smoker and a thief, but also a bad haircut for 80 years. I agree, but I think it is remarkable in the role. The less you know about the plot of the film, the better, like Mamet's latest film, The Spanish Prisoner, because the end will be even more impressive. Just sit back and be ready to go for a ride with a movie that comes dangerously close to brilliance.
