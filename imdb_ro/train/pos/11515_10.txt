It has been so many years since I saw this, but I feel compelled to defend this jewel against those who strike it. It is interesting and unusual to see the diversity of opinions here. That supposes humor. It's subjective. She either charges through your funny bone at 60,000 volts or leaves you cold and wonders why you have given her time. This show has some of the best comic actors in the UK who put together in a story that is bad and irreversible and the result is hilarious. Visual dialogue and comedy are delivered nicely, and the two exits (Cleese and Lowe) are gorgeous together. This was done for them. I can not say anything other than to beg you to find this and to follow it. You will not be disappointed and in a world free of delicate humor, this is an unusual classical and harmless piece of comic brilliance.
