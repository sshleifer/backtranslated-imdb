I loved this movie since it first came out. I was 9 years old, and now I'm 27 years old. I remember playing the Sega Genisis video game. I had so much fun, I would love to show this son to my son. He also likes Michael Jackson and I know he will love this movie just as I did when I was a kid. Even though he is much younger than when I first saw him. I can not wait to appear on DVD! Hope it will appear on DVD! Please let him get out on DVD! I'm going to see her again! Well, this is my comment I hope one day soon I'll get to see this movie again. I like all the videos in this movie. My favorite mini-video is Badder!
