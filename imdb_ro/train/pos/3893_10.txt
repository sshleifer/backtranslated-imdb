What more can someone want? It is a history lesson, a language teacher, a representative of ANR and an ambassador in Burundi, dressed in a beautiful silk dress and heels. I laughed so loud that I left a puddle. Its puberty, transvestism, public school and multilingual disorder have made the best absolute stand-up routine ever seen. I'm thinking about it now, years later when I see the cake (tea and cake or death) and hear something translated in French (the mouse is under the table, the cat is sitting and the monkey is on the branch.) Versions of what could be called Jerry Dorsey before settling on Englebert Humperdinck. Thank you for your time.
