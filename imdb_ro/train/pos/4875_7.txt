"The father is still far from business" was the title of a review after the premiere of "Promise Me This" in Cannes. I understand why many believe that Kusturica's unique expression is still present in his new film and is something that critics can not touch. I had two hours of pure energy without rest. Even when Kusturica suffers from lack of concentration or fear of empty space, he is still unique and untouchable. Stribor Kusturica's surprisingly good performance. Much closer and fewer landscapes, then in "Life is a miracle". Marija Petronijevic has a world-class fatal potential, please do not ruin him. I certainly recommend to everyone to see this movie.
