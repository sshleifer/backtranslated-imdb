I do not like "grade inflation," but I was just about to give that. 10. I can not think of anything I did not like. I saw her last night, and I woke up today thinking about it. I'm sure the Hollywood remake I'm talking about with J Lo and Richard Gear will be great, but this original Japanese version of 1996 was so exciting and provocative to me that it's hard to I think any way through which it could be improved or the setting changed into another culture. A story I found in my mind and with a fist or gun fight or something like that! Imagine! All the characters seemed well-developed, ... even the non-primary characters had a good character development and a pleasant act, and casting seemed very appropriate. <br /> <br /> It's always hard to find a good musical movie nowadays and maybe it does not qualify pretty well (there's a lot to learn how to dance but not sing) but I think Gene Kelly and others who have held a dancing place in our lives would have believed so much about this film and about the role of dancing in helping to tell a story about a middle-aged man who is successful with a family in Japan looking for something ... he does not know exactly what. For the Japanese people who contributed to this film, I thank you for creating and building it.
