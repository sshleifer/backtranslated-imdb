This particular subject, Joe McDoakes, was obviously inspired by the spectacular "Warner Brothers," a spectacular show called "Thank Your Stars Lucky," one of those post mortem war morale boosters. At that time, Eddie Cantor played both himself and a comedian who wanted to get into the movies, except for his resemblance to Cantor. George O'Hanlon who starred in McDoakes is both himself and McDoakes, who are trying to make a break in the film. Just like Thank you to your lucky stars, a few Warner Brothers players contracted players with a free time strolling through this movie. O'Hanlon was sent by a central casting for the role of a single line in a World War I movie, but the McDoakes Quest seeks the message. The poor is so nervous about his big moment, he begins to think about ways to deliver a single line. Maybe it sounds like a real movie star would be helpful. 86 later, to the exasperation of director Ralph Sanford and patient Clyde Cook, who plays a British cockney soldier, they find a niche in the movie business for the poor McDoakes. It is worth seeing this very funny subject that was nominated for the Oscar to find out what's going on with O'Hanlon / McDoakes. Both.
