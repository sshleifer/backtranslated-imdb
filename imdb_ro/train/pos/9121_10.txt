SPOILS CONTAINED FOR AN OBSERVATION. Twenty years since 1984, this film talks about Prince's future in the music industry. There is a scene that sums up Prince's musical production over the past 10 years is perfect, that is, if you've got the two best songs in the last 10 albums, you'll have a fantastic album! The scene plays as such. The Prince goes to the guard room after he plays a song, and the club owner enters the locker room to give Prince a story about his graceful fall in the '90s and staging albums that only the most talented fans powerful might tolerate and sustain his artist. <br /> <br /> The owner of the club - "Do not dress them as you are. The only person who cuts your music is you!" <br /> <br /> Spooky huh! How about the musical emphasis that makes Prince worse when pushing Apollonia to the ground in two separate scenes! It made me chills that it was not the only scene of women when she was ill-treated in this movie. I'm still sparring the comedy between Morris Day and Jerome Benton as these two stole every scene they were in. But what was funny about throwing a woman in a trash? It was terrible! The other bolbot was the chalk contour of Prince's father on the floor, thought carefully by Minnieapolis police, which makes the prince go even further! FANTASTIC! <br /> <br /> Purple Rain is a global entertainment movie because it is the soundtrack of Prince songs, which increases its value by 110%. But again, the film gives us another theory on Prince and his music, because the film tells us that Prince's biggest song is filmed by Wendy, lisa and the princess beat my dad! and the directors are trying to tell us that the Prince stole all the best songs from his father after finding his parents' music sheet of written songs? Maybe that's why Prince started getting out of steam in the 90s because he ran away from his father's ideas ..... Hmmmm .....
