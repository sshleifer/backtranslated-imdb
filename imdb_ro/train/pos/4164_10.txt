These childhood memories ... when things were new, and we were full of curiosity about the world around us; because we took these first initial steps in the long journey that we call life. One of the initial memories I've got since childhood is this animated "Galaxy Express 999" program about a guy named Tetsuro who goes on a train ride around the galaxy hoping to win a mechanical body to avenge senseless death of his mother, in the hands of mechanical hunters who gather with cold souls trophies. Along with Tetsuro on his trip is Maetel, a beautiful golden beauty woman who reminds her of the mother she lost with all those years ago ... Back in the early 80s as a boy who attended the kindergarten and the first years of the elementary school in Seoul, South Korea, "Galaxy Express 999" was a phenomenal popular animation program imported from Japan that inspired young boys who wanted to dream countless adventures on their often tumultuous and lively journey expected. Memories of adjusting in this animated program on business days between 18:00 and 19:00 before bedtime ... <br /> <br /> There were wonderful memories without ever being again .. When I moved to America and while living here for over two decades, I sometimes wondered about that time and place in a country thousands of miles away, divided in America of an extremely vast ocean of this childhood program, and the boy named Tetsuro, his protective company Maetel, the enigmatic driver of the train and the Galaxy Express 999 train. <br /> <br /> Many Last year, while I was in Korea, I was able to watch DVD a copy of the original "Galaxy Express 999" (1979) and brought back a lot of memories nostalgic and heart. "Galaxy Express 999" remains as exciting as the first time you discovered it all those years ago, opening up the nostalgic memories of new discoveries, an important foundation stone for young boys who have fought and hired in the journey of their lives to the man. /> <br /> Here's the wonderful memories. "Goodbye, Maetel. Goodbye, Galaxy Express 999 ..." Goodbye in childhood. " <br /> <br />
