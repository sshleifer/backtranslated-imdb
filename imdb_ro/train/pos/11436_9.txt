This is the kind of image that John Lassiter would do today if it were not for CGI advances. And that's just saying that he would have forgotten if technology had not done sexy and noisy things since 1983. Two ... they have the same wisdom, imagination and sensation of real enthusiasm that you would find in a Pixar film, performed under the environmental restrictions only in 1983. Innovative animation techniques combine with an excellent script and an excellent voice to produce a multi-level film. You should talk in the same breath with _Spiritited Away_ and _Toy Story_.
