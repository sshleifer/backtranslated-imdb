I'm a big Jim Carrey fan. I laughed ASS during Liar Liar and Ace Ventura. I also like it in his serious films, especially at the Truman Show. This is a cross between his VERY funny side and his serious side. He is, of course, VERY funny in this movie, but there are parts that are very serious, and he pulls it easily. he is indeed an actor with more functions. As for the rest of the cast, I was pleased with the act of Jennifer Aniston. I think she is more than a pair of beautiful tits and a big ass. Morgan Freeman is a very cool God. As for Steven Carell, its limited scenes are VERY funny, especially in the anchor scene. Generally, I had to record this scenario 9. A good script, funny script and some very serious situations make this a very good movie.
