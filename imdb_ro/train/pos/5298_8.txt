John Waters gave us a really nice movie. Surely this is not without Waters' shocking moments, but rather than its older cultural things, such as "Pink Flamingoes." "Pecker" returns to John's early stage in the sense that he reminds the spectator of the same kind of humor evident in "Polyester." Generally, a really fun comedy with some great moments!
