Opening credits: awesome. Music: Exactly for this movie. Cinematography: Disturbing to a great effect. <br /> <br /> This is how they are out of control, some lives can become. "Wonderland" describes drug-induced savagery (and its consequences) not as an aberration, but it shows how it really happens in our society. It's better than the pictures of another wild group - Manson - because all the movies, books, etc. Manson's focus is so much on Manson's mad mind, rather than the general image of cheap fame and randomness, which is today so pervasive. <br /> <br /> If you want to see some of the best "ways to act" on film, watch Kilmer in this movie. He shows how the "Method" can be riveted into the right role. Film makers here are able to raise "out-of-control" to a form of art, not only for the sake of cheap emotions.
