I found this movie to be suspense from the beginning. When Miss Stanwyck starts her story, it's only a few minutes before you realize it's all about the problems. The deserted area, the blocking of the deserted gas station door, everything is ready to wait ... here comes. At first you think it's about a little boy, but too soon you start to keep breathing while looking into the sea. I found that this movie is very stressful, even if I followed it before and I was ready for the outcome. Now, a movie that can keep you in suspense even when you've seen it before it deserves some kind of special assessment, maybe a white white prize?
