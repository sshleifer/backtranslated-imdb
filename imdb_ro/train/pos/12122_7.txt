The movie can be great. I just saw her last night, but I do not feel able to give him an honest opinion because I read the first book. The book is much better than the film that I was disappointed with the film. If you are planning to watch "De Bondage Human", do not read the book in advance. On the other hand, the book is so good and contains much more than Phillip's business with Mildred, yet you can enjoy it after seeing the movie. I do not make this easy statement. I read on average one book every 4 days and read some disparate authors like Danielle Steel, Ovid, Faulkner, Plato and Shakespeare. "Of Bondage Human" makes my vote one of the top ten novels ever written.
