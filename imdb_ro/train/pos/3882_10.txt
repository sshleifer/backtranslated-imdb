I looked at this tape, resumed it immediately, looked at it again, and I laughed twice as loudly. I strongly recommend this tape for those who are not ugly but do not feel comfortable about the transvestites. This shows that transvestism is a characteristic, rather than the whole being. Comedy is not a single issue. This man is brilliant. All comics should aspire to its level of honesty, intelligence and talent.
