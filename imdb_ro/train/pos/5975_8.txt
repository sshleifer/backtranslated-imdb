Every film critic and metal head hate this movie, but I liked it. I saw this as a kid on TV somewhere and was amazed at the scene where Sammi comes to the stage and plays Trick or Treat by Fastway. The film itself was typical in the 1980s, annoying supernatural help to beat the thugs, but it goes away and must be destroyed. Matt from Melrose Place takes over Skippy from family ties, so Skippy gets a record of Tony Fields from Gene Simmons to caress him, and all breaks of hell are lost, with the emphasis on Tony singing (lip-synchs) and dancing to a metal song before shyt hit the fan. There were a lot of mistakes and stuff, but the music and the overall picture was enough to hold pumping fists 8 out of 10
