I rarely ever meet a movie so complete I need to talk about it right away. This movie is definitely some of the best entertainment available and is very authentic. I met the doubled version, but I'm heading right now to grab the DVD remaster with the original Chinese dialogue. However, doubling did not get in the way and sometimes gave a funny humor: "Poison Clan rocks the world!" The story remains true to the Chinese method of intrigue, suspense, and interpersonal relationships. You can expect to overturn and transform as the identity of the 5 venoms is revealed and a specialized rhythm. The martial arts battle choreography is in its own class and must be seen to be believed. It's like looking at real animals fighting each other but building their own arcane martial arts. Such a level of skill among cast is unwritten in modern cinema. The combination offers a serious dose of old Chinese culture and I recommend it only based on the real intention of the film to tell a martial art and mastery of its execution. ... Of course, if you just want to see people shooting each other together with brutal forms of old Chinese torture, be a guest!
