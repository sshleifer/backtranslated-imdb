When the Chamberlain family is near Ayers Rock, Australia, Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep) sees her baby being taken out of the tent with a dingo and then begins an attempt that no one should experience. For it seems that the dingo story is not believed by the public or the press, and everything turns into a circus. Lindy does not help in matters, either because she will not play in the jury or in the courtroom, she is alone and is a madness difficult, so of course everyone thinks she is guilty because there is evidence that does not it came easy. Sam Neill is excellent as Michael Chamberlain, Seventh-day Adventist pastor, who has doubts about his faith and maybe his wife. It is good (or bad) to see that people are just as bad and bad as elsewhere, as is happening in states, because the Australian audience does not believe the story and the media just the flames fans. Eventually, Lindy is found guilty and sent to prison for a hard work life, but many years later, proofless evidence shows she is released, but not after family life is largely ruined. An intimate story, very well done, a bit long but worth seeing. 8 out of 10.
