The third film Fred MacMurray / Carole Lombard is a bit more serious than hands over the table and the Princess comes everywhere. It is still an adaptation of the Burlesque, which seems to have been popular that day. The original Burlesque fled Broadway in the 1927-1928 season for 372 shows and is the role Carole Lombard plays Barbara Stanwyck originates on Broadway, which brought her to Hollywood. A version played Nancy Carroll in the early days of talk, and later on Betty Grable and Dan Dailey made another version of it in When My Baby Smiles At Me. In fact, I have a vinyl radio album that Al Jolson and Ruby Keeler had made for the Radio Lux Theater. It's an interesting job, believe me. However, MacMurray and Lombard do well with old chestnut, the story is now set in a nightclub where Lombard is a singer, and MacMurray is a jazz trumpet. Keep a nice interpretation of Dorothy Lamour as the Latin vixen that fits between Fred and Carole. Anthony Quinn is also one of his first films as a wolf in the fight for Lombard. Swing High, Swing Low is glad today and I would not be surprised to see another version of Burlesque for the 21st century.
