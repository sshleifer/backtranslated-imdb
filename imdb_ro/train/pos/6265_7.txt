Nick and Kelly are ready to marry, but Travis (Kelly's dog) leads Nick in a strange blue wall that will change the honeymoon for Kelly. Richard Burgi and Susan Walters play Nick and Kelly and make a good couple. Nick likes to drink, smoke and play with boys, but Nick abruptly abstains from this type of fun. Sex is the only thing he loves because he wants a baby. We find out that an alien race dies and has to interfere with women on earth to save their population.
