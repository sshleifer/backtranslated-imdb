I liked this movie. First, because it's a family movie. Secondly, it offers an invigorating approach to news about HIV in a family, with much less hysteria than what we normally saw in movies. The brethren are very close, but they are not judges. Their desire to protect the youngest brother is noble, but it is not necessary in the end. I understand that Leo's choice of how to treat his treatment may not have been the most popular with humans, but I thought it was the right choice for him. I can not believe it was a French television program. It had high production values. I gave a ten movie, and I think you'll be once you see it.
