Not for people without a quick mind or without a drop of Balkan blood in the veins. If you do not have one of these, you can not understand this. And if you do not understand, you can not enjoy it. :) For example, if you think that Picasso is a name for a CitroÃ«n machine, you probably see Picasso's painting, you'll pass by, thinking it's a garbage job for a street painter. :) So do not judge before you try to understand it :) Finally I think it's MUST for everyone with an open mind. Yet, N1 remains Shawshank Redemption! And remember that not all things can be framed. Because there are things in this world, any frame will not fit.
