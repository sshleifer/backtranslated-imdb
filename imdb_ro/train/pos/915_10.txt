All the talent of Mr. Sooraj Barjatya showed in the first 3 films, I thought it was an accident, because the fourth, his main premiere ki diwani hoon was so bad. But I have to say it was not an accident. This guy is talented and the way Vivah did it is just brilliant. Right from the first scene it affects you. the sequences between shahid and amrita are wonderful. The chemistry between these two actors gives a sense of light between the serpent and the kajol. As usual, Alok Nath, as a good and loving father, is fantastic, so is Anupam Kher. But it's a Shahid-Amrita movie. Amrita looks good in most scenes, although Shahid showed a young couple to marry, but she does a good job of a shy but still morally powerful groom. this movie will be particularly enjoyable by those who have gone through such beautiful moments in their lives. All in all a brilliant film. hats to Mr. Sooraj Barjatya ...
