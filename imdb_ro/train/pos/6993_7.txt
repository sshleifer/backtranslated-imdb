This is not Bela Lagosi's best film, but it has an old-fashioned approach to horror entertainment for nearly 40 years. The bridegroom falls to the dead of the altar like the flies. I think I'd postpone the wedding until after the son was caught, but it's a horror film, so I think people are ignoring the danger for some reason. However, Lagosi is a crazy doctor who needs feminine blood to preserve the health and happiness of his aging and sick wife. He always eludes Keystone's cops hiding the bodies in a robbery (who would think to look for a corpse in a robbery?) And the brides continue to shoot. No movie like this would be complete without a female Lois Lane reporter who wants to catch the killer on his own. Hello to solve the crimes, bad to keep his mouth shut in all the wrong times, guess who chose Lagosi for the next intentional victim. I love the home of the "Haunted House," where Lois Lane becomes embarrassed by a storm as a guest at Lagosi's sinister mansion. Hidden paths, a vampire-like wife, an evil dwarf assistant, Igor, and so on. Good things. Pacing pretty well keeps the movie on the move, and the story is solved in a typical but satisfying manner. If you like old horror movies, it deserves a watch.
