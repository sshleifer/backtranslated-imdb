An analysis of the absorption (albeit repeated and rather didactic) of exploitation and despair in a situation where there is no way forward or upward, where attempts to make you better by breaking and lowering those who are below you seem to be the only option. But even here, in this wilderness of lost and lost dreams, things do not work and come to something or someone to get together and share, a simple act of charity, offers a reward, even if it only survives through the present reviving memories of the past. Although there is little real violence on the screen, it is a brutal and brutal film about the little mind of oppression (political and personal) that does not make it easy to enjoy. Clearly based on a play, with a small distribution, a broader and wider relationship with the general social and political environment would have helped the film reach a wider audience.
