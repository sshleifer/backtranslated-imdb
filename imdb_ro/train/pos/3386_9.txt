Is it the future that awaits us? An overpopulated and unforgiving wilderness with an unwanted and harsh existence? This movie brings to mind a problem that we still like twice because the movie was released back in 1973. Let's hope the world will not end up like this ... Soylent Green is a the wild movie I liked very much. He had loving characters, a semi-apocalyptic frame, a convincing and provocative story, and the macho man there: Charleton Heston. Richard Fleischer gave the film a very unpleasant and dirty feel. You are almost suffocated by the stench of the city and its dirty inhabitants. Characters are great. Charleton Heston, who has become one of my favorite actors, is Thorn. Man created this evil role, but still a tough guy. I could definitely put myself in Thorn's shoes. He sees that something is not right, but everyone around him does not listen (more than paid to not listen) or wants him dead. Edward G. Robinson (in his latest film, R.I.P.) plays an old Sol loving who had plenty of places. Everyone is great, especially Leigh Taylor-Young as Shirl, a piece of "furniture" that comes with the apartment he lives in. The special effects are fantastic, even for 1973. The Green Soylent factory, the futuristic apartments and, in particular, the "balls" (the bulldozers that get rid of people) were excellent. The polluted air from the outside seems disgusting and very ugly. The bare streets of the city, filled with vicious and rotten people, are very disturbing. A final note is the end, which now shocks me. It's terrible, but if you think about it, it's a pretty good idea. Bottom line: A 70-year science fiction run that makes you think and let you feel very uneasy.
