A recent view of this amusement has given me the need to watch many of the MGM classical musicals from the forties and fifties. ANCHORS AWEIGH is certainly a smaller film than the city. The songs are not as good, nor the chemistry among the characters. But the movie intersects beautiful classic favorites, such as Ceaikovski. And the Hollywood Bowl scene with Sinatra and Kelly coming out of the forest above her, then down the stairs, while dozens of pianists play the piano, is the best scene in the movie, even if the scene where Kelly dances with Jerry Mouse is more famous. The fans of classical music will undoubtedly identify the music the pianist plays. Sinatra, then crowns, "I fell in love too easily," before having the epiphany he loves. Color is beautiful, Hollywood looks pretty good with the mountains and the air without pollution (You can imagine Hollywood in the 1920s, much less in the mid-1940s) and piano music is absolutely glorious. MGM certainly had a flair to create lyrical moments like these.
