I just saw the Australian shower premiere [Xizhao] at the Sydney Film Festival. The program notes said it was - Perfect delight - made, funny, funny, dramatic and meaningful. We could not agree. I just hope that the rest of the Festival's films reach this standard of entertainment and look forward to seeing more Chinese films planned to be presented in Sydney in the coming months.
