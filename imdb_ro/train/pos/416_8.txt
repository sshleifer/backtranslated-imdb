Plainsman is a fun western, no doubt a classic, which is real today. Gary Cooper is Wild Bill Hickok, ideal for the role, along with John Wayne and James Stewart, were the best actors who played Western heroes in their generation. Jean Arthur is great as Calamity Jane, no one I know has played better than her. Even if it can not be historically correct, the movie succeeds to capture the most important about Hickok and the moment when it takes place. Sometimes you have to sacrifice history to make your point and that's what DeMille does here. Hickok's friendship with Buffalo Bill, the sale of rifles to the Indians by a great producer to compensate for the losses he would suffer from the end of the civil war, Custer and Little Big Horn, the difficult relationship between Buffalo Bill's wife, a religious woman , with Hickok a man who killed a lot, also the unusual love affair between Hickok and Calamity, all of them make "The Plainsman" an unconventional and exciting movie. Anthony Quinn has a very short look, which already shows which great actor to become. A lot of care was taken to show the original guns of that time.
