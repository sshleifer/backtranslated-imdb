Directed by Renny Harlin (Driven, Mindhunters, A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: Master of Dreams) has made a non-stop entertainment action. This movie is a spectacular, exciting, visible and humorous picture of action. This was one of the biggest hits in 1993. This is one of Harlin's best films. Lithgow is a terrific fun entertainment. Stallone certainly made a brief comeback of this sharp thriller. This is probably Harlin's best work as a film producer. The DVD has a clear anamorphic transfer (2.35: 1) and a terrible surround sound Dolby Digital 5.1. The DVD has a commentary from the director with comments from Stallone. DVD also has a technical crew commentary. The DVD has behind the feature scenes, two deleted scenes with the introduction by the director and more. Do not miss this great action movie. Micheal France's Screenplay (Fantastic Four) and actor: Stallone (The Rocky Series). Based on John Long's premise. Cinematography Excellent by Alex Thomson, B.S.C. (Alien, Demolition Man, Legend). Oscar nominee for best sound, best sound editing and best visual effects. Panavision. (**** / *****).
