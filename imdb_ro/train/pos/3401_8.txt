The Technicolor Pioneering Cinema (Special Achievement Technical Achievement) is truly delightful. Add an endless variety of glamorous costumes and a romantic cinema dream team such as Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer, and you have a pretty "picture". Unfortunately, the controversial plot, the twisted action leaves much to be desired. However, there were no more stunning Technicolor films before that (1936), and very few since then, which could melt this wonderful visual experience of stunning colors. Cinematographers who enjoyed glorious cinematography in "Robin Hood" (1938), "Jesse James" (1939) and "Gone With The Wind" (1939), will not be disappointed with the fantastic work done here. "Allah Garden" will always be synonymous with brilliant cinematography of color.
