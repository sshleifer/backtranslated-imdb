The film starts with a bunch of kids in the reform school and focuses on a baby named "Gabe," who apparently worked hard to earn his condition. Gabe and his sister move to a new neighborhood to make a new start and soon Gabe meets Dead End Kids. The kids in this movie are small punks, but they are far less antisocial than they were in other previous films and deep down, they are well-intentioned punks. However, in this neighborhood there are also several offenders who make an insurance fraud by arson and see Gabe as a convenient scapegoat - after all, he was reforming the school and no one would think he is innocent once was framed. So when Gabe is ready to be sent back to "The Great House," it's up to the rest of the gang to save and expose the real crooks. "Dead End Kids" appeared in several Warner Brothers movies in the late 1930s, and the films were generally very good (especially the ANGELS WITH FOOTBALL). However, after the boys' contracts expired, Monogram studios continued, and the films were very weak and formal - with Huntz Hall and Leo Gorcey being exactly the show, and the group was renamed The Bowery Boys. Because ANGELS WASH FACES THEIR had an excellent writing and production value and Hall and Gorcey were not constantly misleading for the camera, it's a pretty good movie - and almost wins a score of 7 (it's REAL close) . In fact, while this movie is not an aesthetic film, it is sure that a lot of fun to watch, so I will give a 7! Sure, it was a hokey dad - especially the end when the kids took the law in their own hands, and Reagan ignored Bill of Rights - but it was also quite fun. Dead End Kids perform their best, and Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheridan have provided excellent support. Of course, this part of the movie was illogical and impossible, but in a way it was still amusing and quite charming - so if you can suspend the unbelief, it works well.
