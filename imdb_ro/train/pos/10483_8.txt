Yes, this movie is predictable and is certainly not a prize. But then do not try to be something that is not. A Funny Funny Story, Peter O'Toole's Stylish and Very Fun Interpretation, an interpretation by Joan Plowright. The band's performances were on-site, each playing their role in a comely, comical manner. The music was good, but not great, but it filled the film well. From some negative comments, I deduced that the subtlety of humor exceeded their head. A good example is the commentary on the "weird baseball game", well, my dear american, who was the cricket - from which the baseball drives and his explanation to the ignorant band in the US was very fun for those who know cricket. Also, no, you should not have died when Carl broke a window; It was funny how Lord Foxley said "Oh yes!" to get more money for breaking and the manager said at the same time "oh no" also referring to money. Jeez, it seems that every joke must be explained to some people ... Everything I liked and I had some big laughs! It's worth seeing.
