I thought for a first episode of a first series he did very well. It was really fun and I thought the actors were brilliant. I think it is a crime for anyone to say it was bad because it looked like the right time. I find it very annoying when people say it was not historically correct because it should have been a Saturday entertainment show, not a boring historical documentary, so I think the costumes and settings were right. A brilliant start and I will love what will follow! I talked with many people to my school and likes the show! we all think it's brilliant entertainment and has excellent stories to go with it.
