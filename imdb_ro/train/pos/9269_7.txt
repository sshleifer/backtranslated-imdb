Probably I doubled my knowledge of Iran when I saw Secret Ballot (2001). Now, I know four times more (I doubt I learned a lot of heck much from Not Without My Daughter (1991)). Offside is a splendid Irish budget comedy about a group of girls (working individually) to take part in a decisive football match for their country's World Cup. Women are not allowed to participate in football matches, so the nation's armed forces have been mobilized to save any woman trying to get into it. Some girls (adolescent) try to crash the party by dressing as boys, but they are caught. The film is largely put on this pen, where the girls are held by soldiers, waiting for an unspecified punishment (although the little girl who dresses like a soldier claims she was a badge far from being executed!) <br /> <br /> The film explores the absurdity of the situation. Thinking that prevents women from soccer matches is reduced to a bad experience for a fairer sex - an unknown philosophy in the West less than 100 years ago. This farce comes to a head when a girl has to go to the bathroom so a soldier escorts her requests that she cover her eyes so she can not see the graffiti. The conflict is not entirely about the struggle between the sexes: at one point there is a friction between a solidary who is rural and the girls who are urban. Luckily, this film was not very esoteric from a cultural point of view, comedy was lost on this neighbor and the cultural cousin of the Great Satan. You have to be able, but nobody should avoid this movie because they think they will not get it.
