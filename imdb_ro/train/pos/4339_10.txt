This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I feel extremely touched by the theme the film is about to convey. A single sentence that comes to my mind is that "history repeats itself". Life is what is shown in the film: when people are young, they seem to not understand their parents, their husbands; people have any excuse not to share with the children of the dearest, until late; people always have to work hard to support the whole family, but they can only neglect the subtle feeling of their partners; people always change their perspectives in different stages of their lives; people can always be forgiven if their heart is full of love for their lover; nothing is more important than the blood relationship that people share in this world, and it is never too late to talk to their people about what they feel in the bottom of their hearts in order to get a better understanding between them in such a way that when the life to end one day, people should not feel sorry or regret because they have kept their words and there is always hope - a new life. The actors and actresses are fantastic. They perfectly understood the Director's intention. The charm of the film lies in me in the effect of bringing a splendid and splendid audience of cheers and tears.
