I remember seeing this as a child in the UK, fascinated by the story and Laurence Olivier's story. I did not talk about anything else at school the next day. I imagine the ratings for the first time were huge. This is simply the best of the most comprehensive series of documentaries, despite the fact that he had to cut the story down to the bone they captured so much. What is interesting is that battles in the UK and North Africa were pivotal, but they are largely unrecognizable as Americans. The series captures the rivalry between Mountbatten and American generals, the suffering of German troops on the eastern front, the mistreatment of Japanese prisoners of war by US troops. The images of the Holocaust, which made me a European non-Jew, feel forever guilty of the treatment of the Jewish people. I do not know why it is not the number one in the IMDb rankings. Perhaps he shows his bias towards documentation. Spoiler - we win.
