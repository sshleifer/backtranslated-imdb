I remembered this as one of my favorite books as a child and I wanted to read it once for my daughter for 5 years. I knew the movie was coming out soon, so we went to the library to get the book and gave us previews for the day! We rushed home and spent the afternoon reading the book so we can compare it. It was not necessary. The only thing in common between the book and the movie is the name of the main characters, the fact that there is a bet and a lot of worms. Oh, yes, I almost forgot, the child who cooks most of the worms likes to present his masterpieces with a French accent. How children know, the number of children involved, how the bet came, the number of worms to eat, the amount of time they need to eat the worms, the way they are cooked, the progress of friendships, the climax of scenes, etc. Nothing is the same. But somehow, he did not ruin my movie for me. The characters are nice and the film did not let me down. A word of prudence for parents, there was a time when you could hear the adults in the room collecting their breath, and then Billy's little brother referred to his penis as a "sweet dick". The embarrassing part came when my daughter asked those around us: "Does anyone know what a disgust is?" LOL. This and a "closed" occasionally is just as badly sought after by this film. My daughter thought she might get sick around the 3rd and 4th boars (and wore the empty nacho container just for the case), but it was good for the worm. She and I had a lot of film and I had a wonderful time sharing the experience.
