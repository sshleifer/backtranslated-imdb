I think this is probably the funniest movie I've ever seen. Robert Harling's script is almost perfect, just check the "quotes" section; on the second thought, just rent the DVD because it's the delivery that really makes lines to sing. Sally Field offers comic performance everywhere, as you have never seen it from elsewhere, and Kevin Kline is hilarious. Robert Downey, Jr. is usually brilliant, and in a very small role, Kathy Najimy is a revolt as if she were a costume she is facing. I was never a fan of Elisabeth Shue, but she's great here as a real * person * surrounded by a series of cartoon characters on the set of "The Sun also fits" - spitting to you feel under you is Hemingway in the tomb. Either that, either he laughs very loudly. Five stars. Funny, funny, funny.
