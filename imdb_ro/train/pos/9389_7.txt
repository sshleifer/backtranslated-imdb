Red Rock West (1993) Nicolas Cage falls ill in a deadly crime without knowing at first, and dominos leads to the increase of danger, adventure and mischief in the wilderness that has lost West America since the 1990s. Red Rock West is often brutal and sometimes hilarious, and Cage brings the mix with the usual sardonic intelligence and ease of keeping. <br /> <br /> Is the parcel over the top? Yes. Is Dennis Hopper perfect like a crazy killer, almost full of love? Yes. Cage has a chance? Well, you have to look and see. She never leaves, and she took my first look when I saw her. In my second watch yesterday, I was surprised at how well she kept her, how well she was built, and how awful and fun it was at the same time. Director Ron Dahl (who also helped write) is more known for his television work, but with Rounders and this film he shows a deft hand with sensational plots. She is rescued by her humor, and cartoons. The bar is careless, the policemen are being discussed. And do not miss a camel inspired by Dwight Yoakam as truck driver.
