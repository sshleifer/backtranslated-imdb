The only complaint I have about this adaptation is that it's sex. Things that have just been suggested in the novel are shown on screen for some strange reasons. Did they think the audience would be too bad to understand if they would not have shown them all out? Besides, this is very good quality. All actors do wonderful things that bring their characters to life. For the superficial women there, it's worth watching at least because Toby Stephens as Gilbert is the most sexy thing ever. If I were Helen, I'd have forgotten that I still married the moment I put my eyes on him ... A sort of spoiler - The final scene is a funny reversal of what happened in the book.
