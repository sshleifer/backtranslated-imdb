Yes it is. Actually, it's somewhere in my first 20 favorite movies. Number 15, I think. However, usually I'm not one for the plots, but I think parcels work better in anime and RPG games (for example, Final Fantasy 7) and not movies. But that has it all. Live planets of the planets, stars, an extremely well written script. While this is not really for children, they can still look at it, it does not contain graphic blood, intestines and silicone. But I do not think they will.
