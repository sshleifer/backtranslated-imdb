Ice Age is not just Animation of the Year (in my eyes), it's also the best animated feature I've ever seen! The teaser annoyed me last year and spent many happy hours on the website. The scratch is great! So is the rest of the Sub Zero heroes. The animation is superb. Your heart truly comes to the characters in this movie. They have good dialogue lines and are well developed. It's hard to tell which one steals the photo. I experienced their journey with laughter, tears and astonishment. Nothing has been forced or finished. The emotion was genuine, especially in the second dramatic half. The last film that affected me was Anastasia in 1997, also a Fox production. And before that, it was The Land Before Time 1988. Everybody has a real charm and tries to entertain the whole audience, not just the cynics. <br /> <br />
