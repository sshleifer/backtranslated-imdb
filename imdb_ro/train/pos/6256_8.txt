I might be in front of me here, but although the movie itself was a technical masterpiece for his time, I tracked the piece on TCM last night, the question came to me: why did they do that? putting their lives in jeopardy, many of them died on the fly, why would they make such a dangerous journey for life just to find food for their animals (!) once they have reached the "milk and honey country" Just staying there? Do you endanger your life and that of your entire community just to find food for a cattle herd? How dangerous it was, to do this only for this purpose, shows the cross-simplicity of these kinds of people. Death risk for a cow? Better than me!
