I went to the cinema this afternoon waiting to be overwhelmed by Scoop. Fortunately, the film has exceeded expectations, at least a little. There is nothing heavy, nothing deep - and not everywhere as good as any number of true Allen masterpieces - but it is also completely enjoyable as a light comedy, banter. It's simple and sweet. "Cute" was the word I heard from people in the audience as they went out after the show. He does not feel like Allen has decided to create a masterpiece here, feels like he wanted to make a comedy and have fun doing it. Compared to what Hollywood produces, Allen's things tend to be charming. Even fluffy things. Nowadays it is just invigorating to go to a movie made by a real human being.
