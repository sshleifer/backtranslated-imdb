Good for all who have seen this wonderful movie I'm sure you would have liked me as much as I did. I love the songs once you see the show you can sing as if you are part of the show singing and dancing. dancing and singing. the song ONE is a musical song of all time and fears from the end with its mirror so oh you have to look at it
