Very well done, and along with "New Travels" is an extraordinary sequel! Fab to see James Cawley in the last episode "Vigil" Check it out! <br /> <br /> I like the growing characterization, and I think we have good replacements for TV actors in a song produced by the fan. This show succeeds in capturing the feeling quite well, as you say, has improved over the years with experience and I hope with more experience a powerful script editor and a pick-up in time and CGI that HF will become more remarkable than it really is! <br /> <br /> Good work for all concerned! (I have a big grosse place for Lefler & McFarland (GREAT acting) I'm a little tired of "Lefler's laws." Now it's Shelby's awesome (if it's a bit slow) and it's bad that he got the ship ... Commodore Ian is beautiful (like Fred Flintstone), but he does not have the stoning edge of a commander and seems too pleased with himself. Doc, Counselor, and Rawlins are heading straight for money in my eyes, just like Wonderful Nechayev (a beautiful accent - a real Russian!) (I suspect that Rene appears from the rep.) <br /> <br /> She becomes my vote, and CGI is kewl. <br /> <br /> Some of the obvious greenscreen, but on a small budget whaddayagonndo? for und it! <br /> <br /> (OK, some of the actors are not awesome, they are fan-shaped and therefore allowed to be varied - I'm sorry Cmm Cole.) The homosexual material is put on too thick (Graham Norton will be embarrassed.) Trek does not pay enough attention to hetero couples, so why gays with all the snogging? It's not necessary to show someone's sexuality to this extent - I hope that a torch and that Aster & Zen is not non-chip people - I do not treat my homosexual friends differently, They're just ordinary guys. <br /> <br /> The musical is a mixed bag. I can tell him all things in the Trek OST stock and work most of the time, but the calendar may crash now and then (at the end of "The worst fears part 2" the crisis is missing, and the edition loves the fact that I am using "Quest" galaxy music! <br /> <br /> I definitely can not wait longer!
