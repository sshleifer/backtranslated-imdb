I would not hesitate to put this adaptation of the "trap of death" in a top 5 list of the best stages-to-film adaptations ever. Caine and Reeves (an underestimated actor who did not really have a chance to do more than wet and "Superman") play each other extremely well here. Even Dyan Cannon - who normally I do not care about - it is perfectly poured into a role that exploits her worth of frustration as an actress <br /> <br /> I am not sure that comparisons of the "trap of death" with "Sleuth" - another brilliant stage adaptation to the screen offering Michael Caine - are valid, or even fair Yes, the two stories have much in common but "Sleuth" is as much about class war as the battle of intelligence, and the house in "Sleuth "Is set is at least as much a character in the film as the two actors - the house does not really have an equivalent in the" trap of death "and" trap of death. "There is not so much a battle of intelligence, for is a vignette showing how people are not good (and never as intelligent as they think they are) and deserves everything they get. I will say that both films are superb examples of the genre and are well worth the time and money. This is America, after all. You do not have to choose! <br /> <br /> I will not give up the twists and turns of the plot, but I do not think it matters anyway. I watched the DVD eight or nine times a dozen years, and still enjoyed the chemistry and the timing and the media, the frightful moments when things went "all in the form of a pear." Everything is done so well that the journey becomes more important than the actual destination. Anyone who likes the black comedy with heart and suspense in Hitchcock's movie-making movie will probably enjoy the huge "trap of death".
