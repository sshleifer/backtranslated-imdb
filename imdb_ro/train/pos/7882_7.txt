"Ship Ahoy" was probably done to present MGM talent. The film is a fun trip on an ocean liner on the road to San Juan, Puerto Rico, when the country was involved in the Second World War. This was the typical fare for studios, which gave the film going to small-scale public entertainment as a distraction in those difficult times in which the country lived. The beautiful Eleanor Powell is seen at her best in musical numbers where she clearly shows us she was a dancer to be reckoned with. Red Skelton is also seen on a straight, not too clown side, as he follows the beautiful Mrs. Powell on the ship that brings them to Puerto Rico. Bert Lahr has irreversibly good opportunities in the film to show he was a funny man. Also, Virginia Gray is seen as a funny girl who is not fooled by anyone. There are good musical numbers with Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra, including the amazing Buddy Rich, who has some solos with Mr. Dorsey and Mrs. Powell. A young Frank Sinatra also appears as a soloist of the band, supported by Pipe Pipers. This is a nostalgic journey that should be enjoyed by fans of this genre, which MGM has completely controlled.
