The Travel of Hope (1990) is a passerby that many nomad and poor Turks do so that they can live a good life in Switzerland. These people are so desperate to live as Westerners to give up their lives and to live in the quest to reach the promised land. So many of them are blamed by greedy bastards who are making their lives pay huge dues for desperate people who are in a situation without victory. A family faces the cold, the lost mountains and the broken criminals, only to find that there is not always a bright white light at the end of the tunnel. This problem exists in the world, not just in America. Some people tend to forget this. A heartbreaker of a movie that will let you wonder why at the end. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
