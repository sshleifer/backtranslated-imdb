This movie takes you to another moment when there was a different rhythm than everyday life. We get an idea of ​​how families had to deal with the war and how quickly we sent young people to fight. A very wonderful look at the past and a reminder that the victims of the war do not just happen on the front. Fortunately, many of us have never had to go through what our grandparents, grandparents or our parents have gone through a war. This movie, I think, is a little thank you. Peter Outerbridge looks amazing as a young Peter O'Toole, and Russell Crowe is absolutely charming and Australian as he can. It is certainly worth listening to him by reciting "The High Flight" and asking me what he could do with Shakespeare.
