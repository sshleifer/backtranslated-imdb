In a way, this movie reminded me of "Jumping Jack Flash". Do you remember Whoopi Goldberg in the shredder? Whoopi and thirsty tranquilizer? Whoopi Like Lemon Blind and Imitate Mick Jagger? The big moments captured on the film for sure, but the movie is still shit, right? That's how I feel about "Rich In Love". A man hears his wife singing for the first time. Post-cohabit teens talk about the nature of love. Albert Finney ate ice cream from the bucket and, in another scene, has a wonderful moment of awakening about his absent wife. Alfre Woodard adds another colorful character to his action cabinet. But it's just the whisper of a plot here and you can not wait to move. Only when Charlotte Caffey, "The Graces" of Charlotte Caffey returns to a big pop song, the picture wakes up ... and then it's over! This image is the equivalent of a lazy summer day deep in South America.
