I'm only 11 years old, but I discovered Full House when I was 5 years old and I watched her constantly until I was seven years old. Then I grew up and I thought that Full House could wait and that I had "more important" things to do. Besides, there was also the fact that my younger brother, who has been watching me cynically for two years, has begun to not think he's too "giant". <br /> <br /> Then I realized that every afternoon at five was 23 years old and again I became dependent on her. Full House made me laugh and cry. It made me realize how nice it would be if our world were like the Full House world plus a mother. I hear people say Full House is cheesy and unbelievable. But look at the whole picture: three girls whose mothers were killed by a drunk driver. Sisters fight and feel their feelings bad. The three men who live with the girls can sometimes meet. What's the real thing? <br /> <br /> If anything showed me the show when I came down and brought me up when I thought I was in the complete happiness point. I hung up like a hyena at the show and I won a massive obsession with Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen. (Of course, Hilary Duff did this, but they were literally the prettiest babies I've ever seen. They're great actresses and they look very nice people.)
