This is a British comedy movie that was kidnapping and I could always watch without getting tired. Peter Ustinov has never played a bad role, and this is no exception, especially with his dry spirit, but also with a very clever plan. Karl Malden has always been an admirer of mine since he played in Streets of San Francisco. I think Maggie Smith is the real star of this film, it seems to be so inept at everything she's trying to do, but it's really started, especially at the end of her when she informs everyone that she invested so much a lot of money she found while washing her clothes. One thing however regards me, can anyone please tell me why I can not buy this DVD or VHS format in the UK, could anyone please assist?
