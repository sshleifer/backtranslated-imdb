Ghost Story, (The New House) is a terrible horror story. This is from the Circle of Fear and Ghost Story series of the early seventies. The beginning and end of each story is reported by Sebastian Cabot. Do you remember the early family series, Affair Family in the 1960s? This particular story has Barbara Parkins and David Birney as main actors and as main characters in the story. I have seen this recently and I was so scared! If you are alone, I would not recommend to follow this. This story is terrible, not words gore or curse, but very scary. Barbara Parkins played the bride. David Birney played her husband. The actors were very good in their parts. If you like terrifying, fun, terrifying fantasy ghost stories then you will love this little jewel. I gave it a high rating. I highly recommend this story.
