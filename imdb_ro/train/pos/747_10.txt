Although I was born in the year when this movie came out and I never heard of it until I had seen my high school years (1996) when I saw it, I became full of laughter and crying and feeling along with the characters for me and my friends they were. <br /> <br /> Their hair, their clothes and their speech were overcome, but the emotions and despair of each situation were so familiar! I remember thinking how real it was and how I wanted to make such movies. In fact, I saw the movie the night after I was in a crazy party (not so different from that in Jay's house) that was collapsed by what I thought was the defeated losers who were on the edge of our crowd. A world-class BS'er type and a "responsible" type I mate identified immediately with Jeanie (I was also with the car), although I had a little uncertainty about Madge who was floating there. My best friend was Deidre, and her good childhood friend was Annie. Watching the scene when Jeanie is at school or where her and her boyfriend split up and then tells Madge how much she loved him felt like conversations and situations we had personally. Now, at the age of 27, I recently saw the movie and felt a wave of emotions, because it was like seeing a piece of my own youth (although none of my friends died). I think we have to see for all the girls 13 and above.
