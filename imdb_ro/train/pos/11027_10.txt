Since I first saw the theater, it was my favorite. Since then I've seen it countless times, and I've never been tired of it. The setting has much to do with it (Colorado know it would be jealous), but the story is original and I liked the way he used small mountain town people as heroes. There was no movie I could compare. John Lithgow plays an intelligent villain, but I like how completely out of his element - he has to watch Tucker and that keeps him interesting. This is an action movie for the best film. I do not think I'll see another one that's so fun. You do not need 50,000 redundant rounds to qualify as action movies. It just has to keep you captivated, not shocked by the shells.
