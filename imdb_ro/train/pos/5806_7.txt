If you see this movie, you know that you will see an expanded popular music video. But you will find more. Incredible FX, great music and a nice time to enjoy with your kids. If you compare this movie, you have to remember that it is a pop extravaganza. Blink of "The Mirror Man", "Leave Me", "Smooth Criminal" and "Come Come" by the Beatles.
