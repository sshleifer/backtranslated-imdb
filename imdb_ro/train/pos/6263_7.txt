The first collaboration between Schoedsack & Cooper is a documentary documentary on the migration of the Bakhtiari tribe from Persia. Twice a year, over 50,000 people and half a million animals cross rivers and mountains to reach the pastures. You will feel like a spoiled spoil after watching these people breed their animals through ice cold water and strolling barefoot through the snow to cross the mountains as they try to make their animals walk on steep and narrow mountain trails .
