At first, this is from England, so we had, of course, a 98% chance of being a smart and very good cinema. I've never heard of this movie. From the moment I saw Helena Bonham-Carter, I said, Oh! Here's the feminine version of my Left Foot. I was right, but I was wrong too. Wrong because the two movies are very different. My left foot was a John Ford movie and this is a Chaplin-like movie (not because it's funny, but Chaplin to that great sense of melodrama that tears you to the eye.) I was right because in 1990 , Lewis gets a bit nasty playing a disgusting person and made it with a great sense of reality. Here, the very beautiful Bonham-Carter did exactly the same, but with very feminine emotions. The story is well written and very intelligent. For me, Miss Bonham-Carter gives one of the biggest women part of the 1990s with Emily Lloyd in Breaking The Waves. Gee! And look at her eyes! She had the most beautiful movie eyes from Jobyna Ralston, Louise Brooks, Michele Morgan and Ava Gardner! It is also a true talent, as is shown in many other films. See this, you will not regret it! And a very good job by Branagh!
