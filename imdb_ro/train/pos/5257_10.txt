I have to say, this film gave me a double personality. I was told again and again to stop and start talking like a normal person. But it's really hard ... it's not about Wang. Have you found this disgusting and disrespectful? Well, put your mood a lot more. This movie is just dirty! It's not a movie to show your grandparents, but you should show it to a teenager or an immature guy at work. Anyway, back in the voice manner. Fortunately, this site has some ladies (did someone at the news studio say it should be an apostrophe (?) Between e and s), so you can always have a wonderful thing to say to the boss or the cops. I have a sheet in my wallet.
