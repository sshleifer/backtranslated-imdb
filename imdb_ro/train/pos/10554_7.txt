Nothing (3+ outta 5 stars) Another strange premise of the director of the movie "Cube". This time there are two main characters who are on their own, and their home is transported in a mysterious white veil. There is nothing literally outside their two-story house. Interesting to be sure, but I thought the comedy tone set for this get-go movie was extremely poorly conceived. There must be humor, certainly ... and I have no problem with the humor that was ultimately derived from the situation of the two heroes (their last "showdown" was definitely a hoot) ... but I think that the movie would have been much better if it had been more rooted in reality at first. After watching the movie, I watched the DVD Making feature and a short trailer at the end of the movie is almost totally devoid of comic aspects of "force" ... making it look like a completely different (and slightly better) movie. The last half hour of the film is where things start to come together in a way with the recent "Primer" movie. Actors are good when they do not overwork them. They are indeed quite credible in their more "normal" moments. I was probably ready to write the film as a failed half-way experiment ... but they've won me to the end. (And keep track of the past for the final stage ... do not ask to explain it.)
