The erotic movie of the 1970s has been tamed compared to the triple X romps of today, which is good. Because there's a good story about empty rituals and sexual scenes. Of course, I want them to have vampire effects that they had at that time and sex has become a bit short of the story. In addition, some accents have been difficult to understand over time, but it's worth watching the unauthorized version, then the edited version, entitled DEVIL'S PLAYTHING. But if you do not care about getting naked women dancing and having sex, then this is not the movie for you. However, I liked it and gave it ... 7 STARS.
