I can not condemn the movie because it does not work. There are enough noir films to consider as a noir movie, but I think it's just in the category. There is nothing sinister in this piece, and there are no noir elements. Sure, the disease could be considered sinister, but I find it hard to see. The film draws attention to a darker part: Blackie can be trafficked by human beings, the New Orleans police are too willing to arrest a reporter, the specter of plague hangs over all the people in the movie ... but they are really just suggestions. There is no attempt to question Reed's motivations, such as one with Marlowe or Spade, and no attempt to bring Blackie to humanity, which will make him even more despicable if human trafficking has been actually played. This lack of depth is what the film fails in the end. The story is decent, the action is good, the writing and the direction are well done ... but there is nothing to make this movie a movie you should always come back to. It's worth watching once, maybe twice if you do not remember her a few years ago and then let go of it.
