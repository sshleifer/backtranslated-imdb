Deathtrap gives you a turn at every step, every turn, in fact the biggest problem is that there are so many twists you never really focus on in the movie and most of the time it does not make sense by surprise . The story is very good, except that it has so many twists. The script is very good, with a dialogue and excellent characters, but you can not catch up with all of the development due to overturning. Caine's outstanding performances are amazing. The direction is very good, Sidney Lumet can direct. The visual effects are correct, but again, most are actually in a piece and they are false. It returns as much, but it still works and it's worth watching.
