***** Spoilers here ***** <br /> <br /> What really scares you? Killers shark, or maybe ghosts try to bring back a message? Maybe a chain saw that uses the psychopath? But these fears do not even compare to a horror that people do not dare to talk or consider - and this is the death of their own child. "Pet Sematary" sets the foundation for this fear, the primary fear of adults, and then takes her to places that she can not afford to explore. I have read comments on this movie, including poor actors, decisions, etc. I disagree. Actress is actually the first rate for a movie like this one. Perhaps it is impossible for many to imagine the despair that results from such a scenario. But movie events are not just logical, they can be absolutely inevitable if such a scenario were possible. This is the true pet's "Pet Sematary": it's not that pets and people turn away from the dead as killers who hunt with knives and scalp is that anyone who has lost a child could become so desperate to commit crimes on which makes them Louis Creed. Despite the warnings or even the past. The film takes those willing to go with him into the depths of a desperate human heart. The heart of a protector tries to do because he can not protect. The results are terrible. In fact, when the movie sinks on a flying territory near the end, it's almost a drop, although I think it's perfectly logical how it got there. I'm a real horror fan and I claim it's one of the most scary horror films ever made. If you do not believe it, see it again after you have children.
