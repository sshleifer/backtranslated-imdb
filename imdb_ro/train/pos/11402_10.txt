I saw "An American in Paris" at the first release when I was still in school and I fell in love immediately. I came back to see him again the next day and I lost counting as many times as I've ever seen, both in cinema and television. He uses fantastically some of the best music and songs of George Gershwin's greatest folk songwriter and presents the biggest male (Gene Kelly) and women (Leslie Caron) dancer in Hollywood history acquis. At the top of his form, Oscar Levant (as strange as ever), Georges Guetary (why did not make more movies?) And Nina Foch (shining in an unimaginable role). The closure ballet, superbly co-starred in title music, makes excellent use of Paris's views and sounds, as well as the impressions of impressive and post-impressionist artists. All the songs from Gershwin are well organized, but the most memorable are "It's very clear" (Caron and Kelly on the banks of the Seine) and "I Got Rhythm" (Parisian children who join Gene Kelly in "Une Chanson Americaine." Paris, see this movie If you've never been to Paris in your life, see it.
