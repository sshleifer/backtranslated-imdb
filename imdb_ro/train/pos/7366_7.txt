This is a movie that the mass market probably will never be able to access because it does not give the viewer an easy view. The story about Spike and his friend, Heaton, is not exactly a movie Friday night, but it has a unique edge and I found it fun. There are brilliant moments given that the movie was shot at such a low budget as when Spike inhales the aerosol. However, I did not really understand the relationship between Spike and Heaton and be honest that it made me spend most of the movie trying to do it. And I also did not like the fact that most of the film is spent with the two friends talking and not much "action". It's a small movie that is complex to watch and what makes it appealing.
