This is as good as the original 101 if not better. Of course, Cruella steals the show with her scandalous behavior and costumes, and the movie was probably done because the audience wanted to see more about Cruella. We see a lot more of it this time. I also like John Gruffudd as Kevin, a male leader. Using Paris as the culmination of the film was a smart idea. The movie is worth watching regardless of your age, provided you like animals.
