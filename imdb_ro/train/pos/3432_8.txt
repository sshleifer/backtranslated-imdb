This is one of those reference films that must be in the context of time. The character of Tallinn was made in 1993. It was a period of chaos, confusion and grave disruption not only for the ordinary inhabitants of Estonia, but also for countless citizens of other former nations that were part of the powerful Soviet empire. He was in a climate so tense that a young country called Estonia was born. As the newly-established governments face starvation problems, Estonia faced many problems because some corrupt officials have manipulated the state with the mechanisms of filling dirty pockets by using their selfish means. This is one of the main themes of this film. The Tallinn mark appears as an Estonian film, but was performed by a Finnish director Ilka JÃ¤rvilaturi. He tried everything in his power to infuse as many possible doses of Estonian humor. That's why it can be called a comedy film of political subtones. Since ordinary people are involved in this film, we can say that this film is good for the bad. is not a new concept because it is easily accessible in most religious books of different beliefs. The debt in Tallinn shows us how ordinary governments can also be overthrown by corrupt people. A beautiful movie to watch on a sunny day.
