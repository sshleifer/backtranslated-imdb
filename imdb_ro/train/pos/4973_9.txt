I remember that this was his initial broadcasting in 1962 when I was five or six years old and I even enjoyed it. I recently had the opportunity to watch again, for the first time since then, as it was broadcast on "Disney Channel Walt Disney Presents". I forgot the majority, and some were directed to the children, but it was still enjoyable. I can not wait to show my granddaughter and my grandchildren.
