This was the best Muppet movie I've ever seen! I happen to know that Miss Piggy's fantasy to meet as infants was the cause of Muppet Babies. The songs will remain in my head forever. Just saying so, because that stupid Nickelodeon shows the song Hey Dude stays in my head. Sorry, a little of the subject there. But, anyway, what I like is Animal, after the credits say: "Well, goodbye, that made me laugh so much, my absolute favorite is the final piece, I was surprised that the characters from Sesame Street I'm glad that this movie was really fun, I borrowed it from the library and now I bought it, because I can not keep the library copy forever. "In conclusion, I declare that this is the best movie which I've ever seen! In my case, it's even better than Austin Powers in Goldmember, which was my favorite movie!
