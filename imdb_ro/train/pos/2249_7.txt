I liked to see Brigham Young and found it as a positive and largely true representation of the LDS faith. I think a remake of this epic journey on the plain would be beneficial, because many people today are not familiar with the attempts and persecutions faced by the early Mormon church. It's an incredible story of a strong and devoted people. As a member of the church, the most disturbing aspect of the film (most historical inaccuracies did not bother me too much) was portraying Brigham Young as one who "knowingly" deceived the church members, believing that he was called to be Joseph's successor as a prophet. Although I understand the dramatic motives of this line of plot, it gives the impression that its doubts in this regard are historical, when in fact both Brigham and most of the church members have understood and firmly believed that he was called to lead a church. Brigham did not consciously deceive the saints; rather he led them with confidence through inspiration. The idea is important to Mormons, because it is an important aspect of our faith: that God really speaks to prophets today and that Brigham Young, like Joseph Smith, was an inspired prophet of God. or you do not believe that statement or not, you just know that the movie does not accurately describe what Brigham himself believed.
