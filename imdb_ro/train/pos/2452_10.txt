It's a good show and it sounds funny. Finally, the wrong types of Latin stereo are over! ¡Gracias, Señor Lopez! I like this show and I just started watching it three months ago. The whole conception of a television show in the Latin family really amazed me. I'm surprised that the Latins eventually have a good chance of being on TV. This show is probably one of the best I've ever seen, it's funny, charming, pleasant and enjoyable.
