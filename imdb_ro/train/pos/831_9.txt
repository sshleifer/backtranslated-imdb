I saw this movie while it was under limited release, mainly for the novelty of seeing Pierce Brosnan with a mustache, but it turned out to be one of the funniest movies I saw throughout the year. It almost begins as a thriller, but constantly progresses into a one-line playful piece of work with a great comic energy between Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear. Also, while I say that this movie is a comedy, it does not forget that it sometimes has a heart and can be very moving when it has to be. When I entered the theater I did not know what to expect but a mustache, but what I got was one of the best movies I've seen for a long time. Starting from the theater, I felt very fulfilled from the film and I intend to see it again. I recommend it to all who appreciate a good comedy with a well written script and a big mustache.
