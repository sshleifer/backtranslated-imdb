Father and son communicate very little. Actually speaking different languages. When the son leads his father 3000 kilometers for his pilgrimage to Mecca, the conversations take place in the end. they are difficult, and growth is necessary on both sides. This film takes us into the hearts of the two travelers and is really a great voyage for both the audience and the two directors. The images over the years are impressive, especially the final scenes in Mecca. It emphasizes for me once again how different the world can be, but at the same time, how similar. The same was true of the father and son of this film. Watch this movie. Tell your friends to see him. You will be glad you did.
