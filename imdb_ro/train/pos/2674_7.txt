If the redundancy of taking the boat, the boat, off the bus, the bus .. is a way to waste time, then you should go back to Hollywood movies that wind up this part in one assembly to get the money photos. and thus make you unrelated and in the cinematic language that results from the fact that you do not really show the realities of life. The long track sequences allow the same visual frustration and "in-line" feeling that the characters have to endure. Frustrating? Yes. Vital? Really. the language of travel is the key to the "root" of this Turkish family. Beautiful, great action movie. Sad, but worth it.
