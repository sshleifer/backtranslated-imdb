Nina Foch offers a surprisingly strong performance as a title character in this small Gothic picnic. She accepts a secretary position of a dowager of the Society of London (played dowry by Dame May Witty) and her creepy son (George Macready, Effects and Disturbing). Before he knows, he wakes up to find himself in a seaside mansion he has not seen before, where Witty and Macready call Marian and try to convince servants and nearby residents that he is a mad wife of Macready. Of course this pair can only plan cute facts and even if we know Julia has to get out of the trap, director Joseph Lewis builds real suspense in answering the question of how he will manage it. My name is Julia Ross, it has nothing stylistic to distinguish it from any number of films that came out during the same period, but I was surprised at how well it happened together, despite the budget of shooters and the pedigree of film B. There are quite a few moments that might have you on the edge of your chair, and I found myself really rooted for Julia when she got the scheme and began to overtake her captors. In any other Gothic thriller, the heroine would have strayed, screamed and dirty, waiting for her hero to come and save her. So I can not tell you how refreshing it was for the heroin in this movie to use his brain and figure out how to save himself. Very well done. <br /> <br /> Grade: B +
