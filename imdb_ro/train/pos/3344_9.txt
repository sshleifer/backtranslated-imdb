I went to see Fever Pitch with my mother and I can say that we both loved it. It was not the typical romantic comedy in which someone watches the other, and blah blah ... Do not wait for the kisses of the first climate or for them to eventually gather. It was more true because you saw them through the relationship, rather than the whole movie about them to meet. People may be referring to the movie, because they did not look like extraordinary circumstances or impossible situations. It was very funny and I think it was Jimmy Fallon's best performance. All in all ... I would definitely recommend!
