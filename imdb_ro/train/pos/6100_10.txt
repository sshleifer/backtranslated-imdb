This is a very funny (and sexy) movie - which is not just silly, but it has great action. It's kind of a movie where the characters are so funny that you feel connected to everyone in the theater. I saw her at the Boston Film Festival and I woke up laughing frequently with everyone else and moving some serious parts of the movie. It's a unique movie about two doctors, and I do not want to give anything, but there are some powerful scenes, and some very funny - and the dialogue is great. Wood Harris has a unique relationship with Zoe Saldana's girlfriend, and Brian White and Mya are also fun and sexy in their roles. If you have the chance to see it - go - you will not be disappointed. It's worth seeing again. Wood Harris deserves a prize.
