Make the world disappear. Remove it from your shoulder. Tell the things you said and make the world disappear. Well, Dave (David Hewlett) and Andrew (Andrew Miller) were in a pickle, one for misappropriation, and the other for kissing a child. He was not even guilty, but faced with accusations, and his house was about to be torn, but they got into nothing, nothing. The whole world, except for their home, has disappeared. It's kind of weird, but fun too. What would you do if you were alone in the world? The two friends enjoy the mutual company and do what they want. But, that gets old fast, it seems. Then they begin to improve their lives by hating their memories. The sound effects during this were great. Things have become odd at the end. This film was the product of a great imagination written and directed by Vincenzo Natali with the help of the two stars. It just needs to be seen.
