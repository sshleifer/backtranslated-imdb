Gypo Nolan (Victor McLaglen) is just as poor as anyone on Earth. Life in the 1920s Ireland, Gypo and his Irish colleagues are part of an underground rebellion against the oppressive British. A special rebel, who wanted to kill the Englishman, gets back to the city in secret. He thinks he can trust his friend Gypo, but the reward of 20 euros proves to be too tempting. Gypo kills his friend and sinks into a hole of despair and drunkenness. Meanwhile, the other Irish rebels are looking for the informant. Right now, Gypo, with the money that burns a hole in his pocket, is his main suspect, but they, who are his friends, do not want to believe. The story of the informant is simple in plot, but complex in his moral and emotional problems. It's easily one of John Ford's most exciting movies. What Gypo did is wrong, but we can certainly understand his reasons. We also understand his bad character, and there is a lot of sympathy that rises to him. The script is very suspense, too. It's a kind of suspense in which we're pretty sure we know everything's gonna end, so we have to scratch our teeth and carry it along. The act is remarkable. Victor McLaglen, who starred in many of Ford's films, probably had the best performance here (and won an Oscar for him). Any other performer in the movie deserves to ask. In addition to an amazing scenario and adventure, The Informer is one of John Ford's most expressive films. I like the darker part of Ford. In his spirit, as well as in his themes, The Informer reminds me of two of his other favorite Ford films, The Long Voyage Home (1940) and The Fugitive (1948); is also a bit similar to "Grapes of Wrath" (1940) in these respects. 10/10.
