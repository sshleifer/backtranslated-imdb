"Sweetness is never sweet without sour." This quote was, in essence, the theme for the film in my opinion. Tom Cruise plays a young man who has received everything in his life. He takes things for granted and comes around full of swing in this great movie with a superb twist. This movie will keep you engaged in the plot and you can not interrupt it to take a bath break. A movie that makes you really go back and look at your life and how you live it. You can not truly appreciate the better things in life (sweet), such as love, until you have experienced evil (sour). The theme will make you "open your eyes". The only complaint is that the movie gets very twisted in points and is hard to understand. I think the end is perfect, though. We recommend watching and seeing yourself.
