The inspirational story of Carla Brashear (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), a black who grew up in poverty in Kentucky and then joined the US Navy, aspiring to become the first black Master Diver in the history of the Navy. We are shown the series of childhood struggles that Brashear has to overcome in order to make his dream come true (and then keep his life). Not the slightest of the challenges was Diver Bill on Sunday (Robert DeNiro), the primary school trainer that the ship sends to Brashear, which is not particularly sympathetic to Brashear's goals, but which ultimately becomes a friend and unlikely supporter. This is a good movie; fast pace and a lot of action, though it is not a "bit" action in the normal sense of the word. There is also a very human story and an interesting study of racism and the struggle to overcome it; there is also a feeling of the struggle that took place in the 1960s between older and younger naval officers (the "old marina" to the "new marina"). The performances are pretty good - especially Goodings. I thought DeNiro was probably a little overhead in his Sunday portrait (though, who knows, Sunday could have been this extremely bad guy) and portraying wife Gwen on Sunday (by Charlize Theron) asked me if these parts were jazzed up to provide entertainment value. A good movie, though. I have never wondered if it is worthwhile to help him
