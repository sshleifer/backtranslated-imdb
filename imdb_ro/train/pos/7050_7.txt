I do not want to spend much time here crying about the plot - you saw the trailer and if you did not do it online. I do not recommend to see him, though - he was poorly accomplished and did not pack any laughter or magic from the film. So those who avoid this movie because of their bad trailer should give it a chance. It's very funny. I was amazed at the intelligence and originality of this film. The first 40 minutes I had on the floor in hysteria - my only problem was that it has gone unnecessarily into a bad Austin Powers movie in the last 20. However, this is one of the few movies where the end of the camp did not make me to displace the rest of the movie (which is normally the case). Everyone offers great performance (especially Joan Cusack) and there are some great moments all along. I personally plan to see it again when it comes out - just to catch all the details that I was laughing during the first viewing!
