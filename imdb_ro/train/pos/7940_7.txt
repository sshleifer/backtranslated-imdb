The eye in the labyrinth is not your average Giallo ... and to be honest, I'm not sure it really is a Giallo; but Giallo or not, despite some problems, is certainly a very exciting movie. I am hesitant to call her Giallo, because the film does not contain most of the things that make these films what they are; but many gender breaks break, and this seems to be one of them. The film does not contain any brutal crime, as many of Giallo do, but this is done with a surreal atmosphere and a rather confusing plot to stay interesting throughout life. The complaint seems pretty simple because it focuses on a doctor killed by Julie, his patient who, for some reason, sees him as her lover and her father and gets angry when he gets out of her. Then we move to a large house where a number of people live, but nothing is really what it seems, because there are a number of secrets surrounding the events that took place before Julie's arrival. The film seems to say something about how the mind is like a labyrinth. This never goes away and I preferred to sit and enjoy what was happening rather than worrying about what point (if any) the movie is trying to do. The eye in the maze is directed by Mario Caiano, the director behind the excellent Night of the Doomed a few years earlier. He does not create the atmosphere in this film, as he did in the antim; but the surrealistic aspects of the story unfold well, and the mystery is always kept, which stops the film from becoming boring. The film sees Rosemary Dexter, who offers eye candy throughout and also offers good performance. Most of the rest is not worth mentioning, except for Adolfo Celi, who is good as the bastard of the play and Alida Valli, whom the cult fans will remember from a series of excellent cult films. The film is explained at the end; who is lucky, because I'm sure I'm not the only spectator who was more than a little confused by then! On the whole, this can not be a classic thing; but rather good and worth seeing.
