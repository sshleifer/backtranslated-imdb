This movie is horrible, but you have to see it for that. I'm not here to discuss the whole movie, just the biggest scene ever. When Eddie gives milk to Tim, he is banished to the hall. Eddie puts obstacles in the way of hilarious jocks (such as a cymbals that nest a trumpet player, buy the DVD and watch it slowly). The best obstacle is a hammered bucket, which a jock jumping over, but continues to land on a door. But when he slides, he assumes the speed, defying physics (mainly friction); yet what is behind the door is supreme. The steeper case ever in any school, which this jock continues to CLEAR in the air. In fact, he would probably die of a broken neck. Not only defies all concepts of reality but makes the most funny noise ever made in this situation. Go and buy this. Believe me, this scene is worth your six dollars.
