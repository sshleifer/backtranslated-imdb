Although at some point I thought this would turn into The Graduate, I must say that Mother is doing a great job of explaining the sexual desires of an older woman. I'm glad this is a British movie because Hollywood would never have done it, and even if it had it, it would have ruined it without taking the time to develop its characters. The story is revealed slowly and realistically. The act is superb, the characters are erroneous and the dialogue is sensible. I've tried several times to predict what's going on and I've always been wrong, so I was very intrigued by the story. I really recommend this movie. And I have to confess that I will forever see my mother in another light!
