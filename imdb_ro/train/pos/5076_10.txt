It has been almost 5 years since the launch of this elegant action movie. I watched this movie almost 10 times and it's a great effort made by Gautham. From my perspective, I feel that this movie is practically flawless. Surya as ACP Anbuchelvan - undoubtedly .. classy.Jyothika played her Maya role very well. The character likes it very well. The character who captured the attention of the film was Pandia.Jeevan played the role of Pandia very well. .Jeevan has received the "Best Villain" award in ITFA 2004. The support of Daniel Balaji, Devadharshini and others has played well. Race scenario, perfectly programmed dialogues and brilliant narrative by Gautham. Harris Jeyaraj are all free-busters while the BGM fits the movie very well. Cinematography by RD Rajasekhar is rich. Peter Hein choreography choreographers well.Anthony editing is accurate. Particularly, Kaakha Kaakha is a perfect police film filled with dose right action and romance. Even some Hollywood films do not compete with Kaakha Kaakha ... no doubt.
