To get started, since this movie is a classic remake, the rating must already be reduced. Since this version sees Viggo Mortensen as the lead role of Kowalski, he helps. This is not the same as the US government to terrorize one of its own citizens. Sounds like Jason Priestley's character in the movie! But the truth is, the government would do its best to destroy a man's life because he tried to get home to his wife. A wife who is in work no less, and can not do this. "There was a time in this country that the police would escort a man to his pregnant wife." The words of the Jockey disc. In this movie there were some wonderful pictures of the landscape, as well as extraordinary car explorations and spirituality. After much attention, I gave this movie to 7.
