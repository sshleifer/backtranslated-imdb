This filmed presentation of "The Ancient Mariner's Rime" is a beautiful and interesting interpretation of the Coleridge haunted poem. The striking cinema, combined with a collection of two centuries of epic poetry illustration of 1798 by the famous artists and Michael Redgrave's gorgeous story, deserves a great deal of time to see this excellent visual work. <br /> <br /> In the era of television, such a work is an invaluable tool that causes young students as well as adults to explore and learn the value of an extraordinary poem. As far as I know, this type of work is really rare; is regrettable. As a student of world literature and a former university professor and university counselor, I feel that several epic poems such as Coleridge's "Rime of the Mariner Ancient" should be "translated." Although he is not a film critic, but a classical literary reader, I am glad to recommend this fine production without any reservation.
