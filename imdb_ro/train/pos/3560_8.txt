Joseph L. Mankiewicz is not remembered by today's majority as one of the best directors in Hollywood history, but this film proves he is. Already the success of making sophisticated American drama, such as a letter to three wives and all about Eve, and the successful adaptation of Shakespeare to Julius Caesar's life, Mankiewicz does a great job of bringing this Broadway hit to play in the movie and does it with style. Marlon Brando is perfect as Sky Masterson, even if he can not play too well. He is the only actor who can draw him perfectly with his coolness and clarity. Frank Sinatra is a wonderful singer, as expected, and has a good job of acting like Nathan Detroit. Jean Simmons is also very good as Sarah Brown and her scenes with Brando sizzle with great chemistry. All supporting actors make their part, especially Sheldon Leonard as Harry Horse, in a very funny way. However, Mankiewicz should receive the bulk of the credit for bringing a music screen itself so that it feels authentic in many scenarios, but it's still a story in its world. Generally, boys and dolls are great music and work on multiple levels that they should not normally have.
