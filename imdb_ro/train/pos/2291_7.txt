Probably the two main meanings of "Elmer's Rabbit of Animals" is that the pungent leporid presented in "A Wild Rabbit" now has a name and that he is saying his famous "Of course you realize that this is war." for the first time. In large part, the Termite Terrace crowd was still trying to figure out what to do with this long-eared rascal. It's certainly a must-see for hard-core fans of this kind, but others will probably have little reason to be interested. But make no mistake, it's pretty hilarious what Bugs Bunny does for the eternally naive Elmer Fudd. The clear shades of things that will come abundant in cartoon. I recommend it.
