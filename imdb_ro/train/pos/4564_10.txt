If there ever was an inspiring story that could move someone with a disability or not to persevere in spite of the chances and do it (even if it does "as" an appropriate expression, it may have a wide obstruction that is a truth in the latter personally) My LEFT FOOT IS. It's a hard-to-see movie sometimes: seeing Christy Brown's less appealing aspects appear in two key scenes - one when his sister says she's pregnant and gets married while her father has a bad reaction and a supper then when the woman who came to him, able to communicate effectively, now announced at a key moment (the inauguration of Brown's art) that he is about to marry another man - it's hard. Very, very rough. This is more because he is a man who can not react properly to these events and can express himself only in the way he knows how: through shouts, cries and profanities that aim to hurt himself. However, this is not a story of pain and family dysfunction, even when there is a lot of it offering autobiographical account, but that of a man who overcomes serious disability, becoming a functional human being and a force that must be considered in the art world. Daniel Day Lewis won an Oscar for his unforgettable performance, such as Christy Brown, but also tenacious, and Brenda Fricker also made her role as Brown's strong mother.
