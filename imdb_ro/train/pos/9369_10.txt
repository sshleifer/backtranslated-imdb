This film is proof that filmmaking is a lasting, and extremely worthy way of staying alive. For me, it's the best example of Chinatown's noir movie. Unfortunately, he will never get the recognition he deserves. It has never been properly promoted when it was first released and had to build its fan clubs through locations like Vanguard Cinema and word-of-mouth recommendations. I recommend that people who are looking for something more than just the fun rent the movie and stretch into their complicated plot.
