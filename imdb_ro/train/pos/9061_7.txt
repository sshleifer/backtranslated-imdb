I really liked the movie. I remember reading it several times as a child and I was glad to see that a movie about the book was made. I was the kid for a boy and a girl, aged 11 and 8 and had to talk to the girl to see the movie. But happy, in the end, she was glad to see her and even said he wanted to buy it on the DVD as soon as it came out. There were a few great moments of laugh-out-hard and the movie was not as "crude" as I expected it would be ... Tho ran up pretty up there in thickness-o-meter. The only thing I can not figure out is why they had to have Woody's "dildo" line there on his private side ... that for me the only moment was shocking (and you've heard the adults in listening audience at that time in the movie) ... I have no idea why it was put in the movie; did not add anything to the real movie, except for that shock / sensation factor ... other than a pretty good movie. I'm glad to see the little girl "Pepsi" who grew up.
