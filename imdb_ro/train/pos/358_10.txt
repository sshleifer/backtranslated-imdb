Color Purple is about the struggles of life and the love that helps those people who are strongly affected by the struggles of life. Each character had a purple element in them. The film touches love, loss, hope, hatred and triumph. whether Celie lived through hell and lost her sister, and Shug entered her life to show her love again, Albert not being the man who straightened his mistakes for Celie, Shug escaped by his father, and she finally confesses her good and bad steadfastness, and even Nettie, had nakedness and hardship through the film, but they were eventually overcome and this is the sign of a good film. Good job for all distribution and crew.
