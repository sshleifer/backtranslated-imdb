I waited for this film to come to Canada for a while, and when it finally did, I was very pleased to see it. I really liked it. Of course, from the very beginning, it's a very sad movie (and it was New Year's Day - making it even sadder) - yet it is missing with you. The next day I thought about it again, because although it revolves around something so exciting, you realize after a few days it's such a beautiful story. How can a person be seen as a connection with so many people, but sometimes you can be blinded so many things. And how the character of Diane Keaton saves the others, being just there. And how it saves it in this process. It was an excellent movie and Chris Pine (one of my favorite actors) offers a perfect comic relief. It's definitely a movie that will need a box of tissues, but it will really stay with you for a long time.
