This is a very interesting film from David Lynch, saying that the name David Lynch is probably enough for many people. This is your typical Lynch guy. A blonde and a brunette are in a dark room. The blonde wept, the brunette talks in a threatening manner with the blonde, and that's about it. With a lot of silent moments, but with the music haunted by Angelo Badalamenti, there is a strange form of suspense. This short I feel like a bit like "Mulholland Dr.", a movie I loved, and therefore I also liked it. It's probably especially for Lynch fans, but there's a chance you like it.
