The Human Tornado (1976) is in many ways a better film than its predecessor. The director knew what he had to do and cared for Rudy Ray Moore's limitations as an actor. It is a fun movie that is more technically solid and has acted. Performers are not taking too seriously, and it seems that this time everyone is joking and going with the flow. Rudy Ray Moore seems more relaxed in front of the camera and not as rigid as Dolemite. I really liked the movie and I recommend it a lot. Like his first film, he is approached for a certain audience (I doubt that Mr. Moore is trying to broaden his audience at this time of his career). Check it out! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
