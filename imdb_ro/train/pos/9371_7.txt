One thing I always liked about Robert Ludlum's thriller is just when you think you figure it out, going in a completely different direction. There are so many twists and turns into this movie that I have a sore throat from watching. One thing, too, about director John Dahl (Kill Me Again, Rounders, Unforgettable) is that he can be directly dependent, and in this case write (with his brother Rick) a good story. <br /> <br /> Now, add Nick Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle, and JT Walsh casting and you have a story that will keep your interest even if they play characters that have all perfected them. Dahl seems to bring the best results among people, and this will keep you interested and guessing by the end of the year.
