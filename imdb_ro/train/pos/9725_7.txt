"How to lose friends and strangers" is not based on Tiger Woods's infidelity. It's a mediocre romantic comedy based on Toby Young's book about her experiences as a celebrity journalist. The film calls Simon Pegg as Sidney Young, a British journalist who takes a job in a New York-based celebrity magazine. The young man is anxious to catch all sorts of shenanigans to alienate everything around him, hence the film title. He is loud, daring and morose. But, for a very bizarre reason, it is somewhat pleasant. Sidney is friends with a journalist colleague composed by Alison Olsen, played quite admirably by Kirsten Dunst. However, Sidney is primarily fond of sexpot actress Sophie Maes played by Fantastic Lady Megan Fox. This foxtrot is short to act skill, but raised on the "candy eye" material. Sidney gets all kinds of tables to go on the journalism scale in co. These are the film's top moments of comedy. Still, I think director Robert Weide and screenwriter Peter Straughan might lose some viewers and alienate their authentic Rom-Com, developing an unpredictable romantic plot between Sidney & Alison; even if the Weidstraughan team has formulated a different narrative narrative. Pegg fixed his character up to the thread with his hilarious performance like Sidney Young. Jeff Bridges once again built the bridges "The Dude" with his enigmatic support work as Clayton Harding, the suave pres, but the rest of the film was not enough to say here. "How to lose friends and aliens" should not be totally alienated, but you might lose some movie friends if you post it as a superlative romantic comedy. *** Average
