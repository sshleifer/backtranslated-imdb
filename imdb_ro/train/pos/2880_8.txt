"Cinderella" is one of the most beloved of all Disney classics. And it really deserves its status. Based on classical fairy tale, as Charles Perrault said, the film follows the trials and troubles of Cinderella, a good girl who is unhappy with her bad stepmother and comrades who can not be amazed. When a royal ball is held and all eligible young women are invited (read: King wants to take the prince to marry), Cinderella is left at home, while her stepmother takes with her terrible girls. But there is a hand-waving mother on earth ... The "Cinderella" story itself would not be able to show a feature, so generally, while remaining true to the story, the rather accidental characters of the animals that Fairy Godmother uses them to get the character of the ball, they become the true Cinderella's pedestrians. The mice Jaq and Gus are the main brothers, and their own nemesis is the mother of the wife's mother, Lucifer. Their antics generally intersect with the main fairy tale and are, for the most part, wonderful. Of course, the film slows a little between the characters' main introduction and shortly before the scenes move away from the ball, but after this slowdown, the film really begins again and surprisingly (since "Cinderella" is the most used story of all time , probably) ends up as one of Disney's most involved stories. The animation and the direction of art are wonderful. All the legendary Nine Elderly Elders animated on this illustration and Mary Blair's conceptual design and coloring style (she also made the art and color concept for "Alice in Wonderland", "Peter Pan", "Three Caballeros" and many more) manage to make their way on the screen. Colors and drawings are great, especially in Fairytale and Fairy balls, as well as in those pretty little moments here and there. In general, "Cinderella" is among the best Disney fairy tales and is recommended to young people and everything that embodies Disney's philosophy, which truly dreams, can be achieved.
