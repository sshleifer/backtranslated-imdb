This movie is an exception to the rule that a sequel is worse than the original. His comedy to the best. This movie is a quick action comedy if something seems to happen every second. More than one occasion, the whole audience laughed loudly at a joke. A great advantage to seeing the first film, but it's not a requirement. GÃ¶ta kanal 2 also have the advantage of being a parody on the last decade of serial television production such as Survivor (expediton: Robinson in Swedish) This is a Swedish film for the Swedish public. So you do not see her if you are not familiar with Sweden and her tongue. Otherwise: Have fun! Johan
