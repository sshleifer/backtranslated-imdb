I first saw this movie in the 1980s and now in 2006 this movie is still one of the best movies I've ever seen! I would recommend anyone to look at this movie. You will not be sorry. It is well acted, so real and it is never a boring moment. The act is superb and the location makes the movie look as if you were there. From the beginning to the end, this movie is the type that makes you lose your attention. The actress makes a great job of describing the girl who survived this terrible plane crash in the Amazon and shows how she managed to survive alone in Amazon. It is unbelievable that anyone can survive in such conditions. That's why this movie is so appealing. The fact that this is a true story makes the movie even more exciting and to think that a young girl can survive this test is overwhelming. It seems to me a movie that I can watch again and again and which I have never tired of. This is really a compliment, because I have hundreds of movies! I'd say it's probably my favorite movie and the best movie I've ever seen!
