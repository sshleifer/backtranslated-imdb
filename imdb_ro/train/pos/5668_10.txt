I came across this series rather by chance. After half an episode, I was engaged. The American Gothic was a strange, strange series with Gary Cole as mysterious, probably bad, Sheriff Buck, trying to get control of his illegitimate son Caleb, played by Lucas Black. I was impressed by Gary Cole's sheriff's sheriff and I was even more impressed by Lucas Black. Luca Black's Caleb managed to stand up against Sheriff Buck, one of the most frightening characters ever created for a television series. I rarely saw a child actor with so much presence or talent as Lucas Black. If you were not lucky enough to see Lucas in the American Gothic, see him in Slingblade. It was a remarkable show with many ambiguities and mysteries that were never explained during the short period.
