I can not say that this film deserves to be close to the amount of vitriol that some reviewers have gathered. Yes, it is overwhelmed by an exaggerated treadmill, fearsome editing, and an overburdening of the cheeseball special effects. And he lacks much of his energy, a comedy that has to make audience members sit on it without checking his watch. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it also has some funny, talented and serious lines, and the classic premise of the subconscious. Macy, Stiller, and Azaria are brilliant as the "core" team, and Garofalo and Studi are doing great work, adding a team's conflict and variety. I can not say that Reubens or Mitchell have added much to the general movie, although each of them has little chance of shining. <br /> <br /> The plot, as I said above, is your classic underdog-make-good. There are no surprises, because you know they will triumph. What makes it worth is not the absurd heroes, the gaudi and the villain, but the dialogue and the interaction between the characters. Below these, these people are heartfelt children who just want to do good. The best scenes in the film give this film the emotional foundation. Look at the relationship of Azariah with his long-suffering mother; Macy's innocence in his mistrust of accepting Cap. Amazing secret identity; The style of Stiller's fury (not just a strange, spazzy kid you once knew who has always been in trouble, feels unhappy on the playground); Garofalo's desire to avenge her father. This childlike belief that a sense of justice and goodness will always make the world a better place is the real appeal of comic superhero; and under its parodic exterior, "Mystery Men", shows us why these things are afraid of these comic book tropes. <br /> <br /> Never gel in a satisfactory whole due to the large number of bits of bits (romanticism, family life, team conflicts, etc.), but the main plot is so fun that it behaves for this. The fact that it is supposed to be a good, meaningless fun seems to be lost to some of the commentators here, so I will issue a warning: if you are the type of spectator who is pleased to be drawn by a cartoon of torturing and scratching unexplained and illogical ("Am I to think it's kind of ... xorto ... xmagic_ xylophone?"), then you are far too literal-minded and humorous for this movie. Instead, rent a Sandler movie. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
