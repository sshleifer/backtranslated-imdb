I did not feel like the movie was as smart as it seems to be, but it was still enjoyable. <br /> <br /> It's original, although it reminded me a little of two other French films, Vidocq and the City of the Lost, especially for the coloring, but also for the extreme quality of the characters close to them. /> <br /> Set yourself up in a prison cell, but do not let this escape you, this movie seems to go farther than many in a multi-localized blockbuster. Always interesting, with "black arts" good at pre-characterizing and very good characterization making some too credible! <br /> <br /> Scary with some gore this is well worth a viewing.
