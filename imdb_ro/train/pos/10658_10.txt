The only time I saw this movie was when I was 10 years old. I remembered all these years, because I could not sleep for a week or more after I saw it. He just screwed me up. I was on holiday with my Aunt Ft. In Worth, Texas, we will never forget it. Now, 48 years later, my daughter is trying to get a copy of this for me as an adult. It took a lot of research to find out what the movie was, but I always remembered that Barbara Stanwyck was in it and eventually managed to get names and reviews. I liked it very much, but it made me a great hope! Jaqui
