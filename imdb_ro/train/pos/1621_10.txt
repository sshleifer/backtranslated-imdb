Harman and Isings The Old Mill Mill is a true masterpiece of animation art. The ability and perfection of the art that characterize this duo work is no longer evident in this cartoon. It is a shame that so many people can only see crimes in what it is and have always been intended to be, a piece of easy fun, which in no way sought to denigrate black people. If there is anything, it is a tribute to the infectious humor and the musicality of the black race. I have not been able to see this garment for many years because the "race commissioners" in England considered it too offensive to be represented in the UK multi-racialist. If anyone knows where I can get a copy, I would love to see this masterpiece again. I think those who are usually looking for messages and intentions that have never been intentional in these cartoons, which are, after all, sixty years old, should try to make it easy and remember that the world is today a very big place different, but that does not mean that anyone has the right to censure what is visible in the past.
