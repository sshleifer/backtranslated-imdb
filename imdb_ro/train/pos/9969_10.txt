Shawshank, Godfather, Pulp Fiction ... all the good movies. Great Movies. But nothing, and I mean, nothing goes to the biggest Christmas movie of all, Santa. The movie is so big and has so many messages, I cried while watching it. Seriously, this is one of the movies you have to watch 10 times. When we see Pitch telling him he'll have to eat ice cream, see the sadness in his eyes and feel the sadness and then we ask ... what's so bad about this ice cream? Does it mean that we, as humans, treat ice cream just as well when all it does is to hurt us? Think about the movie that makes you think. This movie has the best interpretation of Santa Claus ever. Unlike other Santas, he is a normal person. We see him imprisoning the children and spying on the children's dreams and we ask; is Santa what we really believe so well? Also, this Santa Clause actually mentions Christ, the whole meaning behind Christmas. You owe me to watch this cinematic masterpiece. We should stop making films and air only in this 24/7 epic. Whether it's Christmas or not, this movie gets 500/10. Anyone who says the film is bad is an ignorant madman.
