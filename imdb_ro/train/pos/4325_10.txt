This version of Bleak House is the best adaptation of a classic novel I know. The representation of the Chancery court as a "character" in the drama is magnificent. The actor is wonderful, from sinister Tulkinghorn, to Dedlocks, Smallweed, Crooke, Miss Flyte and the two young lovers. But the Spanish web of the chancery keeps everything together, and the cinema is gorgeous. What was the BBC's mistake about copyright, which means that this version could not be seen in the UK either on the video or on the DVD for many years? I tried to find out from them, but I faced a stone wall. Finally we got a DVD copy from Canada.
