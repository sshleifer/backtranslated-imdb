I agree with all the comments so far. I remember this documentary as one of the most amazing and informative I've ever seen. As I said earlier, I remember that I started looking, thinking that it was just another study of nature - interesting, not necessarily special, but I was so wrong. Not only was the story of the colony incredible, but I remember music as so much of her appeal. If I remember correctly, there were Native Americn pipes (similar to end-of-year music One Flew Over the Cookoo's Nest). And I searched for a copy. This should be needed for someone, but especially for schools. It should be resumed.
