This is the second film based on the life and times of the ultra-critical porn star John Curtis Estes, also known as John Holmes. Boogie Nights is also based on his life. Perhaps one day someone will make a movie about Tommy Byron's life in return. The problem is that the story is not very well said. There are many episodes of law and order that have more twists and turns than Wonderland, and the director never makes the criminal case that goes with every taste. Val Kilmer has two problems - he is not nearly as hanging by Holmes (and this time he has no prosthesis as opposed to Boogie Nights), and is much better than Holmes Holmes. <br /> <br /> The director does not enter a single nice character among the cast. The racist, immature facts with which he is or his wife and the police do not get bogged down too much. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie is Eric Bogosian saying Paris Hilton is "losing". <br /> <br /> After saying all this, anyone who would be interested in the weakest part of the porn business in the 1980s or the real crime should not miss it.
