I did not understand why Jeremy Irons felt necessary to show a great deal of discomfort, spoke through tight teeth and behind his neck. In fact, it really broke the movie for me and was distracted by what was probably a good performance of it (very irritating). No other actor or actress seemed to have such a pronounced accent, and while I rated Jeremy Irons as a good actor, I would not classify this film as one of the best. However, the film has caused my appetite, as well as some of the other comments made in this movie, which I found very interesting, and I intend to read them now.
