By the end of the first hour, my jaw was comfortably placed between my legs. The film never has, and I do not want to say, to give up action. It can be an easy action, but it's an action. Once again, each member of the song fits perfectly. Explosions were realistic, tracking scenes were feasible, and fighting was incredible. Matt Damon will be forever Jason Bourne. All I have to say is that every Bourne movie gets better and is no exception. Action, stakes, plot. As I do, I will never know. Applaud the man who wrote the screen for each of these movies. Because if he did not do such a good job with the first movie, we would not have wanted to talk about it. So you're not going to see theaters if it's still where you live, but if not December 11, Bourne comes home to you!
