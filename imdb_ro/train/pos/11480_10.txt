Silent tracking: This is one of the most amazing and intense movies I've seen for a long time. The first movie of the years that left me totally staggered. I could barely feel my way out of the theater, I was so overwhelmed. I watched the screen for fifteen minutes trying to find a way to describe the power of this movie and I just can not. Highlighting any aspect of it - documentary documentary format, unlimited portrayal of events, character force - seems to trivialize everything. Some may find it surprising that any criminal could be characterized as normal. But then, not all the killers are mad fools. Many of them are ordinary, untouchable people. They are simply connected differently. And this is probably the worst thought of all.
