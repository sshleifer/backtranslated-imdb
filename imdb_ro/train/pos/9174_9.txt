There have been many film and TV productions by Jane Eyre, each with aspects that he recommends, but I suspect that this is what people will still discover and fall in love for for decades now. It's just a classic (and it offers much more of a story than others do). Timothy Dalton is totally in his element as Rochester, rarely missing the sign; its performance is amazingly agile and many colors, without going too far from the dark complexity of the character. Zela Clarke, Jane, is more cerebral than others, but she makes a perfect foil for Dalton (which, accordingly, melts over her!) The shades of her performance come better through a second view (once you have absorbed the shock of Dalton's charisma). There are some technical failures and some moments in which production could have been better; although this was a top production from the then BBC standards. But performance is the real pleasure. Do not miss this!
