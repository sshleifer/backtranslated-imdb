WARNING!!! TONES OF GOD! DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THIS SERIES! Or you can, whatever it is. There are a few words to describe a movie that claims to be the last and to go out with another; Liars, Tricks, maybe some words that can not be spoken. But when Elm Street 6: Freddy's Dead shows everyone who thought the series grew older and wanted to stop seeing him, or people who wanted their hero (or Villian) to stop for his final breath, the movie was like that. <br /> This movie begins with an Oz wizard parody, and then you see a kid called John Doe, who is the last child in Springwood, Ohio, leaving and leaving Freddy. A woman who lives in a hospital / place to take off her children meets this boy and, at the same time, has a dream about a man, a water tower and a promise of a secret floating in her mind , returns to Springwood to figure out this dreadful vision, and soon find out he is Freddy's child. And soon we find out that Freddy can not leave Springwood unless his daughter can be a kind of host for him. And beyond that, it's afraid. This movie seems to hit the nails on the head of everything you wanted to know. This movie has tons of humor, and cameo appearances such as Rosanne Barr and Tom Arnold, Alice Cooper, Johnny Depp and a very young, Breckin Meyer, playing a teenager stoner who sees the vision of the flowers and "In-a- gadda-da-vida "by Iron Butterfly, then gets stuck in a super Mario parody. This movie will make you hate this movie or even Krueger even more. Best of the best.
