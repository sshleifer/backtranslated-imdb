This was that of black society before the epidemics of crack, rap gangsta and AIDS, which faced the ghettoes of the eighties. Dignified, working families who struggled to pass, and all the traumas and troubles they faced. America America was a different group of people in the seventies. Still full of hope and flying up on the civil rights movements of the sixties, the times were tough but still worth fighting. Keep your head on top of the water, taking a wave when you can, the show showed how the black society tried to work together as people and families before beginning to fry each other and anyone else to survive the horrors of the ghettos. It is useless to see what the black ghettos and what have become now.
