Mendez and Marichal gave us a serious, conscious and painful analysis of the social, spiritual, economic and political crisis that 108 years of colonialism gave rise to in Puerto Rico. A beautiful island with the most hospitable people I have met and yet because our nation refuses to meet its imperial responsibilities, the Puerto Ricans are allowed to dry and die. The spiritual crisis of the colonial situation in Puerto Rico has created, if it undermines families, and the basic institutions that support any society. Corruption is unclear to the extent that people do not pay taxes (which has led to a fiscal crisis for this nation), and a sense of cynicism and mistrust penetrate into the island's culture. Fortunately, a grant allowed this painful but a powerful film to be produced. <br /> <br /> We have to see. . .
