I really liked it. The premise was good, the story matched if both of those series stayed, and here is my favorite part. Mary and Valerie are not bitter! They are not like others who become synonymous with a certain series and then refuse to talk about it or make possible meetings (A prime example is Susan Dey, "Family Partridge"). In fact, Valerie said she would be delighted to make another movie, and then Mary said the same later, so I would be looking for another movie ... but if that does not work enough then they can re-execute This one.
