This is a good adaptation of Austen's novel. Okay, but not shiny. Cinematography is inventive, sometimes crossing the border to gimmickry, but surely avoids the trap of doing it look like a boring TV in costumes, considering that the whole story is being talked about. <br /> <br /> The actor is competent. Mrs. Paltrow is in the distance, as her character asks her, but the required distance from the other characters is accompanied by a much less adequate detachment from her actions. In other words, it does not seem to take care of the results of its matching efforts. Some of the support distributions are guilty of over-action - very much in the style that is appreciated on stage but instead in movies. Personally, I had trouble accepting Alan Cumming as Mr. Elton - without his fault, except that he left a gay monk impression in "The High Life" that it is now difficult to accept him playing it. Actors of honor are heading to Toni Collette, who manages to emit heat, and Jeremy Northam, who shares his character to the right level.
