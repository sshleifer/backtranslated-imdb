I just came back from the first introduction of Basic Instinct 2. I went into it thinking it would be messed up by previewing critics and I was pleasantly surprised! If you liked the original Instinct, I think you'll enjoy # 2 as much, if not more. A wonderful story that always keeps you asking and thinking. The music is superb, resuming the theme of the original. Do not expect the Academy Award, go see it for fun and fun. That's why the movies are designed - escapism. I can not think of a better way to escape than to escape with Sharon Stone, which is as sexy as ever. I'm thinking of seeing this weekend again. Go see!
