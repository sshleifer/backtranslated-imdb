Ladislas Starewicz's curiosity about insects and cinemas combines in a short film about a love triangle between Mr. Beetle, an artisan grasshopper and Mrs. Beetle. The fairly simple story of a couple of adulterous cockroaches, seeking both stimulation outside of marriage, is similar to that of Biograph or Vitagraph. Starewicz's return to the story is to use embalmed beads with yarns that straighten legs into frame-by-frame animation. The story is being built as Mr Beetle is unknowingly caught with a local nightclub, a jealous grasshopper. When Mr. Beetle returns home to find his wife in the arms of his artistic friend, he follows her with annoyance, but eventually forgives her and gives her out to see a movie. However, Ms. Beetle soon learns about her husband's infidelity, while the film I'm watching is the image of Beetle's jealous jealousy and the dragonfly together. Mrs. Beetle is hitting Mr. Beetle with an umbrella, Mr. Beetle jumps on the screen and both get into jail after the projector I destroy. Insects are placed in humanized frames, such as a house or a nightclub, and are given human characteristics of jealousy, anger, lust, and vengeance. Insect carcasses carry briefcases, drive cars, and simply wear shoes, but they also grab their antennas and open and close their jaws as real insects. The novelty of the story is not the only one, even after multiple visionaries, but as fluid as motion, the film moves slowly. The action happens with complex details, but faster and quicker shooting speed is lost in this process. Despite its rhythm, the film is an excellent example of Starewicz's early doll and is highly recommended.
