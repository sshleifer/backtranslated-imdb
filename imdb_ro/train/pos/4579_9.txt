I think this movie was pretty good. It's kind of weird that Olsen twins are now 13 and have friends and everything. I loved it very much when I was young children in the Full House. However, pouring was good and the movie was somewhat funny. I'm a little mixed up between all the places of change and their names. It's just an older version of Take It Two.
