The autobiography on which this film is based remains one of the most original books I have ever read. She tells the amazing stories of her two sisters, who have earned their devotion and respect, working well in the 1970s as a teacher and dentist, and then lived for another 30 years with dignity. Ruby Dee steals the film with her perfectly refined performance as the "darker" rebel Bessie, the dentist. She not only expresses her anger, anger, and wisdom; it lets you know exactly where it comes from using a word-saving. Diahnn Carroll has the feeling of a bigger sister, teacher, perfectly, but I'm afraid she never makes me think he's over 100 years old. Whatever - the stories deserve to tell them. Amy Madigan is a bit too extreme and intrusive in overwhelming and uncertain acting in the first half of the film as NY Times Caucasian reporter. And that's just a little distraction. Stories, all true, are the attraction and, although two or three are easily destroyed in translation, most of them do it very well. We recommend the book as an essential reading for all the people I recommend all the books. I can only film this TV movie in that rare air, but it certainly captures quite a lot of taste that is extremely useful in itself.
