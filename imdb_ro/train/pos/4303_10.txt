This is an excellent movie with a stellar cast and great action. I did not get tired of watching. I especially like the scene where Danny Glover's character and Kevin Kline's character, Simon and Mack, drank together. Kevin Kline is so natural and it seems that his mannerism is effortless and one that you often meet. So it's a very "real" movie. <br /> <br /> One of the most powerful scenes of the movie is, however, at the beginning of the movie when Simon arrives at the scene where Mack's car broke down. The film also has a strong message and is different from the stereotypical message that carries the movie in which there is a person who preaches his courage to an audience. Instead, actors' emotions and situations give an impersonal message that does best without the use of words. Eventually, Mary McDonell is brilliant as always.
