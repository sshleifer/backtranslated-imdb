If you feel stupid for fun ... and you want to relax and enjoy ... Miyan Chote Miyan is one of the movies you can watch. Amitabh started pretty well ... but Govinda is the one who steals the show in his hands ... the wonderful calendar and the delivery of good dialogue ..... is inspired by the bad guys ... but he has the Indian Masala. .. people think it could be confusing and stupid ... but the fact that David Dhavan leads and Govinda acts ... should not raise any questions .... other films recommended in the same genre (David Dhavan / Govinda combo ) ... are Shola Gold Shabnam, Aankhen, Raja Babu, Saajan Chale Sasural, Deewana Mastana, Collie no. 1, Jodi no. 1, Hero No. 1, Haseena Manjayegi, Ek Aur Ek Gyarah.
