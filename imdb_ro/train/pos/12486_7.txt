Well, this movie is really a difficult one. To be directly with you, this movie does not contain much of a riveting story, does not make them "want" to know how it will end ... but I'm telling you something now ... I've never been so tense and jumped forward in my life! This movie definitely offers jumps and emotions! To be fair, I saw it almost at midnight, so I was kinda sleepy anyway, so maybe that explains why I was jumping ... or maybe because this movie does not deal with this! This is a couple who loses their child in a tragic event. They decide to move and rent a cottage in the mountains ... they all look calm and calm until they have their first visitors (I think she is the sister of the main character and she brings her husband) ... at night the husband hears noises. Check it out, and when things really go wrong indeed ... they do not sit for another day and say they should leave as soon as it's not right ... cut a story short short ... they finally find out what happened in that house in recent years and decide that it has to be taken into account. It's not a Hollywood blockbuster, nore has a huge budget, but please do not let it disappoint you. It's creepy, tense and very scary! Just give it a try :)
