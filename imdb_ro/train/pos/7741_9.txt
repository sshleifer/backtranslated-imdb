The first of two adaptations of Jim Thompson released in 1990 (the other being better known GRIFTERS), AFTER DARK has all the features of Thompson: dangerous women, trusted play and characters that are not so gentle that others suspect being or not as harmless. Jason Patric is great as a former boxer disqualified from sports for life because of a ring incident (director James Foley uses RAGING BULL-esquire to reveal back story) and Rachel Ward is also very impressive. But Bruce Dern is the secret weapon of the movie: Bud's uncle, who speaks sweetly, orders every scene. In this movie there is almost no comic amusement, so look at him ready to be vacuumed.
