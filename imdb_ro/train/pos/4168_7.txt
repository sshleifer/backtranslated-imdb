Not only has this film one of the best film titles, but also the third crew of actors in the 1970s, Ike Eissenman and Kim Richards. I remember that this movie was broadcast in the Halloween week in 1978, going against Linda Blair in Stranger in our House. I missed my first run, choosing to see the other movie. Later, I repeat, I saw that I made the right choice. The movie is not very bad, but really does not have chills or surprises. Although, I liked the scene where Richard Crenna shot the family dog ​​without any results.
