This game is fun and has a plot that you could expect to see in the comic strip. Spider-man was framed by a mysterious impostor. The city is overwhelmed by a strange gas, and symbiotics like Venom and Carnage appear all over the city. Who is behind these crimes? Could it be Doc Ock? Well, he seems to have turned a new leaf. Venom also does not seem to be involved because he is just checked that the Spider-man apparently cost him a fairly good photo opportunity. The good cameos from other heroes and a lot of villains later, Spidey will reveal the mystery. Fighting is basic, it's not hard to lift, battles with bosses are rather fun. You can collect comic books, get rid of the internet and have some fun with the city. However, this is also a weak point. The cradle is not as great as everything you do is to go through the city, while Spider-Man attaches its appearance in the sky. You also do not have too much maneuverability on the internet, especially when compared to a video game about Spider-Man 2. However, it compensates quite badly about the other elements, especially the story. So be prepared to see Scorpio, Rhino, Venom, Mysterio, Doctor Octopus and Carnage for an action-packed walk.
