I had the opportunity to see the debut of this film at the Appalachian Film Festival, where she won the Best Film Award. This film is brilliantly made, with an excellent distribution that works well as a whole. My favorite performances were Youssef Kerkour, Justin Lane and Adam Jones. There are also a few big effects with dragonflies and beetles that I was surprised to learn that this movie was made with a small budget. Writer-director Adam Jones, who I think has also won a prize for his writing, does a great job in the direction. The audience loved this movie. Cross Eyed will make you laugh throughout the movie. You must certainly see.
