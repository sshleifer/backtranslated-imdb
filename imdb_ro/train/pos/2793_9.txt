It is a shame that because of the title, this film will be avoided by people who hate football. Bend it Like Beckham is much more than a brown sport shot. The story line is emotional and intelligent without being liked, the jokes funny laughing and the characters behave well. Naran Parminder and Keira Knightley are brilliant as Jess and Jules adolescents, performing both on the field and on the ground. Anupam Kher is awesome as Jess's troubled father, and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who was so stunningly bad in "Ride with the Devil," meets so well that the nice guy for once, takes full advantage of its Irish accent! Even if you do not like football, visit this movie. If anything will make you smile.
