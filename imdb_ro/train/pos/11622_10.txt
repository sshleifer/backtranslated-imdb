Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams starred in this action / thriller written and directed by suspense master Wes Craven, himself. The whole movie starts with trouble in The Lux Atlantic, a Miami hotel. The problem is solved by Lisa Reisert, the director of the hotel. Then he goes to the airport, and that's where everything starts. He meets Jackson Rippner, who does not like Jack being named Jack Ripper if you know him and I mean. Then he gets on the plane, and quite crazy, Rippner and Reisert stand next to each other. For the next half hour, Lisa is terrorized, tormented and frightened by Rippner. I will not give anything. Then we go to the place where Jack follows Lisa at the airport. Then Lisa goes to her to see if her father is good, and pretty crazy, that Rippner is already there. There are almost twelve minutes of violent violence and intense intensity on the whole scene. In total, about 25 minutes of intense action comes at the end of the year. Not only was the movie intense, but it had a big plot. As I said, I will not give anything, because it is so shocking and thrilling and somewhat disturbing / frightening. And acting from every character in the movie, even those who did not have lines at all, were all perfect. It was incredible. Everything was great in this movie! Actor, music, effects, makeup, direction, editing, writing, everything was great! Wes Craven is certainly the Master of Suspension. Red Eye is definitely a must-see and definitely worth spending your money. You could watch this movie over and over and will never be boring. The red eye has to say it's better than 10 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Original MPAA rating: PG-13: Some intense violence and language sequences <br /> <br /> My MPAA rating: PG-13: Some very intense sequences of violence and language My Canadian Rating: 14A: Violence, Scary Scenes, Disturbing Content
