One of the fastest and most documentary documentaries you will ever forget. While the story takes place in the capital of Venezuela, Caracas, it provides an intimate look at the political dynamics that predominate in the entire Western hemisphere. While, in essence, another chapter in the American hit story of America, this film chronicles in real-time what can happen when the poorest people are armed with unity, political wisdom and courage! <br /> <br /> The political outlook offered by this film is invaluable. We receive clear examples of the private media as a formidable force for mass deception and propaganda. We see the poor people in Caracas struggling with the brutal realities of "American politics." One has a clear sense of imminent conviction if people fail to address the flagrant tyranny that was suddenly and illegally shattered by conspirators. We also see arrogance and fascism, CIA support, private media, plutocrats and generals who have conspired to bring Venezuela back under Washington's domination. Although he is ably led by President Hugo Chavez, the people of Caracas are forced to act without him, after Chavez was abducted by the renegade generals. Their answer is the climax of the film. If someone looks for an excellent portrait of the US government, Hugo Chavez and revolutionary Venezuela, this is the movie!
