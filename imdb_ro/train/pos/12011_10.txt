I am amazed at the negative comments I have read and I can only assume that the people who made such comments were less than honest. This is the most mysterious and real portrayal of Joseph Smith I have ever seen. It was good to say that sometimes I forgot to watch a movie. He brought Joseph's life to hardship, good-natured optimism, long-standing faith in men and God, and supreme sacrifice for life, in a way that honestly left my movement and silence with astonishment. If anyone, of any Christian religion can watch this movie without being touched in a positive way - I should say it is a reflection of the individual and not of the film. I give it to the movie "10" and I encourage sincere souls to see it. In the smallest way, it is a highly felt portrait of the man who gave everything he had for what he believed ... In a world where values ​​and beliefs are ridiculed, this film is a lasting memory of the genre of people we suppose to be - no matter what religious beliefs we have. - Ann Pruitt-
