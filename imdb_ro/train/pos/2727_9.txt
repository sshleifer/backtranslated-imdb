One of the best true crime films ever made and very faithful in Truman Capote's book, which invented the romantic genre of true crime. Haunting Quincy Jones scores musically and terribly as Scott Wilson and Robert Blake as Dick and Perry, the killers. Why Wilson did not continue to be a big star after this film is a mystery to me. The black and white cinema and the editing in this movie are top notch. Re-creation of crimes is terrifying and since it leaves the imagination of real crimes, even more frightening than if it showed that the rifle is moving away. The film was filmed in Clutter's house, which was sold to another person after the crime. The film has a very documentary atmosphere - besides scenes from Clutter's house, other scenes have been filmed at gas stations and in the shops where the killers actually were. Nancy Clutter's beloved horse, Babe, is right in the movie. Geer will have a serious role as a short-term prosecutor who is not only filmed in the courtroom, but also has some of the criminal criminals of Clutter, who is acting as the jury of the film. <br /> <br /> This is a solid, scary film every time you see it.
