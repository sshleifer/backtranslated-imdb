Paulie sounds like the prettiest, lizard and saliva trash you could find, but it's actually much better than you expected. The difficulty of the plot could have so easily made the tone of the whole film, but in fact in most other departments the film is charming. If you ask, Paulie is a parrot. Buying for a little girl with speech difficulties, Paulie becomes her best friend and goes all over with her. He even stands on his shoulder during speech lessons and eventually becomes a super-intelligent speaker. However, Paulie is sent by the girl's mother and spends the rest of the movie trying to get to NYC in Los Angeles to get together with her. So why is this horrible doing the movie doing pretty well? First, it boasts some interesting and impressive animatronic effects. Second (and much more significant) he has the courage to embrace his playful premise and to tell a truly moving story, often humorous, without worrying too much about the obvious flaws in the story. Third, she has some surprisingly powerful performances, including Jay Mohr as a sweet cock, Gow Rowlands as a nice old lady and Cheech Marin (yes, Cheech Marin smoking!) As a musical immigrant. It may not be a classic, but Paulie is a solid entertainment for kids of all ages.
