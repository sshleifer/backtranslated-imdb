I thought the "River of Souls," was a very good Babylon 5 movie, with some exceptional performances from Martin Sheen, Tracy Scoggins and Ian MacShane. If this was an episode of the series (without humor), it would probably be one of my favorite stand-alone stories of the series. <br /> <br /> Personally, I have always preferred to Christian Scoggins, although he has given JMS no writing, and for much of the series and she had to endure the Byron / Telepath plot. If it removes the shrieking humor of the brothel and the "poorer" actors in those scenes, then this movie is solid. Probably the third favorite of the four films, but not at all bad.
