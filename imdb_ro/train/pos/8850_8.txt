Legendary director Sidney Lumet gives us one of his best movies in his historical career in this extremely tense story and, ultimately, shocking about a family including one of the dysfunctional children. Through a listed list led by Philip Seymour Hoffman (an Oscar-winning performance), Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney, Lumet captured not only elements of crime stories, such as Reservoir Dogs, Ordinary People. Many viewers may be confused and feel overwhelmed when building the plot that Lumet left here. Instead of showing him in a linear way, he crossed the Tarantino route and shows the central scene of a lost robbery from different points of view, all inappropriate. I have found that this is very satisfactory and has allowed me to constantly guess what would happen next. The script is very strong, with some excellent scenes between husband and wife Hoffman and Tomei, and between father and son Finney and Hoffman. All the actors are totally committed to watching, and Lumet is clearly entertaining in the direction of a style that usually does not enslave him. A lot of action and suspense to keep the audience in for two hours of running, this is a rare movie, I'm disappointed for a moment.
