When you encounter a gem of a movie like this, you realize why the 80s were the longest decade to live. Rock music reigned, so did the movies ... especially the horror films. The filmmakers knew how to have fun, and "Trick or Treat" is obvious for this. When rocker Sammi Curr, most probably written by W.A.S.P. Blackie Lawless singer, dies in a hotel fire, his # 1 Eddie fan, is distracted. He goes to his friend and local DJ Nuke (Gene Simmons) for support. Nuke gives him a copy of Sammy's last record; this is the only available copy. It was given to the radio to be played live night Halloween. When Eddie plays it, she brings Sammy back. He helps Eddie with the bullies at school, but then he does not have control. It's definitely a great movie. The bad thing is that this movie has no footprint. I paid $ 25.00 to finally get off eBay. Should be ... well spent!
