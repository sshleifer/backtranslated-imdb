A kind of road movie in old-fashioned trains from the late Slowen province. At first, you see someone in black linen trousers sewing underwear and when the same pair of black trousers leave their two suitcase, you see the pants are missing on a mourning flag (apparently his father has died). In the train there is a young lady, and almost without words, but with many small gestures, begins a wonderful love story. It's a surreal, very poetic and a bit bizarre movie with many weird characters and strange incidents. Beautiful pictures with love for beautiful details.
