The horse is indeed a fine animal. The picturesque pictures of wild horses and their grace could not have been more important in animated animation. The animation is simply breathtaking. Beautiful animation forms the backbone of the beauty that the horses are encouraging on the move. Moreover, when the stallion crosses a different ground, it jumps over rocks and faces waters. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack is too impressive. Wonderful instrumental music makes you appreciate the movie. <br /> <br /> "They say the story about the West was written from a horse's saddle" huh? Well, the story of a safe horse was written from the saddle of the West. Overall, this movie is obviously up there with the best. It's one of the best animated movies I've ever watched. It would be a very good choice in a lonely night. A slight 9/10.
