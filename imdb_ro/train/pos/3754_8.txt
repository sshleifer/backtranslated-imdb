I remember watching this movie on Saturday afternoon in the 1950s or 60s. It was well presented, but I remember that there was a message of hope broadcast by transmitters secreted in lamps in one of the last manic executions for the imminent release. I'm not sure squares with facts. Still the movie is well done. The High Command of Germany reports with no excitement "The Russians are heading for Fredrich Strasse" as though everything was in line with the plan. It was my impression that this film and an American later off is based on the account of British historian Trevor-Roper with a similar title "Last Days of Hitler". I was surprised to see no credit to Trevor-Roper. I agree that the newest German film on DOWNFALL was as well made as the classic. The American was a bit flat. Few figures have attracted so much attention in cinematography as Adolph. However, I find it interesting that none of the many movies and books that ever came out speak of Hitler's double alluded to the transition to John Toland's magnificent historical play.
