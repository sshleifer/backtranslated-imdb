I'm so glad to see the movie at the store. We were looking for some happy movies and it turned out to be a real jewel. I liked the fact that the movie, a love story, was not about beautiful twenty years; rather, it is a story of beautiful sixty things that were usually twenty years old. It's a good story, well written and wonderful acting with the fabulous music of the World War II band. It also has a delightful surprise for the Scottish castle lovers. I let myself smile and ready to look again, which I did several times before I returned. We highly recommend it.
