Fact: Stargate SG-1 is a cheesy sci-fi television series. <br /> <br /> There are no escape facts. How much you try to excuse or explain, Stargate SG-1 remains a series of gross sci-fi television. Stargate SG-1 borrows and steals ideas frowns. Special FXs are not as impressive as it could have been and the action will not pull you out of the chair. Or a couch for this either. But, and here I really think Stargate SG-1 deserves all the credit it can get, for every stolen episode or idea, I think you can count on at least one cheesy sci-fi movie that is actually worse than an hour-long TV episode. In fact, some episodes may be probably 90 minutes long and still better than most movies. <br /> <br /> Being able to keep that quality throughout the show and continue to deliver and push the story further is what makes the Stargate SG-1 special. <br /> <br /> I'm very keen on my selections. He probably watches at least one or two television series and I have quite high standards, which made me even more surprised when I got up. So for those who decide to still capture Stargate SG-1 another SF show, do not they? Stick with him and see what I'm talking about.
