I just looked at "The Last Wave" in the fine arts library in my school. It's interesting, like Peter Weir's all, but it's not always as exciting as I would have liked. I was fascinated by the ideas that were cast to me (because they are very well handled by the director of Weir), but at the same time I was not stimulated enough by them. AKA I've been a little bored in the stains. The plot surrounds an Aussie lawyer who gets obsessed with some dreams he has that bind him to an Aborigone group he defends. <br /> <br /> It begins with an intense sequence of weather and has some wonderful mood effects (especially bizarre, noise design) and a strong direction; but I did not have fun like Weir's movies. I may have to look at her again, though. Good film about obsession and mystery. Because, ultimately, the mystery that exists between whites and aborigines offers some very serious consequences. However, God bless Peter Weir. Only for him this film deserves to be ... very organic director. As a response to Aussie Malick! He would give me a 7, because he has great ideas to overcome his boring moments.
