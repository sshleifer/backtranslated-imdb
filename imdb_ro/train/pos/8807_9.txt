This is a documentary collection that lasts 11 minutes 9 seconds and 1 frame of artists from around the world. The documentaries are varied and deal with all sorts of concepts, the only thing that is divided is the theme 9/11 (very small in some cases). Some of the segments are weak, while others are very strong; some are politicians, some are not; some are just about 9/11, some are simply using 9/11 as the theme to reach human feelings, emotions and tragedies that are universal; some are mainstream, while others are abstract and artistic). This movie was never censored by anyone, so the thoughts you see are very cruel and powerful. This is a very controversial film, especially for conservative Americans. I think two segments could really tick off the right (one in Egypt where a dead American soldier and a dead Palestinian bomber come back as spirits, another in the UK that tells the US backed up in Chile on September 11, 1973, in 50,000 horrible deaths and atrocities). The Mexican segment was the strongest, telling the downfall of the towers and the resulting death (you must see it believe that). Even if the final product is uneven, with some segments being almost "useless," it still recommends this. It is very difficult to classify this movie because the segments vary along the scene (some weak, some very strong;). We rated 9 out of 10 just because some segments were excellent and covered the issues that are usually censored (Mexico, the UK segment, the Japan segment, the Egypt segment).
