The typical De Palma film, made with a lot of style and some scenes that will bring you to the edge of the chair. Sure, the thing that makes this movie better than the average thriller is the style. It has some scenes and scenes that are really stupid that will bring you to the edge of your chair. The best scene in the movie; The scene of the museum and the crime of the elevator. There are some light erotic scenarios, and the pace of the movies may not be fast enough for occasional viewers to fully appreciate this film. So this movie may not be right for everyone. The story itself is also pretty good, but it really is the style that makes the movie work! It could be for fans only, but also occasional viewers should appreciate well build tension in the film. There are some nice character portrayed by a good cast. Michael Caine is an interesting casting choice, and Angie Dickinson works just as well as it looks good (not bad for a 49-year-old!). Pino Donaggio's musical score is usually De Palma, and it matches the movie well, just like his score for De Palma's other "Body Double". Thrilling Thriller of Brightening Nerves. I like De Palma! 10/10
