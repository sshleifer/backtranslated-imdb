The first time I came to Delirious, I only heard that. I listened to the whole comedy show and never laughed so much in my life. Eddie's ability to paint wonderful pictures in our minds and make a great imitation is exciting. When I finally got to see him perform this act, I had to know him. Edri Murphy's performance at Delirious shows his genius! Being the new millennium, its actions in 1983 are as fun as today. My parents loved her as teens, and I (eighteen) too, love them too. From that point on, I had to see Murphy's other films, such as Coming To America and Harlem Nights. There will be another comedian like Eddie.
