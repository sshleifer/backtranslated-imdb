Los Angeles news reporter Jennifer (beautiful Barbara Bach of "The Spy Who Loved Me") and her two assistants Karen (Karen Lamm) and Vicki (quite Lois Young) find her a delicious point in a scene tasty and free nude drink) go to Solvang, California to fly an annual Danish festival. Since all the local hotels are firmly reserved, the three beautiful ladies are forced to seek room and board in an old but premeditated villa owned by a strange Ernest Keller (deliciously played at the late geeky perfection, the great Sydney Lassick ) sister Virginia (a solid Lelia Goldoni). Unfortunately, Keller has a dark and lethal family secret in his basement: a portrait, pathetic, diapazed, with incest, the Mongoloid mother named Junior (Stephen Furst's alternate, exciting and frightening portrait); ), which, of course, unleashes and causes a deadly disaster. Danny Steinmann, capable of a uniform action, from a robust cast, a perverse plot, an excellent Craig Reardon make-up, a beautiful atmosphere, a a wild, wild climate, a slow but balanced pace, and a surprisingly heart-breaking final freeze frame (the incest sub-plot packs an unexpectedly powerful and beating blow), something you should be ignoring in the early 1980s.
