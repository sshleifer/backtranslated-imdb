I liked this masterpiece and, frankly, I found Mary Poppins (although I love Julie Andrews and Dick VanDyke) as silly and cute. Angela Lansbury plays her character to perfection and I do not know why people think this movie is distorted. It was magic and it was really fun to look at. Every scene has a certain charm as you know the characters better. You will really see how this family thrown together learns to connect with each other, despite their age and differences. I thought the characters were well developed, especially Charles who was at the "Age of Not Believe". Mary Poppins may be more popular and more appreciated by others, but this little jewel will be the one I will love and I will always cherish it.
