I did not know what to do but to think it was much better not to have been too much. Do not worry, it's not a bad little movie. Tess Nanavati is a relatively new director and writer, so I think he deserves a lot of kudos to make this film. You can say it was an act of love for her. The actor (outside Dominic) is a little camouflaged, and the quality of the movie is not great, but for a very low budget movie. There have been moments in which the story line is complicated and there are parts that are pulling, although they do not feel that it deviates a lot for the ability to understand the movie. If you love Dominic Monaghan as much as I do, I say we go to him. The gag drum was fun, I will not hurt it, but there is a special scene that makes DVDs worthwhile just to be able to watch it all the time. If you like the movie then check out The Mirror Pink, a Jagged Edge movie. I know Dominic's fans will enjoy this little piece of heaven.
