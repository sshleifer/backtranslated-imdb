I watched this movie several times and found it very good. This film is also known as "Castle of Terror", "Coffin of Terror" and "Dance Macabre". Barbara Steele, is her usually beautiful / creepy self. George Riviere, the male lead, does a good job with his role. The whole film sneaks in with the atmosphere, and there is a very good stretch. The camera angles are good, and the role, for the most part, is not bad. This movie is suitable for a rainy day or evening. I have a smooth DVD version that is much superior to the edited TV version. Take some popcorn, pull out the lights, relax and enjoy yourself. John R. Tracy
