This is the best piece of film ever created, a masterpiece that brought me a tear. I will never forget my experience. I do not understand why people do not think I do. The dinosaur turns into a performance that resembles De Niro in the Raging Bull, Pacino in Scarface and Crowe in the Combined Gladiator. This should be released on DVD in Superbit format, so I can fully enjoy it as if it were meant to be enjoyed when they produced and filmed it. Whoppi Goldberg really transforms himself into the performance of a life like a tough, tough policeman who is against his will, along with a hot dinosaur as a partner, then hi-jinx. By telling the complete opposite of truth, this film is a total garbage.
