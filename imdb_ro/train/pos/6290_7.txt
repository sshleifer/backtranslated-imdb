Using Buster Keaton in the twilight of his career was an exciting choice. Perhaps he was the most talented comedian of the silent age. This gives him the chance to expose his talents to a travel story. He connects with a guy who lives in modern times and it becomes obvious that we are better left in our times, Keaton is able to make his very good gags. I've heard his voice. I think she made some of the movies on the beach playing some naked characters just to earn a couple of dollars. Serling seemed to have respect for him and described it like that. It's not a bad story. It shows how we react when we want something that we do not have, and we get this desire.
