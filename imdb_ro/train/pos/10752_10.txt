This was the most astonishing, moving, amazing and incredible story I've ever experienced. Honestly, even those adjectives can not describe it. I can not just choose a scene that stands out for me. I suppose if I had to write a few, it would be the fireman's reactions to the crashing sound of jumping victims; the reaction of people caught in the elevator who were not aware of what was happening, while finally appearing on the horrible scene; the shock and the unbelief of the viewers; and finally silence. <br /> <br /> That day, and right now, I remember Star Wars (1977). Obi-Wan says, "I felt a great disturbance of the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out and were suddenly silenced." It's amazing how precise it is in its description. There really was a disturbance of the Force. This documentary reveals this disturbance alive. Feelings are so incredibly visual. Anger, frustration, shock, fear, exhaustion, and even its amplitude. Everything is there. It's not a bad thing. This is a powerful and moving documentary and it's worth it for Emmy. Not just because it documents 9/11, but because it's simply everything that should be. <br /> <br /> If you are going to watch, be sure to take a tissue box. You will need them. I know I did.
