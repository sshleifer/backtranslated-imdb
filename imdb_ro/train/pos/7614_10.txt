I'm obsessed! The story is amazing and the show is very addictive, but I like it. I'm in Season 2, Disc 5, and I'm telling you I'm too attached to the characters now. Whatever it would hurt for them to seriously affect my vote for the show. Michael is on my list now. Kidding ... I am so happy to see there is a season 3, because I was too afraid to go on the 6th drive, thinking it would end. I can not wait to see the rest now. Thanks to directors / producers / and Lost actors ... I love watching TV again. Before Lost I navigated through every cannon who sleeps because of my disappointment on TV, but I have to say that Lost is my kind of entertainment!
