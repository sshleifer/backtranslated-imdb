This superb movie is based on a variety of talented actors and musicians at their peak - Levant, Crosby, Martin, Rathbone, Manone are completely home to the story that was apparently provided by Billy Wilder. We would like to find out more about how much he has to do with it, because it is an exceptionally intelligent variation on the stellar master / fertile servant - almost an allegory of the entertainment industry led by numismatized dry, vibrant art and gameplay by a subclass exploited by nobodies and non-WASPs. Looking at the last six decades of music, television and film in the US, it's hard not to see the fundamental perceptions of this film as prophetic.
