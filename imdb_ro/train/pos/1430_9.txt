This was playing at our Amsterdam theater and the movie we wanted to see was sold, so we went to this, knowing nothing but a documentary about the planet. We were very happy about our unhappiness because it was a very powerful film about life and the delicate balance we share with the rest of the Earth's inhabitants. This movie has some of the most amazing photos I've ever seen in a movie and took my places from ocean deserts to rain forests and display things I've never seen in a movie, TV or book! "Earth" is a movie that every student needs to see before becoming jaded. I encourage my granddaughter to see this movie ever since he inherits the planet we are leaving. This is also a movie to see on a theater screen or a very large TV because the photo is so powerful and exotic.
