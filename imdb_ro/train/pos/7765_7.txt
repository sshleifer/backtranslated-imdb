Douglas Sirk directs this drama everywhere about the trifling affluent. Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack) and Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) are friends of childhood with a different look at life. Kyle is the woman son of an oil tycoon; Mitch works for Hadley Oil. Both of them fall in love with the same woman, Lucy Moore; but it's Kyle who has the means to amaze him and marry her. Sister Marylee (Dorothy Malone) seems to be the nymph of the city and wearing a torch for Mitch, who always seems to have cleaned Hadley's misery. Ambitious with pretension; a little over the top, but the stars make it a movie you can see. I was very impressed with Malone. Shooting Robert Keith, Edward Platt, John Lurch and Robert J. Wilke.
