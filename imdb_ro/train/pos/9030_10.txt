This movie caught me by surprise. My friend told me that this movie was a "chicken blow". Oh, it was wrong! This movie has a great interest for the family, without sexual scenes, like other movies. Jake Gyllenhaal does an excellent job in Homer Hickam's shoes. Support support is great as well. Science, age, family quarrels, a great stage train ... This movie has everything. The soundtrack is good, although the score is quite odd. Music of the 1950s releases the film over the edge of greatness. The DVD definitely deserves to weigh in the coal. Repeated value is great - I've already seen it a few times.
