This film has slipped through the fissures of film history. It is much better than other New York movies, such as "The French Connection" or "Taking Pelham 1-2-3". There is a peculiar reality for this movie, which also manages to use humor effectively to continue the plot line. It engages from start to finish and does not affect age, as is the case with the two examples above. Ron Liebman turns into a brilliant performance like "Batman" and it's a shame that his career will not come out as a result of this project. Gordon Parks leads, and as happens after "Shaft," it seems at first to be a weird choice. However, it is the reverse of that previous effort and has approached so much in face machismo. Unfortunately, this movie was not available either on DVD or on VHS in the United States. Some artists really have a jewel in their hands and it's a shame they do not do anything with it.
