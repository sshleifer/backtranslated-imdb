This was 101's Eddie Robinson's latest film, and died of cancer nine days after filming was completed. Although some styles of hair and clothing are little given (also note the video game displayed in the movie), but the subject in the movie is quite long. Heston said he wanted to make the film for some time because he really believed in the dangers of overpopulation. Several things make this movie a classic. The story is solid. The actress is of paramount importance, especially the interaction between Heston and Robinson, with beautiful performances by Cotten and Peters. Music is absolutely perfect. The core of Beethoven, Grieg and Tchaikovsky, combined with pastoral visual elements, makes for some truly moving scenes. This was fog on the cake for the film. And the theme (or "point") of the film is a significant one. Yes, it's a movie about overpopulation, but, in a more important note, it's a story about what can go wrong with the man on Earth. It is the subtext that you will find the true message of the movie. Pay attention to what Sol says about the "old days" of the past (which is our present) and note how Thorn is incapable of understanding what Sol says. This movie is one of my top SF movies of all time.
