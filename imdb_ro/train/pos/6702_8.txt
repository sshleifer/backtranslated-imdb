Even if there are no new episodes and is rarely shown. I used to love the magic of Sabrina and the teenager witch. I've never seen the last episodes, but I want to know what happened to Miles or Josh? And why did aunts disappear from the show forever? I'm sure the end was perfect. But there are a lot of unanswered questions. And I want to see the last episode of S.T.W.! Because I hear he's deciding between Erin and Harvey on her wedding day! I really hope he takes Harvey! And I can say that Nate Richart is HOT! Too bad, but too old for me. Melissa Joan Hart has her own sense of joy that she adds to the show, but there are many things a little "bad" for the show, like famous bands coming out of nowhere and singing songs and everything they listened to, stupid. Plus the cat starts to get really tortuous, the show went on, the jokes just started to get stupid and the things the audience "controlled" audiences would like, I think it was so lacy. Do not misunderstand me, at some places it was fun, but I think the show has somehow lost "the magic", to say that the show continued. They give kudos all the casta, although I tried, though Soleil Moon Frye's girl had no taste, and she was a horrific actress. I wonder what Melissa is doing or some of the cast now for this, now that the show is over.
