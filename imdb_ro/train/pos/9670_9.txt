One of the best movies I've ever seen was an Irish movie titled Philadelphia, Here I Come. I read the play before I saw the movie and I loved both of them. It's the story of a young man who is preparing to leave Ireland to go to America because he can not earn his living in Ireland. It is both the young man's perspective (which the other characters in the film can see) as well as another young man who represents his uncensored thoughts and feelings but can not be seen by the other characters in the film. It's a very sad but deeply moving film and I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to think about something. I love any Irish film or almost any movie about Ireland, and any film with the late Irish actor, Donal McCann, will take my vote. I saw that man chew gum for 2 hours on the screen and unfortunately I have. shame that they lost him so young.
