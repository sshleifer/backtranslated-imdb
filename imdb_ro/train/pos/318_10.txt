It is no doubt the biggest film ever made. It's almost incomprehensible even with many repetitive views in an attempt to find out what's going on. The film was almost entirely improvised and includes random musical numbers, advertisements, mailing contests, and a host of other innovations. What other movies did Martin Luther King, Jr? To decipher the movie, hunt the director's book titled "I was curious." It will become clear. It is a grandiose and bold experiment in improvised improvised recruitment. A triumph. Now, if only someone would put a version with subtitles in a color * other than white ... white caps tend to wash and become invisible.
