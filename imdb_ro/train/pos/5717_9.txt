Omigosh, this is seriously the most frightening movie I've ever seen. Lets say I like horror movies would be an understatement and saw piles (given the limited availability in New Zealand is pretty much), but I never had to sleep with the light ... until I saw The Grudge . Some may say that is a split ring (both based on horror movies Japanese), both lines similar (but different), but Grudge retains its own as a terrifying movie - seeing the movie, I even cried a certain time of the film. The actor is great, especially the characters who support - Kade Strickland is fantastic and steal the show, is an enthusiastic person. Jason Behr is a real hottie, and William Mapother seems to have fun. However, while I'm normally a fan of Clea DuVall, it does not seem real in this film. Of the supporting characters, she probably has the deepest story, but she does not seem to be still there. As it concerns Sarah Michelle Gellar, it remains about the same in all films and her roles, is not it? Ghosts were really scary, music and sound effects are cool (especially noise Kade Strickland's character answering the phone in her apartment), and the end was cold. Super recommended. 9/10
