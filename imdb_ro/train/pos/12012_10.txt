I saw her at the Legacy Theater in the Joseph Smith memorial building in Salt Lake City this morning. I will assume that the level of joy that you will enjoy during this film will largely be based on the level of acceptance of Joseph's story. However, besides this, it was very well done, a nice score. If you arrive in Salt Lake City, it is necessary to see it in the Legacy Theater. I have never been in a more beautiful theater in terms of image quality, sound quality and the atmosphere of my whole life ... I wonder if the church left me to watch Batman Begins out there! Since I am LDS and look at Joseph as a prophet, I have been touched in several places and has been brought to tears several times ... which I suppose is to be expected when they gave the tissues before the start of the film ! Anyway, I was told that this movie is available in several LDS visiting centers around the world if you have 70 minutes of verification, because if you think Joseph Smith or not, he says a fascinating story.
