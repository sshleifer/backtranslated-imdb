At a time in our culture, where the reality exposed as a narrative is an excessive fiction as we know it on the small and large screen, "Apart From That" is a movie that portrays real-life moments that feel more honest, ever seen. The usual bullfood conditions do not exist in this film, leaving a content audience to sit down and follow these real-life moments that slide one after another on the screen. While watching the movie and even after contemplating the job, it is hard to believe that these amazing shows where, in fact, performances. Every moment, with the great actors, the truth was exposed in the ordinary daily life. Even so, "Apart From That" does not feel like a documentary or real television, but transcends into its own category with its cinema and its unique direction. I look forward to watching this new category of stories continue with other films by directors Jennifer Shainin and Randy Walker. This movie must be seen.
