Richard Widmark is a mysterious character in this movie. He is a professional pocket. He has been in prison three times, but at the beginning of the film he tries to make four. Thelma Ritter is a busy body that sells information to almost everyone. Jean Peters is amazing as Widmark's flaming face. This is an epic piece during the McCarthy era where Red Scare ruled politics and was worked out in this pretty plot. What is unusual with this film is that Peters & Ritter are both victims of violent beatings in a time when women were rarely more than sexual objects in movies. This is what makes this film noir, because women often have different roles in this type of film. The film is only 87 minutes and was obviously made by Fox as the business card for the doubles in the theater. Sets show it's a budget-limited movie. The script made J Edgar Hoover crazy because patriotism is taken down. Hoover wanted to change. Instead, it became a B under book card, which was a sleeping hit in 1953. The script and acting in it are better than the other great features were that year.
