Well, this movie was probably one of the most amusing scary movies I've ever seen. The effects are so bad that you just have to laugh, and the actor, well, tell him not gibson. But Gary Browning, who plays a police officer, is so bad, he gets good. I do not know how, but he himself makes this movie a 10. You have to see if in your horror / slash movies cause bloody and funny at the same time. The criminal movie.
