I really like this movie because in Australia, Chinese movies like this never show up during the first. I have to say that this is one of the best ever films that highlights the difference between the people of Hong Kong and the mainland Chinese. She really shows there is discomfort between the two, but she can become better than HK learns Mandarin. He also showed me how there is indie rock in mainland China and that the Chinese people know how to shock the guitar and make funking! Who said that China is not ready for rock music? Daniel Wu is absolutely gorgeous, with his clear and clear voice, honest action and a total chicken magnet. I recommend this film to those who do not know much about the Asian people to get rid of typical Western stereotypes and those who love Chinese / Asian cinema like me. Check it out!
