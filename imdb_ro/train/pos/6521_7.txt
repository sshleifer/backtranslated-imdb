Taken in the context of the time it was made, it seemed like a good film. While the details can be "dramatized," the general history was a first good reason. In addition, I discovered the actors I know a real pleasure of. Who would imagine Ben Cartwright as a corpse? I'll let the rest of the star see you. As for the secondary film, this film (as we expected from a movie made in the late thirties) has a nice character actor, but the best kudos of Peavey, the man of Andrew Jackson. Well, shot with beautiful ships and acting competent all the time, I recommend this to any person who has a taste for a light camp or an eye for a two-part play, set at dawn in America, and made in a period in which great names, and top notch character actors, were a real pleasure to enjoy.
