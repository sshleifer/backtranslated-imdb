Hardcastle and McCormick are an excellent television show. <br /> <br /> Yeah, it's predictable just like Dukes of Hazzard, Hunter, A-Team, etc. etc. This show is just a good clean TV. The relationship between Hardcastle and McCormick is pretty funny. They often take jabs from each other several times over an episode, which adds great humor to the show. Contains more car searches in almost every episode, but who does not enjoy a good tracking machine? Especially with Coyote! <br /> <br /> I just want them to make a clean TV like this today I highly recommend!
