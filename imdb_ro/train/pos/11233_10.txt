I think I'm the third fan of the Hidden Frontier, seeing that I am among a small group of fans who have actually met most of these guys - of course, without counting conventions, of course. I've been looking at the Hidden Frontier since 2001 and I have to say I'm still impressed with what these boys have come to. Hidden Frontier is Rob Caves creature and his studio, Areakt Pictures, operating from the room behind his house. Although it is not as fancy as the TOS New Voyages series (sometimes becoming some of the actors in the original series, such as Walter Koenig, known as Chekov), Rob and HF distribution and crew manage to create a worthy series to replace that terrible experiment called "Enterprise." The most controversial and successful story was the introduction of Star Trek's first gay character, Corey Aster (which was introduced in the second season), and his quest for a soul mate. Somewhere in the series, he meets Jorian Zen, the Trill officer in Excelsior. In the recent story lines with these two characters (Warning: MAJOR SPOILER! Do not read if you have not followed the series to this point!), Zen is associated with an exiled symbol, causing a great change and conflict in his relationship with Aster. Although the future is uncertain - as the latest episode, "Beachhead" was just shown to HF fans in the chat room last night - I think this relationship will last, but only time will tell. /> Gene Roddenberry created Star Trek with the intention that the story be more about his characters than about space battles. Rob Caves created the Hidden Frontier for the same reason - and that made this series as popular as it is. As I said before, I would like to give her a rating of more than 10, but it will have to be enough. Though the next season will be the last - keeping the tradition of seven season shows Star Trek: The Next Generation - I'm willing to bet that we'll hear a lot about Hidden Frontier after that final episode.
