Some have compared this film to Deliverance. I think of mice and men is more appropriate. Our driving man, Heaton, certainly loves Spike. It is irrelevant and immaterial if it is sexual love. That's why Heaton does not leave Spike. He needs it. They need each other. As brothers, as a family, as their only connection to humanity. The setting, the scenario, the minimal distribution go to a great movie. Frankly, I did not care what happened to the characters. But, I cared what the filmmaker made with them. She did well with them. I spent a while wondering how the mummies and men will end up. The soundtrack and the cinema were convincing and interesting.
