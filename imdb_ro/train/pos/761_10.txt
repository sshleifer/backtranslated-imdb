I just want to say that among all the so-called classic hiphop movies seen as Wild Style, KrushGroove, Breakin ', Stil Wars etc ... IMO BEAT STREET is the best of the others. Whenever I ask other people about their deeds, then it seems that BEAT STREET breaks out the most. But still, it is the lowest of all. 4.3 is just a punch "under the belt" (If I say, 5 points is the belt). I love the musical performances, breakdancing makes me want to pray, RAMO makes me want to throw a piece ... be, a classic !!!
