When Paris arrived, we totally rejected it. I was not in the whole Madonna and Vogue phenomenon. I thought it would be camouflaged and silly. How bad I was about this movie. I looked after the movie came out for ten years and I went out and bought it. I went back in time and a place of fun and excitement. I felt like I knew all the characters personally. The 80's were spectacular and the film captured the essence of homosexual culture. What a great job! I went over the internet and found out what some of the original members were doing now, but I could not locate them all. If anyone has any information about any of the casting members, please let me know. <br /> <br /> I hope to do another documentary. I loved him
