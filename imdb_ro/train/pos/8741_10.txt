"A Bug's Life" is like a favorite candy bar - it's full of small bits that adds something really tasty. The story could not have been better; is intelligent, has "heart" (emotion) and each character has a beautiful "bow" (growth or change). By comparison, the only characters in "Toy Story" to have a "bow" are Buzz, who learns to love his role as a toy, and Woody, who overcomes his resentment at Buzz. There are tons of laughs and nice moments in "A Bug's Life". All actors turn into a great voice work, and the animation, both motion and detail, is superb. This serious movie does not throw around "10", but this movie deserves the "10" I've given it.
