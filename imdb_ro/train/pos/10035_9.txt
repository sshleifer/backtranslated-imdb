I think James Cameron could become my favorite director, because this is the second review of my films. Anyway, everyone remembers RMS Titanic. It was great, fast and "reckless" ... until April 1912. It was all over the news and one of the greatest tragedies ever. Well, James Cameron decided to make a movie of this, but stay in the spotlight instead of the ship. Well, on the main review, but let me remind you that this is a fact of opinion and zero and the only fact that will be present is a film event. So our two main characters are Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet). They are not annoying too much, but watch this and you'll find out why it could become annoying (http://tinyurl.com/ojhoyn). The main negative character is bad luck, fate, God's hand (no blasphemy), or simply Caledon Hockley (Billy Zane). Combine all the above and what do you do?! Oh yes! We have a love story on a sunken boat. My personal characters are as follows: My personal favor, Andrews (Victor Garber), Ledyoy (David Warner), Murdoch (Ewan Stewart), Lightoller (Jonathan Phillips), Molly Brown (Kathy Bates) and more. We also have the current treasure hunter, Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton). They add something to the story, something good. The action here is wonderful, especially in the second half, drama and good. Finally, you can have eyes storm rain or silent tears. The story is simple and working. A treasure hunter seeks the heart of the ocean and instead finds a drawing of a woman wearing that diamond. He calls and tells the story about Titanic RMS. Two lovers separated from the social class and, ultimately, from the fate of the ship. Everything about the story works and there are very few defects. I give Titanic a wonderful 86%
