This film was shot on location in Gerard Gardens in Liverpool and was the United Kingdom's response to films such as "Jungle Blackboard". The film is the test of time quite well, with all the moral stories still (or even more) relevant today. The film has a good performance from notable British actors such as David McCallum, Stanley Baker, Peter Cushing and Anne Heywood. Baker plays the role of a Liverpool policeman responsible for juvenile detention obligations, assuming that if you catch the children at an early age, they will become adults responsible. Starring Freddie Starr Fred Fowell) and Melvyn Hayes (Gloria). Tsai Chin and Michael Chow play brother and sister (they are the brother of real life and sister) who are caught in an incendiary web. Tsai Chin continues to act and can be seen in Nicole Kidman's "The Interpreter." The violent playground has a gun siege in a school, so it's unlikely to be on TV after similar events in Scotland / Russia. I lived in Gerard gardens, where the film was shot (though not born at that time) and have beautiful memories in the area. I recently completed a documentary about Gerard Gardens, which includes extracts from "Violent Playground" and a small UK movie "Coast to Coast" that plays Lenny Henry and Pete Postlewaite. The apartments were demolished in 1987, and the movies go some way to keeping their memory alive. There have been some complaints from the residents when the film was released, the film representing the area in a bad light. Time helped heal these wounds. A little gem of a movie, I would recommend you look for it
