After SuperFriends and Scooby Doo left the morning satellites in the morning of Saturday in the autumn of 1986, I stopped watching the cartoon on Saturday morning, because they were the only two who agreed. Since neither Real Ghostbusters nor Flintstone Kids seemed very promising, I retired and started sleeping on Saturday morning. I only came back to the television on Saturday morning in 1988 for that year just for one animated show. <br /> <br /> A new Superman animated show was something I did not have to go through. I was 17 and high school at that time, but so! I liked the show. As far as I can remember, this series was a gift for the fans I suppose to celebrate Superman's 50th birthday that year. He had the musical theme and the style of music that reminded of John Williams' film score in Richard Donner / Christopher Reeve Superman. I honestly felt that Ruby Spears's animation style was a reminiscence of Super Powers: the Galactic Guardian series by Hanna Barbera a few years before. Sadly, Danny Dark did not come back as Superman, but I felt that Beau Weaver did a very impressive job because Superman's and Clark Kent's voice was not like the Chris Reeve version. After hearing Reed Richards / Mr. Fantastic in Fantastic Fours, I could still see this version of Superman in my mind. Ginny McSwain as Lois Lane. LOL! What rhyme. She was a voice director for Hanna Barbera and Ruby Spears, and I think she's got her to do Lois herself. Reminders from SuperFriends remained in this series when it came to voice over cast. Jimmy Olsen is Mark Taylor, who at SuperFriends was formerly Firestorm. Perry White is none other than the former Batman TV writer Stanley Ralph Ross, who at SuperFriends was Gorilla Grodd and Brainiac in the Super Powers shows. And Lex Luthor, now a cracked billionaire tycoon, is nothing but the SuperFriends vocal dash, Michael Bell, whom they know best as Zan and the Riddler as well as many other characters in many other series. <br /> <br /> I felt that this series was a combination of Superman and John Byrne's post-crisis, Superman's revival, with Lex Luthor as a billionaire tycoon, Jonathan and Martha Kent being alive to see Clark as Superman. Bruce Timm and Lois and Clark would do that too. Unfortunately, I have never seen Brainiac, Bizarro, Toyman, Metallo or Darkseid. Besides Luthor, I just saw Prankster and I saw General Zod. I was especially pleased with that Wonder Woman episode, which was expressed by BJ Ward who also starred in the Super Powers team. <br /> <br /> The episodes were crushing and I also enjoyed Clark's story of growth and development from early childhood to adolescence in an adult moving to Metropolis in the short superman Family Album. <br /> <br /> The only two things he did not like. It only lasted a season. And after Wonder Woman's welcome, we hoped Batman would return to express his opinion of Adam West (I'm still thinking about the Super Powers episodes). We also hoped, because in the Prankster episode, the Metropolis baseball team was pushed against Gotham Goliam. <br /> <br /> Every popular Super Hero has a series of cartoons that is extremely rare. For SpiderMan, I feel that the solo series of 1981 was broadcast at the same time with amazing friends. For Incredible Hulk, it's the animated cartoon of 1982. For the Fantastic Four, it's 1978 series with HERBIE Robot. For Batman, it's Batman's New Adventures of Batman's 1977 Shooting. But for Superman, the rarest series is this one. <br /> <br /> Superman's books and documentaries do not cover or mention it. This is another series that WB should consider for launching the DVD. All in all, this version of the 1988 Superman is fine .... Super !!
