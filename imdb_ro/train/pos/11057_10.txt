I was 10 years old when this show was on TV. It was by far my favorite. The actors were very credible. Alexandra Bastedo was gorgeous .... I just order the DVD (15 episodes). They did not have super powers. They had superior human abilities (strength, hearing, sight). The three actors were very good in rolls, very credible. There was a good story in each episode. At that time there were no special effects or explosions everywhere, so the script should have been good, and the performances of the characters were great. There were no fancy things like other shows. They did not try to make a joke every 2 minutes to make a light show. I highly recommend this television show to anyone who like good things.
