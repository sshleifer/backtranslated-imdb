I really enjoyed this movie! Even if it was not like any of the books, it's Nancy Drew's classic style. I've seen a lot of commercials for this movie and when I was really in Nancy Drew's books we had great expectations for this movie and they certainly met those expectations. Quite a lot, all the characters were just as I imagined from reading the books. I'm very happy to see this movie. All actors and actresses acted as they did in the series of books. Since I've seen this movie I wanted to read every Nancy Drew book there is there. All the actors and actresses really got into their characters and they certainly showed when they broadcast this movie on the big screen. Surely it seemed to me that all the actors and the actress were really in the positions where the characters were in the safest film 10 out of 10.
