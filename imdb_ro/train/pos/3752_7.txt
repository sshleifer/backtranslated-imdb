This movie is unusual and bizarre and is almost unusual and bizarre in a very good way. I gave a short 7 just because it is so unique and wall, but most of the time it looks like it would be bizarre, just for the sake of being bizarre. If the movie were able to integrate more bizarre moments into some of the appearances of a plot, then it would have been really fantastic. The main problem here is that the creators seem to have mixed up a bunch of shit on the spatula, then thrown in a bunch of nonsense that sounded as if it sounded funny coming out of the mouth of a spatula. This is definitely worth checking out, but it is not the top rate of any stretch of wild imagination creators.
