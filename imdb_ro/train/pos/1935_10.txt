Writing something authentic and true is a challenge. Knowing how to shoot him and put them together without doing the banal is even better. Ishai Setton's film is one of those where you can recognize life in all its simplicity and beauty. I have been touched by "The Great Evil Swim" and from now on I will promote it as much as I can. It's just a shame that I can not have something to say to my friends (you know, like a DVD ???) because the talk is good ... but giving something to see is better. Everyone can go to festivals to discover such pearls and this film deserves to be put there! Great Thanks to the staff of this piece of master and I expect it to be distributed.
