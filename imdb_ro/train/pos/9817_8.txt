I remember this movie. Pretty intense for a 11-year-old. Good editing, I felt terrible for St. Bernard. I would watch again if he retransmitted, but the signal sends Pluto when I write this. Robert Culp. A highlight of his career. I'm glad I did not live in this neighborhood. In the '70s. What decade. If she remaps it, I bet it would be very violent and bloody. So what's waiting? An excellent movie for pre-puberty suburban boys. It was very intense. I think he was filmed in Los Angeles. Of course it was not done in Lodi NJ. The appearance with St Bernard was the best and, of course, the most haunting picture in the movie ... and then they left the casing on the hook. Wounded children.
