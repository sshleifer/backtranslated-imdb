I have no idea how a Texan (director, Douglas McGrath) and American actress Gwyneth Paltrow have ever shot that, but seeing this again reminds you that all about Mrs. Paltrow! I have long since left the woman and feel it is boring in Oscar winning "Shakespeare In Love", but it has all the beats right here - it's almost perfect like Emma Woodhouse. Perhaps she won Oscar for Shakespeare, but she should be remembered for that. Of course, she is surrounded by a large support distribution, including Toni Collette, Greta Scacchi, Juliette Stevenson and others ... Jeremy Northam is very appealing to the interest of love, even if the script leans a bit in his love statement to Paltrow this process, allowing all tensions to emerge from their relationship); a few years later, Ewan's hair is a little easier to take than it was in '96, and I personally find Alan Cumming in the presence of a grill in something today. But the standout is undoubtedly Sophie Thompson (Emma Thompson's sister, daughter of the Phyllida law) as Miss Bates; what this version needs is a scene where Emma gets along with Miss Bates, because she's the character we're fated to. The film deserves to look (and again) for its performance itself. Overall, this has grown up wonderfully, with charm to save even more than enough subtlety to sort out the British class system. Well, it's worth a rent (because it's unlikely that Paltrow will ever be that good - but we'll always have Emma).
