Meryl Streep is excellent in her nuanced and stoic interpretation, like the infamous Lindy Chamberlain, who has been accused and tried to kill her own child Azaria Chamberlain and use her alibi of dingoes coveted as a defense. Based on the book "Evil Angels" and so called in its Australian version, A CRY IN THE DARK is an ugly movie to watch. It presents a scenario that is too real to us in America: witch hunt against a person considered an easy target. Lindy Chamberlain was this woman. Being someone who told his mind, someone who did not play the book of sympathy and someone who was tough enough to continue her life despite her terrible anguish, she was called suspicious and ugly beyond understanding even when it was clear he did not kill his own child. The media began to get stuck and a progressive invasion of confidentiality, which soon had the whole nation stuck to its sets, while eviscerating this piece of family. And through all of this, Lindy remained as stoic as ever, even when her husband Michael was breaking up. This position, of course, is the power of force, as though it were uncomfortable, and people react strongly to this. They want to see a cry of the troubled mother and cry and sometimes fall at each crossroads, not to sit there and look naked. People do not understand that not everyone is afflicted in the same way and when someone decides to stay strong, they begin to speculate. Meryl Streep embodies this penetrating woman at the handle, making her a cold, but not innocent, woman who faced her beliefs even though they cost her freedom. Because of her, Sam Neill is allowed to lose his character slowly in despair - someone needs it, or the Chamberlains are too detached and nobody wants to see that. Except for the monsters who, at the time of this writing, became news. They will always eat trains and feed the manure to the uninformed audience.
