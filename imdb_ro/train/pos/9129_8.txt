When this movie came out for the first time in 1984, Prince was one of the hottest acts around. Everyone wanted to see this movie, which was not much more than an extended musical video. The act was pretty bad, but what can you expect from musicians who act for the first time on the big screen? Despite this, it was still a very fun movie! Morris Day and Jerome Benton offer a classic comedy, especially their interpretation of "The Password," which will make you think about Abbott & Costello doing their "who's on" baseball routine. Appolina who went with a single name then) offered some beautiful breasts, so you had covered the short nudity. In addition, it is very attractive. And, of course, the soundtrack of the album is one of the best princes ever recorded. Prince later had an impact with Warner Bros. and changed his name, but at that moment in his career, he was at the top of his game. This movie does not fit in all the high-end categories, but it's quite fun.
