Plato's Plateau is a fun b movie with Gary Busey.it is a pretty unfamiliar movie, so I saw her on a car boot, I thought this was fun to say I was right. Gary Busey plays Plato as a tough mercenary who is framed by a powerful Cuban killer, now Plato has to survive long enough to prove his innocence with his friends, played by Steve Bauer (scarface) and action star Jeff Speaksman (expert). what I liked about Plato's flight was how the movie was never boring the plot could have been done before, but it was still good acting was fun to look and the action was quite fun as well and climax Gary Busey makes a good irony because he normally plays the bad guy and Steve Bauer is good as Plato's opponent, even if Jeff Speaksman does a good performance and can not even finish it from his run Plato is a nice effort from the picture films and not give me 7 out of 10
