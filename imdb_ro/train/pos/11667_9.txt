Kell's Secret is a movie I've been waiting for for years, after seeing some early clips at the Kilkenny Cartoon Salon. I'm here to tell you that it was worth waiting. The cartoons are very stylized, but not annoying, as I was afraid of. The entire film is a thing of beauty and great imagination, I especially love the animated book, in which the little figures come to life on the page. The characterization is superb, I like Brendan Gleeson's voice as abbot abbot, and I especially liked the voice of the Aisling spirits. The forest is a triumph, a place so beautiful. The story is well done, a combination of deeds and fantasy. and attracts the viewer to cheer Brendan in search of the perfect materials for the Book. I am a calligrapher and enlightener anyway, so the subject is close to my heart, but all the people who know who saw this and are not the fans of the boats agree that it's a great movie. I will definitely buy the DVD when it is released, and would like to say, the well-done Cartoon Salon and all the people involved in this mammoth project. There may be more. :) Return here to say that I bought more copies of the DVD as soon as I could and I gave it to Christmas, everyone loves it! And I wish all of luck in the world to the Oscar, such a joy to see this nominee.
