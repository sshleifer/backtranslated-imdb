It was a wonderful and funny movie that I will never get tired of watching many, many times. Casting was magnificent in matching young people with older characters. There are those who are here who truly appreciate good actors and intelligent stories. As for Judi Dench, she is beautiful and a gift for any kind of production she plays. I always seem to see Judi Dench in all her shows. She is a superb actress and a pleasure to look at every transformation of her character. I can only be thankful when I see such a remarkable picture for most recent films, missing good characters, good scriptures and good actors. The public film needs heroes, not deviant mannequins, who lack ingenuity and talent. How wonderful it is to see old favorites like Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Cleo Laine. I would like to see this movie winning the prizes it deserves. Thanks again for an extraordinary night of entertainment. I congratulate the writer, the director, the producer and all those who did such a good job.
