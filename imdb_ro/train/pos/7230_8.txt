The "invisible mouse" is a delightful cartoon and different from Tom & Jerry. It has the usual tracking characteristics and cat / mouse battles, but differently this time. Jerry falls accidentally into an invisible ink bottle and is obviously very happy about this because he realizes he can prepare a lot of "surprises" for Tom, scares him, tortures him and confuses him. because it's weird, it's also very cool and fun to see what we can not see: Jerry invisible. It's fun to see things get up in the air without seeing who does it (we know who, yes?) - it's like these things had a life of their own, or almost a thing of ghosts. It's just as fun to see Jerry eating candy and fruit while it's invisible. I really like that instrumental music that plays when it's not visible. Some of the best jokes on this short are when Tom sees Jerry's shadow and hits him and even when Tom tries to beat him with a pan, and Jerry writes, "I'm lost." I also like Jerry drinking Tom's chocolate milk, becoming visible again and with a happy look on his face. Generally, this brief contains the basic ingredients needed for a classic cartoon: humor, entertainment, fun and some fine artwork too.
