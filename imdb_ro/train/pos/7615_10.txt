This show is undoubtedly one of the greatest shows ever on TV. I mean, the actor is great, suspense, drama, comedy, it has everything and that simple story: a plane collapsed on an island. The characters are wonderful and Evilina Lilly is HOT !!!!!! Matthew Fox shows us once again a great actor, Josh Holloway is so great, Jorge Garcia is funny, I could go on. Also, the unexpected upset of the plot, the characters behind the characters, the music that is at the end of each episode. J.J. Abrahms once again proved to be an excellent writer and producer. I mean, it's better than ALIAS and I liked ALIAS. Anyone who does not look at this show, should definitely consider DVDs and watch it, because they miss something great. This show could be the best show in television history!
