There are many films related to World War II, but the nightmare is quite distinctive among them: in this film, we introduced Howard Campbell (Nolte), an American living in Berlin and married to a German, Helga Noth (Lee) to accept the role of a spy: More specifically, CIA agent Major Wirtanen (Goodman) recruits Campbell, who becomes a Nazi propagandist, to enter the highest echelons of the Hitler regime. However, the deal is that the US government will never recognize Campbell's role in war for national security reasons, and thus Campbell becomes a nasty figure in the US. After the war, he tries to conceal his identity, but the past returns and haunts him. His only "friend" is Wirtanen, but even he can not do too much for the avalanche of poor campbell events ... The story is deeply moving, watching Campbell's tragedy, which, although a great patriot, is treated with contempt everyone around him. Not only that, but he also gradually realizes that even the people closest to him have many of their secrets. Vonnegut gives us a moving atmosphere, with Campbell's despair building and almost choking the viewer. Nolte plays the role of his life, in my opinion; he is even better than in "Affliction", although in both roles he plays tragic figures that are destined for self-destruction. Sheryl Lee is also excellent, and the same can be said for the entire distribution in general. I did not read the book, so I can not appreciate how the movie compares to her. In any case, this is of no importance here: my critique is on the film itself, and the film deserves to be worth 9/10.
