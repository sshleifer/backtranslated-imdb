Some movies can be seen almost 60 years later, but they remain as appealing as this one. Technological advances have not given this classic love story. The special effects used are remarkable for a 1946 movie. The actor is superb. David Niven, Kim Hunter and especially Roger Livesey do a great job. Using black and white / color adds to the creative nature of the movie. He has not been seen on television for 20 years, so few people are aware of his existence. It's my favorite movie of all time. Waiting and hope for releasing this DVD for so many years is in itself "a matter of life and death."
