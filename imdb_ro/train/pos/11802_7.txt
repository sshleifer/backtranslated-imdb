This is not the best Bigfoot ever made, but through the recent standards of the movie Nature have appeared wrong movies, especially on the Sci-Fi channel, quality stuff. It has some actions, some humor, decent F / X and Bigfoot. CG is used, but so are some F / X practice that I like. Generally, this movie deserves a watch if you are a fan of B / SF horror and you need a repair. It's better than Sasquatch and not a sequel, so do not be fooled. The actor is better than you expect to find in a movie like this and the leadership is more than adequate. Expect a bit of lol that the characters are "developed", but I know things will get up. If you are watching a DVD, you can skip a chapter or two.
