Each scene was put together perfectly. This movie had a wonderful cast and crew. I mean, how can you have a bad movie with Robert Downey Jr. in it, it does not exist and will never exist. He has the ability to light any film with his amazing talent. This movie was perfect! I saw the film alone on a film shelf in "Blockbuster" and that he called, did not resist taking him and bringing him home with me. You can tell me a romantic sappy, but this movie touched my heart, not to mention, it made me laugh with pleasure at the same time. Even though I was crying, I admit that at the end, the whole movie later enlightened my vision of life afterwards. I suggested the horror, the action, and the movie of pure humor of a brother who absolutely adored this film. This is a sensual movie. It could make you laugh loudly, touch your heart, fall in love and enjoy your life. Every time you plan to go along with this movie, you have to be aware that you are aware of choosing to live and feel this inspired film. Who knows? What if it could really happen to you? And keep your mind open to the mystical miracles of life.
