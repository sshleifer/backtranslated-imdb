Jane's old story is very popular nowadays. We've lost the number of versions that happen around. Probably the reason is that their "routs" are our "routs" even at this later date. This mini-TV series gives her a personalized story suitable for the novel. Emma is a pretty "modern" little girl when you think about it, even if the ambience of Jane Austen's world may seem a bit artificial to us today. If you did not think of EMMA, I'll just tell you that Emma's self-standing does not get her. It's worth watching to find out how. The actors act on the ladies: Kate, Prunella, Lucy and Samantha. She could almost have a mental relationship with the old Jane!
