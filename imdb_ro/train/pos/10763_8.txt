I have to admit I was very skeptical about this documentary. I expected it to be all sort of American Propaganda that we in Europe do not like so much. I was wrong. This is not propaganda, in fact it is not at all political. He describes the events of September 11 through the eyes of the firemen called to the scene immediately after the planes collapsed. It is an amazing coincidence that this documentary was shot at all! This movie was originally shot as a documentary about a new-born NY firefighter becoming "a man." We can only thank filmmakers for continuing their work during the terrible attempt they faced. A great work. Absolutely amazing material. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> Hello,
