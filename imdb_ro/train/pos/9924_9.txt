Ah, Domino is actually a breath of fresh air, something new in the world of cinema. I liked the film very much because of the complicated plot, the varied characters and the intense effects of the camera. I have seen some complain about the work on the camera and, in fact, in the opinion of the creators themselves, the shining and wild fires were the culmination of mistakes made over time. All you see was the desired effect. Maybe some people complain, because something like this has never been done, although that distinguishes it. In a deeper look, what you see is how Domino sees things through her eyes, think about it. When it comes to the story, I do not see anything wrong with that. Despite the "dirty" nature, in the opinion of some, it is, in fact, only a quick form of stories. In reality, the plot is not so hard to follow if you focus on what is happening. Maybe I'm just because I see movies in many different ways, such as the actor, the plot, etc. I'm not an "interpreter" or something that shoots outside, it just comes to me. With that said, I think this is indeed an excellent movie, despite its future as a classic, blockbuster or anything else. And the characters, well there is no doubt about how varied the distribution is. I think the distribution is excellent, because everyone is doing their job well, portraying their characters effectively, making a movie of ladies and gentlemen. Characters are very unique, and a plus is that you will become witnesses of a small piece of their life, still distinguishing them far. Practically, I personally loved characters and characters. All those who crack and burn this movie may just not see it as they do, or simply not call them. No matter, this is a great movie in itself, no, it's a great movie time.
