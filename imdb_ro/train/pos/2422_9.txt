Yes, it's a low budget. Yeah, it's one of Candy's first movies, but maybe it's the funniest one! John Candy was not so far away from SCTV's days in "Going Berserk" and looks. If you do not break when Candy tries to help a guy with his food while his arm is bent in a cohort escaped in the process of having sex with his girlfriend, with just the door of the apartment separating them (no, see the movie!) or how Euguene Levy (the creator of Kong Fu Yu) speaks to his mother on the phone or just the countless number of facial expressions that only Candy can give you better to check your pulse! If you like John Candy from "Only the Lonely," this may not be a movie I'd advise you to see, but if you like John Candy's SCTV days, this movie must be seen!
