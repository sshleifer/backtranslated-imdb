Wonderful film that once again deals with the trials and troubles of the Second World War in England. What makes this movie so good is the touch of the human element. This movie is definitely in the tradition of British classics such as "Mrs. Miniver" and "Hope and Glory". As with this film, we see people's despair during the war. The performances are remarkable here especially by John Thaw, who received a child who was evacuated from the London bombing. We'll soon see why this baby moistens his bed. He comes from a crazy mother who abused her terribly. The old man takes his child and brings happiness into his sad life. When the child is returned to his mother, the old man goes to London and seeks him only to find tragedy. He literally kidnaps the boy and is able to convince above that the child is better with him than being in the boy's home. The picture is so good because it deals with and is based on daring relationships.
