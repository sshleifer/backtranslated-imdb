I watched this movie by chance after I bought it as part B on the Omega Man DVD. The Omega man was a bit disappointing - except for the beginning, which was clearly inspiring for 28 days later, the rest being just the movies. But Soylent Green is in another league. I bet this is one of Tarantino's favorites. There are at least 3 scenes in a movie I've never seen before. Heston is usually drunk in bed with "furniture" while discussing something completely unresolved! A whole lot of people who are gathered by a fleet of mechanical diggers! A priest who confesses and is shot by the confessor. Okay, maybe it has been done since then - but there are not many movies that are as original as this one. And what the hell is going on between Heston and Edward G. Robinson? Is the least likely gay couple ever or what? Fortunately, I have seen this film without knowing the end - which seems to be rare. Then I looked again and enjoyed all the little clues that make early long scenes worth it. A very beautiful script - and some great sets. Just when you thought you saw everything. . .
