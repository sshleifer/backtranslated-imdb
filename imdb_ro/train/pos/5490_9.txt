This is really an incredible movie. Not only does it document the eternal struggle of indigenous and impoverished people to win their legal voice, but also shows the United States of America for the dishonor, subterfuge and flagrant ignorance of human rights and self-determination. Chavez is portrayed as a very brave and charismatic leader who fights against what can only be characterized as a shrewd elite without any sense of proportion or justice. These directors recorded a coup, unlike what had happened before. In the cross hair, we see the US, pulling the strings again and snatching all the feeling of reality. It is useless to follow the initial stages of the uprising, knowing very well that the undermining of the democracy we are witnessing is a tool used by successive US governments and their seemingly blocked citizens. The recordings clearly show that it is not the manipulation of TV or generic images but an active documentation of a people and its government fighting for its future. Truly a moving experience for anyone with conscience. These Irish film producers deserve our gratitude. We cross Chavez. We must endorse the idea that each country must be allowed to choose its own government and develop itself in ways that most find fit. The first step in this process is the need to know the realities of the situation and this documentary does a great job of doing just that.
