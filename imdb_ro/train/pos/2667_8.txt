I've never been a big fan of horror movies. They usually try cheap tricks to frighten audiences like loud noises and creepy kids. Usually they are not original and do not contain much. The only horror movie I liked was Stir of Echoes with Kevin Bacon. He was well acting and had a great story. But he was joined and perhaps overtaken by Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, the most likely scariest movie ever. The film follows a writer (Jack Nicholson) and his family who agree to look at a hotel while it is closed for the winter. There were rumors that the place was haunted and the last resident became mad and killed his family. But Jack is convinced he'll be fine and he can use the silence to overcome his writer's block. After several months of loneliness and silence, Jack becomes a gossip and later violent. Is there a cabin fever or something in the hotel that makes him crazy? One of the most amazing parts about the film is the sense of isolation Kubrick makes. The hotel is very quiet and the rooms are huge but always empty. It is also quietly quiet when Jack's son goes on a bicycle through the empty hallways. Jack Nicholson's performance is also one of the best, squealing the hell out of me and making me sure I came out once again. My favorite scene is when he speaks with a ghost inside a refrigerator. <br /> <br /> Shining is the pinnacle of horror films, in my opinion, beating the core of the crap as the Ring and Blair Wizarding Project. It can be an old one, but it's definitely good. 8/10
