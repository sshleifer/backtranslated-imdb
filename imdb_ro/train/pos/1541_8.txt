He just saw this movie today at the Seattle International Film Festival and enjoyed it. Very writing and direction, excellent and credible interaction between the cast, and an extraordinary comedy program. <br /> <This film refers to themes that are universal families and separation. As a result, I can see European, Asian and American audiences, finding similarities between this movie and their own lives. If all that was not enough, this has the potential to be the best underground movie of the year ... someone distributes this in the US, please! <br /> <br /> Finally: thank you Maria Flom! It's really a great movie.
