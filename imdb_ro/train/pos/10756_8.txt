Very interesting and moving documentary about the tragedy of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. Its main theme is the heroism of American firefighters who have tried to save as many people as possible. The film is deeply emotional and quite disturbing - many people seen on the screen have lost their lives! Recommended.
