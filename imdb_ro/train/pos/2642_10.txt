Truly, this is a "heater of the heart" movie. He won the George Peither Prize, winning over "Roots," to tell you something about the essence of this film. I searched the Internet for how to order this movie since my former father-in-law, Eugene Logan, the co-writer of this film, died for a few years, so I do not have the chance to receive any information from him. I would love to have my only daughters, my daughters, to see this movie as well as to convey this wonderful story to his ancestors. My eldest daughter was seven years old when it was on TV and I have been waiting to see it again. One of my friends said it was the favorite movie. I will not "spoil" this movie for you.
