What Fun Fun Movie! I certainly do not do that anymore. 4 au pair have arrived in London and have all sorts of sexual wrongs. The tone is strangely innocent, because considerable nudity evolves from pharic situations, rather than any sexual desire manifested by the characters. Only when the actress accidentally loses his clothes, the male characters become agitated. Richard O 'Sullivan literally receives "Randi" (sic). The film certainly betrays the origin of the softcore feature as being in nudity movies and the old school's movies. My particular interest in 'Au Pair Girls' is that I'm a big fan of Gabrielle Drake. If an actress has ever shown herself better naked (she is thin but wonderful curved) or clothed, come to this (I love it from the beginning of the UFO - who else could wear a purple wig!), I will eat my hat.
