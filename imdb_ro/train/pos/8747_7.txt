* Spoilers Possible * Although he did before (and better) in 'Midnight Express' and 'Return To Paradise', Brokedown Palace still has a rope with me. Here we have the story of two young girls traveling through Thailand and you are being arrested for drug trafficking accusations. Was Alice, Clare Danes? Was Kate Beckinsale's Darlene? Was he the beautiful stranger they met on their journey? Nothing really matters, because this is a story of friendship and trust and the limits that can be stretched. Cast him into Bill Pullman as unenthusiastic lawyer and Jacqueline Kim as a Thai bride (and a better lawyer than him) and we have a wonderful story that keeps the audience's attention. Brokedown Palace is nothing extraordinary, or notorious for any reason - it's not an original concept, it does not show the sensational violence leading to the avant-garde agglomeration talking about "rocky realism" or "hard-to-hit truths" - it's just a good story with some fine performances. Bill Pullman is the weakest with his remarkable lazy and rocky road - I was pretty bored of character. Kate Beckinsale, while decent, is nothing spectacular. It works well, but it's not exactly a memorable performance. Jacqueline Kim, however, is in fine shape, making a nice and definite character, where, indeed, there is not much work to do. > But do not make a mistake - this is Clare Danes' film. I was a fan of her work, and that's not a change. She captivates every scene she appears in, and if it was not for her, the movie would probably be inclined into the boring fare. I especially appreciate her performance in the scene between her and Darlene's father. The film also has a brilliant soundtrack. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
