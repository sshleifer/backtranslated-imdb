This is a beautiful, rich and well-executed movie with a rich and significant story. Basically, it is said how an old master narrator has to find an heir (man) to continue his job, but fails to get what he expected in the men-dominated world. Characters have to deal with their situation, and the old master must struggle with the conflict between his desire for companionship and the heir and the traditional notions of his society. The story is fun, emotional and complex. Exploring their characters, lives and emotions is rich and convincing that character development is strong, while characters are complex and not dimensional at all. The film experiences the emotions of the old man and his desire to find a heir and shows exactly how he and the child are dealing with the situation. There is also humor, sometimes quite subtle, at the appropriate points. The film also analyzes traditional Chinese, good and bad culture, creating a greater interest and depth for the film. Direction, acting and landscape are remarkable. Added to other strengths, this creates rich and convincing visual images and convincing and real characters. As a result, the film evokes strong empathy and character-related feelings. Some have argued that the end weakens the film, but I do not necessarily agree. Perhaps it could have been stronger with a different end, but any improvement in the overall movie would have been quite small.
