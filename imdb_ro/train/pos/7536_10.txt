The comment of the person who said that Pat Robertson is bad and his program is bad has nothing to compare what evil and right is. The definition of de rÄƒu is the opposite of evil. The Bible itself says that in the last days people will call good evil and good evil! He does not even know he has fulfilled the biblical prophecy! If you do not know God and you will not know him now, it's good. He still loves you, but when you kneel down on your knees and you do it, it will be too late for you. God does not send anyone into hell, not even you! You will go there with your own decision, and your shedding defines it! May God have mercy on you and give you an experience on the road to Damascus. The 700 Club Ministry and Pat Robertson are one of the reasons I'm still here. At the edge of alcoholism, adultery, and perhaps death, God got to the TV screen and used Pat Robertson to do it and thank God for doing it! You have the right to say what you have said, but you can not curse your words. God has mercy on you.
