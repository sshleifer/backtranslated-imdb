Sarah Silverman's thought of having his own show worried me at first. The movies that appeared were not very funny and her humor is a bit off. However, I was very surprised to see her true colors shine in this Central Comedy jewel. I could match her with Amy Sedaris in Candy Strangers - Sarah's character is a true sociopath, very similar to Jerri Blank in Sedaris. The only fall of this show is the support expressed. The character of his sister is good; Funny sometimes, but eventually he did not want to steal Sarah's show. However, the rest of the distribution is extremely sub-par with the comparison. I'm glad, though, that Comedy Central gave Sarah a chance to show him the unique and crazy feeling of self and humor.
