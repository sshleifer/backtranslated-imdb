The brilliant use of the overworked colorful technician illustrates the optimistic extremes of today's Christmas ceremonies. The voyeuristic element during the stage (Santa & Pedro sums up society's behavior on a telescope) is unique (and obviously Jean-Luc Godard, though he was subtle, stole this theme in his film Pierrot le-fou). Highly recommended!
