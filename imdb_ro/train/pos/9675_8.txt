Most would say that if someone were to spend a Saturday night watching a movie, you have to be really bored. In fact, I just got home from the exit and started the TV and it was, "Paulie." <br /> <br /> We lost the opening credits, so I did not know the name, but I saw that Cheech Marin had in it, so I naturally thought I had tuning in "Born in East LA" When I saw him talking to a parrot talking, I was about to give up this as a kind of flop movie that he shows late at night. Happy to say, it was better than that. As you know, if you do not lose Paulie again and try to get back to his original owner. Looks like it takes years to find her. What Paulie's advantage should be is actually a disadvantage in ways. People meet a parrot gifted and everything they see is a way to make money or benefit themselves. <br /> <br /> While Cheech Marin's character "makes" money from him, he is not bad for him. The parrot dance sequences are something the kids will find cute, I found them funny. Paulie, naive, "quickly learns that not all people are good people, especially the owner of an animal research laboratory." The man told him he would help find the owner as long as he helped in the animal communications research. is now blocked, but decides to make a mad man, a demonstration for others of Paulie's vocal ability. Throughout the movie, Paulie tells his story to the facility repository who gets to release him, several other animals and Finding the location of the Paulie's owner is an exciting reunion. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10, the wing cut scene should have been assumed and not shown This may disturb the younger children, otherwise, is a wonderful movie for older children and adults who are a child to heart.
