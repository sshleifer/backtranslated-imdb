I really really enjoyed this movie. (And that's why I was surprised that she received such a low note from so many users on this site!) I'm not saying it's a cinematic masterpiece, but it was a great way to spend a Saturday night cold and snowy. It's funny, full of beatings and a wonderful story of friendship friends who live in hard times and bad things that female friends tend to do to each other! (Bill, we have it all!) Bill Paterson shines that Reverand Gerald Marsden and Andie McDowell prove she can be a good actress when the role is right and puts her mind to her. (And really, it's the best "wedding escape" we've ever seen or dreamed of in this movie ... more joy than anyone I've ever known!) You'll laugh and cry --- ignore any campaign marketing and how this movie is marketed ... is a hidden gem that should have made TONNES by the box office. (now I have to look around to buy a copy!)
