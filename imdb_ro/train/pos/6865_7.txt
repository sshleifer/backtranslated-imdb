With the current harsh tendency of humor, this film is everyone's grandfather. While some of the humor is dated, each skit will shock, reject, or make you laugh aloud. The most memorable one is commenting on sexual games and, of course, VD advertising. It does not always work, but it pays when it does. I gave it a 7.
