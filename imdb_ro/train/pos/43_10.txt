I really enjoyed this movie. It really intrigued me how Deanna and Alicia became friends along such a tragedy. Alicia was just a troubled soul, and Deanna was so happy to see someone after being shot. My only complaint was that at first it was a bit slow and it took a while to get to the bottom of things. Besides, it was great.
