I liked the story. Somewhere, a poster said there were no families like this one. Maybe it should be. I thought everyone seemed really human and credible. What top casting. What a great music on the soundtrack. How beautiful this, and how beautiful, but above all, I will say two words to recommend this movie. Steve Carell. He really showed a beautiful, subtle depth that touched me. He was really the commander of a widow who perhaps devoted a little too much to become a good father, first with the price of denying his own needs. Was it a petulant donkey? Why, yes, he did. And you see, that was perfect for this movie. The actor who played this character made me feel that she felt something and not simply that she felt something and gave me perfectly what she felt and what she felt was denied. <br /> <br /> He gave up happiness. <br /> <br /> He denied the fulfillment. <br /> <br /> He denied love. The loss of your love is painful beyond belief, and many who do this will never feel that again. <br /> <br /> Beautiful movie. I gave it eight out of ten.
