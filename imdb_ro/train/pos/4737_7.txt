Hak hap (Black Mask) is what I would like to call a ballet with fists and explosions. Of course, the plot was tried and heard before (A prepared biological soldier, part of an elite fighting force of supermen, who decides that he feels that killing and brutal force are not the ways to solve every thing and become pacifist. but when he learns that the rest of his group is trying to get an antidote to keep them alive by taking the police - his best friend is a child - he becomes a black mask.) The style of the movie, very visual, works and little for me is fun. I like martial arts movies that are speculative. People who fly around air more easily than air and recover a second second after impact keep pace and action non-stop. But this is all that is this movie, a showcase of Jet Li that does what he does best, and this is spectacularly spectacular of his skills, which at least are top. Like most fast-acting martial arts movies. Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung, who are present in the United States for the first time, are filming and tall on stunning physical facts. But I have to say, even with the big holes left in the plot (as if we were safe in his apartment when he had only one scene before having 20 people not more than 15 meters away he with the sign of escape? the scene just cut to him in the apartment ....... ohh well suspense of faith I think), the film for me remains interesting. Just for the last 20 minutes, the movie seems to feel as if it could have been a bit shorter. But still around a high-speed action movie.
