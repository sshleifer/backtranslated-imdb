Even though The Shining is over a quarter of a century, I challenge anyone not to be afraid of Jack Nicholson's descent into madness. This is a rare example of something so unique that no one has been able to break it; instead he was referred to pop culture from time to time. Gemini, the Blood Lift, RedRum, the mad crap "writes" ... must be seen, if not for nothing else, to understand all the hints in everyday life. The film is both scary, suspenseful, beautiful and psychologically intriguing. It has the classic mystery of Hitchcock and the terror of a modern thriller. And he usually has what horror movies are missing: a great script.
