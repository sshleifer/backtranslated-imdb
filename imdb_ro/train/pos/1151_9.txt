"Soapdish" is one of the best, but least well-known, comedies of the 1990s. The film revolves around the various dramas outside the room, which appear behind the scenes of a day-made soap opera. The first of the impressive strengths of the film is the fantastic A-List. "Soapdish" features some of the greatest actors and actresses of his era. The film is gorgeously driven by Sally Field as Celeste Talbert's aging neurotic actress (She throws a tantrum when she is put in a suit that makes her look like "Gloria F * CKING Swanson!"). Her support support reads someone who is the 90th laureate movie! Whoopi Goldberg, Robert Downey Jr, Teri Hatcher, Kevin Kline and Kathy Najimy raise everything to a great extent. Goldberg is predictably excellent, while Downey Jr. and Hatcher's performance suggest the comedic excellence they will achieve later. As for writing, the film is remarkable. There is a truly modern edge for the script, which strives in wonderful bizarre on several occasions. There are also several visual gags that are well ahead of their time. In some respects, the film reminds Mel Brooks of the best film and reminded this reviewer of "High Anxiety" (1977) frequently. Much of the humor of the film is based on daytime television and non-pro-active actors. For example, the extraordinary casting session with the exploiting executive played by Carrie Fisher is both hilarious and honest. "Soapdish" is, for my money, one of the best comedies made by Hollywood in the 1990s. It's an excellent script and a Class A cast makes it a must. It's hard not to love this movie after you've been laughing for 90 minutes.
