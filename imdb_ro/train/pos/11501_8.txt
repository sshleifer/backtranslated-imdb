I remember this show a little, but I remembered it was great! My eldest brother, recently reminded me of the show and saw an advertisement for the D.V.D set that comes out. The network has again managed to pull this out of the air so it can put everything in its place? It should have been at least 3 seasons. Why not, right? I think sometimes the directors of the network think they are the "gods" of the entertainment world. But they misunderstand and do not realize it from time to time. Let's say they have more flops than "hits". This was one of the worst cutting decisions in the composition. Anyway, I get this for my collection.
