Well, it was a pleasant surprise. his trailer did not predict a good movie at all, it was even a little misleading. Especially the part of Jeff Bridges was a positive, well written, sardonic and funny surprise. However, I do not believe that a guy who has arrived where he received would show signs of such a disregard for what his current company is. One does not become a top suit just to bend again suddenly again. The end of the movie, during the Dolce Vita show, was too strange, clich√© and disappointing. And, of course, a guy like Pegg's character will not last the past of his first week in a New York magazine like this. I hope one day to see a decent role for Megan Fox, here she watched a poor actress playing a bimbo. By the way, I do not see why the "sex symbol" of the year, I see hotter girls on almost every cover of each magazine.
