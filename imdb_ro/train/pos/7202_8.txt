Long before "Brokeback Mountain" (about 23 years before), "Deathtrap" was the first time I saw two people who passionately kiss on the screen and, frankly, I was shocked. I understood it in terms of the plot and did not disturb my sensitivity (not too much), but it was the first time I saw it at least in a mainstream movie. I thought it was a bad move for his time, and he took the courage to try it, especially Christopher Reeve, in the midst of his time as PG-rated Superman. The bisexuality of the elderly on the screen may have hit Brokeback, but it is interesting to notice this older incarnation.
