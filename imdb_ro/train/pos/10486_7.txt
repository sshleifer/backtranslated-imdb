"Saving Grace" is never funny, but it offers pretty good laughs and I liked it to a significant extent. Brenda Blethyn is a beautiful actress and is doing a good job in portraying Grace the widow who uses marijuana to pay off her massive debts. Also, support distribution has a good job. The French actor Tchecky Karyo has a fun little role. Only the premise is appealing. The idea of ​​a woman who grows and smokes a woman over the top seems pretty funny. And the movie plays wisely premise from time to time. Of course, there are full moments, such as one in which two elderly women cheat Grace's tea leaves for marijuana and start shooting childhood antiques at the shop where they work. It was a mindless gang that had not separated. The tone of the movie is diminishing and sometimes boring, but I laugh enough to give this English a recommendation. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
