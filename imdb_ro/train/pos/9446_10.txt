James Dickey is a wonderful descriptive author. When "Deliverance" is read, one is immediately transported into the lush forests of the South Deep. When someone watches the cinematic version of John Boorman's book, it is understood how accurate he surprises the essence of the book. The room is as descriptive as the narrative. The characters are fully realized and the portraits are fantastic. I first saw this film in 1992, after the first year of college. I was in a phase where I was watching movies that were released within a few years of my birth in 1973. Among them were Patton, Papillon and All Presidents. fine movies, all this. It was easily the class of the group. That says a lot.
