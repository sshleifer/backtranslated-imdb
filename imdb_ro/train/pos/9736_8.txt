Pegg had a couple of blows in recent years, starting with "Shaun Of The Dead" in 2004, "Hot Fuzz 2007" was released in early 2008 with "Run Fat Boy Run" and now comes "How To Lose friends and aliens, "which is in many ways one of my favorite comedies of the year. The film is about Sidney Yound, a man who writes a magazine that fails and who has the most of the celebrity because he is not one of them. However, one of the most successful magazine owners (played by Jeff Bridges) invites him (from nostalgia) to work on his magazine. Sidney is, of course, delighted and moves to America, there meets a girl who writes a book today and loves it. This movie is great and I hope it will come out more like in the near future. Pegg once gave people another good film everywhere and I can not wait to see the third part of the "Paul" blood and ice cream trilogy. Rate this movie 81%.
