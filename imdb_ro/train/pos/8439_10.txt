For all the murderers from Homicide there, this movie was great! Every character who has ever been on the show has appeared in the movie. He helped solve some (but not all) issues in the series. Unfortunately, if you did not actually watch the series, most of the pleasure would have been lost, because the film made heavy references to every season of the show. Perhaps this would have been appropriate as a final series, as opposed to being a separate film, but we have to take what we can get. I hope they make more movies and there are still homicidal characters on law and order.
