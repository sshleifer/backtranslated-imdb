Radiofreccia is a movie about us all, about our dreams, our friends, our obsessions, our dependencies, our fears. It is a brilliant film in which a group of friends, like all those living, lives through the hardships of growing up in a small town in one of the most important decades of the last century. The film does not have a happy or sad approach to things, but just tells us a story that we could all experience. One of happiness and excitement, sadness and pain. The power of this story is that we love our characters, it's one of those movies that you'll always watch again, feeling closer to the little town of Emilia Romagna where it's taking place. Hoping one day to finally walk through the streets near Freccia and his friends, listening to the music that changed the world through the noise of an old radio that played Radio Raptus International, playing dreams, dreams. Radiofreccia will make you laugh, make you cry sometimes, shock you and comfort you, give you and take you from you. Personally, I think it has played an important role in my life and my friends, and I suggest you pursue it all and make it part of you.
