I have to be honest and say that I have not seen many independent films, but I thought this was very well done. Direction and cinema engage without becoming a distraction. The angles, settings and illumination used created the nightmare world in which the main character was captured. Many haunting and memorable images from the movie in mind after it's over (always a sign of a good director).
