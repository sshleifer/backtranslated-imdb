Eddie Murphy spends time looking for lost children, so when a very special magic kid is kidnapped in Tibet, sexy Charlotte Lewis asks his help to save this kid from the clutches of evil himself. the story is a little foolish, never feels scary despite the hilariousness of comedy alongside the movie; Charles Dance disables the comedy with its very serious and dark characterization of the evil that keeps the child hostage. The Golden Child is very funny, action-packed and really quite convincing in a charming, almost magic way. <br /> <br /> 7/10 Great for all generations.
