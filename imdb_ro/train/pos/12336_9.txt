An excellent vintage crime melody, with Fontaine actually playing against the type of previous birth flower, in a role that Olivia DeHavilland refused. It's good, because Fontaine is great. Written by Charles Bennett, who wrote for Hitchcock in the thirties and later, he wrote the excellent script for the British horror film "The Night of the Demon". The opening scene, in which Ivy visits a sinister monster played by the wonderful Una O'Connor (James Whale's famous screamer), is a tour of force, and the film keeps her interest in many sinister machinations. I hope to see this movie on DVD one day, but despair has ever occurred, because it seems to be an unnoticed obscure movie. Luckily, I saw AMC seven or eight years ago, but I have not seen it since. Grab her if you can!
