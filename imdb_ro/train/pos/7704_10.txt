Certain elements of this film are dated, of course. A white male crew, for example. And, like most of Pre-Star Wars Science Fiction films, it tends to admire too much. But no film has ever captured the Golden Age Science Fiction as it did, even down to the use of "electronic tones" to deliver musical scores. Robbie Robot represented the Asimov robots and was the inspiration for everything that followed, from C3PO to Data. The plot line is, of course, Shakespeare's "The Tempest." Morbius is Prospero and an exiled wizard who finds his kingdom invaded by interloper ... It was a film that treated Science Fiction as an adult genre probably the first.
