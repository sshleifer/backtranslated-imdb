One whole, this movie is not perfect. It does not "hang good" together because the story line is actually a bunch of hooks to close jokes. Some of these jokes are little "80 years old" and tend to date the picture. But some of these jokes are classic. You know that a movie has something special when you and your friends still quote heavy quotes from him two decades later. <br /> <br /> <br /> In addition, there are a bunch of familiar faces; Michael Keaton, Danny Devito, Joe Piscapo, Peter Boyle, Marilu Henner, Maureen Stapleton, Bob Eubanks, Griffin Dunne and one of the last roles of Alan Hale Jr., Captain of Gilligan Island. <br /> <br /> There are also absurd moments, such as when Johnny labels puppies with a price cutter or if the Pope makes an appearance in Johnny's neighborhood. Also, the scene in which the false priest makes many words in Latin is excellent. ("Summa how praise, magna cum laude, radio too louda ... Post meridian, ante meridian, meridian uncle"). Other classic scenes include Ramone Maroney English English slaughter Danny Devito urging Griffin Dunne to play the ball Peter Boyle believing he has lost his manhood Fake film VD This movie is not home. But, like Porky's, it has enough classic comedy bits to make it memorable.
