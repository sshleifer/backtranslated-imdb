This is the only feature film about the bridge world. I found the first 10 minutes a bit slow but after that, the movie is absolutely perfect in describing the professional bridge players and how they win a place of life. <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes are very funny. I do not think a non-bridge player would get the charm of this movie. <br /> <br /> Some of the dresses are really beautiful, pity the film is black and white - I can only imagine what it looks like in color. The way the media is presented is absolutely hilarious. There is no way on the deck of the earth to ever be like this. <br /> <br /> Watch it as soon as possible and tell your friends about it.
