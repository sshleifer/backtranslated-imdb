This is a very interesting project that could have been pretty brilliant. The assembly of 11 prominent international executives and the allocation of 11 minutes, 9 seconds and 1 frame to create a selection segment; each short exploring the September 11th global reverberations. Without using spoilers, I would say that Ken Loach's piece is crown jewels, and Mira Nair's short ("India") segment, based on a true story, deserves to become a complete movie. One also realizes while pursuing briefly, why Alejandro González Iñárritu is one of the best directors in today's world? he is simply a master of the environment, who also has a profound understanding of the subject. Unfortunately, not all 11 tracks are also made. Youssef Chahine, in his "Egypt" segment, assumes the Arab position of self-provoked collective guilt, which might have been the most interesting piece. He does not manage miserably. Chahine's short story is poorly written and badly executed, at least enough to be highlighted among other top chapters of the film. Despite the imbalance in quality, I would still keep the 7/10 movie for the concept, if not the execution.
