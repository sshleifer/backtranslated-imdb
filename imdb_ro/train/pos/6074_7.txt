Laurence Fishburne is a good actor and he deserves respect because he tried this, but he is not in a class with the great Shakespeareans like Olivier and Welles; and still suffers from Kenneth Branagh. This Irish, always brilliant, surely steals the show. Olivier recognized that potential in his production and threw Iago away with someone he knew he could support. We did not realize nearly the possibilities of Iago, Shakespeare's worst character, but Branagh shows us the depths. I'm also glad to see Venice's point of view.
