This movie took a lot of stick. He was criticized by critics when he came out and was accused of destroying Nicolas Cage's career. The thing I do not think people get is that it's not an epic film, Oscar, it's just a brilliant "Bruck-Buster" action. Fast cars, fast editing and a good soundtrack - do exactly what the box says. Also, for anyone who likes cars is a pure treatment. It has everything: Ferraris, Mercs, a Hummer and we do not forget Eleanor! I think you've been hard pressed to find a better action movie and personally a better movie at all! Then maybe it's just me!
