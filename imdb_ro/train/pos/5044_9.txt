Bill Paxton plays and directs this very original film. Watching the first time I was with how well she was. The comments I heard were OK. As a result, I've been expecting the most at an average thriller. Still, thanks to Paxtons's excellent filmmaking and acting, the movie is worth seeing, especially if you're a fanatical horror movie. The film is also aided by closing credits. The strongest point of filming is the story I have to say is very original and it's the way I've ever seen before. Well done also to the two young leaders who perfectly convey emotions when these guys confuse. I give this movie 9/10 and I strongly recommend that everyone capture it.
