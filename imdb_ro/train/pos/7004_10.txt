Will Smith is one of the best actors of all time. I do not know how to do it. I read books constantly, but if there's a movie with Will Smith, I'll follow her. She has a rare gift to shoot you in the movie and keep you there. This movie is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I saw her on Saturday and I still can not get it off. AMAZING and sad all at the same time. Thanks again Will. You have to watch this movie from start to finish to understand each part of the movie. You can not lose anything. Make sure you have a lot of Kleenex and the man / woman who sits next to you so you can relax. Well worth the money you will pay to follow him .. Do not wait to come on TV.
