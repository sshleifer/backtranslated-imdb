Several posters have quoted Renoir expressing his desire to make a film showing Ingrid Bergman smiling at the camera. The short answer is that they would not all be, while the harsh reality is that only a selected number managed to do so. At this stage in his career, Bergman could not be arrested; In 1949 he left Hollywood to take a photo in Europe, fell for director Roberto Rossellini and never waited. After five turkeys in Italy, she was probably ready to open a vein, but during the year, after doing this for Renoir, she was again where she also belonged with an Oscar to start for Anastasia. This is one of the three films that Renoir made of color around this time and on balance is better than The Golden Coach, which is not hard, and even about the French Can Can. Renoir probably thought that with so much to go Bergman they could escape with a couple of leading wooden people and Renoir chose two doozys in Jean Marais and Mel Ferrer, a solid mahogany in both cases. The land is actually based on a real incident in the history of France, but Renoir is pleased to once again over-focus and to focus on replicating his father's paintings after setting up. In her pastel colors she resembles another Les Grandes Manouvres film, which is not a bad thing. Everything remains a pleasant thing with a beautiful and charismatic actress.
