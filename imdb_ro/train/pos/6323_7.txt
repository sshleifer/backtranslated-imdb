"Welcome to Collingwood" offers some of the most hilarious dialogue in recent memories. Watching this comedy directed by brothers Anthony and Joe Russo has perhaps reminded us of another movie we have seen in the past, but since we missed the opening of credits, we had to wait until the end of the year to discover that what we I remembered, it was the 1958 Italian film "Big Deal on Madonna Street," directed by Mario Monicelli. <br /> <br /> Russo brothers put together a magnificent cast to portray all the characters in the movie. Whatever with William H. Macy, Luis Guzman, Sam Rockwell, Patricia Clarkson, the late Michael Jeter, in it, can not be bad. Since this is an overall piece, all characters get an opportunity to shine. <br /> <br /> The film presents us a group of sounds-they would be biscuits safely from hell. No one could think that these men could do a job like the one they do. Whatever may go wrong and more is what they can do. George Clooney makes a small look like the master cracking plant, which is also seen as a rabbi, just to be confused with a priest by the gang members coming out of his funeral Cossimo. <br /> <br /> The best way to enjoy the movie is to sit back and relax, and get this done. Let their funny lines make you laugh, as anyone can see this band is doomed from beginning to end!
