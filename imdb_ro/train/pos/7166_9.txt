The holes, the novel, were forced into my education. I did not think I wanted a novel for children; Plus, the other two books I had to read about for the class were very bad. But to my surprise, I absolutely loved Holes. It is indeed one of the most perfect Romanian writings I have ever read. I think it has a rare quality that makes it recognizable to pre-adolescents, adolescents and adults. Everyone who reads it, I think it will leave a better person. While I can not say enough about the film, I'm happy to say that they are largely right. I do not think that moviegoers will be as rich as they are, but they will surely be entertained without the side effect of being stupid when they sit. It's a smart story and it's very well said. I think it's moving too fast. The novel takes more time in character development. And the flashbacks come in and out so fast they do not have much time to register. Interracial romanticism in the past feels more clich and trita than in the novel. And the end that unites all the free wires seems ridiculous. It's exactly the same thing in the novel, but there's a sense of absurdity that does not even exist in the movie. It works much better. I also do not like the multitude of pop songs. I want Disney not to feel such a need to sell soundtracks. The distribution is excellent, from small children to old professionals. Jon Voight is particularly great. Not sure why we need Catwoman and Fonze. 9/10.
