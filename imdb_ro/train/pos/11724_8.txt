Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) hosts a cheap horror show. After learning that her dead aunt had left her, Elvira went to England to pick her up, hoping there would be some money. But to her horror, the Elvira finds out that her whole aunt has left her, her house, her dog, and a cookbook. Elvira decides, anyway, to settle in the house, but with its stunning, amazing appearance and stunning features, she will not be able to live alone. All the neighbors now turn all the city against her, and with Elvira's scandalous attitude and gaze, everyone needs to take care, because Elvira is in the fire! I really liked this movie, it's really fun to look at Elvira in all these adventures, it's great. The whole movie puts you in a Halloween mood, for sure, it's silly and the jokes are cheap, but it's a pleasure to watch it. I would give Elvira, Lady of Darkness 8/10
