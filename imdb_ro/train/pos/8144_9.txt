After seeing both the "Fear of a Black Shirt" and "This is a Touch of the Spine," I can honestly say that while they are similar, both films must really see. Many times, in "Fear," you will have hysteria. No wonder why both movies have such a cult. "Fear" will soon be available on DVD. Rent it if you need it, but the only way to enjoy this movie is to have it for you.
