I cried my heart, I was watching this movie. I have never suffered from food disorders, but I think this has to be a very real picture. Alison Lohman is great! She expresses these amazingly good feelings. The teen years have returned so alive. Anyone who has gone through difficult moments like a child or adolescent will be able to refer to this movie. We recommend everyone to see it! Music is great - I've now discovered Diana Lorden. I also look forward to seeing Alison Lohman in White Oleander, because I'm sure it's perfectly suited for the role of Agnes.
