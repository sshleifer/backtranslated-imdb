I want CÃ©line and Jessie to go further in their relationship, I want to tell them that they were made for each other, that in much of the film we want to die for each other. Their story is what we've ever wanted, and probably most of us have never arrived. It's love, but not stupid things like "notting hills" or that kind of movie. This is life and I believed in them, I think they fall ... It was so intelligent and exciting. I just finished seeing him a minute ago, and I'm still there ... I want to go to Vienna. I want to see them as soon as possible. I have to say that I was now a misanthropist and I felt that love was just a fake concept, but with this film I realized that maybe somewhere, in one way or another, when something could really happen. I'm French and I do not know very well July Delpy, despite Kieslowski's "three colors: white" ... Now I have to see others work because he looks like an angel and he had a perfect action. I've seen "before sunset" (sequel to Paris) a few days before I see "before dawn" and it does not matter. Both are masterpieces. proof that you do not need to impress your eyes with technology to get pure feelings. I'm sorry for my English that I'm trying to do best. Franck in France
