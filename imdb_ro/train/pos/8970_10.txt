I've been researching this little movie and found a website that claims it was actually a joke in the gay and lesbian world of World War II. With the exception of Stewart and Novak, warlocks and witches were the alternative lifestyle. John Van Druten, who wrote the scene, was apparently gay and very familiar with this village in Greenwich. I thought it was ironic because I first saw Bell, Book and Candle in the theater when I was in the 5th or 6th grade just because my parents took me. It was hard for me to go to a movie that did not contain horses, machine guns, or foreign monsters, and I planned to get bored. But I remember the moment Jimmy Stewart embraced Kim Novak on the top of the Flatiron building and threw his hat as the camera watched it shake. As the glorious theme of George Duning's love grew, I suddenly felt a sense of what I felt to fall in love with. The first romantic / sexual love moves left me stunned when I left the theater. I'm sure I'm not the only pre-teen boy who was seduced by Kim Novak's stunning and direct look. It is ironic that a homosexual parable managed to start at the beginning of heterosexual puberty in so many of us. I'm 50 years old now and I watched the movie yesterday evening and the same feelings were shaken when I saw that hat reached fifty years later. . .
