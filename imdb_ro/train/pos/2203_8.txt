Me too, I loved this series when I was a kid. In 1952 I was 5 years old and my family always followed this show. My favorite character was the one Marion Lorne played as a typical aunt, a rather stupid, humiliating person. I can still remember my "ubba bubba um um" comments as she tries to say something important. And then, when she came back and played her aunt Clara in Bewitched, it was a great casting! <br /> <br /> It was the first time I remember seeing Walter Matthau, whose career I have been following as a fan for many years. <br /> <br /> I have a question if someone can check: Was the title or end credit to the music "Swedish Rhapsody" by Hugo Alfven? Every time I hear he played on my classic radio station in Southern California, he brings me memories of Mr. Peepers' image, going back to the room. I'm not even sure if this image in the eye of my mind is correct.
