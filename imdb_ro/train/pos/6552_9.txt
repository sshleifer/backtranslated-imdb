I usually do not like Emma Roberts, but after watching Nancy Drew, my mind changed. The actors in the movies have done everything interesting and funny. Most of the time, when watching a mysterious movie, you can fix it before the middle of the show, but in this movie it's like you were there. The indices must match everyone until you finally understand the whole crime. I'm still amazed how she found out. The whole movie was very clever, and the people who looked at it liked the movie as well. Clothes were my favorite part of the movie, she was so cute. I do not think there will be another movie like this until the sequel comes out. I give it a new one, because the popular girls do not seem to have the right side but still make me laugh. It was a great movie and a great mystery. I certainly recommend watching him.
