With everything that happens in the world, sometimes we need an escape. Curly Sue is just that. It is not a complicated plot or a deep meaning; however, it is not devoid of substance. There are many angry actions or intimate dramas. There are the charming shows you can watch with your kids and have enough substance to enjoy the meeting. Try to like more than you think. The girl is really smart and cute. "Dad" and girl are going through some routines. When a jealous friend enters, the troubles for Curly and the life she knows can be broken. Fred Thompson and Kelly Lynch play good roles as a top crust, and Alison Porter and James Belushi are an interesting fabulous duo to illustrate street drifters. Their worlds collide, and the comedy is followed.
