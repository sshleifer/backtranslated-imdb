Pecker is a funny, yet twisted, film about a small town in Baltimore, whose daily, noisy routine is broken by Pecker, a young photographer who shoots "real things." There are no beautiful models, no marvelous men who live hard. This wonderful movie has fun at the plasticity of the urban art chain. There's a special scene when a homeless woman at Pecker's mom's shop buys the exact same coat as one of Whitney's art girls for just 25 cents instead of five hundred dollars. This only works to show you that no matter what kind of money you may, you may not always taste. Again, John Waters sends you into an endless spiral of laughter and brutal reality. You can have Hollywood movies with special effects and celebrities, but give me a "Pecker" or "Hairspray" (another great movie John Waters) over a day "Titanic" or "Godzilla"!
