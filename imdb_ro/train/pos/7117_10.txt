This movie is a fantastic movie. Everything about him in my opinion was top notch from acting to directing. I know Mr. Garfield was blacklisted in the 1950s, but most of his other films are on the video, if not on DVD. In this case, why is not it? A friend registered him for TCM for me, but to have it on DVD would be great. For special features, a marine history may speak of the battle, and if Mr Schmid's wife or son are still alive, they could also be interviewed. Anyway, this is a great movie and I highly recommend it. If it is ever removed, we hope it will not be colored. Coloring would mean, in my opinion, ruin the whole effect of the film. The battle scene was pretty realistic until 1945, when the movie will go. Mr. Garfield did a great job of representing Mr. Schmid. Some actors would have been tempted to overcome Mr Shmid's disability, but I feel he has succeeded. I sincerely hope to come with this DVD movie one day as a tribute to the courage of Al Schmid and all the other marine that sacrificed us so much for the Second World War.
