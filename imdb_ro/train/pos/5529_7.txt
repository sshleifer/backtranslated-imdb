I first saw this movie in a theater in France a year ago. He came and went with a little fanfare, but I enjoyed the beauty of landscape photography and the fascinating film in the wild. (The story, even if it's cute, is really incidental. If you're actually thinking, there's no way for most of what's going on in real life.) I saw her again tonight, here , in the States, on DVD. Again, I noticed that the distribution is very limited. Blockbusters only had a copy and I do not remember playing in the Cleveland art houses ever. On my TV, photography is not as stunning, though it's still very beautiful. The film for wild animals is still fascinating. The story of the relationship between the 10-year-old and the fox is less convincing the second time when you know where it's going. However, as I said, the story is incidental. It's a beautiful movie to watch and if you like wild pictures, you should find this fascinating.
