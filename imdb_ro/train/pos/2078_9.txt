This adaptation of Pearl S. Buck's film is certainly a classic. A true epic of Hollywood, it has all the great Hollywood stuff: Birth, death, happiness, sadness, joy, despair, and so on. There is one thing that bothers me. I know it was a sign of the times, but neither of the two main characters is interpreted by Asian actors. Paul Muni was a great actor and makes an admirable job like Wang Lung, the owner of a Chinese farm. Luise Rainier plays Olan. He does not even look Chinese! I think he tried to get the role, but he should have put Anna May Wong in the role. I know why they did not, and Mrs. Rainier is very good in the movie, but they have hardly tried to make her look "authentic." Still is a great movie, especially if you read the book (I did it in high school decades ago). You have to see it, look beyond the casting. I think you can.
