He first saw this film around 1990 and died absolutely laughing through him. She became a cult favorite with my circle of friends and I quoted her at the drop of a hat ("I'm going home in a bag!"). Needless to say, humor is still there, 15 years later. It has become a Halloween tradition to expose many of my new friends to this movie (good thing you can still buy on Ebay!) We have discovered that Halloween candy have much more with the language you have planted firmly in the cheek. this film offers everything - pathos, suspense, unrequited love, nobility, and the continuing list. Royal Dano offers a stunning performance from the heart's point of view as the old Wrenchmuller. I remember seeing him in "Lao's 7 Faces" as a bad guy who encountered an evil. Here, you really feel for the old man from the beginning. <br /> <br /> If you are not careful, you will lose some of the levels of humor in this movie. The creators were very subtle in many ways, with innocuous comments, subtle costumes in other sci-fi movies and even a torn scene from Wile E. Coyote's pages! many thought processes trying to analyze a movie, people - this is a fun without the need of nitpicking and should not be offensive to anyone (well, maybe stupid people, but they will not know they are mocked) <br /> <br /> -If you excuse me, I'm going to take a "Zag-nut" bar .... -Ramsay "RC" Cowlishaw, karaoke DJ / entertainment
