Gosha's last big film of the 1960s. A decidedly-styled stylist with a sense of purpose for his films, Gosha made a team with Shintaro Katsu (from Zatoichi's fame) to produce this insensitive allegation of mindless nationalist loyalty. <br /> <br /> "Tenchu" (the heavenly judgment) is the word that the loyalists push the Emperor while killing the enemy or "traitor" in the cause. Katsu plays his sympathetic character to a manipulative politician, all in the name of patriotic pride. Anyone who asks the politician is called a "traitor" and becomes a target of assassination. One of the best films ever shot, many photos are incredible compositions of shape, color and light. Battle scenes are frequent, very bloody and brutal. Blood becomes part of the color palette used by Gosha for his images. Wonderful and disturbing. While the personal story is easy to follow, the background is complicated and while a lesson of basic history for this time in Japan would be very useful, you can fight the movie without it. Several disadvantages of the film are the musical piece, the length and occasional slicing of Katsu. He has a drunk scene that's on the top for a movie, but actually a very accurate description of a boy. Beginning, but one of the biggest chambara movies.
