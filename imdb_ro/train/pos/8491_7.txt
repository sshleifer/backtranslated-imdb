I saw this movie when it was new. Later I hired her in Japan after I was here for three years, fearing that I was wandering when I saw it in the harsh light of my extensive international experience. The film surprisingly surprised me how accurate it describes the conflict between Japan and Pennsylvania (where I am). Not all things are actually on the scene, but the tone is perfect. I'm still in Japan many years later, and I continue to enjoy this film for her unparalleled treatment of the two sides in the story. Interestingly, although Japanese-American actors spoke Japanese in their original form, the dialogue is reduced in the Japanese version to cover obvious delivery problems in the second language. We noticed that a commentator uses this in a Japanese class. I think you can find out more about what to expect from a meeting with Japan watching this movie than reading "serious" books in this area (most of which were written in the 1980s and funded by Japanese propaganda companies). <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the average rating caused by star reviews that, among other things, found it impossible for the Japanese to build cars in the US. (Of course, the Japanese operate many factories there to be close to customers and to avoid commercial friction.) This is a very hot and funny movie that I would miss most if it had not been for a few moments in the 80's, such as dancing around cheese disco electronic music. Michael Keaton has never been more funny.
