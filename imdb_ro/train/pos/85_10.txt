I shot this film at Southern Birmingham College in 1975, when it was presented in combination with the Red Balloon. Both films are similar in their dream quality. Most of the film involves a bowl of happy fish swimming, while its new owner, a little boy, is gone to school. A cat enters the room where his fish and bowl are and begins to easily trace his "prey." The boy starts going home from school, and the spectator wonders if he arrives in time to save his fishfriend. The fish becomes agitated by the presence of the cat and eventually escapes from the bowl! The cat walks quickly towards the fish, gently lifting it up with his paws and turning it into the bowl. The boy returns happily to his fish, no more wise. The conclusion is amazing in both its irony and its technical complexity. It is hard to imagine how the director could have pulled the technical piece back in 1959 - it seems more of a trick for 2003. If you can find him, look - you will not be disappointed! And if you find her, let me know, so I can get a copy too!
