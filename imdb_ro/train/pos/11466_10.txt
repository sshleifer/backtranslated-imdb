I was lucky enough to see Zero Day last night. It's an amazing movie. A very disturbing thing about that. In a way, the Zero Day is very similar to the "Blair Witch Project". It is completely shot with handheld camcorders. There are about 2 children. Only your average children. Andre and Calvin. Start a campaign against High School, titled "Army 2". The whole story is told in the Video Journal form, from the two children. It shows there relationships with the parents there, among other people, who show that they are just normal children, just like the people we know or who have met. We find out that the last mission of the 2nd Army will give Zero Day. They're going to shoot the High School there. See how they have access to weapons, how they plan it, everything. They point out that the media have not affected them at all and there is no reason to do so. As I said, this is said in the Video Journal form, and then they store the boxes in a box to be seen after Zero Day. The real filming is shown through the Survillence camps along the school. Cooling really. The film is very cold. Some of the things I say, how they plan it, should only see them for you. A quote that I remember is the only time Calvin is alone. He says that "Andre thinks he will go to a escape car, doing it at numerous schools across the country. I do not know what he is thinking, but the only way out of school is in a black plastic bag." I probably do not even give you the right idea of ​​this movie. You really have to see it yourself. It's happening around the festivals right now. <br /> <br /> A +.
