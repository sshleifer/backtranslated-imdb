I've rented a domino on a whim, not knowing she was inspired by a true story, and even if it's the least likely and true biopic, you'll probably see. I found it rather wonderful. With Richard Kelly writing together a plot of parks and narratives in 2 hours of pure entertainment. And once you've seen it many times, understand it and appreciate it. <br /> <br /> Domino is a rewarding hunter model who leaves the perfect Hollywood life to pursue such a subtle or perfect career. He has a style of foreign acid excursion offered by director Tony Scott. And with fast paced music and rhythms, it provides a focal point to keep your attention with slick performance and unexpected comedy, the movie is well made and enjoyable and should have reached a wider audience. <br /> <br /> I suggest to anyone who wants to think and have fun at the same time for 2 hours.
