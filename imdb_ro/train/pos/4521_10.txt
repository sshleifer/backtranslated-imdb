Julie Waters is always awesome, but Adrian Pasdar is a positive revelation in this comedy about a transvestite who can not suppress his obsession and change when he finds out. Undoubtedly, he avoids vulgar, hoarse and light jokes for authentic wisdom and true understanding and has an absolute ball while doing it. A very beautiful comedy, with a low level of chef, I feel good
