This is a documentary I happened to meet on the British Channel More4 and I have to say that it seemed very exciting and provocative. I will also look for the book that was the source of the material for this documentary. Practically, this is Professor Jared Diamond's theory of how certain parts of the earth societies have thrived, and others not. The argument she was presenting was new to me and she argued that the right crops and the right animals she could cook is certainly convincing. As far as the documentary itself is concerned, it is well shot and well-related, not many of the re-created scenes that ruin a modern documentary. The diamond also helps not to be condescending, which is the fault of many intellectuals when they try to receive a message to the masses. People have argued that his theory is Marxist, but I do not buy this and see him as a geologist. It was also refreshing to hear a theory about the evolution of non-religion-based society. Highly recommended viewing.
