I found this movie available for streaming on Netflix and I thought I'd try. The plot is revolving around Ryan and Theo Taylor (Colm Feore and David Cubitt) who eventually saw their father die. Ryan and Theo, at first, argue about who did what. But later, Theo discovers that his brother, Ryan, is not just gay but dies of a terminal illness. So Ryan and Theo spend their time to destroy their differences. <br /> <br /> This is an incredible movie. I only saw Colm Feore in Season 7 of 24, but he was phenomenal in this respect. David Cubitt, an actor I never heard of, did a phenomenal work. I would recommend it to those who are interested in Gay and Lesbian. This is a movie you do not want to miss. Give this movie 10 stars out of 10. Great movie!
