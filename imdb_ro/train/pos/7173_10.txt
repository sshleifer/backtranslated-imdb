I watched the documentary "Fog City Mavericks" on Starz cable television. It's no doubt one of my most enjoyable viewing experiences ever! Chronicle artists in the San Francisco Bay area and creatively responsible talent for some of the best movies ever made. In addition to well-known artists, he also includes segments with Irvin Kershner, Caleb Deschanel and a segment about Pixar Animation studios. I hope it will be released on DVD - this is a must for any collection about cinema history and the brilliant movie. If you are even remotely interested in movies and those who create them, you will not be disappointed.
