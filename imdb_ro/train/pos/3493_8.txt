This movie is underestimated. I liked. It was really sweet and honest. A family struggling but not transformed into a dysfunctional family that is so typical of today's films. The film did not make it a problem that they have little money or are Dominican Republicans like Hollywood. Instead, the problem is that Victor is immature and needs to grow. He slowly makes the end of the movie. He has a way to go, but it was a sincere attempt to advance. His grandmother's very cute, and the scene in which the boy throws up has made me laugh for the longest time. A truly indie heart
