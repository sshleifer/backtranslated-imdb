At first sight, I found this story to be at least less annoying than other Cannon Movie stories. After many others, I think it's one of the best. Some songs are pretty bad, especially the love song, but two things stand out, making the movie, even singing, worth it. One is the direction of art. Like the other Cannon Movie Tales, this is a beautifully decorated vintage piece; every piece of cloth and jewelery (both of which have major parts in the plot of this film) looks fresh and new and counters the peasants' simple clothes. Even during the love song I find myself studying the dress and hair of the princess, wonderful done. The other thing is the comic moment. Much of the film is cheese, but the vanity of the Emperor (and his fun in the end), the suspect guardian, the guard who was watching Nicholas and the stupid prince, were all fun and ridiculous. And the sequence during Weave-O plays for songs that were not that good.
