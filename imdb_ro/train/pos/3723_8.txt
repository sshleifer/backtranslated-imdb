There is an inexhaustible hunger for "core workout" movies, so it's surprising that it received so little attention at the first release. Looks like he'll have a second life well worth on DVD / VHS. Tigerland is not uniform in any way, there are terribly cliche characters (especially the portrayal of NCOs for the return of Lee "Full Metal Jacket" Ermey), but Colin Farrell's lead performance is that thing today. Charisma to burn and a role that any actor will kill to get it.
