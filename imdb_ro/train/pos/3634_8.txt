We had low expectations for this movie, but we were looking for something uncontested for one evening. I came out of the theater totally delighted and a little surprised. This is a great baseball tribute movie and a beautiful lesson about pursuing your dreams. Dennis Quaid does a master work with his role and I have been touched by his performance. It definitely deserves a full price ticket and a few hours of your time!
