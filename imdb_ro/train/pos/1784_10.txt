Evening is a funny film with plenty of depth. All actors and actresses turn into spectacular shows. With an extraordinary piece, however, star action is expected, but in this movie the expectations are outdated. It can relate to personalities and family situations. As we look at the interaction of family members, the memories of our family are immediately brought to mind. This is one of the few movies that inspire someone to read the book. It is usually the reverse; one reads the book and then wants to see the movie. Surely I will get a copy of Susan Minot's book and read it. The landscape of Rhode Island is spectacular as well as the soundtrack. Any brave car will enjoy periodically restored vintage cars. Needless to say now, but I greatly recommend the Evening. You see that you will enjoy it.
