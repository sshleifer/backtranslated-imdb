Legendary Boris Karloff ended his illustrious career, making four megacions in Mexico. This is the symbolic period of the moody gothic horror entry from bunch. Karloff gives an ordinary, subtle and worthy performance like Matthias Morteval, an eccentric patriarch, elderly, who invites many of his relatives, greedy and reluctant, without counting his relatives in his creepy castle, for reading the will . Pretty soon, ugly invitations will be swallowed by fat-sized toy people who will populate the place. A symbol of Mexican sex, Andres Garcia, of infamy "Tintorera," portrays a police officer hero, and Julissa looks absolutely scary as the only feminine character. Unstoppable scenario, brilliant scenario, ugly film, cinemas washed, ridiculous pieces of crime (a thick fat thick is thrown directly in front of a miniature cannon!), The morbid atmosphere in the dark, largely amazing (especially the exception of Karloff), gentle brown gorons, weak dabbing and fiery conclusions, all give this delicious leaf a delicate charm and therefore strangely funny. A real noise.
