I grew up in Royersford, Pa. The town where Jerry's market was. I remember my whole family went out to watch the shootings. I remember a guy who showed me "Blob" for me and my brothers in a bucket. I would also like to share the fact that my mom was in the movie. Her hair style was the same as Aneta Corsaut, and one night she was sick and they saw her mother and asked them to stay in the car with Steve McQueen for some back shots. They paid him $ 25 and gave him a story to tell until he died last August. My mother was not a teenager and she had a few months since my sister's birth.
