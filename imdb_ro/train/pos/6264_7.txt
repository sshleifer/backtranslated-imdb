Merian Cooper's team and Ernest Schoedsack produced a documentary of 50,000 people from Bakhtiari and their animals in summer migration to the winter pasture. The basic value of this film today is a time capsule of a "forgotten people" and the way they lived during what we in the West knew as "twenty years." A more drastic contrast could not be imagined. Rivers of river passage and mountain splinters are brutally realistic, and animals that disappear under water actually die. To make sure that the audience of time thought the story took place, a signed authenticity certificate is offered at the end of the year. The version I saw had a fascinating Iranian music that can stand alone and be appreciated without a movie. Having said all this, the movie is probably more valuable to the anthropologist than the casual viewer in search of good evening entertainment. The crew only had enough stock now to take pictures that they had registered and there is no fancy camera work resulting from several re-take. Inter-Western titles are the difference, but they are actually part of the record, as it demonstrates how Hollywood has attempted to rotate in the lives of an indigenous peoples' life so that they are appreciated by the public of the day. Entertainment activities from the desert police become a "policeman's ball". The producers continued to make the drama docu-drama Chang (1927) and King Kong Total Commercial (1933). The subject of migration is again used in the People of the Wind (1976) and the Himalayas (1999). Recommended for those who know in advance what is coming in - and then highly recommended for them.
