Frank McCarthy, who produced Oscar winning biopic film Patton, follows a tribute to another American general, Douglas MacArthur. Gregory Peck offers a strong characterization of man, his genius and his selfishness. With MacArthur you never knew where it started and the other one left and too many times mixed up. All Douglas MacArthur's story would be a six-hour movie or a mini-TV series. He could cover his days at the border posts with his family at his time at West Point, where he still has the highest average scholarship ever made by a cadet. He would talk about his service in the Philippines as a young officer, his legendary build courage on the battlefields of the First World War in France. He should also tell him about the 1932 World War veterans' draw, probably putting his head on any chance that President Herbert Hoover had to choose. In the last years of MacArthur, he and Hoover had penthouse apartments at Waldorf Astoria in New York City. It must have been a topic they avoided. This film focuses on 1941-1952 and is said in flashback. The film opens with MacArthur addressing the student body in 1962. As he speaks the famous Duty Honor speech, MacArthur's mind returns to World War II and the desperate struggle against the advanced Japanese on Corregidor and the Bataan fields on Luzon. The film takes him through his struggle to win back Phillipines, Japan's occupation and the first 18 months, culminating in President Truman's release of command. MacArthur's film would not work if it was not for Dan O'Herlihy and Ed Flanders portraits as presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman respectively. It's the part of the movie I liked best, seeing MacArthur and her relationships with these people. FDR by O'Herlihy surprises the aristocratic sculptor and the man who was the 32nd president. Roosevelt was a man who knocked down his points with unusual intelligence and intelligence. Sometimes he would like to imagine too much for his sake, but he was the master politician of the last century. Note how MacArthur handles both the battlefield commander and the potential rival at the same time. Truman of Flanders is, as people remind him, a man speaking of people who did not like MacArthur's supremacy of gitto. Of course, in the history books, Truman freed MacArthur in 1951 for disobedience. MacArthur was undignified, no doubt about it. However, I could write an entire thesis about Truman-MacArthur relations. Along the way, you must never have come to a crisis. I've always felt that the FDR would have been much better off if it was still a president then. MacArthur was eloquent, and Gregory Peck captured some of the eloquence in some of the roles that made him so much a legend as victories on the battlefield. Listen to Peck at the Japanese capitulation, bid farewell to MacArthur with the nation before the congressional session and, of course, his speech to the cadets in 1962. Watch the news stories and see if you disagree.
