Dance is an excellent movie because it shows how something, like dance, can rejuvenate the flow of life in the human spirit. Dance is seen as an expression of existence and the birth of individuality. It's certainly Aoki's case. At work he is a humble officer, but he puts it on the dance floor and all his bottled intensity is released. Surprisingly, this release is impressed in Japan due to the rigid culture of compliance. At the beginning of the movie, all the characters are ashamed or frightened of their desire to dance. They will be despised or perverted, because they will express their passion through dance. This movie is worth watching to witness the resurrection of human emotions and passions. It will leave you a smile on your face for a few days.
