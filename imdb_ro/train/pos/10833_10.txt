This movie made me cry at the end! I watch at least 3-4 movies a week. I've seen a lot of great, even worse movies. But when the scene ends - catharsic at its base - I Cried! And if you did not have - you have serious problems! The story is archetypal - nothing new or original. But it is real - because that really happened and that people really exist. Glam is not my kind of music, but I really admire everything they've been through the early 70s ... At one point, this has turned me to Velvet Goldmine! Docudramas does not really work really well. But this film really caressed us to believe everything ... Because they are not trying to make it like a glamorous concert, musicians who are superheroes, group girls who are stupid and emotionally numb, do not glorify drugs and alcohol, they promote rehabilitation and redemption that comes 20 years late ... Once again a great movie. Since "Leaving Las Vegas" I've never been so excited about a movie.
