At first, I thought that Ring would be more than normal, with the usual plot. How surprised I was! Of course, the plot is simple - a girl is in love with two men - but Hitchcock brings her to a silver plate, laughing and afraid, with compassion and suffering. The way he describes the folk crowds of the fair, the force of the girl's attraction to both men, the tragic elements that come with techniques that open the mind to most of his greatest films (Northwest, Rope, etc.). The master did it great right before the thirties!
