Believe it or not, this movie (for 1912) is a feature film. Very few movies have been longer than those of then, but it certainly is not what makes this movie strange apart from the rest! No, what is different is that all the actors (except a frog) are bugs ... yes, bugs! This simple, little comedy could have looked a lot more like Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy or Max Linder, but instead of this Russian production, bugs (or, I think, models that looked like bugs -hate). Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy have not been discovered yet, and I assume Linder was busy, maybe that's why they used bugs! Using stop-motion, the bugs moved and danced and fought amazingly well - and a heck much more realistic than King Kong 21 years later! <br /> <br /> The film begins with Mr. Beetle sneaking for a good moment. He goes to a frightened club, while his wife is waiting at home. But, unfortunately, for Mr. Beetle, he is caught on the camera by a local film director. Besides, she does not know, but Mrs. Beetle continues with a Bohemian painter. Of course, there is much more to this comedy than that, but the plot is old and very fun for adults and children alike. Strange, but also very amazing and traceable.
