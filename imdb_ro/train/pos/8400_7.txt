I chose this movie at the local library. After meeting the director at a film festival late last year, I was curious to check his "work". I was pleasantly surprised. The film takes a new look at familiar topics, love, infidelity, friendship, jealousy. It may be a bit "talky" sometimes, but never so long as to completely sink the movie. I liked to follow a love story with characters that appear clearly together and who seek to make conscious decisions rather than fall accidentally into something as important as love. The contrast between this movie and the low-budget media shoot-em "The black movie is pretty distinct. Check it out, if you're lucky, your copy will come with a copy of the soundtrack like mine.
