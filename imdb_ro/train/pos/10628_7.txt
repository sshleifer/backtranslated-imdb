Despite the fact that he played occasionally and was "seen before-before," this is a pretty convincing film. It has suspense, the scenes with the demon are actually pretty creepy, the effects are gorgeous, and, best of all, I'm not humorously greatly humored to drop the movie, because there are currently too many horror films (wannabe) is the biggest ever movie ever made, but it really attracts you and at least makes an attempt to develop the character <br /> <br /> I was glad I saw him
