I was 15 years old when this movie premiered on TV. Being grown up in Texas, I understood the boredom and monotony of adolescent life. This movie has touched my impressive adolescent heart and I have remembered it in the last 12 years. I recently saw it for the second, third and fourth time due to the LOVE channel. I still cry because the movie touches my inner confused adolescence.
