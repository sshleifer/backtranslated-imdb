I doubt that this film is based on a true story. At first it is said to be based on a true story. I bet the only truth was that there was a former bounty hunter model eventually transformed by the name of Domino. Anyway, start with Domino talking to Lucy Liu, who works for the FBI. Domino is interrogated about what he knows about a $ 10 million theft. Through flashbacks, we see Domino as a child, then a model, and how he became interested in being a reward hunter. In fact, she tells two more reward hunters, Ed and Choco. They let him join the group. She is tough, she can use any kind of weapon and she will use her good looks if necessary. He's involved in a scam that Clarmont, a boy, is going. Along the way, the group starts a real-time television show, and Ian Zering and Brian Austin Green are involved. I'm a kind of host, and I must have been really desperate to appear in that. I thought the story was fun and she had some laughs. Editing did not bother me. There is also a lot of violence, mainly using guns and blood. It could have been a bit shorter. VERDICT FINAL: Pretty good to look at.
