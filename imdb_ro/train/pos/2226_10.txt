I'm surprised by the low rating of IMDb. With all due respect, his low rating is representative of the IQ level of those who rated him so poor. They would rather see a movie with cheap emotions, a larger budget and more gore. The first misconception of people is that this is a horror movie. It's not, and the movie does not make you think it's one. It's a psychological thriller. It's for people who actually want an intellectual experience when watching a movie. Reel.com's reevaluation is a perfect example of how I feel about this movie. All the other negative reviews do not make much sense. It's like trying to make an original movie for a change - very rare these days - is bad and not worth it. I'll unveil some spoilers for the monsters who said it's boring and does not make sense. Martha was brainwashed and experimented with herself as a careful mother, while she was really a bad Nazi who would kill without warning. Evidence is all in pudding and the fact that at first sight we sympathize with this cold blood monster during the film is a testament to the direction and writing of the film. that this film should at least be rated in 6 only on originality. I recommend this movie to the people at the end of the IQ Stage - the so-called intelligent people - because this movie is obviously killed by those who would prefer to look at Freddy's Scream or Nightmare. Kudos to the actor too. For such a low-budget movie, you're amazed that this movie did not hit local cinema with direction, writing and acting. Please do not be fooled by IMDb. This film deserves. In fact, I recommend buying the movie because a first view on a rent will not do that justice.
