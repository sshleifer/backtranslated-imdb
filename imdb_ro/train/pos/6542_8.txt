Although well past the target audience, I always had a weak spot for the YA fiction, so I was naturally intrigued by Nancy Drew's return to the screen. This is not a bad movie. The central mystery involving a long-standing actress is presented in simplistic terms, with lines of danger to the young man. Nancy and her friends do not take the threats seriously, so the young members of the audience will not be upset. What I really appreciated from the story was that the final results were pretty serious and meaningful and Nancy seemed to understand and grow from experience. Emma Roberts is wonderful as Nancy Drew and hopefully we'll see her again in another mystery.
