Simply one of the best ever! The adaptation of Richard Brooks to Truman Capote's non-fiction novel is truly an artistic achievement. The brilliant Black and White cinema (which ought to have won an Oscar), a Quincy Jones scandal and the extraordinary performances of Robert Blake and Scott Wilson as the right killers. This movie was 0 for 4 at the Academy Awards and was not even nominated for the best film while Doolittle was. Realize! <br /> <br /> Although you do not know the Clutter family, as you did in the book, it was a good decision to focus more on Perry and Dick and on the tracking of the pains of tracking these boys down. John Forsythe is also impressive as Alvin Dewey. There are simply no flaws in this. 10 out of 10. Best Performance = Scott Wilson and R. Blake a second. Highly recommended!
