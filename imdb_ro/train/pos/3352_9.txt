there should be a western sub-gen called "Robert Mitchum Western". Mitsubishi, brilliant, idiosyncratic, usually underestimated, is importing his film personality to etcha some dark sketches and to bring an elegant wear to the world of Sam Peckinpah's film. "Man with the gun" is one of the best. Directed by Orson Welles protects Richard Wilson, it is a stark, monochrome beauty full of cold silhouettes and terrifying outbreaks of wild violence as Mitchum comes to tame a city terrorized by a monopoly with a private army. Mitchum's regression, from a foreigner speaking from one man to another, to a disturbed killer with a series of dark emotions between them is a miracle of expressive physical action.
