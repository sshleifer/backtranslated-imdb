If it should be a portrayal of the American killer in the series, it meets a considerable average. A journalist [Duchovny] travels across the country in California to document the most famous killers of America, not knowing that one of [Pitt] is a serial killer himself. Rather predictable along the way, it has its moments of action, and Pitt and Lewis play their roles well, but I have not bothered to see again.
