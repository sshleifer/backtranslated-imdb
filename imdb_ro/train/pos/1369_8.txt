I liked this movie and am one of the oldest who should not enjoy it, or so it seems. No, this movie is not deep - who cares? These types of movies are never. But strange, there is a message in it. It is that each of us has the potential of being whatever we want to be. Parker Posey is great in this movie. I always thought she had a facial similarity to Katharine Hepburn. So it's great to see both Hepburn and Posey have made movies about librarians (Hepburn's is The Desk Set). All librarians, especially those with a sense of humor, should see Girl Party. I gave a movie to 8. It's not a wonderful film of cinematic standards at all, although there are some beautiful pictures in it. But it's incredibly charming and fun.
