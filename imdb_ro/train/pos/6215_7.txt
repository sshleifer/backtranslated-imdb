While I'm not a big fan of the music, I loved Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, because they're really fun. Of course, they may be a little formal, but even if you know what's going to happen, they are still very pleased to look. However, despite this, I was a little disappointed in this trip. Part of this was due to the fact that this movie does not have the wonderful support, as you have seen in TOP HAT or SHAN DANCE. Without Edward Everett Horton or Eric Blore, the film seems to be lacking - especially in the "fun" department. The silly antique of these supportive actors gave the charm of the other films you just do not get with FOLLOW THE FLEET. Additionally, unlike the usual character of Astaire, it is rather a robbery - while his fat head makes Rogers face again and again. And as a result, it's much harder to like or want to see them meet at the end of the movie. In addition, although the music is Irving Berlin, the songs do not seem memorable. In fact, none of the songs were so special and I can not remember any of them, even if I saw the movie. While this is still a nice and valuable film, she misses only the glamor and magic of some of her other films. Good, but far from the sea.
