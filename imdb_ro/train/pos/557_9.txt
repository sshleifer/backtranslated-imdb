When I drove from Skagway, Alaska to Dawson City, Yukon a few years ago and I was impressed with the landscape, I can only wish that this film, even if it has a beautiful color and picturesque views, would have been shot at the location current. Jasper in Canadian Rockies is a great place, but it's not the place where the movie takes place. When the story goes to Dawson, then I feel that Anthony Mann, who used so many outdoor places, could have done the most if shot in the real spot. James Stewart is again a struggling man, part of him does not want to get involved and helps the people who are in his way to make money, and the other is not able to look away from the people killed. Ruth Roman is the ambitious woman who does not care who she is, Corinne Calvet is the beautiful girl. Mann excels in gunfire, but the high point of the movie is how well he does in outdoor scenes. He uses outdoors as much as he can and is helped by the winter landscape, the predominant white, as well as the green in The Naked Spur and brown in The Man From Laramie. Like all Mann-Stewarts, this is a Western tradition, with a difference in the elaboration of Stewart's character, which is more complex.
