Sexploitation of children is one of the most serious problems we face today in our world, and I feared that any film on this subject would go directly to sexually explicit scenes to shock and disturb the public. After seeing both "Trade" and "Holly," a movie pushed me to actually see a change in international law. The other felt a bad attempt to make me cry for five minutes with emotional music and strange suicide. <br /> <br /> I do not think the transformation of this problem into a Hollywood jerk jerk is a useful or necessary strategy to adopt and I have to appreciate the Holly marks because it is subtly but strongly involved with the conditions terrible which these children are unfortunately forced to endure. "Commerce" ceded between the grave and the stupid, with scenes that led to the death of a cat coming after images representing children being forced to commit some terrible acts. I have learned that this is not mandatory and sometimes offensive to the cause. If I wanted a cheap laugh, I would not have enrolled a movie about child trafficking. <br /> <br /> For anyone who would like to watch a powerful movie that actually means something, I would suggest saving money on the movie ticket for the release of Holly.
