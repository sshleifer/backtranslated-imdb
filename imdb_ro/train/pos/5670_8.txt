Esther Williams gets her first MGM post and plays a good role and starts playing a good start. This movie is a well-kept suspense of entertainment with a mature theme that will be repeated a million times higher in the future - an innocent girl watched a giant woman. Esther looks great, and if she likes it, she might have been able to play more and better movies, but according to her autobiography, she pretty much gave up work for marriage. Anyway, she is so enjoyable and engaged that her fun can see her in a completely different role outside "swimming music". Universal was fabulous to make films with former MGM stars after the studio began to give up its biggest names when it started sliding down the hill. The stars like Lana Turner, June Allyson and others have made the first quality movies at Universal because they obviously still had the power to shoot at the box office. I want Esther to do more, but since she has not done it, that's all the more special.
