There is nothing that you do not like to like the "Weird Couple," and it's no surprise that Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau make a very successful comedy team. But there is something so underdeveloped about adapting Neil Simon to his hit scene, to make it look more like a sketch on a sketch comedy than a full body movie. I did not see the song, but we have to assume that the screen version is pretty faithful, because Simon wrote it, so defects can not be accused of adjusting from scene to screen. There are some interesting ideas in this story - two newly divorced men who immediately fall into traditional married roles when they become roommates because none know otherwise - that Simon never does it completely. However, there are many more serious ways to kill a few hours.
