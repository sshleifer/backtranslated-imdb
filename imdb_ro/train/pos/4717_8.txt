How can somebody not love this movie? I think it's a hilarious paradise of all the old gangster movies; if you have never seen them, watch them instead. Michael Keaton has a ball in this role as anything goes. A guy eats English whenever he talks and Griffin Dunn plays a D.A., but my favorite role must be Joe Piscopo. It has all the best lines. Danny DeVito, Alan Hale, Ray Walston is in this starring movie, that lamp gangsters are more fun than the "mafia" for the underground killer.
