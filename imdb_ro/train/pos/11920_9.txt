Christopher Lloyd is funny and really credible like "The Angel of the Head". This movie is much better than the first, but has special special effects that the first did not have, as well as a much better plot and plot. OK - it was written for children, but adults have as much fun as kids. Tony Danza does a very realistic job in his role - but this is not a taxi reunion. Danny Glover is actually good and even seems to be very human in his emotions, as well as a real talent for a change, a pleasant change. Look at at least once - it's worth the effort to catch it.
