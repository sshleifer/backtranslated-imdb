The story is about a little girl who grows in colonial Africa, but there is much more than that. Whoever grows in the South will experience the same things. One desire for another, one for another race, which can not be perfect. Even a look is forbidden. No words needed. The facial expressions tell them everything. It's a black servant, Protée (Isaach De Bankolé) and a white woman, Aimée (Giulia Boschi). Their desire for one another is so strong that they torture each other, because they can not reciprocate. Little Girl, France (Cécile Ducasse), is alone and spends all time with Protée. She can not see this dance. One of the more irritating aspects of the film is the laziness of the colonies. They can not even undress themselves for bed. The world is about to end; they still do not know yet. Their racist attitudes will be erased by their presence. I think I'd like to visit Africa. It seems so quiet; especially at night when you hear the animals.
