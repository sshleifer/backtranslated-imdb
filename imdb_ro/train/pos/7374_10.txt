For his first ever debut, this film has some moments of riveting and coolness. In the best horror movie mode, the stomach pit gathers every moment during this movie. The end is superb. Blair Witch's producers have obviously seen this movie ending was not a goal but a beginning to end. A great movie and just a piece of great Japanese, as a hope factor a perfect score makes you think and scared from your mind.
