This movie shows the type of work you want in each movie. Barbara Bain and Donald Sutherland (who play husband and wife) are positive colds, talking about the "family business" as if it were a grocery store or a chemical cleaner. Macy, Campbell, Ullman and Ritter are also wonderful. They play each other as members of a top theater team that realizes that a quality product requires each actor to support others without selfishness. And finally, it's Sammy (David Dorfman). What amazing performance from a child ... and what a similar resemblance he has with Ullman, whose son he plays! We are treated with a unique story in "Panic" and this is a rarity in these days of tired prostitutes. The dialogue is sharpened and clever, and this relatively short film has the power to bring out a full range of emotions from the spectator. There are places to laugh, be shocked, terrified, sad, awakened, angry, and loving. It's not a movie that lets you jump, but when it's over, you're more than pleased knowing that you've spent the last ninety minutes experimenting with a good piece of work. go to the theaters if we were treated to a quality tariff like this one. When will the Hollywood powers awaken? It is a real shame when something good fails to expose beyond festivals and households lucky enough to have cable.
