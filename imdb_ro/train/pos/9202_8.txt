We have to admit that Dev has an eye for beauty and talent. He gave a break to Zeenat Aman, a successful model and also the former winner of the beauty contest title, playing him in a role that was adapted for his debut. Her gaze, staring at her stones, and her tinkering with hypnotizing music, made her instantaneous love for the spectators. This film is an eye treat, with picturesque churches, ethnic people, those temples of the Buddha, and Mumtaz chirpy, naughty, which looks quite attractive in her ethnic clothing and dancing skills. Dev is, of course, adorable, and this is one of his commercial success. Hare Rama manages to keep interest with scriptures, edits, and exciting music. Just like Des Pardes, his other film, Anand treated the subject of drug addicted young people, and their theory in troubled families and disturbing childhood is quite plausible. A good entertainment artist, this movie keeps its freshness up to date!
