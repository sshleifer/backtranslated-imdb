A great addition to someone's collection. <br /> <br /> 12 monkeys is a movie you do not see every day. She has excellent actors to go with an excellent story. This is not a normal role for Bruce Willis, but he plays the role of John McClane. The virus kills everyone on earth and leaves a few hundred survivors. The story is not a new one, but the story (Bruce) is sent back in time to get information about a virus that wiped out most people. the actors were wonderful. I have to mention Brad Pitt, who was hilarious, while James Cole (Bruce) is meeting in a psychiatric hospital. The director has done a great job to bring us a disturbing picture about the future devastated by a human virus. Animals seen in the world of viruses have made her feel like he would lead the world when people are driven to underground facilities. This movie was great and I have to see and also have to be my own. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend. <br /> <br />
