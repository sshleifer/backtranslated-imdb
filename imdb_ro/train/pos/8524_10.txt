Children aged between 7 and 14 have gotten so big a shot in this movie that we gave a copy of all the other children on our list of anniversaries this year. They all loved it! Children from 2 to 7 follow her repeatedly and frequently, and give us a shot to look at them. It's rare that a movie entertains kids for so long, and offers laughs for adults as well. Most enjoy it more than the first. Production of the best quality and excellent distribution, led by Christopher Showerman as a super-athletic, energetic and completely credible George, with a pleasant innocence and a particular temptation to take a tree forward - well supported by Christina Pickles hearts evil-mother-in-law, the Church of Thomas Haden as the vengeful rival and all others. That's funny.
