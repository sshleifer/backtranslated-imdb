One used to say, as far as Nathaniel Hawthorne is concerned, that his failures were more interesting than his successes. I think the same remark might be appropriate for McDonald-Eddy's photos. And especially that. <br /> <br /> Apparently has many features of a failed movie: is the kitsch, the script, because of censorship, inconsistent sounds? However, this film also has some good points: Rodgers-Hart's music ("I married an angel", "Tira tira tira la"), with EEHorton and Reginald Owen. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you do not like it, you can not forget it. This strange film really leaves a very strong, dreamlike impression, and it's very likely to take days, maybe weeks. Why? In the thirties and early forties, the films did not have the same role as today: they aim, as a dream, to hijack the public to make it forget a difficult reality. Of all the dream movies that were made, at that moment, this is a particularly strong one. In short, let's say the best way to appreciate this movie is to watch it without asking whether it is good or bad. Watch him as if you were looking at a dream.
