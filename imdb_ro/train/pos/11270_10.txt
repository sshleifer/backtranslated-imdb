Do not make a mistake, Maureen O'Sullivan is definitely the most beautiful Jane ever, and will never be a gorgeous one. It's amazing. Besides, it takes more than a beautiful woman to make a good movie. This is a great movie. Not only does it have the classic aura Tarzan, but also the sense of continuous saga. We engage with the two white hunters looking for ivory, one of them in love with Jane, the other one, an amazing catalyst whose character can be one of the best-defined and better examined in the history of the film. And these characterizations are what makes this a great action action remarkable as a classic. There is uncomfortable racism that is described. However, Africans are described as individuals, and at the end, two become even more heroes than white hunters, and are highlighted as such. In fact, the one who is not called probably evokes more sympathy from the public than any other person. The finale is also one of the reasons to enjoy this movie. The great lion's attack has never been duplicated, and horror is well involved in character reactions more than a modern gore film would do with graphic representation. If I left something, it's because I do not want to get the picture for those who did not see it. But it's all you can want in a movie.
