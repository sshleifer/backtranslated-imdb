I was living on Rawlins when this movie was made and I was lucky to work on it. In addition, and with Eddie Surkin on special effects. It was fun to see all the things behind the scene, from Barbedwire who came alive to Electric chair through the guards' office. It was also a lot of fun to meet with all the actors, from Viggo to Tiny. Also, the gate that was cut into the prison for film was and still is called the "Disney Gate" by the locals. If someone is interested and is ever in Rawlins, most of the films are still in place and can be seen during the self-guided tour. It was a lot of fun work for and with R. Harlin and I wanted to have had a chance to do it again.
