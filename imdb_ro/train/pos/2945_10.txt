I watched this movie several times in the 90's and I almost shared my parts laughing every time. I love Eddie Murphy as an actor, but this is something else. It's very funny. Even P.C. the brigade would find this hilarious. It's a mustard clock, and it's even better if you have boys or girls for a drink. Michael Jackson's movement is just like him, if you close your eyes, you think he's singing. The things they describe are true for life, and you should seriously have a humorous bypass if you think this is not funny. My local video stores no longer store this video, but I'd like to get my hands on a copy to show my husband and guys when they're old enough to appreciate humor. Anyway, highly recommended, I hope you enjoy.
