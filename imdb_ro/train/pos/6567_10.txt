Most people (36) gave this movie a 10, and those who are not too critical or expect anything else. This is one of my favorite 80s movies, growing on you and having it all. I just got it on DVD and 20 years later, I still do not disappoint, having a lot of action, drama, romance and even comedy. Add to this car great pursuits, automatic gun throws and many things that blow up and have a fun, exceptional experience! You'll even be buzzing or whistling the main theme song for days after you've seen it. <br /> <br /> You can watch this movie with your wife / gf and you will enjoy it so much. The premise is that of a book hero, such as Doc. The Savage, which really exists and helps people fight evil, so that he can write the story is almost true for the life here. Actor Jake Speed ​​is also director, producer and writer of many movies. In this movie, Jake Speed ​​is an Indiana Jones adventurer, usually uses his head to get out of sticky situations, but sometimes he will resort to the raw fire (yay!) Watch out for a piece of equipment hi-tech "James Bond," the latest road war SUV that comes out of the sky. "Eroina is a very good interest for young vampire lovers Jim Carey" Once Bitten "and here is a little older and yet a knockout even in comparison with her teen blonde sister The bad guys are "real bad men" and they are the worst I love to hate The end is just perfect and can stand alone or invite a sequel, unfortunately never did it but you can imagine what should happen next! You have to see this movie just because you will have fun and have fun and that's worth the price of a ticket.
