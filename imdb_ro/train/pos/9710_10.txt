That's what makes me proud of being British. This is by far the funniest thing on TV. The league is composed of Jeremy Dyson, Steve Pemberton, Mark Gatiss and the wonderful Shearsmith Reece. Totally underestimated, this comedy of horror is perfection. Characters are iconic and bizarre capture phrases, "Hello Dave". It's a comedy that everyone just has to look at. The best thing about the league of gentlemen is that it is always fresh and always pushes the borders. It should not be based on catch expressions (as opposed to the UK) to make it fun. the fact that the League are willing to kill, undoubtedly, the most famous and iconic characters, shows us that they have a steel ball.
