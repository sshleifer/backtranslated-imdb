High-class Raoul Walsh's 1933 energy, Bowery places the owner of the salon and operator Wallace Beery against the bitter and dandy rival George Raft with his adopted child Jackie Cooper and Faye Wray looking for roles that play between their great rivalries. It is not clear exactly what rivalry is about, but everyone is watching it in the daily tabloids. A lot of wisecracks at first, but the characters soften as the movie progresses. Besides, there is the absolute exuberance of the scenes from the Beery Salon. The different characters, the sexy crown line, a lot of drinks, a perfect creation of a denunciation of iniquity, which has not gone too far from the so-called pre-cod restrictions, and then comes Carrie Nation-led by Carrie Nation. Everything creates a very vivid image of a life that has long passed. I do not like to compare the epochs, but this film is completely and completely different from what is seen today. The film has a lot of heart and a lot of lost innocence and it is absolutely necessary to see.
