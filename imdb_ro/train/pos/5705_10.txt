A wonderful early musical movie from Rene Clair, fun and full of spirit as his silence "Italian straw cap". Using the sound in an expressive way and not just for dialogue and effects, Clair influenced early musicians in America (the opera scene from one night to Opera is strongly influenced by Le Million, for example). They should (but will not) be seen by all of the movies, and the Criterion DVD is just as good as you would expect. There's not a lot of extra, but most of the DVDs I've seen are useless, and the Clair interview on the disc is one I've never seen before. Take it while it's still around.
