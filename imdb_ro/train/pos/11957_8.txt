Great Woody Allen? Not. Good Woody Allen? Categorical. I woke up, along with the audience attending, laughing hard and often at some of the best Woody Allen lines I've heard for some time. Aging Allen has created the right role as "father" of Scarlett Johansson ... well, kind of. Some have said that Johansson plays "a young Dianne Keaton". I beg to differ. She plays Woody's dialogue, which in his comedies always has a very similar feel ... like a comedy by Woody Allen. That's good for us, Woody's appreciation. She certainly did Woody's dialogue much better than the young man in his last comedy, Melinda / Melinda. Some may find Woody's humiliation humorous, but for those of us who love him when he does well, we look forward to the next.
