American boy Jesse took the train to Vienna to take the plane to the US. In the train he met a French girl Celine. Although they met for the first time, they talked like good friends. When the train stopped in Vienna, Jesse asked Celine to accompany him to have a tour in Vienna. Then the romantic story unfolded. At first, they were cautious. The funniest scene was listening to CDs in the music store. They stared at each other, though their eyes did not contact them. After an in-depth conversation, the relationship approached. Then I saw the most romantic scene they claimed to call their friend. Their deep love for each of them was fully expressed in words. Love is a weird thing. When you really want it, it will not come as you wished. Love needs mutual understanding. Without it, love will not last long. Spiritual harmony is most important for love. An excellent screenplay and performance led to a huge success of the film. One of the best romantic movies. 9/10
