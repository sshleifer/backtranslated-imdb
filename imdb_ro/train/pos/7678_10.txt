I just looked at Holly with another film about trafficking and sexual exploitation of children, called the International Film Film Festival at the Sea Film. I have to say that Holly breathed the trade out of the water. <br /> <br /> Holly is a powerful and amazing film on many different levels. From an artistic and cinematic perspective, it's amazing. Mixing sound, camera angles, steering and drive are all on site. <br /> <br /> In addition, the way it deals with the subject is tasty and non-exploitative. It presents the issue of sexual exploitation of children in such an educative and precise way. The directors paid special attention to detail, capturing the hues of the sexual exploitation and trafficking epidemic. Too often, when dealing with a subject of this kind, it is tempting to shock the audience with graphic scenes of rape and violence. Holly is able to do all of this without falling into the typical Hollywood trend. <br /> <br /> I had the pleasure of seeing Holly at two separate film festivals, once in the US and once in the Netherlands. I can honestly say that I have never seen more public movement. Just by listening to conversations after screening, people wonder what they can do personally to combat sexual exploitation of children. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it to everyone, both for cinematic value and for his subject.
