One of my best movies ever, maybe because I was really good at punk scene in the late 70's and I went to many spider concerts, but the movie was a good story line and a very good action with Strawberries and a Phil Daniel Daniels sure about his latest Eastenders project! excellent performance by a lot of unknown actors who, if you keep your eyes uncovered, will see them in many of the soaps in the UK today exp: Carver of Bill, the more I look at as many of them as I have my face, well if you have not seen she has one more night with the movie, do not forget to remove your pins for your nose and makeup of heavy black eyes and shave your head Mochanian style .... Enjoy
