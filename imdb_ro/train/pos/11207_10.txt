This documentary has been nominated for Oscar and it's easy to see why. Even 45 years later, it is quite impressive. Why not in-print is a mystery that only Disney can explain. Make good use of live images and tandem animation. This has been used to run as part of the "Vault Disney" every few months or so, but I have not seen it listed for quite some time. * Sigh * Most recommended.
