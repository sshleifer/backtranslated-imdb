He saw this Saturday night at the Provincetown Film Festival and it's a bones movie - she stayed with me. Very smartly adaptable of what is probably an excellent novel, it's a drama in the back and in time with completely rounded characters, careful attention to the choices of life, and we do not exaggerate. one of the biggest movies ever assembled in over 100 years of filming. Wonderful work from everybody, led by a bright Vanessa Redgrave like a dying mattress deceived by Newport, and by Claire Danes as her younger self. Meryl Streep's daughter Mamie Gummer is, like Mom, the real deal; Patrick Wilson looks like Paul Newman around 1958 and does not overlap the charm; and what a pleasure to see such excellent stage actors, such as Barry Bostwick and Eileen Atkins, who contributed to clear and detailed interpretations. Hugh Dancy, too, from the stage, does not pay much attention to the somewhat clich√© role of a rich asshole, and family problems are perhaps better than real life would do. But it is a deliberately, wonderfully visual meditation on real-life issues, and you can cry and do not feel as if you were manipulated by negligence. Also, a sumptuous parade of cars in the 1940s and 50s.
