A great movie, full of undervalued performance and clever and sharp dialogue. What really distinguishes the movie, however, is that it is under sad tension. The story is highlighted by business, loneliness, suicide, disappointment, fear of losing its job in a world where it has disastrous consequences. Above all, it was put into a world that no longer exists, being destroyed at the beginning of the Second World War. In fact, the movie is just a comedy if you compare the percentage of serious scenes with comic scenes. However, it's funny - listen to Margaret Sullivan of Jimmy Stewart's harsh rejection and watch his painful expression because he replies that her comments were a remarkable mixture of "poetry and malice". It's funny, sad and sad everything. A remarkable achievement and one of the biggest screen comedies so far.
