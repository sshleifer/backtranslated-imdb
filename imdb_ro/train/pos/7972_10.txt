We're watching this movie all the time. I followed this with family ages from 3 to 87 and everyone between them; They all loved it. It really shows the true scenes that a dog has and the love and loyalty you get from a pet. Just nice. It's great for those who love comedy movies, tears, or even pets. Music is wonderful, spectacular animals, scenes really thought out, and perfect characters. What I liked about the characters is true and beautiful mixed characters: Shadow (the oldest, a Golden Retriever) He is the wise, filled with the wisdom and mentality of any dog, Chance is essentially a puppy with a spiritual side, the comic character; And Sassy (Hymilayan cat) She is the real cat that shows what a real cat will do for their owner, the true girlish little girl.
