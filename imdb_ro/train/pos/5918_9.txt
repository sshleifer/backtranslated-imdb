One of the most interesting films to be classified as "blaxploitation," "Coonskin" from Bakshi is a rich text full of wonderful views. She wrote it in collaboration with Scat Man Crothers and Barry White, who also appeared in the film. The racist images may often be disturbing, but the message of the film was so strong that NAACP gave her approval (but only by addressing). I recommend this film to all those who are interested in a film examining the pervasive atmosphere of racism that Bakshi is trying to deconstruct. Lovely things.
