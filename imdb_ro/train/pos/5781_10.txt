"Most of us live in at least two worlds, in the real world where we are at the mercy of the circumstances and in the surrounding world, the unconscious, a safe place to escape ..." With these words, Mr. Gone introduces the world " Maxx, a fascinating world where fantasy and reality are combined. Inspired in Sam Kieth's comic books, "Maxx" is very faithful to the material in what he was inspired, not only in the story, but also in the graphic style, which looks like the pages of comic, giving the show the unique surface and appearance. But the story is also interesting and fun. In moments it might become too strange, but when you get into it, it's hard to get out of it. The story and the characters are greatly developed. The music works perfectly with the style of the show and gives it the right atmosphere. Unfortunately, like many good animated shows, this was short. "Maxx" is something you have to see. It's one of my favorites.
