With "King rocket men", this was still repeated on BBC TV in the early half of the eighties. If I had loaded a time capsule from this period, both series would surely enter. Someone who is concerned for the first time will think it is bad, but this is one of the best examples of "serious". Don Del Oro makes you laugh (when I was little nickname for him was Mr. Dustbin) and funny when was shot when he said that "bullets can not hurt me", then he stops back, apparently less than happy. I also like the way he releases Sebastian in the first episode. that I had good memories of him a few years ago, are good stunts and good music, have ingredients you expect to include water, bombs, trolleys ... In addition to the first episode (with Ralph Faulkner), the game of sword does not was almost as good as I remembered, and yes, he presents the inevitable flashback episode! She gets 8 out of 10 because she still suffers from slow rhythm, stuffing and other tricks If you are interested in these series, recommends you William Witney's book, "In a door, in a fight, in a door, in a chase," though there is only a small entry about this series in it.
