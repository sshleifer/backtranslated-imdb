EDMUND LOWE (which somehow reminds me of Warren William), is waiting for a pleasant cast of a small interesting mystery that moves at a lively pace and runs just over an hour. Douglas Walton plays the unfortunate jockey that seems to have been intentional since his death (hypnotism, anyone?) And suspects include a good casting cast - all from Virginia Bruce, Kent Smith, Frieda Inescourt, Gene Lockhart, Jessie Ralph, Benita Hume, Rosalind Ivan and HB Warner. As an extra bonus, Nat Pendleton is a dimwit detective - and you also get an art deco decorated decoration load for the luxurious interiors of a rich home. It must have been a set that has been used in several subsequent films. In addition, the mystery is not so complicated that anyone can follow the plot with a reasonable assurance of not being too confused. Everything is clear to Detective Philo Vance - and then has a final confrontation with the killer who gives the movie a wonderful five minutes of endless suspense. Very well done and time passes in a fun way.
