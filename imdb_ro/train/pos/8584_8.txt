Sergeant Ryker is accused of being a traitor during the Korean War, a hanging offense. A long courtyard marshal during which Sgt. must remain in a military prison. After a lot of investigation, the defense attorney tries to exonerate those who are not commemorated with one hour's time. Very good image.
