Lupine goes to Morocco, seeking a legendary treasure. His only clue is an interesting gem that an old man gave her. It is a beautiful location for Lupine, the desert and that hot exotic feeling. One interesting thing about this film is that Jigen has a much smaller role than usual, generally being in a different place from Lupine. On the one hand, their classical dynamics are missed, but it is a change in rhythm. In addition, in this way, Lupine can focus on ladies ... Fujiko makes a point about it. Along the whole feature is seducing Lupine and new viewers. Then is Lara, the mother of this story, and she's pretty nice. This has more nudity than any other Lupine anime, which is a fun distinction to have. There is a very crazy effeminate ninja type who is the best villain in this case and of course he has some big fights with Goemon as well as some fun scenes with Fujiko. Inspector Zenigata, of course, is also on a warp road here in fine shape. Quite a lot, this is a smooth ride with Lupine. The plot is medium and there are some slow spots, but everything in this movie is a real pleasure. Enjoy.
