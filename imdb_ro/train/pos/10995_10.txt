I saw this movie at the theater when it first came out a few years ago and I really enjoyed it. But I still wanted to see it again this year to check if it's still good compared to the movies coming out now, and I mean it's one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life! !!!!!!!! !!!! <br /> <br /> What you need to know is that you do not have to miss a minute of this movie if you do not completely follow the action you will lose and you will not understand the end. <br /> <br /> The end is what makes this movie so good you can not wait. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the manufacturer!
