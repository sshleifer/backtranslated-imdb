This must be one of the most sincere and emotional boy-meets-girls ever made. While "Rebel Without Cause" and "Tell Anything" deliver beautiful portraits, these films take down unnecessary subplots and divergences from Hollywood. This film focuses exclusively on pursuing the flowering of a beautiful story. You never doubted for a moment that the movie will lead to the romantic mating of these two people. You almost immediately feel the synergy and chemistry between Jesse and Celine, and it's just the joy to watch them find her. This film is mostly all based on dialogue. But any conversation between them is very interesting. What makes this pair so romantic is how real it is. As in the whole conversation, although it often does not have any real influence on something critical, you can feel the nuances as they become better and confident in each other. This is exactly how you dream that you meet that particular person. And what makes it so real is that it's not too fantastic to believe. This could be what would happen if you were confident enough to have a conversation with the person you noticed somewhere at random. And what puts this film into play is the magnificent background of Vienna where this film takes place. It just adds to the romantic nirvana feeling that the film suggests. And no matter how many times I watch this movie, I do not think I'll ever get bored of it.
