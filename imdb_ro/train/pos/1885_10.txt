This was one of my favorite films for a long time. Recently I was happy to see it on DVD, which is a relief from tracking old fat VHS variants. I have not seen him for years and I looked today to watch how good the movie is getting on time. It is one of those rare and perfect comedy stories where great writing (the really funny line after a really funny line) is associated with excellent direction and remarkable performance at the same time. Dudley Moore received an Oscar nomination for "Arthur," but lost (though John Gielgud won for Best Supporting Actor). If Moore's performance in "Arthur" does not win an Oscar for the best actor - it's proof that no comedic actor could ever win the title (another example is Gene Wilder in Young Frankenstein). Steve Gordon artistically stunning the film with each character and the animated tone of the story. Pretty simple, IMHO is a rare piece of jewelry. It's only sad that Steve Gordon died just a year after Arthur was released. As far as the DVD is available since 1/2007, it is so. Although video quality is a leap over old VHS copies, there is not yet a widescreen version. The DVD has some extras that are nice, but not enough. An example is the director's comment, which shows how much he wanted a lot of deletions and scenes (because they were hysterical) but that he had to make difficult choices for a final editing. The DVD, being the perfect form to include such materials, should have also provided it the same. This original, "Arthur," is a classical comedy that is one for books.
