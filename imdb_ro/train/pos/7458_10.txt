This game is the bomb and this is the 007 game of the year and should be on the biggest hits. When I got Agent Under Fire, I thought it was a good game, but Nightfire came and it was better, but now there's a new type of James Bond game. This time is a 3rd person shooter and there are more than 12 missions, the graphics of the game are from this house. She has all the great actors and actresses in this game, such as Pierce Bronsan, like James Bond, William Dafoe as the villain Nikolai Diavolo and Judi Dench as M (forgive me if I write the wrong one). This game would be proper as the greatest James Bond game around. I gave this 10/10
