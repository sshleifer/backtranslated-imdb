This document really opened my eyes to what people outside the United States thought about the September 11 attacks. This film was expertly constructed and presents this disaster as more than an attack on the American Earth. The consequences of this disaster are predicted from many countries and different perspectives. I think this movie should be better distributed for this point. He also helps in the healing process to finally see something other than news about terrorist attacks. And some of the songs are actually funny but not abusive like that. This movie was highly recommended for me, and I passed the same feeling.
