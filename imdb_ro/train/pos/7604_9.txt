SERIES 1 While the United Kingdom is looking forward to the launch of the second series of the Lost, the first series (which has just ended here) has not disappointed. forty passengers are struggling to cope after their plane crashes into a deserted island. They pray for salvation. However, as the days turn into weeks and survivors explore the surrounding tropical rainforest, they begin to wonder if they are alone. Of course, the series has a difficult time to maintain the rhythm after the explosive pilot episodes, which casts a polar bear on the group, a huge beast and the opportunity of others on the island. However, the series manages to rise after a few episodes and is remarkable in the last episode. Perhaps the biggest thing about "lost" is that we visit each life of the character before the accident in a series of flashbacks. This gives us more understanding and, therefore, more suspense and excitement as events unfold. Ultimately, this show is a superb combination of drama, suspense and supernatural; is simply meaningless. SPOLES FOR SEASON 1 FOLLOW SERIES 2 After the cliffhanger, which was at the end of Series 1 of "Lost," Series 2 begins with our protagonists falling deep into the heart of the phenomenon that is Hatch. They discover a mysterious man who has a job to do. Meanwhile, Michael and Sawyer struggle to cope with the consequences of what happened in the cork. As the series progresses, viewers will not be able to close their television set because each episode in the series contains more twists than a Curly-Wurly chocolate bar, one of which introduces a lot of new characters. With every mystery solved with "Lost," five of the new ones seem to get out of the wood. After the overturning of the 974 series plot, finally, it seems that the viewer does not matter if survivors make it to the island. However, the end of the stunning series answers over half of these questions, despite its anti-climatic ending.
