I had a good joy to see this picture and I was surprised by its more erudite features. First of all, the film is undoubtedly made with cardboard sets, limited settings and creative scientific props. The action meets from the very poor (the two stripteases), barely professional (Herb Evers as a leader), Gothic overestimation (Leslie Daniels as assistant Kurt) first with Virginia Leith as the headless head victim in her life's will for the benefit of science and passions passionate about her fianc√©. The script is very good and the dialogue is fantastic for a movie of this film. Problems abound about the role of science and medicine in our lives and what limitations should be. This movie is a thinking film in many ways. However, do not be fooled by his real intention. It's a crazy story about a man obsessed with his fitness in medical science, who wants to unite his girlfriend's head with the perfect body, creating the perfect woman for a man with the best body and soul. Another very bright aspect of the film is saxophone music, which resonates strongly every time the doctor cleans the city for feminine beauties.
