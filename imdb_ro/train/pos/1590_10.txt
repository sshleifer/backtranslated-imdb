I just started to watch the TV series "What I Like You" and I have to say it's a joy to watch. I always like to see new performances doing good, since a lot of shows are deactivated before they have a real sense for them. I've watched Amanda Bynes since "All That" is really a funny girl, which is best about her comedy is so natural and what I mean about it is something a person there could be there my best friend saying I did not repeat. I just started looking at the show and I fell in love. I just look at the re-runs now, but I look forward to the next season. All the characters in the show give something to the whole story. I like to see an old face from other shows I enjoyed in the past, such as Jennie Garth from "90210", Leslie Grossman from "Popular" and Wesley Jonathan from "City Guys". The new character is very talented, Nick Zano has that charm that makes him love even when he does something wrong at Holly (Bynes). Generally, this show has the right ingredients to be successful, I look forward to watching it grow.
