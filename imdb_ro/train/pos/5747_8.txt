If you have any kind of heart and compassion for people, it's a tough movie to watch, at least in the second half of it. <br /> <br /> It's in that segment where we see a little boy beaten, and then a late man (mentally provoked) goes away after witnessing this brutal act against the child. It is not pleasant material. Still, it's a good movie, and acting is good. The story will stay with you for a while. "Dominick" is the mentally handicapped guy and is played by Tom Hulce. I think it might be Hulce's best role ever. He was taken care of by a medical student "Eugene" played by Ray Liotta, who became a star next year with Kevin Costner's "Field of Dreams". Dominick is a welcome man who reads "Hulk" and loves battles. He is the kind of "slow" guy you can not help but love and roots to live a happy life. When he is angry, for many good reasons and ... well, see the movie for the whole story. It's worth your time, but be prepared to go on an emotional roller coaster and be very angry at some things you see.
