The most recent way will never win over the main audience. It's a slow but fascinating film for those who are willing to go with him. An Australian property lawyer is asked to take the case of five aborigines accused of assassinating one of them. There will soon be all sorts of commands and humanities, because man's death involves a tribal problem that was not intended for the white man's court, and soon the lawyer has trouble distinguishing the reality of fantasy. It seems that the end of the world might be at hand and he and the Aborigines might know that, but no one else does. Richard Chamberlain, as a lawyer, is at the top here. David Guptil, a known face from several Australian movies and a decent actor, is one of the five aborigines in the process. The latest version is simply not for everyone, more than MAGNOLIA (both encounter strange things falling from the sky). Check him out on a slow Saturday night.
