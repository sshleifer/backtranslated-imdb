I really liked this Summerslam because of the arena, curtains and just the overall look was interesting for me for some reason. Anyway, this could have been one of Summerslam's best, if WWF did not have Lex Luger in the main event against Yokozuna now because it was good to have a great man and a strong man, but I'm glad the times, they changed. It was a terrible big event, like any match Luger is, is terrible. Other matches on the card were Razor Ramon vs. Ted Dibiase, Steiner Brothers vs. Heavenly Bodies, Shawn Michaels vs. Curt Hening, this was the event in which Shawn called the big monster of a Diesel guard, IRS vs. 1-2-3 Kid, Bret Hart takes Doink then takes Jerry Lawler and things with Harts and Lawler has always been very interesting, then Ludvig Borga destroyed Marty Jannetty, Undertaker took over Giant Gonzalez in another terrible match, The Smoking Gunns and Tatanka took Bam Bam Bigelow and Headshrinkers and Yokozuna defended the world title against Lex Luger, this game being boring and having a terrible ending. However it is worth 8/10
