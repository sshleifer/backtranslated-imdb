I think Charlotte Gainsbourg is one of the best performers in the world. I do not understand why some people say it is not. Boring....??? Perhaps the one who said it was boring is because it's boring. She is a great actress and the movie was great. He has a lot of wonderful ideas and very good performers. The direction was great. I imagined in the French environment with all the sophistication and perfume, the flowers, the churches, the problems, etc. When going to the sister's shop it's just amazing. Everything's great. We have a very good actress, wonderful, for a long time. Alain Chabat and Bernadette Lafont are perfect. I like more than the next film LA SCIENCE DES RÃŠVES. And Eric Lartigau did a very good job.
