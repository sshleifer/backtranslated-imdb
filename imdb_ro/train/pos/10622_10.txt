"One Minute Hate" is a beautiful movie. A psychological thriller that takes you on a journey through the nightmare that is the life of a serial killer, Eric Seaver. Strong performances and excellent cinema make this movie a must see for any movie student or horror fan. The reality of Eric's storyline and human part separates this film from other psycho-killer movies. Some cries to filmmaker Bruce Campbell, as well as "The Evil Dead," add humor to anyone who knows the genre.
