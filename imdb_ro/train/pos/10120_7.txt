The film starts out as something less hyper-kinetic, more passionate Dead or Alive: strange underground activities are done while bodies are discovered by police officers. But when a police officer is killed, a Tatsuhito gets involved ... and when he discovers that his brother Shihito is also involved, things get bloody pretty soon. An earlier work by Miike's Society, Shinjuku Triad Society, is still full of its usual habits of ultraviolet sex and sadistic sex, although it is not one of its more eclectic or more beautiful pieces. Rather, it is a bit quite well created by pulp fiction as Tatsuhito cuts his way through the underground, a labyrinth that leads him to a triad homosexual leader who sells organically obtained organs from Taiwan and keeps almost a brothel of young boys especially the character that kills the cop at first). Tatsuhito's brother is involved in that society, so Tatsuhito himself is forced to become a dirty policeman and uses similar violent and sadistic tactics to penetrate into this sordid sphere. What is particularly interesting about this little thing is the relationship Tatsuhito has with his nemesis, Wang. Tatsuhito is a Japanese born in China, later moved to Japan and estranged for him. Wang is a Chinese who felt alienated in China, murdered his father and developed a crime wing in Japan. Wang is also a surprisingly shakespearian character, which is quite strange as such, much less that you start to feel sorry for him when his final ending with Tatsuhito appears. And Tatsuhito himself is a similar and tragic figure when he is forced to struggle with the lack of ability to control his brother. While it is rude to say that Miike's films are successful, especially on the basis of their shock value, it is true that sometimes it's easy to lose how well Miike can create bitter and dispassionate characters. -PolarisDiB
