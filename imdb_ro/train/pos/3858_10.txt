The directors of Paul Verhoeven's American vehicles are of varied quality, but most of the films he made in his home country are incontrovertible masterpieces. This is the story of an alcoholic writer (and bi-sexual) who moves with a beautiful and very strange beautiful woman. But the lady does not know that he is only interested in meeting his beloved male male. Meanwhile, the writer is affected by strange visions - at first they appear to be hallucinations triggered by alcohol abuse, but soon he begins to realize he is actually faced with some kind of premonition. Fascinating thriller Hitchcockian, very original and provocative. I like movies that make you think I'm about something, but then you realize that I'm about something completely different. This is one of those movies; a thriller in the first half and a quasi-religious surrealistic saga in the second half. Very erotic, original and blasphemous, not for children or people going to church every Sunday. Great cinematography of the future director, Jan de Bont. Highly recommended!
