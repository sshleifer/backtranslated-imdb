Have you ever had or had a pet that was with you through thick and thin, that you would have lost without and who you love no matter what? Betcha never thought I felt the same about you! <br /> <br /> Lovely, wonderful family movie. If you have a soft place for animals, this is guaranteed to make you cry no matter your age. I watched this movie all the time when I was young and I learned that now, at the age of sixteen, I like so much then. I could never decide a favorite character and I still do not think I can! I love all three animals. The dialogue seems very real and comfortable, as a loving but frightening family. I like Chance and how he says he has a family at the end. Brice, yes, but we have to remember that this is a family film and that it perfectly fulfills this role. Sassy has just the perfect "sassiness" dose, and Shadow is the perfect model / model for charming, adventurous chances. Animal mode highlights people, but of course most of the tear moments are to be had during an interaction with them (for example, saving Molly and the end). Not to mention the incredible soundtrack that gives each moment more emotion and an accompanying sense of swelling of the heart. I give this 9/10. To be compared with (and even rated better than) Cats and dogs and Babe.
