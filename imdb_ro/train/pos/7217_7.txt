Scene changes often have a major blame. They often appear as a movie movie was simply placed on the stage (Like "Night Mother"). Sidney Lumet's direction keeps the movie alive, which is particularly difficult because the picture did not give him any real challenge. However, it is good to look at what it is. The chemistry between Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve is pretty brilliant. The dynamics of their relationship is surprising. The dog is fantastic as always and Reeve gets one of his few chances to really act. I confess I've never seen Ira Levin's play, but I hear that Jay Presson Allen's adaptation is true. The script is incredibly complicated and keeps you guessing. "Deathtrap" is an enormously entertaining movie and is recommended for almost all fans of the scene and screen. 7.4 out of 10
