Although some may call it a "Cuban Cinema Paradiso," the movie is closer to a "How Green Was My Valley," a memory film that dies for lost innocence. The film avoids falling into a political party trap (Pro-Castro? Anti-Castro ?, focusing instead on the human fragility of the characters and the importance of the family.) Completed with good act, especially by Mexican actress Diana Bracho , who plays Keitel's wife, a masterpiece of classical movies from CASABLANCA to Chaplin's LIGHTS OF THE CITY, Gael Garcia Bernal plays a small, critical role in dramaturgy dramaturgy. in acting (remember THE ROOKIES?), plays a homeless bathroom that acts as a greek, gorgeous choir. It is a shame that this movie, originally titled DREAMING OF JULIA, was released in the United States by THINKfilm with the atrocious title of CUBAN BLOOD, which has nothing to do with the movie.
