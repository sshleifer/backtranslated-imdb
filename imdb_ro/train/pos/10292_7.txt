Let me start by saying that I'm a big fan of Carrey. Although I admit that I did not see all of her movies * cough * magestic coughing *. Bruce Almighty was nice. None of the other reviews really went to what kind of cheesy it all comes to, I do not know what the writers were thinking. Somehow I could not help thinking that this movie was a poor attempt to re-create the Liar Liar. On a positive note, Steve Correl from The Daily Show is HILARIU and so is the rest of the cast. You see Bruce Almighty if you're a big fan of Jim Carrey or if you just want to see a funny comedy, like a piano music.
