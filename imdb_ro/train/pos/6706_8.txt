I remember this show because it became a regular view on a Saturday night. Sabrina is a young girl who moves with her aunt who, as it turns out, is a witch and she is one. So, Sabrina has to learn how to control the powers of the hr and use them efficiently. She also has to deal with school with a vicious rival named Libby, her best friend and boyfriend Harvey Kinkle ... The show was fun and fun. He held entertainment evenings for a 10-year-old boy on Saturday ... and made him laugh aloud ... And flirting with "Libby" ....
