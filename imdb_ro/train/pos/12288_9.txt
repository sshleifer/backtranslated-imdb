The House of Spirits is an exciting story of family intrigue, South American politics, and super-natural powers. Meryl Streep, Glenn Close and Jeremy Irons bring life to Isabel Allende with all his passion and suspense. This, in my opinion, is one of the best movies of the 1990s. Jeremy Irons, like Esteban Trueba, ages and softens very credibly, while Meryl Streep, in the role of Clara, keeps her mild, loving warmth in her relatively short life. Winona Ryder and Antonio Banderas make a beautiful couple fighting for family acceptance in a racist culture. Glenn Close, as Esteban's sister, offers very moving performance. Portugal's rural country is a reasonable substitute for a non-tropical country in Latin America. The settings of Clara's house and Esteban's farm are efficient, and while US cars add nice post-war atmosphere.
