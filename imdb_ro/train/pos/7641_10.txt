Everyone plays their role pretty well in this "beautiful little movie". Belushi gets the chance to live a part of his life differently but gets to realize that what he has is going to be as good or maybe even better. The film shows us that we should take advantage of the opportunities we have, not the ones we do not have or we can not have. If U can get this movie on video for about $ 10, it would be an investment!
