I have read most of the comments here. We have come to the conclusion that almost everyone agrees that 9/11 is a shocking history. There are some who think the added narrative is weak and agree that the narrative is feeble and useless. Approximately two brothers who were found back after the disaster and on the rock shoulder of Tony. But I do not think narrative is useless. Like many theorists, I think our lives are narratives. We live and do our autobiography. So if we say about our lives, it is always in the form of a narrative. We do not summarize facts such as: birth, childhood, high school, etc. Create a story about our lives. Because we are familiar with stories, we want to put history into a story and. Because in the form of a story we can identify. We can better understand the things that happened in history when it comes to a story. So, this is the purpose of adding a story to the documentary. The story is weak, so be it, but we understand what's going on. If I was there, I would worry about my brother. And the second, making a movie about this movie. True, he recently came to come with a great movie about September 11th. However, there were a few about the subject, but none like this documentary. But what happens if it's a movie in about five years? I agree that it is wrong to try to make a lot of money from 9/11. But I also agree that movies are one of the best ways to tell history. How many movies about World War II have we seen? If I had not seen these films, my vision of WW would have been totally different to me. I remember seeing the Schindlers list and wept an hour during the hours. Films give you a good picture of what has happened in history, and although it is a fiction, it helps to remember the disasters and the victims. So my point of view: the story is not always bad, it makes us identify with the story and makes us never forget what happened.
