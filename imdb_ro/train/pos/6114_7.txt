A very sweet film that has some resemblance to the hit "My Sassy Girl" in 2001, but is able to delight in most of the time. The greatest applause should be directed to the two rulers. Ha-Neul Kim is both sweet and weird, Sang-woo Kwon is appealing and rebellious. The chemistry between the two is very good. Kyeong-hyeong Kim's director uses some CG inserts to show the images and offers impressive battle scenes in which Sang-woo Kwon can shine. I liked it much more here than in the highly overvalued "high volcano". And the boy has a future - those glances, those fighting techniques and a romantic advantage. Not bad. I can make it short: beautiful movie. My rating: 7/10
