This must be one of the best comedies of television at this time. It takes the sweet-sweet idea of ​​a show that rotates around a close family and transforms it into a fairly realistic but funny picture of a typical family, supplemented by brothers and brothers, brethren, brothers, protectors and bimbo sisters. I'm almost surprised to be Disney! To figure out, "8 Simple Rules" knows it's a comedy and does not try to be more. Too many shows (for example, "Sister, Sister" and "Lizzie McGuire") believe only because their characters are now teenagers, then they should address social issues and lose their humor by being too hard. This is a "8 simple rules" trap avoided; dealing with certain issues (such as leaving the school), but they also have fun. In fact, the only time he was really serious was understood when he treated the tragic death of John Ritter and his character sensitively. And I think that although John Ritter will have been mistaken since the show's performance has made his mark, "8 simple rules" can do well if he remembers humor and does not make Cate's father a second version of Paul Hennessy .
