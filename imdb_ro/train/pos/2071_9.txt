For those of us Baby Boomers who arrived too late on stage to appreciate James Dean et. Martin Sheen showed us the Way in this extraordinary feature. The premise is quite easy: the chilled hood meets with the small city sheriff and All-Hell, but the walnuts and bolts of this film delight in everything. <br /> <br /> No, this is not Casablanca, nor is it a great literature, but it's a serious film about cars, rebellion and genius that's Martin Sheen. this and you appreciate it for what it is and for what will become Martin. I liked this movie that grew up as a teenager in the '70s, and you will be.
