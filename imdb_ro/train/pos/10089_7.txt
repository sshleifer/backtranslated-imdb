. . . or typing on a computer keyboard, it would probably give you a eponymous movie of a "10." After all, no elephant is shown to be killed during the movie; they are not even supposed to be injured. On the contrary, ELEPHANT WALK's master, John Wiley (Peter Finch) complains that he can not shoot any of the enclaves - no matter how threatening - without the government's permission (and his tone suggests that such permits are not within the realm of probability). In addition, the elements conspire - like an unusual drought and a human cholera epidemic - to leave the Wiley planting house, vulnerable to the total destruction by Elephant People (as locals) to close the story. If you happen to see the current EARTH edition, you will find that the people of Elephant are heading today less.
