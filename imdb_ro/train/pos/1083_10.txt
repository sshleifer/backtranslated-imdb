Another example of Cary Grant's unique talent. A performance worthy of Oscar, but once again avoided by the Academy. Mister. Grant runs ranging from stupidity to auction in this wonderful comedy about a man who decides to move out of the big city. The pitfalls of building a home are well-timed and have become the basis for Tom Hanks's most modern vehicle, The Money Pit. If you like a good old-fashioned comedy, no curse and free sex, this movie is a must see.
