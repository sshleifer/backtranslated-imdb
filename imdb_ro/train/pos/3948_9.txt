So finally I know there is. Together with other taxpayers in the UK, I saw this about what MUST have been just British screening in the 1970s. I remembered the title, but I did not get where I told the people. You scared me (that's 2 years), but when you go to bed with a cursed doom about your brain and listen all over for an imminent terror, then it's not a horror film CLASSIC TRUE? I barely remember the complexity of the film, but what I remember is my trembling flesh and high senses. Can anyone confirm my suspicions that it's black and white? Again, if someone has information about how to get a copy of this information, please contact ...
