I have very pleasant memories of this movie, as I have seen with my two youngest sisters when she first appeared in theater in 1977 and I was eight years old. It seems to have been a failure - and is now virtually forgotten (pan and scanning scanning video - which has never been right to the picture, or ambitious compositions of Panavision are now out of print). The film is very stylized (YELLOW SUBMARINE shades) and often uneven. Some of the characters and sequences are refined, while others are somewhat minor and unfounded. The camel blue shirt (Eeyore's nuances) and its blue song are truly unimaginable. Joe Raposo's songs are, for the most part, simply beautiful. Definitely a valuable curiosity, which probably (unfortunately) will fall into total obscurity.
