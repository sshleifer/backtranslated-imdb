Let's think of people, let go of the original, because it is time for the original Battlestar series to be a masterpiece, even with all the stars, lines of story and art. Lorne Greene was great because Adama and Richard Hatch were perfect as Apollo and Dirk Benedict were funny like Starbuck, but I dare say, not as beautiful as Katee as Starbuck. <br /> <br /> I liked the episode with Pegasus and Greetings on Earth was good John Calicos was great as Baltar, The War of the Gods, the best was Experiment in the Earth, I thought it was a tribute in a Heaven Can Wait way, then you had the women in Battlestar, do not compare them to tell them Tricia, which is particularly beautiful like Number Six, but Jane Seymour's beauty can not be compared. Not to mention Loerrta Spang that Cassiopea was fantastic. He had a beauty that a rainbow would be embarrassing to. I liked the original as much as the new one. Can you imagine if John Calicos had a six? :) <br /> <br /> Thank you for listening.
