Robert Mitchum plays Clint Tollinger in this short but tough western: Man with the gun. Tollinger is a professional tamer city - as in, when a city needs someone to save; he is the one who is brought to do it. Tollinger's latest concerts came as an accident: walking in the city in search of his former game, he stumbles into a town played as a puppet by a local Western gangster. But many people in the city start learning the day they hired Tollinger, because his way of cleaning the city is very taxed (suddenly High Plains Drifter seems less original). <br /> <br /> The gun man starts as a medium-hard medium film but begins to surprise you more and more as the movie progresses. What starts from watching and at the end of the morrow ends dark and centered on characters. The entire movie is very well shot and the distribution is very enjoyable. Mitchum is Man's The Gun's usual self, which is not one of his best performances, Mitchum still has a classical and effective presence with a high angle, and is trying to create action-packed scenes, the movie right in the park. Man with a gun is a beautiful Western Mitchum and deserves a little time.
