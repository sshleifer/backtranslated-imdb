First I was totally guarded by the initial lyricism of the movie and then I was completely excited about the story that was unfolding and was worried about the brilliant direction. The characters have been fully developed, no bigger than life, but, like the people we live anywhere in the world, in Sweden, in Turkey or in America, all human beings are completely credible with foibles and nobility. Hollywood could learn so much from this beautiful movie. This shows that you do not have to go into every detail behind every action that brings the whole clear and lighted theme that shows the brilliance of the director! Hearfelt thanks to Kay Pollak and the wonderful prize for this superb treatment!
