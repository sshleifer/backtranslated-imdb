But the rest of us who love a good sentimental and emotional story, which is a key to making you cry ... enjoy yourself! <br /> <br /> Tom Hulce is magnificent as Dominick, a slow mental trashman who loves his professional fight and his brother, Eugene, played by Ray Liotta, a doctor who has been working for a very long time. <br /> <br /> Due to Eugene's work schedule, Dominick is alone for a long time and tends to make appealing judgments. He really wants to be a good boy, do what he needs and make his brother proud of him. He stops in the church to pray at a time and express emotions so openly and character so well that you wept before the movie even started to become miserable. <br /> <br /> It's not about giving anything here, but the movie is extremely involved and sad and sad. Those who are not afraid of these things will have a field day with this beautiful story, loving characters and a great song I can not quote here that has nothing to do with the movie, but it is oddly appropriate. .. but you hear it in a bar. I think Tom Hulce will be nominated for this movie because it was for "Amadeus" I thought I could give him the inner path to win. There is no luck. Liotta is just as good, but it has less emotional impact, but later it does. All I can say about Jamie Lee Curtis is that she does not have much to do here, but it was nice for her to borrow her name in a little drama in Pittsburgh about two brothers you will never forget.
