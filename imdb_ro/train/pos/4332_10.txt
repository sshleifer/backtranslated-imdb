Paul Reiser did a spectacular job of writing this film. Peter Falk gives the performance of his life. He is an Oscar winner. This was one of the most painful and funny movies of the year. Reiser's landmark is fantastic and is as good as he was and was in his long-running sitcom "Mad About You". Peter Falk did a master job as his father, and Peter, 78 years ago, made us laugh and weep at the same time. Support support was equal to the pregnancy, especially the gorgeous superbe Elizabeth Perkins. It's a movie to be seen for the year 2005. I bet everyone in all ages and religions will love this movie and will somehow bind in one way or another. In the film we have mothers and fathers and brothers like these. We all had good and bad times and I wanted things to be the same but different.
