If there was a greater adjustment than this, you do not have to look for it; you will find everything even more in this almost perfect presentation of the masterpiece of Charlotte Brontë. I rarely saw a movie that would urge me to read the novel on which I am based, but I admit it here. Although I have not read Jane Eyre, I am convinced that I have lost very little in the path of dialogue and plot or of intensity and emotion. I just want to explore the novel because of the tremendous curiosities and emotions that this masterpiece has stirred up in me. I do not have to tell anything about the plot here. Let me just say this: if you are probably uncertain that you have to watch or read the beautiful story, which is Jane Eyre, I beg you to stop bending! Every atom of power and magic that grew Jane Eyre as a popular classical English literature was successfully captured in this film. What Brontë did not bring, Clarke and Dalton were able to translate into the spotlight with amazing intensity. The success of the film is undoubtedly due, in any way, to the lack of their sense of action. Love Jane Eyre or hate it, but appreciate the richness, vitality, truth of the story; I love the characters; I love actors; just as you love what's great in cinema.
