"Magic" is not a powerful word for the spell that this movie cuts. You find yourself relaxing and see others in a more benevolent light ... Any movie that has that civilization effect on viewers deserves special attention. We rarely are soaked in beauty like this. As if this was not enough, it is fun. The shows are, without exception, extraordinary, but the miraculous Miranda Richardson and the magnificent Josie Walker, both open as roses, must be remembered. Why is not this movie on DVD? It deserves to live forever.
