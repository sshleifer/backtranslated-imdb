I have not heard of Brashear before I look at it. This is his story and the one who coached him, helping him to become the first African-American American sailor. A story of will. The plot is well written and grows well throughout. This is what it seems, ordinary, and does not have many surprises. It's also quite Hollywood, but hey, I do not know the real man, maybe it's close to how it actually happened. However, this does the job with dramatic scenes and adversity along the way, and this is inspired for anyone who has ever heard the words "no, you can not" be told about their long-lasting dream. The acting performances are excellent. DeNiro and Gooding Jr. both shine whenever they're on the screen. Rapport is great as well. Characters are well written, credible and consistent. It is well-edited and has good cinema. Production values ​​are high, and this makes it quite a compelling job to carry us back in the 1950s. This is the only movie I've seen of this director and writer, though I can now think of more responsibility. There is a moderate limit of strong language, otherwise there is no offensive material. I recommend this to anyone who discovers the interesting topic and / or fans of those who did it. 7/10
