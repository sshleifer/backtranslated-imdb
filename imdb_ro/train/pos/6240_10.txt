How many days is one of the most accurate movies I've ever seen describing life in modern cities. It is very harsh and cruel at some points and unfortunately it is very close to reality. Isolation, despair, deep emotional deaths, problematic issues, perversion, complexity, insanity. All things present in today's major cities. It makes you realize again the pitiful state in which people led the society. <br /> <br /> The negative side of city life has never been so good on the screen. I just want to be a lie. Unfortunately, it is not. Therefore, ... 10/10.
