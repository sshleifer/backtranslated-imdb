I lived in Tokyo for 7 months. Knowing the reality of long train transports, bike rides from the train station, soup stands and other typical scenes illustrated so well, certainly added to my appreciation of this movie that I really liked. There are aspects of Japanese life in this live-colored film, but you do not have to speak Japanese to enjoy this movie. Suo's directors were mostly subtle; I found characterization of the Tamako Tamura character with a soft filter, making him sublime, a little controversial, but most of the directors' tricks were so blonde that I was fully cashed and just danced with his characters. Or shouted. Or he laughed aloud. Wonderful. A +.
