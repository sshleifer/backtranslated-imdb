I've seen this movie three times now, and every time I see it, it's getting more and more personal and emotional to watch. The actor is amazing, which is not hard to believe because Daniel Day Lewis is an amazing actor. Brenda Fricker is the amazing surprise in her. She surprises her heart as the mother of a physically disabled boy who is unable to walk or talk until he is in late teens. I can not say good things about the movie, but I'll stop here. I recommend it to everyone who enjoys movies based on real events or enjoying good dramas in general.
