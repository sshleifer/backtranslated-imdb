Of all the versions of the Odyssey (or of any Greek mythological stories), this is, in my opinion, the best of them. Almost true for the original story - with some minor deviations and omissions, the absence of Scylla & Charybdis and the fact that Eumaeus recognizes Odysseus in disguise in the hut - authentic reality, acting and decorations and costumes contribute to transforming this masterpiece into a true memorability, not in a sword and sandal sculpture Hollywood. Despite the fact that dialogue and subtitles are completely in Italian, if someone is familiar with the story, he can still make ends and tails of what happens and what the actors say (provided you have a good Odyssey at hand). At least I did so much to inspire me to study Italian to appreciate the film more.
