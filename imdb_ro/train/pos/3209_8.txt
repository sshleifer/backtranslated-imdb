An interesting mix of comments that would be hard to add something constructive. However, I will try. This was a very good action movie, with some big pieces. You will notice that I have specified the gender. I did not hit the lack of characterization and I did not beat the act. Enjoy what the world is, an action movie far above the media. I could go on, but I did my comment.
