I liked! Fred MacMurray is great in the role of Skid Johnson, a saxophone player who is in love, yet very vulnerable, who is in love with Maggie (Carole Lombard), who is always there for him. They meet in Panama after Maggie comes out of a ship and ends up in a bar with Anthony Quinn. Tony gets perforated in her nose, after her insults, that she thought of a free woman - just because she pulled her hat in public. Big joke and Maggie ends up blocked in Panama. Romance. Carole and Arthur are great together. Maggie is always there for him whenever he needs it. He urges them to go to NY where (look good at the movie and find out). They have these wonderful scenes together where they sing in their arms while interpreting the saxophone. I definitely recommend it.
