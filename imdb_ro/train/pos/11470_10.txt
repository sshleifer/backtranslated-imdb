Everyone knows about this Zero Day event. What I think this film did Elephant is not that they made us see how these guys were. They showed their lives for about a year. Throughout the movie we get to like it, laughing with them even if we know exactly what they will do. And that gives me the chills. Because I felt guilty to be content with their comments, and I thought Cal was a sweet guy. Even if I know what's going to happen, you know? Even at the end of the movie when they happened to commit suicide and just decide if they did it on number 3 or 4, I thought it was funny, but still I was terrified to see her head blown. Of course I was. She must like it. They were bad, maybe, but I felt they were normal guys, they did not realize that. But I knew I was. <br /> <br /> This is IMO, the main force of this film. It makes us realize that our friends, relatives or anyone can plan something crazy and we will not even notice it. This movie, as good as it was, made me feel bad. And that's why I can not sleep right now. There is still a small feeling in the stomach. Butterflies.
