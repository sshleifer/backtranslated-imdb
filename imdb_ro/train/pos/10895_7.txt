Surviving Christmas is a surprisingly funny film, especially given the bad publicity when it was launched for the first time. Ben Affleck is funny as an unpleasant millionaire who pays family to his childhood to be his family for Christmas. He then leads the mad family with overindulgence for Christmas cheerleaders. I have not been a fan of Ben Affleck in the past (although I liked Daredevil and Paycheck), but here he is well distributed in this role. I also love Christina Applegate as the family daughter who can not stand Affleck's character at first. Sure you can see where this movie is going, but you do not care. Ignore what critics say and rent this movie because it's more fun than lots of Christmas movies.
