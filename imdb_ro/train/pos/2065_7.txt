The fear of symmetry is a pleasant episode with a few mistakes. The first thing about this episode is that it takes place near the Force Base of the Southwest Idaho Air Force. Season 1 "Deep Throat" takes place near Ellens Air Base, also in southwest Idaho. I wonder if the bases of the air force are the same, but they decided to use the real name in the Fear of symmetry. Mulder and Scully have a good dialogue, always a plus. Ed Meecham, the zoo keeper, reminds me of old, elderly teachers. They probably loved the kids once, you can not imagine how. As if he had to take care of animals for a while. I liked the episode concept, but I felt it had some inconsistencies. If the aliens are so able to kidnap people and return them safely, why can not they put the animal back in the right place? And aliens now have problems with returning animals? I do not buy Mulder's theory about a problem with the space-time continuum. Like an expert in this. I also thought that Jayne Atkinson's performance as Willa Ambrose was not well done. Besides those nitrophores, I still enjoyed this episode because of the intriguing concept of extraterrestrials harvesting animal DNA as well as human DNA.
