I have not seen any of the Japanese films Grudge, but I really like it. I rarely got SCARED when I watch movies. I can jump if the effect and the sound are quite surprising, but being scared by a movie is a rare thing for me. But I was scared from Grudge. Maybe because I did not expect anything when I looked. I did not expect you to scare me. I did not know anything about it either. That was probably a good thing. This is a movie that apparently either loves or hates you. Most people seem to compare it with the Japanese films Grudge, but even if I have not seen them, I think it's not fair to compare a movie. This movie is on its own. The story is poor, most people say. I disagree. The story is minimalist and has been made in this way. The storytelling techniques used - the broken time, for example - are perfectly accomplished. The director knows exactly what he is doing and I think he got his vision as he wanted it to. I gave this movie 8 out of 10. It's a movie that you will enjoy watching or hating. It's as simple as that.
