I saw him on the Fidou's World Prize at the Toronto International Film Festival and I enjoyed it very much. Here we have a welcome review of a genre believed to have been a pioneer (certainly "accurately and successfully") by George Romero. But this is a Canadian movie by a Canadian director and it's a comedy! And, YES, I think it's better than "Shawn of the Dead". Things that are credible and, perhaps even more important, enjoyable by Dylan Baker, Carrie-Anne Moss and the young actor K'Sun Ray, who I suspect will see much more of the future features. However, I must confess that I enjoyed the most delicate twist of Tim Blake Nelson as Mr. Theopolis neighbor, who played essentially a volunteer animated version of Victor Van Dort from Corpse Bride (or , for those who have seen the movie, who has read even better here as Corpse Pride?) and, of course, the Scottish actor Billy Connolly in his least animated role, but somewhat in-depth, as a titular. Think, it would not have done this role unless it was Peter Stormare's commitment to Prison Break (as shown in questions and answers after Thursday night's screening). I can only speculate that scriptwriters must have inspired Zombie "Bub". I'm not interested in detailed details about the plot during a Comment and I will not start now. Suffice it to say that Fido is NOT one of those stupid, noisy movies that you can rely on from Romero. Rather it is a movie that will make you always laugh, and though (and I have to think carefully to be sure) there is a fair dose of swearing and violence, delicate humor so much improved by the surreal environment created by the director Currie and his co-scriptwriters, goes a long way to making this seem a feature that should be evaluated PG-13. I urge you to go see this little Canuck gem. I will definitely buy the DVD once it appears, hopefully, until the next summer.
