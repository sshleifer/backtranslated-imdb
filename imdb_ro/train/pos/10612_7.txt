It's cheese, it's creepy, it's rude, but it does so much fun. It's over top melodramatic moments that are simply ridiculous. This movie is great to have fun with. Rent her for a good laugh. The film focuses around three women reporters, while before the mobile phones. They go to a small town to cover a festival, but they can not get a room to stay at night. And then they meet Ernest Keller. She's creepy in a psychic way. And she offers them to let them stay at home. But he does not tell them the truth about who lives there. Stephen Furst's performance is so amazing as "The Unseen," that he really beats this movie. Most of the movie is a bit boring, though finding the truth of Ernest's family is a very interesting one. <br /> <br /> Just seeing this distribution in these scenes makes it worth a look. Barbara Bach and Doug Barr make beautiful candies for the eyes. <br /> <br /> Consider the film an old, hard-to-find jewel and worth a look.
