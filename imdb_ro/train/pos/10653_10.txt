I know it's now up to you to hate this movie. I've seen hundreds of spook films, including the 1963 Haunting original, as well as most of the Hammer films. This film is not restricted and does not stop at all, probably because many modern spectators seemed to dislike it. However, many viewers can accept movies like Scream because knife killers are easier to believe for most people than for demons or ghosts. In fact, this movie had many extraordinary scenes, and the effects of action and special effects were wonderful. I've seen it 15 times now and it improves every time. The director of this film made a series of interesting and stylish films and did not try for the type of realism of the sixth sense. Haunting goes away and is certainly not boring. Perhaps this film could appeal more to John Carpenter's fans, but rather a traditional plot structure. Haunting the old was also a wonderful movie from 1963. It was even more scary. See both the two, as well as The Innocents and The Legend of Hell House with Pamela Franklin.
