This is a movie I saw when it came out for the first time and I've seen it several times over the years. It is always enjoyable. One thing is that the comedy does not take away: it confuses the workforce and the capitalists equally. Only Sid appears out of classical struggle, even if he is responsible for it. <br /> <br /> Warning: Do not read any further if you have not seen the movie. This is a fantasy, though presented quite plausibly. Ask yourself: can someone support their weight in one piece of cloth? It would have cut almost any support. Also, when it is cornered in an alley, Sid uses a garbage that can cover like a knight's shield. Cute symbolism. One day, I'll see on DVD.
