I do not care how many bad reviews become violet rain, this movie rocks! Excellent film, it has everything, great music (Prince of gross!), Romanticism and drama. This is a very sad, very moving movie. I do not mean to say more, I will not give the plot, but I will say this - the film is very realistic, there are so many romantic relationships going through these issues, so many families similar to the ones described in the film. I think this is very realistic and is so real, it makes the movie move much more. My generation loved this growing film, so many of us loved the prince and we should not refer to any teenager who has gone through similar problems. That said, it's certainly not just a teenager film, Recommend it for all age groups. And it's not that dark, the movie has great music, performance scenes in the band and sexy funny scenes between Prince and Appelonia.
