I first saw this movie about 4 years ago and I was expecting something funny, similar to CB4. I was surprised. I was on the floor laughing the ass on this movie is so great. Better than CB4, the characters, the songs, the plot, everything. The first independent film that was given by "Two Thumbs UP" by Siskel and Egbert (and if two white boys can understand the humor in this movement, you know it's good).
