Antonioni watching another masterpiece hip, this time across the Atlantic, but "Blow Up". There was success with critics and young people as the former. Why? Maybe it was a European feel about America full of slime that did not work then and have not aged well. (Students revolutionaries are embarrassing at first.) Perhaps when they launched big blockbuster movies and those specifically targeting the youth market seem dated. Had it been released a year before, hipopo≈£ii of desserts would seem fresh ... It is a very interesting film, very nice shot some scenes bright and Antonioniene together like love in the desert, desert and silence mansion the explosive end ... that leaders were two amateurs have helped. They were beautiful but lacking experience. Mark Freshette is slightly better than Daria Halprin. It would be much better with the right actors! Maybe Michelle Phillips or a young Jessica Lange ... Dialogue is actually quite funny and poisonous at times, you would not know how the lines are delivered ... A very interesting document of the late 1960s definitely deserves a look for the photo and the soundtrack ....
