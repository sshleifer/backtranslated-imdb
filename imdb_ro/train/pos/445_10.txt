I first saw Enchanted April five years ago. I loved so much that my husband surprised me with a copy the next Christmas. It's about two women who decide to rent a castle in Italy in April, leaving behind their young life. There are very sad women at the start of the movie and you can not help hurt them as they plan to go with two other women they invite together to share their expenses. This is probably the best movie I've ever seen. It's simply without machine hunting, no animosities and no deaths. It was done carefully and with a very good taste. You can not smile all of them - except when you cry happy tears!
