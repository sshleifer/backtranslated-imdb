This is one of the most superficial episodes in which the plot really seemed like an excuse to have fun. BUT, I appreciated this easy approach and this is really one of the best episodes to be seen on a purely fun level. Think - crew members meet with the white rabbit and Alice from Wonderland, a Bengal tiger, a samurai warrior, a horse knight who kills McCoy and a series of other seemingly bizarre events that never make you feel all the way. Despite the whole danger, you can not take everything seriously - it's too fun and the whole episode seems very unreal. So, on a purely non-aesthetic level, it's a great thing.
