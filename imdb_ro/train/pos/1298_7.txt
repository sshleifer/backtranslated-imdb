A true anomaly in French cinema, this desperate work has no equivalent in contemporary production. One would rather look at Louis Malle's part, "I feu follet" (1963) (the inner fire), to find something that is not completely different. Harel's effort. Rare and cynical, after he lost all the illusions, the hero, a computer scientist, has no reason to live. Absolutely none. Removed by the human race, he seems to live his life as an entomologist, his colleagues. One of them draws his attention: Tisserand-JosÃ© Garcia plays the most bold part of the decade. Then Tisserand will become a kind of prey: his entire pessimism will move away from this poor man. the club culminates in the strange relationship: the hero tells the victim that his life will always be unsatisfied if not ... Well, now the movie has a more conventional toy to say (perhaps, for example, Clouzot's misanthropy), but only for a times. > <br /> The form is strange beyond the comment There is t wo voices-over, one for the narrator who always refers to the main character as "our hero", one for the hero mentioned above. The story takes place now in Paris, now in Rouen, the city of Guy de Maupassant. his hero says that the writer's madness was just the expression of his disgust for man, and he makes a parallel between his despair and that of Maupassant. This depressing film is only suitable for an informed audience. for very short snapshots of X-rated movies, but because, after watching it, you may feel in the dump.
