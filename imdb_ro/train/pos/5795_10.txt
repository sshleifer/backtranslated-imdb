This movie is my favorite all the time! You really have to see Michael Jackson in this wonderful movie! I'm always over the moon and I look! This is a movie you really need to see, too, if you are not a MJ fan, you are looking for this movie, like Captain EO, E.T. and Ghosts, a little bit of film and music history! This wonderful movie, Michael's Feathers, is a must! And: Smooth Criminal is really the most wonderful, exciting, and amazing song I've ever heard in my life! Thanks Michael for this movie and I love you! MJ is the best musician who has hit this planet, is a good man and always brings you glow in your eyes when you listen to his music! Please, if you do not know this movie, watch it and do not miss it, because it would be too bad for you if you missed it! Highly recommended film for every film lover -
