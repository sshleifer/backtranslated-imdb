I, Kasi Lemmings is definitely a beautiful woman. This movie is a lost jewel, a "mockumentary" death satire of the 1990 Hip Hop scene, when MC Hammer just started to fade that good night. We follow the three NWH members while embarking on their picaresque journey of wealth and fame. And just like Nickolas Nickleby, at the end, they finish their journey, not far from where they started, but at least a little wiser and much less naive. This is one of the best movies nobody ever heard of, but it's the kind of movie you love or hate, much like "Company Man" in this regard. I consider the film as the 1000 New York islands. It's a wonderful secret you want to keep alone.
