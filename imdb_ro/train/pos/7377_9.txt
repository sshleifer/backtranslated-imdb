this movie is practically impossible to describe. the alternative title "Do not Look Up" is more descriptive. Like most Japanese cinemas, the story is not as linear as the Americans. The story revolves around a director filming a story about a Ww2 deserter. The set is haunted (?) By an actress who died (?) While filming a TV show in the 1960s. the director is the only one to see this show. if you saw Ringu (director Hideo Nakata is the same) and liked it, you will like the ghost actress. I loved the ghost actress much more than the ringu. a truly scary and disturbing movie. a 10!
