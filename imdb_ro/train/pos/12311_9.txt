"Ghost Story in China" is one of the most amazing films in Hong Kong I've ever seen. It's a brilliant mixture of fantasy, comedy, romance, horror and martial arts. The film has some wonderful visions and amazing fights. the scene between Wu Ma and the demon tongue tree. Original and refreshing film and another fine recommendation by Embalmer.
