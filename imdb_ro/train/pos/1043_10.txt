Since I remember and are only 18 of my mother and I have been and continue to watch older movies because I find them much more enjoyable in the long run (but do not misunderstand me I like the movies we have today just not so much I love movies from the 1940s and '50s. Anyway, now I have to say when I started watching the movie, my eyes were stuck to the TV. Of course, my favorite character was Grandma played by Lucile Watson. But I liked how Betty Davis and her family were portrayed. Children ... did not behave as little children as possible. But there is a good reason for this, being forced to hide and lead more of your life, seeing the terrible things the children have seen those days have destroyed their innocence. So, people saying "Oooo I hated how the children acted ... bla bla bla" read between the lines and know they saw things that children should not see. Paul Lukas ... dear Paul has done an amazing job !!! Now I know many people are upset about going to Oscar, and Bogie did not, but they both did a stunning job, so I think he could have gone anyway. But Lukas's performance was so stunning that until the end of the movie I was reduced to tears. I loved this movie so much and I recommend it to everyone! :-D
