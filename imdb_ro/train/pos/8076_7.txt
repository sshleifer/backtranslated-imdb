The family has about two families that are after the blood of the other. Viren Sahay (Amitabh Bachchan) is an underworld of donkeys, operating from Bangkok. He has a family in India. Once she accidentally kills Shekhar (Akshay Kumar). Like Viren Sahay, he has a family (a brother, a wife and parents). Aryan (Aryan), Shekhar's brother must take revenge on his brother's death. He kidnaps Viren Sahay's family for the same reason. The film has a turning point (Amitabh Bachchan). The second half of the film belongs to him, where instead of his dialogues, expression matters more. Akshay's tiny role also put him on an equal footing with Amitabh. I did not understand what Bhumika Chawala does in this movie. In the scenario, there were some weak points; that; Amitabh was shown to be the city's most wanted killer, but he continues to travel to the city. The kidnapping of his family also seems vague. How can the family of such a great don do not have any security coverage?
