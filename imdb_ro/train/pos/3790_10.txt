I accidentally adjusted the independent movie channel and I was ripped. I'm a professional actor and I was amazed by the shows. They felt totally improvised, absolutely unimpaired. I could not tell if he was scripted or shot and waited all the time to see the credits and then spent half an hour on IMDb to find this movie. Do not miss. I see that the writer-director has also made a very beautiful film called The Daily People, which I liked very much. The shame of the film business is that these excellent projects do not receive the distribution and advertising they deserve and live under radar. This film deserves to be thrown up with pride and height. I urge people to look for him and look at him.
