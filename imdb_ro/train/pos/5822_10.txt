The Three Stoogi have always been some of the many actors I've ever loved. I like almost every one of the shorts they've done. I like all six of Stooges (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe and Curly Joe)! All shorts are hilarious and also play many other great actors and actresses, many of them in many shorts! In my opinion The Three Stooges is one of the biggest actors ever and is the funniest comedy team! <br /> <br /> This is a good Three Stooges short. It's funny and his cast includes Christine McIntyre, Symona Boniface, Gino Corrado, Fred Kelsey, Sam Flint, Chester Conklin, Theodore Lorch, Lynton Brent, Judy Malcolm, Vernon Dent, John Tyrrell, Heinie Conklin and Bess Flowers. Stooges played very well in this short! We recommend this!
