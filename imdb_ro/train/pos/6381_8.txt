"Atlantis" is a new and straightforward step for a Disney feature. It's a good choice to make a movie of such a mysterious legend as "Atlantis." I did not have any expectations for this movie, but after I watched it, I do not quite understand why this movie received so bad reviews. Even in my country, the reviewers were not positive. "Atlantis" is not a perfect film, but still one of the biggest Disney, I doubt this movie will ever have the reputation of "Disney Classic". Well, this is another case. It's fun to think that this SF movie was directed by the same directors as "Beauty and the Beast" and "Hunchback" (so Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale are trying to get rid of their reputation as monster movies, he, I joked) . Well, a lot of nonsense. "Atlantis" is a movie that can be watched, coming out and very enjoyable. Even this movie is an action feature rated by the PG, it is also suitable for children, in my opinion (parents who say the opposite does not kill me because he wrote it, he). the story is unpredictable, but it does not destroy the movie. Comic-inspired animation is right for the movie and the set is a departure from the usual Disney style. It's colorful, dark and detailed. The Deep Canvas sequences are pretty impressive. The movie is also funny sometimes, I even have more fun than laughing through the movie. (SPOILERS) The characters of this movie are also very nice, but unfortunately there is not enough time for everyone to know, so some characters are left behind (SPOILERS). James Newton Howard's score is absolutely awesome. It's bold and exotic. (SPOILER) The most impressive film about this movie is how they make Atlantean sound very natural, ethnic and authentic. It's very wonderful (SPOILERS OVER) The script is tight and well written, but there are still some unanswered questions in the story. Fortunately, there are not so many of them. So you're a self-esteem, do not listen to the reviewers and see "Atlantis", because it's waiting for you ...
