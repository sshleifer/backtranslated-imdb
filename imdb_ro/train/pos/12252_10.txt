I was very happy with this adaptation of "Emma". I have seen it several times and I always look forward to seeing it again. Although it takes only 107 minutes, most of the Roman plot and sub-plots have been developed in a satisfactory way. All the characters are well portrayed. Most dialogues come directly from the novel, with no foolish joke added to Emma Thompson's sense and sensitivity. As a stranger, I especially appreciate the perfect dictatorship of the actors. Set and costumes were beautiful. I think this version is quite similar to the 1995 Pride and Prejudice miniseries, but the producer and writer were the same. Kate Beckinsale did a very good job portraying "Emma," about which Jane Austen said he would create a heroine for anyone, but she would love her. She is snobbish, but she has just enough young people and lack of experience to be still enjoyable. Mark Strong was also very good at portraying Knightley, not an easy part, I think, though he does not have the charisma demonstrated by Mr. Colin Firth's Darcy in Pride and Prejudice. Even the final scene (the harvest festival), which does not happen in the novel, offers a perfect finish, unless it shows that Emma is cold and almost unpleasant with Frank Churchill, while in the novel he was reconciled with him, even telling her that she would have enjoyed duplicity if it were in his situation. A strange deviation of faithfulness shown differently throughout the movie. I think the costumes are more beautiful and elaborate than other adaptations of Jane Austen's novels.
