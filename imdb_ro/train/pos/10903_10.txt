This man has nothing amazing. You really feel like you've lived life with him in all these tragic events and crying with his family in the end. He was so passionate about his cause, not only himself, but to make sure that others who will survive must not go through this painful pain. I watch this video every time I have a bad day or "down" and always succeeds in making me see the biggest and brightest part of life, just like Jonny, even with his unbearable pain. My only regret is that I do not know earlier about Jonny when I visited England twice during her life and I could have said I met him. It is comforting to know that Jonny is sitting on the cloud, without pain! Rest in peace, dear Jonny. You deserve it!
