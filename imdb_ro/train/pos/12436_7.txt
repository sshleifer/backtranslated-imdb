I've been reading Blaise for many years now, collecting the tape numbers. After the fiasco movie, made many years ago, based on the first book "Modesty Blaise", I was surprised by the result of this. The director focused on history and psychology. How Modesta was created based on her own story and what parts of her life were affected by non-childhood. I think this will give a better understanding of the next film (I hope). I just loved the old-fashioned movies. Still, everything was not that good, gambling was not that good. almost boring and unreal. The act could have been improved too. I do not think the bad guy in this movie felt real, the only reason she was there was so modest that someone could tell her the story. They could also expand the movie by showing more about when they build the "Network," but I'll guess that for the next movie. And please forgive me for my bad English
