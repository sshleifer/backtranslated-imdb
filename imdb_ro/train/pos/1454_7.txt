I have waited a long time since I saw the trailer, which made it a political drama with three favorite actors; Al Pacino, John Cusack and Bridget Fonda. And even if it was directed by Harold Becker, who did some uneven work, he and Pacino combined in the SEA OF LOVE, which is one of their best works. But the interference at a certain level (for beginners, more scenarios in the original trailer do not appear in the movie) and the change of tone (the subsequent trailers make it a thriller) do so, while it can be watched nowhere were. <br /> <br /> Which is too bad, because I really wanted to like this movie. There was a great potential here to be a film about how the government can still deserve its credit despite corruption and make a comprehensive statement about corruption, not the common boys and the bad guys. And here it works well. Pacino and Cusack are both very good, and Danny Aiello gives one of the best performances in his career. But Fonda is wasted in her role, having nothing to do, and while she deserves the central story, when it turns into a thriller, the film loses its way, recovers on the final stage between Cusack and Pacino and then falls down completely in the end. I'd like to like more, but not.
