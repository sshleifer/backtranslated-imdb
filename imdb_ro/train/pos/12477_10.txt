My family and I have watched this movie many times over the years. It is clean, healthy, unimaginable and unimaginable. Showing us compassion between two families in two countries thousands of miles away and the strangest coincidence is almost as if God's hand had to intervene. 5 years old, Jodelle Micah Ferland playing Although the little girl has suffered a heart, she has a magnificent job to act, and for me it was Priam's choice for the lead role. <br /> <br /> In total, 10 out of 10. There are no disadvantages of this sweet human story. Children of all ages will have courage, then they will gladly follow this and bring the viewing family along with good smiles and feelings.
