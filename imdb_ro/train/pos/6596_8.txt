Brazilian films often receive more positive evaluations than they really deserve. Rather unbelievable, Contra Todos (against all) (the original title, which the producers threw: God Against All) achieved a very low level of GPA (Average Average Points) on this site. It seems to have been dismissed without a doubt by female viewers in general. In fact, it's not that brutal. That is, in terms of graphic violence. Its brutality is intrinsic, while it portrays it in the future, meaning underdeveloped citizens who in fact possess high-tech equipment that coldly executes crime orders in exchange for "grana gra√∫da". Is this post-modern man? Are they worried only by an extremely fast, almost impersonal laity in the middle of satiety tables? The picture is probably the best Brazilian movie since 2004, so far. His brilliant editing style at Godard, his strange soundtrack, his more than efficient distribution and, above all, the original narrative, with hidden hidden non-chronological dots that only appear in the epilogue, deserve at least 8 brand.
