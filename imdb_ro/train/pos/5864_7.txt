I did not like the pretentious and overestimated Revelation now. Probably my favorite movie in Vietnam is The Hunter Deer. Deer Hunter focused on one side of the war, then focused on lives before the war. This movie is basically Deer Hunter 2. The script is too weak compared to Deer Hunter. The story is never developed to the point where the audience can truly understand and feel the characters like Deerhunter. The Vietnam reports are not as tight or involved as those in Deerhunter. That's why I can only give this film 7 out of 10. However, I think the acting was remarkable. DeNiro and Harris are really amazing actors. They completely sank into their characters and expressed the great pain of two former friends who lost their best friend Bobby in battle. The character of Harris is a half-dead alcoholic who hides the guilt he has in losing his life trying to save him. Everyone in town is part of the movie. The city obviously can not handle the Vietnam veterans very well. Like many small towns, it's about being quiet, humble, and taking care of your business. The character of Harris, however, can not be any of these things. It's interesting how wars affect people. Some people are coming back quickly, while others never recover.
