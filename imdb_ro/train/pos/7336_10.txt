This is another fantasy favorite from Ralph Bakshi; after watching YouTube that it is. Established in the distant past after the Ice Age, it is a prehistoric search for sword and witchcraft between good and evil. Nekron, Lord of the kingdom of Ice, and his mother, Queen Juliana, set his eyes on the conquest of the known world. When the glaciers destroy a man's village called Larn, he (Larn) promises to avenge his people and kill the Lord of ice. Meanwhile, the submarine servants of Nekron and Juliana capture the suffocating daughter of King Jarol, Princess Teegra, of Firekeep; but he manages to escape and eventually meets Larn, who promises to escort her back to Firekeep; if sub-people do not find them first. This film made box office very little (as did most of Ralph Bakshi's films) but became a classic cult, partly for the quality of art, a collaboration between Ralph Bakshi and the famed fanciful artist Frank Frazetta. I also heard that the script was written by Gerry Conway and Roy Thomas, the two men who made Conan comic stories, and the background painters included James Gurney, the illustrator of the Dinotopia novels; although of course I have never read Conan or Dinotopia. And also painter Thomas Kinkade, noted for his paintings of art for figurines, music tapes for The Bradford Exchange Company. And like Bakshi's films, Lord of the Rings and American Pop, this movie was rotoscopic, but the process works better in this film than in the first film. Generally, I think it's one of the best animated fantasy movies ever made and a wonderful collaboration between two great minds - Ralph Bakshi and Frank Frazetta. With lots of fantasy, sexual innuendos and thrilling adventure.
