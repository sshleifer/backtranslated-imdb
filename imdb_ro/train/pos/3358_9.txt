First of all for this movie, I have just one word: "wow". Probably this is one of the best movies that touched me, from his story to his performances so wonderful played by Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni. I was very impressed with the last one, because it brought the character deep, because it was a very difficult part. Nevertheless, the pair formed a pair that surprised me from start to finish, pointing in the road, a loving friendship that develops throughout the day, set in the movie. The story takes time, because the introduction of the characters is long, but eventually we are compensated with a wonderful story about love and humanity. If you have the chance, see it, because it's a movie that will stay in mind for a long time. Simply amazing - 9/10.
