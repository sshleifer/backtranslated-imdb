A comedy that worked surprisingly well was the little British effort "Divorce Lady X (1938)". She marks the first pairing of Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon before that little film about the uncontrollable passion of English 19th-century English marauders. And while Olivier and Oberon are not particularly suited for the screw comedy, everything is flowing. Oberon is Leslie, a young woman who arrives at Logan's (Olivier) hotel suite, with a divorce lawyer's lawyer, through an ugly fog that hinders the trip. He does everything he can to irritate him - but in crazy way the movies go, he falls for it. And she falls for him. But a serious case of wrong identity appears when Oberon's "Lady X" (all that leaves Oliver in a note) is considered by Olivier to be a married woman. To make things worse and more fun, Lord Apple (Ralph Richardson) goes to Olivier who wants a divorce from his wife, whom Larry thinks must be Oberon! There is a beautiful dialogue about the fight between sexes and the fun exploration of sexual politics. You can see that Olivier is not too confident in comedy, but in the real Olivier is a perfect professional and offers. And he deals with twist and screw turns, perhaps not easily, but with taste. Oberon was not a very shocking actress, but she was usually competent enough, and despite the reproaches she expressed off the screen, she worked well with Olivier. This movie was filmed at the beginning of Technicolor, which seems very primitive today (everyone seems even whiter than Michael Jackson), but perhaps printing needs cleaning.
