In the areas where they overlap, this wonderful movie is a few years before the 2004 Innocence, which gave the impression of a rheumatic eye and a heavy breath that saw the young girls. Here the effect is more realistic and truly becomes inside the heads of the three protagonists, while they move through teenage teens. The three main characters, all unknown to me, offer very safe performances, the genre of fact, which can be so natural that it will be difficult for them to reproduce this quality by acting in other films, so I would not be too surprised if I am not heard again. It would be nice to move away from the Art and Multiplex Houses, where there is only an outside chance, that they could "speak" to the crowd they are not destined to.
