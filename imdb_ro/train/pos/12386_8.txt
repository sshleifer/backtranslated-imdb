'' The Sentinel '' is one of the best horror films already made in the movie industry! I think it's very scary because there are very few movies. Alison Parker is a model with a certain fame. She is dating a lawyer named Michael Lerman, and has her best friend, another model called Jennifer. Everything was great in her life until she decides to live alone for some time and rents a nice and old apartment. The problem is her neighbors, who are very, very strange. Suddenly, Alison begins to experience health problems and frequent leaks; She also remembers some painful facts about her past, which makes her have nightmares or illusions. But everything has a reason and is related to the new house he lives in ... I personally find "The Sentinel" a very creepy movie and along with "The Exorcist" "These are two of the most scary movies I've ever watched When we discover that Alison's house is occupied only by the priest and that my blood has frozen, it is also terrible to see that she must become pudgy at the end of the movie to be the new sentinel to keep the monsters away from our world.
