This is a fun FBI's "history", but it should be regarded as fiction, because that's exactly what it is. What else could be when J. Edgar Hoover personally approved and played a role in the production. James Stewart is as good as usual, and his support, except for Vera Miles, is good. Murray Hamilton is particularly good in supporting a Stewart's partner and best friend. The FBI performances that the film highlights are undoubtedly all true. What is significant is what is left. One of the most shameful parts of the film is the representation of John Dillinger's killing. She is portrayed quite as though it happened, but no mention is made of Melvin Purvis, the head of the Chicago Bureau who led the operation. Instead, the operation is described as if the Hardesty Chip fiction is running it. It was said that Hoover was jealous of the publicity Purvis had received after Dillinger's death; Purvis was later transferred to a remote outpost, and shortly thereafter he left the FBI. There is no doubt why Purvis has never been mentioned in the film. But this viewer, at least, stopped thinking that if Purvis was treated like this, what happens to all the agents who have run all the other operations described in the film. They were also completely ignored and replaced by Fictional Hardesty. The film is probably accurate in describing the FBI's work until the end of the Second World War. However, after this point, the film would make us believe that the only threat facing the US came from international communism, which is undoubtedly what Hoover thought. You do not mind the mafia. Do not worry about the linguists that were still in the south. It does not matter that the blacks were intimidated to prevent them from voting in much of the south. I do not know if the FBI started to intercept Martin Luther King when the movie was made, but if not, it was not long after it started. from the beginning, this is pretty good fun, but it should be seen as the health fiction that it is.
