WINCHESTER 73 is the story of a man (Jimmy Stewart), obsessed with getting his precious possession, a Winchester repeat. The weapon continues to change its hands, and Stewart keeps her fiercely. This 1950's Anthony Mann's effort from the B & W is more of a crime film than a traditional Western, and cowboys often look more like modern gangsters than old-fashioned cowboys. Shelley Winters plays a woman of dubious virtue who heads to a farm with a man (Charles Drake) that she can marry. She approaches Stewart, but not before she's around. Winters is the most complex character in a movie full of unusual characters. Watch for a young Dan Dureyea as a wicked killer and Tony Curtis in a very small role. A miser of Will Geer will play Wyatt Earp.
