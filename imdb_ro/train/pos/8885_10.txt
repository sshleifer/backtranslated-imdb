Sometimes you have to look back to go on. The 60s did this. We have to remember the past. The past is part of the future. <br /> <br /> Great mix of Gary J. Coppola. I see a wonderful future. You deserve to be nominated and win, the best mixer of the year 60. <br /> <br /> The best mini-series of all time. <br /> <br /> Thank Ursula <br /> <br />
