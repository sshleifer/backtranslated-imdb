1933 seemed a great year for satiri ("Duck Soup," for example) and this fits well, even if it is about obsession with the bridge. The tone is like a humorous piece from The New Yorker, because the movie starts with the magazine's "Goings On About Town" page. The only strange thing is pouring. A few years later, William Powell and Myrna Loy would have been perfect. However, after 1934, you would not have had the adultery manipulated in such a sophisticated fashion, young and beautiful Loretta Young, in some sneaky and slinky garments, or a group of prostitutes listening to a radio contest on bridges. Even if you do not know anything about the bridge, you probably want to see a rare example of satire in Hollywood.
