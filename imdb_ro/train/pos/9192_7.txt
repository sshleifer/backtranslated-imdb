Let's begin this review on a positive note - I am very happy that they did not decide to cope with Tony's shot and make a retrospective season like rumors. In fact, the creator and writer of this episode, David Chase, did the opposite. We do not know whether Tony will live or die. It has a coma and chances of recovery are very poor. This episode seemed to move very slowly, and the coma induced the dream in which Tony had the wrong identity, and the Asian monks who were spoiled by his hat was absolutely full, weird. After 45 minutes, I got sick of all the pain, but there should be no reason to defeat this episode. It was a strange and unpredictable episode, but it was still well written and intentional. Edie Falco gave a stunning career performance in this episode, while her conflict wife faces the death of her husband. I also found it interesting that AJ dropped out of school and swore a vendetta against Junior, which AJ probably would not have the balls to withdraw. Silvio is now the chief actress who opens many doors to problems in subsequent episodes. There have been many big tricks in this episode, and I think Vito "Pole-Smoker" Spadafore can meet his death if he continues to be a greedy SOB. This was not a big episode and disappointed just because, although Tony kills people, we, as a public, adore and feel he's our hero of the show. This was an episode of the series, even if it was a small snort that led to a conclusion. Kudos for the show of Edie Falco, and David Chase and the writers to create this complete overturning original and unpredictable plot. This is the only season of "Sopranos" where I have no idea where to go. I can not wait for the next week's episode. My Rating: 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> The best line of the episode: (Paulie to AJ): "Let's go, Van Helsing!"
