I definitely recommend reading the book before watching the movie. This book won the National Council Book Prize in 1978 and is a very compelling (not intentional) reading. It is not too hard to read for those who do not read it often so do not be afraid! The book seems to capture more the passion of relationships than the movie, and the movie will make more sense after reading the book. After I grew up in Melbourne, I could refer to this book and film. Few Australian writers have been around the 1970s, therefore, very few are documented about the way a woman lives in an urban city in Australia in this age or class. It's a precious piece of Melbourne history. It's a shame that it's documented as a 80-year soft porn film. It's far from that and, as the other reviewer mentioned, do not read the jacket of the DVD, it's not about the film. Those who rent the movie based on this description will be disappointed. Just remember that this movie was made in 1982, so do not expect the Hollywood drama that they seem to incorporate these days. That's what I like. It's also wonderful to see Noni Hazlehurst in this role, she's just fantastic as Nora and it's wonderful watching her really act, because if you're close to my age, you'll remember her best for stints on Playschool and Better Homes and Gardens. Who knew he hid this talent? This movie will give you a whole new impression about her. A classic Australian story!
