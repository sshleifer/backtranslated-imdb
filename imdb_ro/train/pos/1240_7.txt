Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell, a man who devotes his time to finding lost children. When the beautiful Kee Nang (Charlotte Lewis) enters her life, she tells him that he is the one to choose and has to find the Golden Child. Skeptical and driven only by appetite and intrigue, Jarrell gets involved without realizing he is about to embark on a fantastic journey, one that involves danger and the worst of all, the demon Sardo Numspa. the product of his time ?, by that I mean, was Eddie Murphy and the golden child's popularity at the end of the 1980s? Because I remember very much how much this movie played in that decade, the box office was $ 79,817,937, becoming the biggest winner in 1986, but in the 80's, comedy they had once. The Golden Child does not deal with the most accepted pictures of Murphy since the age of 80, such as Trading Places and Beverly Hills Cop, but after reviewing the recent personal film, I realized he contained Murphy at wisecracking, quipping and charming !, seriously! > <br /> Loading on a fantasy action formula that was revived and tempeted by Raiders Of The Ark Lost in 1981, the Golden Child hits all the necessary buttons like. Beautiful girl, a bold hero reluctant with a shot in his armor, a cute bastard {Charles Dance, so English I could kiss him}, a wonderful color and a cute little child with mystical powers, the movie you just ask you to get involved in the fun, not to dissect and digest your value as a fancy cranial image. Yes, the CGI demon seems to be screaming now and giving the genre had much better pictures in the 1980s, 90s and later, but really if you agree with the shameful rating of 5 here on this site, then it could to take this seriously, seriously. 7/10
