Unlike other comments, I discovered this fascinating film, even with all the mistakes and zombies that act on some actors. Being a technologist, I discovered that interesting experiments and realistic hardware. Though reading the mind of people through the computer sounds fantastic, experiments are now taking place to do this. I will note that these experiments are at a very early stage, with results that are not yet favorable. The characters in the film are well-spoken. The girl, though she is a little penetrated, looks right. The truck driver is a sound for real truck drivers. The minister questions in the beginning (the principal researcher tells the minister that he is not sure if he thinks that God created man or that man created God.) But when the chips are down, he returns to his beliefs Only the doctor plays the zombies Secrets they host are suitable for their characters In the face of death they react as real human beings The film is a warning against the danger of unlimited surveillance by the government. As a thriller, the film does not have enough emotions, being a scientific exercise with philosophical foundations, is fascinating.
