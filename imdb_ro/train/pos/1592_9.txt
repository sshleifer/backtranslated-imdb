"What I like for you" is certainly a show I could not wait to see every day. Amanda Bynes is such an excellent actress and I grew up watching her show: "Amanda Show". He's a very funny person and seems to be on the ground. "Holly" is an appealing person and has an "outside" personality. I liked how he always seemed to turn things around and head down, so he sometimes got confused. But that made the show so great. I especially loved the show when the character "Vince" appeared. Nick Zano is very hot and funny, as well as "Gary," Wesley Jonathan. The whole cast was great, each character had its own personality and charm. Jennie Garth, Allison Munn and Leslie Grossman were very interesting. I loved especially "Lauren"; it's the best! She helped make the extra funny show and you never know what she will do or say next! Overall the show is very nice, but the reason I did not give it a 10 was that there were no new episodes, and because the episodes could have been longer and deeper.
