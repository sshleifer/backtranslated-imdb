An unconventional historical drama with some beautiful scenes of battle. Tobey Maguire gives great performance and gets a good backup. The script is literary and quite original, and the film is kept merciless by heroes. That being said, it pulls a bit, and the last drum is too much like a mini-TV series. However, working with Frederick Elmes's room keeps one interested in the bored bit (and from time to time you see a blow that reminds you that he worked for David Lynch). Worth seeing.
