Claire Denis's debut is both courageous and sure. In this picture of life towards the end of the French colonialist Cameroon, she explores the relationship between black and white men and women. With the black minister "Prot√©e" as the main object of the film of desire and oppression, the film enters the taboo territory from the beginning. Denis builds a picture of life through a series of character relationships that keep the informed viewer fixed on the screen. The mood of the film is perfectly captured by room work and lack of illumination. A very good speech.
