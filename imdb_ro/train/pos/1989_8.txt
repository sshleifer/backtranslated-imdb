I admit I'm not so in love with Oliver! as a small child - is long, and the story moves a little because of the musical numbers. As a teenager I discovered that the fun of this film is the experience itself. Rather than think of this as an adaptation of Oliver Twist, think of it as a celebration of the classic story. Adaptation is free at best, but indeed, if you watch a musical, you are not there for the story. Music is the core of this film and its overwhelming majority is stellar and very appealing. Most or all of the cast has been involved in the stage version of the music, and this shows in their performances - and I consider this a plus. Performances are all in a more "scenic" style to act typical of many older movies and are very fun. The exception is the child who plays Oliver, whose job seemed to be nice and stay in the way of the interpreters. Fagin and Dodger are the real viewers of this film. Oliver Reed also does a fantastic thing, keeping an intimidating screen presence like Bill Sykes threatening. Even Sykes Bullseye's dog performs well. This movie is not for everyone. People who hate musicals will despise, as well as those who take music too seriously. Looking over bad historical details or exaggerated scene mistakes that act for bad action will ruin someone's joy. Stay calm and enjoy the fun - it's much better if you remember that as a musical it's a little fancy around the book, not a strict fit.
