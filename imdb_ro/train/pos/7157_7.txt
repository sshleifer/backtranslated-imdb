This movie is a fun, fun and quality film. The film follows the guidelines very cleverly in the book and tries to stay on the exact lines. The actors are all right and you expect them to be part. They use famous actors who have a great effect on the film. Graphics are a little overwhelming in some parts, and there are many mistakes throughout the movie. There is, for example, a yellow lizard. The camp is not as frightening as it was explained in the book, and they do not have the tendency to show camp trips, just as much as the book. His whole group is mentioned very much in the book, but it is not in the film. Generally, a great movie for a rainy afternoon
