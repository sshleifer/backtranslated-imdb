It's really true for the original manga with the same name, aka (Tramps Like Us in US), but it can be enjoyed even if you did not read the manga. It's a different queue, showing a strong and independent woman who hurts like everyone else. However, because of her external power, she is afraid to show her inner feelings and therefore allow those around her to hurt her with their awkward comments. The only one who really calculates it and who she can feel good about is her new pet ... human ... Momo. If you want something different from the dull things with some wonderful J-Dorama actors (Japanese drama), then it's sure to be the series you want to watch ... and read!
