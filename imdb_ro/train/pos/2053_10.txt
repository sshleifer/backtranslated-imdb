First of all, I would like to say this brutal film more than any of the recent crap that Hollywood has prepared from the gut. McBain is a true action movie, with more violence than most viewers can take. It has all the classic elements of an action film from the late 1980s / early 1990s ... random violence acts (for example, when Walken and the crew enter to deal with drug dealers to get money on who just showed and killed them rather than let them live and take their money), the throttling of the throat, the boys in the fire, the wounded boys on the buildings and, of course, the boys who are in the fire and who are torn from buildings. Walken is the best in this image, offering memorable lines like "let's go on deck". and others that make this movie a top buy-out of the rack from the local video store. if you have blood for unnecessary violent acts of violence, rent this movie today and satisfy your thirst.
