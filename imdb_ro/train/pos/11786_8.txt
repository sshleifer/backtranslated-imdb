This is almost typical of Lynch. However, what makes this movie something unusual for Lynch is that it looks very brutal, almost amateur. But I think Lynch does this in order to give a greater sense of realism, which serves to increase the intensity of surreal moments. However, there are plenty of typical Lynch motives, such as: Floating work room; haunting music; long (torturous) breaks; suspended curtains; the dimmed light darkens at a slow pace (almost indiscernible); extreme close ups; the themes of women in difficulty; who are confronted with characters who are distracted, temporarily blind, in the dark and so on ... Performances are wonderful and short is provocative. As usual, Lynch leaves almost everything to be interpreted. Many questions are left unanswered, and this ignites the imagination. Another brilliant effort from Lynch. I just hope she does some shorts, rather alongside the two PlayStation 2 ads. They were inspired.
