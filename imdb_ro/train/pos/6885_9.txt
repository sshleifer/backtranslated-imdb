He came by surprise. . .access and resolution that this film had on my way of being reactive to people and situations. The most vibrant was the agitation of the wrath of emotion. Just like the way he would be a spoiled child when he would react not to make his way. . ..... if you want. The thought of hiding this anger from the others was the most ridiculous freak of all. What does that cost me? Love a lot of love. . of many blessings. Now I am at how incredibly humiliating I feel and having a continuous attitude of gratitude for life. . for what is happening at that moment, without my wild expectations for life being a particular way, the way I think life or people should be. This movie has contributed to the freedom I now feel connected with others without limits and expectations. . and to connect with genuine love. . without fear of loss. . to first love and accept what is given love.
