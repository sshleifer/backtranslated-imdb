This is one of my favorites. Great music and funny bits. Every time I laugh at Millie, the maids are pretending to be a dabbling, keeping their thin clothes as they talk and wandering away the furniture with her while she talks. I can never pass the past of her French accent that is never a problem as they try to give it up as the boss's daughter. Seeing a teenager Mel Torme and very young singer Frank Sinatra is such a treatment. My mom saw Frank Sinatra in a theater about the same time that this movie came out. She said I can not delete the "bobby-soxers" between the movies (in those days you did not have to go between performances). This movie shows you how attractive and appealing the young Frank was and allows you to appreciate his early talent as well. And Victor Borge gets a bit of his routine, which is a bonus. <br /> <br /> This is a fun movie with a sweet and simple story. Very pleasant.
