Someone noticed that James Earl Jones is the waiter who serves when Hagarty's wife reveals she is pregnant while at the restaurant next to the lake. I watched this movie on a video I recorded on TV. When I looked at this scene, I thought I recognized Jones' voice when the "waiter" laughed at the end. I rewrapped the tape, then slowly walked through that side when the camera pulled back and showed the waiter. Listen carefully to how the waiter laughs when Hagarty looks up and tells him they will have a baby, then follow closely or slow the scene when the camera shows the waiter, though fast.
