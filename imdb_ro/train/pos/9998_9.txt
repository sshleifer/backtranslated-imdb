Seeing that the average vote was low, and the fact that the video store clerk thought it was "just OK," I did not expect much when I was renting this movie. But contrary to the above, I really enjoyed it. This is a charming movie. I did not have to grow up, I enjoyed it from the beginning. Mel Brooks offers extraordinary performance as the main character, I think he is something different from his regular character in his films. There are not many knock-out jokes or something like that, but there are some pretty hilarious scenes, and this is generally a very enjoyable and very easy to watch. Highly recommended.
