I got this movie about a month ago and now I'm a fan of Drew Barrymore. I love a happy ending and this movie offers a brilliant picture of Red Sox's truths inside! This is a math teacher who takes some promising children on a math trip to a company where successful Lindsey (Drew) shows them some information. This leads to Ben (professor) and Lindsey. But it's not easy when he confesses he's a massive Red Sox fan. <br /> <br /> First of all things are fine, but then his baseball gets into the way of Lindsey's life. Everything is fine in the end and it took only one shot to get Drew to pass! I took it for two pounds in the Blockbusters, so I was happy. If you like movies like this, I suggest you see more of Drew's work as Charlie's Angels and 50 meetings or even his new film with Hugh Grant in music and lyrics.
