Ah, a Kelly / Sinatra musical. So familiar, right? Yes, but this is not the one you usually hear. In this city-a-way. But if you stay around, you could learn something. Okay, probably not. Anyway, Anchors Aweigh tells the story of two sailors on a three or four day vacation. Joe is "Sea Wolf," and Clarence, the type of book, begs Joe to make him a "lady." Now, after being taken by the coppers, they have arrived a little at home at Donald. There they meet Susie, that temptation, with the bottle. Just kidding! Clarence falls in love with her. At least he thinks he does. Is right? Or is he a madman? Or is it simply deceived by society? Find out all this even more when watching {trumpet fanfare} ANCHORS AWEIGH! <br /> <br /> If you want to see Kathryn Grayson be something sweet, try Kiss Me Kate (1953).
