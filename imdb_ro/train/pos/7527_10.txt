More of a snapshot of the most popular film of all time than your usual biopic, this fun and fabulous film has the look and erection of the era with an excellent soundtrack and everything you want in an indie movie. I think the trend would be to wear Bettie Page like a kind of sex vixen like Jayne Mansfield. But if you looked closely at Bettie's positions, she was always happy. It's not "a desire you could get with me", and "I'm just doing this because my actor's career did not work," the look of a porn star. And so the ladies involved in this film (three female producers, a writer / director, female co-writer and the wonderful Gretchen Mol, who are sure to have helped shape this role with his sweet influence) captured the idea of ​​a cute, somewhat naive, southern girl who really enjoys her photo and hopes a good JC would not be too angry with her. <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mol shows you a career performance (she can only have the most perfect breasts ever), which I'm glad because she had the curse. A few years ago she made the Vanity Fair cover, when no one knew who she was, pulling her like the next girl. And to be honest, it was a little sinful. I mean, unfortunately, he never got to Gwyneth's status, though not for lack of talent. Making some poor film choices when you're a beautiful blonde in Hollywood, you're afraid to look. If this does not put her back on the A list, I'm gonna be an uncle of a monkey. Intimate private, Bettie herself has not seen the movie yet. Bettie left the pine party on a high note and fell in love with her old flame, Jesus. No matter what your honey boat is floating. You were a helluva woman. I hope you are happy wherever you are. Congratulations Mary Harron, you have made our idolatry of worship.
