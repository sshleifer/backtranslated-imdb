I entered this movie without knowing anything about it and I got to enjoy it. Lack of authenticity and credibility - Some of the things the characters have said and made were completely bizarre and a lot of script seemed to be ad libitum (maybe it's typical of Woody Allen, Excuse my ignorance) , but the whole audience in the theater laughed so loudly. It was not even the jokes of the film itself, but the whole movie itself. The act reminded me of Seinfeld's actor, where he tries not to laugh at his jokes - they are horns, but if you do not take the movie seriously, you can truly appreciate the humor of the ACTORS, not the CHARACTERS. If you are looking for a random film and you like Woody Allen, I would certainly recommend!
