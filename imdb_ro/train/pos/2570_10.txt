Well, this is probably one of the best movies I've ever seen and I love so much that I've memorized most of the script (especially the scene in the storage unit when Jerry Lee breaks the wind) and even with the script I still want to see for Jerry Lee, that the German Shepherd is hysterical and is really tested to see who's smarter. The line of labels is also valid for you. Let's not talk about acting is great, though Christine Tucci sounds different in a whisper (Check out the CIS if you do not know what I mean). It's too bad that this movie contained only the problem with which Dooley and Jerry Lee had to work, it would have been bad enough to see the tricks that Zeus and Welles had in their sleeves.
