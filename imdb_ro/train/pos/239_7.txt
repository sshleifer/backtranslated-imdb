I saw this with my girlfriend at the time, and I can say I did not have the best time, especially because I did not know about Ned Kelly or his story. is a biopic, it is important to know at least what to expect from the character. I do not know if the way the events are said are true or if everything is fictitious. But the way Ned Kelly is portrayed as a hero and a fighter for justice makes me want to believe that everything is true. I do not think he was portrayed as a killer or thief, but that's just my opinion. This is a solid Western film for everyone's tastes. Heath Ledger is great as always and Naomi Watts sexy delights the screen. Give this movie a chance if it's on the cable. Otherwise, I do not think I could recommend it.
