This photograph was forbidden in the 1930s American film houses due to the nudity of Hedy Lamarr (Eva Hermann), which caused all kinds of problems among ladies in the 1930s, but not so much for the male population. This story relates to a young woman named Eva Hermann, who marries an older man and is sent over the threshold of the wedding night, and the husband never consumes marriage and worries about all sorts of very small things, such as his shoes and killing bugs. Eva comes out of her husband's house and lives with her father and tries to explain the situation to her. On a hot summer day, Eva takes a ride on her horse and decides to swim naked in a forest lake. The horse runs away and goes after him and is spotted by a young man who finds his clothes and returns them to Eve. These two people become very familiar and there is a love story that begins to flourish. There are many more interesting issues that come up when you watch this movie by the end of it. Enjoy a great classic movie that was the Shocker movie in 1933. Enjoy.
