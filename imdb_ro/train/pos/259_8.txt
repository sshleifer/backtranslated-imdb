For a Danish film, I have to say that this is a very good movie. It is in its own class, yet it has an international potential. <br /> <br /> The film has a big budget and it has famous Danish actors and some newcomers who play very well. Can be watched by anyone who likes adventures and a bit of "ghost" movie. Do not be afraid, be excited!
