I like how this game can make you literally jump from your chair while you play it. The way the screen jumps and blinks when hit, very realistic while, at the same time, you have to remember that it is just a game and not really there. The sound effects and the sound are amazing. There are a lot of different weapons and spells to throw and you can even choose which spells to make it stronger or not. You will get this stone that can defeat your enemies while recovering your hand to beat your enemies with more magic. The best part is that all the time you play it, you are really nervous and afraid of what might hide around the next corner or what might bounce behind you. If you want to get the full experience, try playing it with headphones.
