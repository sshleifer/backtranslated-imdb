This is an absolutely charming movie, one of my favorite romantic comedies. It is extremely humorous and the distribution is wonderful. Although Laurence Olivier is largely associated with his Shakespearean work, he shows in this film that he is not limited to playing only classical theater. He administers the transition from a cynical divorce attorney, who tries to avoid women and his tragic ways, the puppy of love that falls for Lady X played by Merle Oberon effortlessly. Dialogue is wonderful wizarding and refreshing and charming atmosphere. Ralph Richardson was a pleasure to look at you too. I strongly recommend it.
