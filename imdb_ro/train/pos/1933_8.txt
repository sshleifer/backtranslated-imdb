This indie film looks at the life of a group of people who take an adult class in Connecticut. The plot is quite thin. What drives the film is the characters, played out of strange actors. Standouts in the distribution are Brewster as a high school teacher facing martial problems and Weixler as a casino dealer who lunar lightly as a striker. The two actresses perform natural performances and work well together. This is an impressive feature debut for writer Schechter and director Setton. The latter keeps the story in motion in a quick clip. The title and poster of the movie suggest something bad, but it's a great little comedy drama.
