Save and Bigardo's friend were at the edge of the law for most of their lives. We see them guided in a metro car, where their pitch to get donations is so lame, nobody gives them anything! Salva, who is a little hardcore killer, does not even have redeeming qualities, that is, until he discovers a real show on television that gives him the idea of ​​what he is about to do. Religion and spectacle prove to be a winning combination, something that Salva makes use of. He and Bigardo were in prison after the accidental death of a priest who was critical of the duo. Salva show that it is a natural show for reality show. It turns into a figure similar to Christ, which is instant success in the program. Espe, a woman who is not a stupid woman who is the producer of the show, can not escape the way Salva gives him unusual attention. Eventually, Salva is the victim of his own success in the end. Jordi Molla, whose first post director is this film, was successful in how the film satirizes the role of television. Spain, which has been vulnerable to these types of programs, has seen its bizarre side, what the director felt was an attack on the audience watched and wanted to set his story from the point of view of the people who make a fortune in the audience naive. The distribution of the ensemble has some good moments in the movie. Mister. Molla, like any actor who decides to straighten her first piece, would have been more effective concentrating on the image in front of the room. Candela Pena, a good actress, is one of the best reasons to watch the movie. Juan Carlos Villedo, David Gimenez Cacho, Franco Francescoantonio, Florinda Chico and the others responded well to the new director.
