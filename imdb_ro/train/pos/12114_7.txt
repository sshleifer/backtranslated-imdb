This film is obviously budgeted and filmed in British Columbia, Canada. Obstacles to overcome to make this film convincing (established in California and the 60-80s) were well-designed. I think this is the best and most accurate version of the Zodiac crimes that affected the Vallejo and the Bay area from 1968-19? (he was never caught). Edward James Olmos (Dave Toschi) and George Dzundza (Zodiac - at the time created by Arthur Leigh Allen after being released from DNA and fingerprints) play a cat and mouse game scenes together, each trying to trigger the other one, an emotional revelation. The dying man dying of a type of terminal disease and knowing that Dzundza did it, yet totally obsessed with the point of losing his family and becoming a breathing alcoholic along the way. totally forgotten and self-absorbed (like all serial killers) to the massacre left in his awakening. The only disappointment was "over the top" that ends otherwise quite accurate. If you're bored with the typical Hollywood whistle or you're interested in the Zodiac, check out.
