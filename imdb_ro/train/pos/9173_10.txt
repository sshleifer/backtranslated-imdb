I think this is a wonderful version, I came here before, to help me find the version I should use and went to Jane Eyre 1983 and read a comment from the user's comment and then helped me get this version. I do not regret to choose this version and you do not. I tried to look at all the other versions and none of them fit. There is nothing like the book, and TRUST ME if you read the book you want something that will match it. When you look for something real and moving after reading the book it's hard because you want something that will match it. I would say that God led me personally to this version. It indicates true love for a man. I would say that the love of God is greater. If it's better, I'd like to see. but so far there is no one like that!
