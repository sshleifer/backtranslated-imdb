Extremely tense thriller, seated in the urban chaos of São Paulo, the biggest and ugliest nightmare of the third world in the Brazilian city. To make it easier for anyone who is curious about this exciting and truly well-done film, has the Mexican "Amores Perros" character stones, with a character not far from Max Cady in both Cape Fears, though this is not , by any means, a film about a psychopath. Two partners (Alexandre Borges and Marco Ricca), in a construction company, pay agent Anisio (Miklos) a third party (and majority shareholder) in the construction equipment. Killing is accused by the city, but things start to look really gloomy when a great and charismatic nightmare Anisio decides he wants to be around partners so angry in murder, not only has he violated but rather deconstructed strict social codes which make up the Brazilian society. Anisio turns poverty into an attitude and wants to get in. The appearance is almost entirely portable, granular, remarkable performances throughout the year, especially as the first actor (and Brazilian classical Brazilian Tités), Paulo Miklos, dazzles and baffles the viewer with his social terror quite amusing. I saw the film at the film at Brasília Fest in November 2001. Since then she has done very well at Sundance and Berlin. Kleber Mendonça Filho
