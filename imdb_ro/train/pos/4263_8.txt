During a celebration of Kurt Weill in Brooklyn, where are we going from here? was eventually revealed for an examination. It is amazing that a cinematographic picture of any age that has Weill-Gershwin's collaboration may be missing from the screen. The score is high, and a CD of the material, with Gershwin and Weill, emphasizes only his merits, which are considerable. Yes, the movie has problems, but the score is not one of them. Ratoff is not in his element as the director of this musical fantasy, and Fred MacMurray can not understand the material. Then, the "modern" segment is poorly written. But the fantasy elements bear the film at a high level, just like the work of two lovely ladies - Joan Leslie and June Haver. Both have the charm that this type of work desperately needs to work. As a Second World War, we welcome the history of our country - although in a "never been" setting, the film has its place in the Hollywood musical history and should be available to everyone to see and find considerable merits.
