The actors play wonderful, especially Kenneth Branagh himself. It's good that Robin Williams received Osiric's comedy, otherwise it might be a bit strange to see him in such a production. It's great that Kenneth decided to use the most complete version of the text, this does not happen too often ... Thanks to this fact, viewers can see the whole, not the parts chosen by the director. Also - thank God that the film is in a classical form; NOT to surreal fantasies! Although "Tytus Andronicus" was impressive though, but Hamlet is a different story, at least that's my point of view.
