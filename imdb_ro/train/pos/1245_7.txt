Whenever I see the most reviews, it's called "Eddie Murphy's eruption." These critics want to take a look at some of the things they do in these days and maybe they can soften their position in retrospect ... "The Golden Child" is not fun, but thanks to some of the distribution, it breathes new life into old clich√© and gives Murphy one of the best roles. I do not understand the lack of "love" for his efforts at all. Perhaps it was released at a time when the unit became tired of adventurous adventures? Steven Spielberg started with Indiana Jones; it is unfair to make him a scapegoat when what he can do is his greatest sin is also absolutely harmless. There is nothing wrong with trying to capitalize on trends. Yes, he is really stupid, but even an occasional observer should understand that "ridiculous" is the place where Hollywood's mysticism begins and ends. What is more important than credibility with a story like this is that the audience has fun travel guides on hand to show their mysterious goals. Michael Ritchie and Eddie Murphy fit perfectly for this ability. My advice for you is to buy the ticket and drive.
