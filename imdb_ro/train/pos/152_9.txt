I saw yesterday "El Mar" and thought it was a great movie. It begins with a childhood episode in the life of the three main characters: Ramallo, Manuel Tur and Francisca. Then you jump over 10 years in a hospital where the three friends meet again. Religion, illness, love, violence and sexual anger throughout the filming and intense and tense film. > <br /> I see people complain that the movie is too bad and I think they missed the point in the story. It's a violent, intense and sad story. People are expected to suffer. To cry. To be hurt. To bleed. And I think what the film looks like is not made for pure shock or presented in a disastrous way. I know some people like "clean" movies, even violent ones. But sometimes a movie must make you feel uncomfortable working. This is one of those movies. And a great movie is. The only mistake I discovered was that there were 3 or 4 moments when some details about the plot were not 100% clear, and only after thinking about them at the end of the movie all made sense. But it was not much of a big deal for the whole story, so we still give this movie a 9.
