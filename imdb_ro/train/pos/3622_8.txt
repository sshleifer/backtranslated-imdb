I knew I'd see that when I first saw the preview. Dennis Quaid was a reason, but the theme of keeping your dreams is telling me. People talk about it as a children's movie, but I think it's a movie for kids who meet with aging, infected parents, our own mortality, our children growing up and going away, and all the other things I never thought it will happen to us. <br /> <br /> The film does not fall into the trap of tragedy; it is about what it means to live your dreams when you have a real life. <br /> <br /> Quaid is too small for a pitcher, but he makes it look good, and Rachel Griffiths makes a small part as the wife in a careful layered performance. Working with the room is slow and sweet. When they put together this film, they left everything that was not necessary. Very nice.
