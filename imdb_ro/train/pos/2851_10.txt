Japanese film indie with humor and philosophy, in which the three main characters literally run almost in the whole movie, watching each other for strange circumstances and a comic coincidence. While it is running, we see what happens in their minds and how they got where they are now. The act of running is a metaphor for these lucky people's lives. In a way, what they truly pursued is not what they initially pursued, but to understand in their lives and to get rid of their personal problems and their broken dreams. Running makes everyone feel really alive. The great life-changing adventure ends when it accidentally falls into the middle of something big, violent, and so absurd that it's funny in a clever way. One of my favorite films of all time by director Sabu genius.
