Saxophonist Ronnie Bowers (Dick Powell) wins a studio contract and goes to Hollywood. He stays at the Hollywwod Hotel (of course). At the same time, the great egoistic star Mona Marshall (Lola Lane) has a tantrum and refuses to attend the premiere of her new picture. In a panic, the studio hires Virginia (Rosemary Lane) to imitate her and bring Bowers to the premiere, not telling her he's not Marshall. Of course I fall in love. You can quite understand the rest of the plot. The land is old (to say nice), but Powell and Rosemary Lane make a very nice pair and have nice singing voices. The score is good (emphasized by "Hooray for Hollywood"), and director Busby Berkeley unveils unique visuals in a very entertaining musical sequence (with Edgar Kennedy making slow patented burning). Also, Glenda Farrell has some funny bits like Monas Jonesie's sister. Still the film is not that good. The rest of the ferocious casts and most of the humor is not just funny. Lola Lane is rather stupid, trying to play Mona for comedy. There is also racism - a stereotypical black maid is played for laughter and there is a real "racist" humor in one place. Probably this is the most of the TV. I realize it was accepted at that time, but it happens to be revolting today. Everything in such an appealing film, with some serious problems, helped by a good cast and a few great songs. I give her a 7.
