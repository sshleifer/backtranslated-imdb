Anyone who says pokemon is bad can die. This movie is superlative. I really gave a tear when she died of Celeb. I do not much CRY! This movie is an animated thriller. <br /> <br /> In this fourth installment of pokemon, Ash and friends must stop the evil revenge of making Celebe the weapon of evil evil with his dark ball. Over time, Sam and Celebei travel in time and are constantly hunted by game hunters. I love the side with the double battle and Sam has the golden horse (if you played gold, silver or crystal pokemon, you know what it is.) I also enjoyed having a miramax responsible instead of Warner Brothers. Putting the mini-movie at the end was a great idea. The Pokemon in this movie comes to life more than ever.
