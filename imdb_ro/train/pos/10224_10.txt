... and I mean. If not literally (after all, I have never seen a movie ever created!), At least, of course, among those I know. 5.3 ??? The normal rule with IMDb is the following: Sometimes highly ranked movies (for example, Kannes-Competition-Krowned-Korean-Kraap called "Oldboy") can be really bad. But rarely, a movie worth watching is actually rated under 6. This movie, really worth watching, is. An embarrassment. True, I give him a 10 in protest. The movie is not perfect. Its true rating should be 8 or 9. It has some defects that act (especially Belafonte), the script wanders around, sometimes. Nevertheless, what we have here is one of the greatest directors of all time, the Czech Jan Kadar, who directs two of the greatest actors of all time, his lover, Zero Mostel larger than the alive and the sublime Ida Kaminska in - a poetic / moral tour of force. A pair made in Heaven! It is true that this film, with little defects, does not depend on the average audience but on those interested in watching an excellent film (beyond criticism) of the incomparable director who gave us the "The Shop on Main Street" ever-Holocaust film) should not miss this just because a stupid IMDb rating system decides that "American Beauty" is better than "The Angel Levine."
