In this installment of the series, Edmund Blackadder is blocked during the Regency of Great Britain (during the last part of the reign of George III). This time, Blackadder's prospects are much poorer - instead of the royalty, he is a very, very thick minister, George IV (the regent price). Unlike George IV's historic history, it is as bright as a tomato, and as a result, Blackadder is able to take advantage of it and change its content. The only major difference in style between this and the previous one is that the series ends in a very, very, very different note - you just have to see it believe. Besides, all the elements of the usual story are there, and the show is hilarious. The only reservation I have (as always) is that this show is not suitable for children due to its crude language and adult situations.
