This movie captured my heart from the very beginning when I heard Quincy Jones' first notes or I saw the wonderful color of purple flowers in the meadows. This is really a movie to cry and die for ...! All the cast offers the best performance in a movie I've seen over the years, and Spielberg has really outgrown! Whippi Goldberg, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover, and others, all give us their best and you can feel it - almost touch it! Goldberg IS Celie, she gives her the feeling that insecurity and inferiority, which is necessary for character, and we grow with her, we grow stronger with her throughout the movie, and we triumph with her. Margaret Avery is wonderful as Shug Avery, even when she is the most arrogant to her, and shows us that "sinners" indeed "have souls too." Always sympathetic, charming Danny Glover does a great job of making people make him and magnificent music (I would say sir) Quincy Jones adds even more of the beauty to this splendid movie I hate! Photo, music, director and music make this movie beautiful, full of soul in a lifetime experience. You do not want to miss! "Sista" ... I remember my name ... "
