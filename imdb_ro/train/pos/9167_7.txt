This is, in my opinion, much better than any of the two versions of 1990, but it's not that good yet. It feels dated, probably because it is, but it rises well compared to other BBC 1980 pieces such as Mansfield Park and Abbey Northanger. The length of this adaptation allows a much better adaptation of the book than any of the 90's and St John Rivers is at least covered, though not very well. Timothy Dalton is very good as Rochester, but the actress who plays Jane is far too old. There is certainly a possibility for a TV adaptation of this length, which has more than a tenner spent on it.
