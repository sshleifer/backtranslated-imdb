This show will succeed because it addresses all adults no matter where they are in their relationship. Like a man married for 26 years, I feel the character of Patrick Warburton: he loves his wife, but he assumes that he knows that. I also enjoy my monotonous delivery; he is never too enthusiastic or too low. A nice set of characters. This will be a nice addition to the Monday night series. I do not know how David Spade will be in his role. Best enjoys in small doses. I also find it a little older to still be trolling for women. I liked the pilot and look forward to seeing the series unfold.
