Stay there for half an hour and watch a story, believing it all, then watch for another half an hour of the same story that does it all ... and then come back. Brilliant. One of the most exciting movies at the San Francisco International Film Festival is a documentary. I do not know whether, besides Andrew Jarecki's Capture the Friedmans, there has ever been something like "Anna Broinowski's forbidden lie". She presents, expounds, protects, reveals, and questions what Norma Khouri, the author of "Honor Lost," the best-selling best-seller in 2001 about honor crimes in Jordan. What is quite incredible and making the film so exceptional is that this "exposure" of Khouri is made with Khouri's full participation. For the first part of the film, Khouri presents her story about the alleged killing of a friend of hers in Amman, the story of the book. She is completely credible, convincing. Then her story is destroyed, exposed, by eminently credible and persuasive people, such as women's rights activists in Jordan, investigative reporters there and in Australia where Khouri lived a while. <br /> <br /> Khouri returns and denies the allegations by making a successful lie detection test in the process. Another segment of devastating exposures appears - not to be specified here because it would reduce the value of shock ... and then Khouri returns and faces the allegations (not all but the essentials in the book issue). /> <br /> And the Houdini act continues with a round after round in this difficult fight, surprise surprise - and there is no "happy ending" in the sense of resolution. Brilliant.
