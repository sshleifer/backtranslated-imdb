In addition to being a very fun movie, I can add that the costumes and the scenery were wonderful. This kind, a woman full of love, had a lot of money. Unfortunately, she also had two greedy daughters who were eager to take her hands on her money. This woman was alone since the death of her husband. He had proposed them in a theater to be broken. To prevent this, she bought it. Her daughters were afraid to throw their "money" and decided to take action. The characters in this movie were also a great addition. I would give almost anything to have a copy of this movie in my video library, but since she was never released. Sad.
