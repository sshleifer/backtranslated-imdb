Greetings again in the dark. How rare it is for a movie to examine the lost soul of people in pain. Adam Sandler plays Charlie, a man who lost his family in the tragedy of September 11, and has since lost his career, the reason for living and, of course, anger. Don Cheadle collaborates as Sandler's roommate, who seems to have the perfect life (which Sandler had before September 11). Of course, the parallels in these men's lives are obvious, but it's actually refreshing to see the feelings of men exposed in a movie ... feelings other than lust and revenge, that is. Watching the way that they help each other just because there is pain and heart. Writer / director Mike Binder ("The Upside of Anger" and Sandler's accountant in this movie) really brings a different look to the film. Some of the scenes do not work as well as others, but they are generally well written and pointed. Sandler and Cheadle are both excellent. Sandler's character reminds a bit of his good performance in "Punch Drunk Love," but it brings much more depth here. Cheadle is always good and does a nice job of expressing the burden he's wearing ... only if he's going to work a puzzle. Supporting work is excellent by Jada Pinkett Smith (as Cheadle's wife), Liv Tyler (as a very patient psychiatrist), Saffron Burrows (in an oddly appealing role), Donald Sutherland as an irritated judge and Melinda Dillon and Robert Klein in as Sandler's engineers. The film truly touches how the tragic events of that day have affected a man so deeply that he is virtually ruined. In addition to the exciting story and a few extraordinary photos of NYC, you have to love any movie that contains a voice from Chrissy Hynde, Bruce Springsteen and Roger Daltrey ... as well as Eddie Vedder, who plays Daltrey. It's not an optimistic movie, but it's a quality movie with an unusual story.
