It's a pretty good movie, but too Americanized in its predictability. Change Kung Fu for football and the Turkish family for a Pakistani group and watch Bend It Like Beckham (2002), almost scene for the scene. A beautiful feature is that the backbone of the film is the progress of mysterious ninja fights under the highway, starting with miserable losses and progressing slowly until the last fight is a victory against it, as Kung Fu has pointed out several times. At a different level, Danish life is revealed quite differently from the image it has to strangers: non-indigenous immigrants who represent a large proportion (in fact most of) Danish citizens, graffiti in the suburbs of Copenhagen, immigrant girl in begging of the film. All of them have a different picture from the one they have in mind when they hear the word Denmark.
