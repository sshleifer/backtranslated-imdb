I first saw this movie when I was 13 years old. She let me go then and, in many ways, still has it. But I'm less inclined to see it now as a precise historical piece. There is little precious effort to examine and interact with racism - and so fails to recognize that the most powerful anti-racism weapon is to understand it right in the midst of those who commit it. What we get in return is a dichotomy - on the one hand, beko and forest in the panoramic 3D vision of the rainbow - on the other hand, the two-dimensional characters are portrayed as a terrible evil evil. film story, but I worry that people see the portrait as "fair".
