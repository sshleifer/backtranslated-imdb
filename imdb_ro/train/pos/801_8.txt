I suppose JEDI is now chronologically considered the last entry into the popular saga and is very good, as well as many of them. I liked how fast this sequel followed, after HOPE FIGHTING BACK and I appreciated the maturity of Luke Skywalker as a character (and also Mark Hamill as an actor). After hearing so many negative things about Ewoki, they were not so bad. I loved the thrilling warmth of the forest and I felt that in this chapter there was a lot of well-done emotions. The end (with some new additions, I suppose?) Successfully blends all 6 chapters into a wonderful fantasy story. I know many Star Wars fans have forgotten George Lucas for the changes he made to the original films, but he was a novice relative to these films lately in life and did not miss what I did not already know, I think that he made these six films perfectly as a whole entity. Oh, and wrong - Carrie Fisher looked pretty delicious in her expensive outfit.
