I just saw this movie today with my children (son, 10 and daughter, 4.5) at the third Annual Private Film Festival Roger Ebert. After the film, children from the public had the right to ask questions to the director, Tian-Ming Wu. He (through a translator) has told several stories about his life and about making the film. All the touches aside, both of my children really enjoy this film. Of course, I had to paraphrase many of my daughter's subtitles, but much of the film is self-explanatory from a visual point of view. I will not give anything, but the conclusion is that this movie is so much better than 95% of Hollywood carp (especially children's films) there. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is a "real" / original king that can / could make 12 masks simultaneously. The actor in the movie learned and learned to make up to 4 masks at a time (then cut and changed to 4 new masks).
