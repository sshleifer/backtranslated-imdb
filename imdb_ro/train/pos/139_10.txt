First of all, Riget is great. A good comedy and a mystery thriller at the same time. A beautiful combination of strange style of "dogma" to tell the story along with good music and great actors. But, unfortunately, there is no "end". As far as I am concerned, it is unacceptable. I was thinking ... how would it be possible to continue the story without Helmer and Drusse? ... and I have an idea. I think Lars should make RIGET III a little different. I'm sure the third party without Helmer would not be the same. So here's my suggestion. Perhaps it can not be bad. I know Lars likes to experiment. So why not make small experiments with Riget3? I think the only solution here is to create doll-based animation (such as Trey Parker's "team America") or even 3D animation. I know it's not the same thing as the real actors, but in principle I think it could work ... only in this way it is possible to bring the actors alive. For Riget fans this should not be such a big difference - if the animation is done in a good way, the average observer will consider it normal after the first pictures of the film. The most important thing is now the story. It is completely understandable that it is not possible to create Riget 3 with today's actors. Why not play with the animation? And ... look for the possibilities that it offers you! Even a marketing one! The great director ends his trilogy after 10 years using puppet animation. Only dreams? I hope to see Riget 3 someday ... or even just to see the script. I'm curious how the story ends ... and as I expect - everybody here. Hello, slaj ps: I'm not talking about the "kingdom hospital" by Stephen King ;-)
