With all the inconveniences of "Adult" in today's family movies, it's nice to see one that you do not have to worry about, and you can just sit back and enjoy a family with your children. Yes, this movie may have some sworn words (there is a time when Knox swears, but does not let you hear the full words) but for the most part this movie is really as pure as they come (and this is included movies from the back during the day). Not only that, very enjoyable, one of my favorites, and just a great clean and fun movie to watch with family. The only thing I have against this movie is that it's too short and I'd like to be more of the memorable parts that are in it, I will not mention them because I do not want a spoiler here. All the best and a great movie to watch; so go out and take your kids, make some cookies and watch this movie!
