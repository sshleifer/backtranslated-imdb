This is an unusual movie in which the top-up star does not appear literally up to halfway. However, I was hired by Mrs. Ghost's hook. Curtis, although competent as a falsely accused, Scott Henderson, seems hard to be sympathetic to (probably should have his mustache), and his behavior when returning home should have been convince the police at least to some extent of his innocence. While another commentator had a problem with Franchot Tone like Jack Marlowe, I discovered that the portrait of his character is impressively complex. He is not a villain. Bishop Elisha Cook Jr. is again in the top form as a "small man with great ambitions". His drum in the musical numbers brought a welcome note of eroticism. This film, however, is borne by Ella Raines, very capable and enjoyable, because the devotee would have been Henderson's lover, Carol Richmond. She certainly has talent and her presence on the screen is in Lauren Bacall's tradition. This is the first of the works I've seen and I'm certainly inclined to see other roles. The rest of the casting is also more than competent. However, a very satisfying film mystery, which, seen today, completely conveys the dark and complex urban world to which it wishes. Recommended, 8/10.
