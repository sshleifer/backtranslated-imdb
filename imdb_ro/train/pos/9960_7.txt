I noticed that this movie was destroyed long before he hit the theaters and I have no big hopes for that. I thought it was another kind of movie "You did not serve," with some nice dance moves and a terrible adventure. I was at the theater and I decided between Meet the Spartans and I chose that. To my surprise, the act was not bad at all and the movie was actually pretty good. The fact that it has a rating inferior to the one you served is absolutely ridiculous. Instead of listening to the garbage posted here, I recommend you see a morning show of this movie so you do not spend too much. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised at how bad everyone was. When it comes to dance films, this is certainly one of the best, with much higher action than the other. Go see the movie and judge yourself. We hope the rating will increase after it appears on DVD and more people will check the movie instead of judging it on the basis of comments before the release of the movie. Edit The film is now approaching the correct assessment. More than 1,000 people gave him a rating of 9, a bit too high, but at least he helps to offset ridiculous votes of 1.
