A delicious Disney movie with Angela Lansbury in fine form as a middle-aged spinster whose interest turns into witchcraft in the Second World War. Lansbury was about 51 years old at the time of the film and is only ideal for the Party. She is again Jessica Fletcher, but this time it is for the benefit of her children and mother of England in a time of great danger. The film follows the adventures of Miss Price (Lansbury) and David Tomlinson as a witchcraft teacher in an attempt to obtain some information about witchcraft. The three little dears sent to live with Price to get rid of London bombings are just great in this enchanting film for all of us, regardless of age. Too bad that Tessie O'Shea, Roddy McDowall and Sam Jaffe are so little to do in this wonderful movie. I really thought of Ben Stiller's film "Night at the Museum" at the end of the movie when the relics come to life to fight the Nazi invasion in the small British coastal city.
