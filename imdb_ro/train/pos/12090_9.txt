I saw this movie when I was 10 or 11 years old, alone in my parent's basement on a Saturday night. It was featured on "The Chiller Theater", a common feature of fear that I saw religiously as a "one" young man. Now, I've seen many old horror movies thanks to Chiller Theater, but none has ever stayed with me like "Danse Macabre," also "The Blood Castle." I'm 51 years old and just last year I was fortunate enough to find a relatively recent, quality DVD of this supernatural classic that provokes tremendously, thinking that I will never ever see it again. I've followed her four times and can not seem tired of that. They just do not make spook movies like that. The haunted catacombs and thickened gravel cemeteries do not work as well as black and white that day. Anyway, it has Edgar Allen Poe and Barbara Steele, deliciously haunted castle sets with a humming wrapped, restless spirits reigning their dead ... and an endlessly ironic end. IMO, this is up there with "The Haunting," by Robert Wise, "The Innocents" (with Deborah Kerr), and the more recent "The Others".
