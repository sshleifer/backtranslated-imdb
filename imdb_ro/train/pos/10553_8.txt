... of this ;-) What would happen if Terry Gilliam and Douglas Adams had worked together on a movie? This film starts with a touch of Brazil ... when, at some point, the story goes straight to the crepuscular area ... it brings nothing new, but nothing ... and nothing is fun! When Dave and Andrew begin to explore their new environment, the movie really gets really nice ... the beaten head? well ... yes ;-) <br /> anyway ... this movie was, imho, the biggest surprise at FantasyFilmFest this year ... Like in Cube and Cypher Natali gave this design a design minimalist, weird, but very special, making it difficult to locate history or its time ... somewhat timeless ...
