We've found the FBI story a lot of fun and good for watching the New Year celebrations. His dramatic and action episodes were thrilling. Hardesty was well-drawn and admirable. Overall, photography, scenario and direction were perfectly credible. Rather than taking the film as a reproachful propaganda, as some did, I enjoyed it as a well-portraised motion of the need for ingenious minds and courageous bodies to fight crime. Again, the image of a family that held together, even under the tension of her husband's commitment to his important (important) work, did not find a twee representation but an ideal and exemplary one.
