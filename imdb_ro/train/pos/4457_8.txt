Yes, this is one of the great musical films I've brought up with as great artists as Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly, not to mention the wonderful and glorious voice of Kathryn Grayson. Music and dance are great. I understand that Frank took lessons from Kelly; and there is Kelly dancing with Jerry Mouse, which is quite unique for the time. Betty Garrett plays the waitress who falls in love with Sinatra. She is one of Hollywood's great sublime stars. I saw this again on A & E and I also have it in the old VCR cassettes. Never get tired of these old musicians. What happened to Hollywood?
