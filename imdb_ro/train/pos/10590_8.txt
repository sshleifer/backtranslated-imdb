This series was a cut above the rest of the TV detective series of the day, but somehow did not find an audience. The idea of ​​a blind detective can not be completely new, but has added so much to the story. And who could forget Pax, the beautiful driving dog in the series! While the stories themselves were not better than the average series, the settings in New Orleans, the actor and the music (I note the comment on the score of the music in the other comments ... I remember clearly) all the work to do a good TV series even better! Well, you never know ... one day Paramount might just dig into his archives and release it on DVD!
