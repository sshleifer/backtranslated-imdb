"Dance, Fools, Dance" is a Crawford-Gable vehicle early in 1931. Crawford plays a Bonnie Jordan, a wealthy woman whose lives consist of parties, drinks, and stripping clothes to jump out and swim. Everything ends when her father dies and leaves her and her brother (William Blakewell) without money. Bonnie gets a post on a newspaper named Mary Smith; her brother goes to work for bootleggers. The head man is Jake Luva - portrayed by Clark Gable, playing yet another crook. Later, of course, he will turn into a romantic hero, but in the early 1930s, MGM used him as a bad guy. She does not realize that her brother is involved in illegal activities, Bonnie cozies to Luva. Gable and Crawford made a great team. Her facial expressions are a bit on the wild side, but that, along with her dance, is one of the things that makes the movie fun. Look for Cliff Edwards, Jiminy Cricket's voice, like Bert. It's always exciting to see pre-made movies, and "Dance, Fools, Dance" is no exception.
