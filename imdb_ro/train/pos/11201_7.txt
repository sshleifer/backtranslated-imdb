Surprisingly good start from Alfred Hitchcock. One of the only original scenarios written by Hitchcock himself, this film features a remarkable story structure. Start with a boxing match where "One Round" carnival potato loses a challenger from the audience that happens to be a rewarding professional. The film then slows down to develop characters and introduce a love triangle between Jack, the girl and the professional boxer. The rest of the film is a dramatic accumulation of rematch between the two men, this time for the heavy crown. Even in this early film, Hitchcock demonstrates his talent for significant cinema and a proposed placement. A banderol bought for a boxer's girl continues to appear throughout the film as a symbol of her unbelief. The only detractor of this film is that the art of filming a boxing game has not yet been refined in 1927. Consequently, the final match has somewhat reached an anti-limbo. The story, however, is what drives this movie.
