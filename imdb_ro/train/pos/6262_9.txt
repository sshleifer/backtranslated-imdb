This was incredible, which meant it was hard to believe that the "forgotten tribe" would make this amazing migration twice a year, and that filmmakers Cooper and Schoedsack did not make some scenes and photos. But what are the fires! Cinema, under extreme extreme conditions, is brilliant, and the Iranian music score added to the video gives this memorable asset added wealth. I had the pleasure of seeing this and the "Kon Tiki" in the same weekend, which was an excitement and certainly made me see how hard and courageous and courageous it may be either for primitive survival, either for the adventure need or for science.
