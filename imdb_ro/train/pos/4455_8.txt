Although I liked the city better, I liked it a lot. I'm a new man when it comes to Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly. Although I have heard of them, I've never seen anything with them before. The first one I saw was Singin in the rain that made me a fan of Gene. I think it's even better. But I thought this movie was good and that all the movies are a few parts that are better than others, but in my book it's a great movie and I like it. Frank and Gene are doing a good team. I have to see them together. Take me to Ballgame. But I stand on my arms saying I liked it very much and I like it!
