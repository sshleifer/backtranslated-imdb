Beautiful and smart played by the two young girls, Mischa Barton as Frankie and Ingrid Uribe as Hazel, although the plot is rather a stretch of imagination. The young runner for the mayor does not seem to be the place to be sincere. While the actor is well done by all those interested, the film tends to lack a true atmosphere of drama. Perhaps we grew to expect reality in movies, rather than comparing Pollyanna to How Green Was My Valley! No matter, each of them is good in their own way. I admire Joan Plowright, even though her role is somewhat subject here. The middle of road fun is suitable for younger viewers and how beautiful it is sometimes to be exposed to classical music, which is almost a rarity! I think this movie is a welcome change, because it reflects more quietly, attentive values ​​for growing years and without violence thanks to goodness. A hot family movie to enjoy.
