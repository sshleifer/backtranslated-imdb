This movie is great! This movie is beautiful! Finally, a film portraying Muslims as PEOPLE without stereotypes here. This film is led by story, acting and, above all, by its theme, the affirmation and cultural discovery. They may seem clich√©, but they are not, at least not in this movie. The Grand Mosque in Mecca is absolutely amazing and the public is given a glimpse of a part of the Muslim world that is rarely ever presented in the West. Here people are cared for, supported, devoted, tolerant and devoted to each other. What a welcome and delayed departure from the negative portraits of the Arabs. Exceptional film.
