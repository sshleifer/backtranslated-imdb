Womans Waiting Ward of a large hospital, with all its joys and troubles, is where LIFE begins. This almost forgotten drama is a small soap opera full of comedy and tragedy, all related to the lives of maternity staff and patients. The sincerity with which the subject is treated indicates the state of the pre-code of the film. Marvelous Aline MacMahon, as the sympathetic head nurse, is the calm center of the film, the rock around which all the current flow. Capable of dealing with any crisis or emergencies, she is Mother's best, sometimes last, friend. MacMahon is surrounded by excellent costs: Loretta Young, a convicted offender released from prison long enough to give birth; Eric Linden as her frightened husband; brass Glenda Farrell as a mother who hates children; sweet Clara Blandick as a very mature mother in her sixth birth; Preston Foster & Hale Hamilton as grumpy, compassionate doctors and Frank McHugh as a comic frenzy. <br /> <br /> People in the movie will recognize Bobs Watson as a boy who wants to see the Stork; Paul Fix is ​​a nervous husband who promises to behave like a "little soldier"; Gilbert Roland, an uprooted Italian husband and Elizabeth Patterson, as a snooth doctor's wife interested in adopting Farrell's son - all unbelievable. There are some absurdities in the plot - some of the mothers are obviously too old; Farrell gets drunk in Ward, but none of the employees seem to notice; an obviously psychotic patient is able to wander at will - but this really improves the value of the strange entertainment of the movie and keeps things from becoming too serious.
