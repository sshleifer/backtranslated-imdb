I saw the first time he had the premiere more than ten years ago. I saw it again today and yet it had a big impact on me. The Singles fight is about a girl, Caitlin (played by Tiffani Thiessen), who is raped by Jace (played by David Lipper), a classmate who enjoys injured girls. Caitlin is in a popular high school clique, but when she reveals she is raped, the clique comes back against her, led by Ethan (played by Brian Austin Green). This chronicle fights Caitlin's fight against a whole city, including a high school that essentially allows athletes to determine the social environment, allowing them to escape with whatever they want. Thiessen and Green are the leading artists and there is real chemistry between the two throughout the film. All actors in this movie, inspired by real events, have done a great job. Combat Singles truly captures the essence of what it is like to be in high school (at least in 1995) and to have a self-image and self-reputation. Recommended. 10/10
