It's a story of the Siberian people from the beginning of the 20th century until the 1960s. It's about passion and feelings about the Russian soul and very romantic. This film is NOT packed in action, it flows slowly. In the second part there are great songs - romance. It's much better than Dr. Zhivago. The director of this film moved to America and made, for example, the Runaway train.
