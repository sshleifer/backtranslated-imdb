This is a very cool movie! I remember seeing him first when I was very young and I saw her all the time once a week ... Shadow was my favorite character in the movie. Homeward Bound is really funny and it's cool to train animals to do all this. Part of the movie is sad (like when Sassy, ​​the cat falls in cascade and Shadow falls into the hole at the end.) I saw the second Homebound Bondage, but I have to say it's not as good as the first . Shadow is the smart one, Sassy is good, Sassy, ​​and Chance is the funny idiot. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedy or talks to animals. This is one of my top ten favorite movies!
