In what must be one of the bloody movies ever, a transvestite kills people in New York and the answer to everything can not be what people suspect. One can see how Brian DePalma takes an influence from Hitchcock with camera angles and others. Michael Caine plays a very challenging character, while Angie Dickinson is, in principle, a bored woman with a bad haircut. Keith Gordon (who later starred in "Christine") is probably the most interesting character in the movie. But you do not really understand this movie without seeing it. And once you've seen it, you may never know who to trust. Also starring Nancy Allen and Dennis Franz.
