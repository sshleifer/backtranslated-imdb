Sleepwalkers are creatures that leak from the full life force of people to survive ... but I can only use virgins (why not explain). Charles Brady (Brian Krause) is one who needs to feed his mother (Alice Krige). She goes after Tanya (Madchen Amick). Will he escape? <br /> <br /> On the one hand, this is a great movie. Various rhythms, blood and gore, and a sense of humor, twisted. There are lots of joke references for horror lovers (Castle Rock is mentioned once). Krause is also excellent (who would have thought he could act after "The Return to the Blue Lagoon"), as Kirge and Amick. But I found this annoying film. It was written for screen by Stephen King and he is madly vague. Somnwalkers are not fully explained. Where are they from? Why is this called? Why does the son have to feed his mother? Why do cats hate them and kill them? What are their powers after all (at one point Krause makes a car disappear and change color and style!)? Why do they need to fuel the peoples' life force? Why do they just have to be virgins? Why does the son have sex with his mother? None of these is explained leaving the story confused. It is really too bad for, beyond these questions, this is an excellent horror movie. Excellent makeup and special effects too. <br /> <br /> Rapid, gorilla and a lot of fun. If the script was better. Also, a fairly explicit sex scene was edited between Krause and Krige (you can say) to get a rating R. I can only give 7.
