I'm watching the series again, now that it's DVD (yay!) It hits me so fresh, as relevant and intriguing as when it was first released. The central performances are captured, the scriptures are stratified. I'm gonna stick my throat and put it there with The Prisoner as a show that will win new fans and still be chased to come 2035. I was asked to write a line more (it seems IMDb is just as unfriendly and analytically retentive coded as ever! Pithy up to the point is not clearly the IMDb mode.) Well, unlike IMDb, comment editors, American Gothic understands that simplicity is everything. In 22 episodes, the show covers more character development than many shows do in seven seasons. Moreover, he questions the personal ethics and the force of character in a way that causes the viewer at every step to wonder what they choose and what they think in a given situation. the first time it was broadcast, I was still betraying the Twin Peaks and I thought it would be a cheap escape. Personally, I started to appreciate it more and suspect that it will rise better over the years. I think no more controversial than that!
