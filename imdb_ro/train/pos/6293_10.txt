Buster shines absolutely in this episode, which is the only vehicle I've ever seen before the end of my career, which allowed her to make the physical (and silent) comedy that made him famous. It's still a shock to hear his voice in the tune-in - his voice is about the only thing he does not care about Buster - but his ability to make a pratfall is still unmatched. He even repeats some of the gangs used at the beginning with two wheels with Roscoe Arbuckle. My deepest gratitude to Rod Serling for presenting us this episode and for giving Buster the whole thing. It did not take much time (an episode) to do it, but this is a tribute to Hollywood's greatest genius.
