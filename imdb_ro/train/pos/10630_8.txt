I think it is regrettable that the lead comments on this movie include the words "Nonsense clueless and stupid". I think it's a very funny movie and great fun. One has to suspend the belief that a homosexual man and a lesbian woman may fall in love, have a baby and live happily together afterwards. But it is always wonderful to see that it was played in a movie and that it has a warm heart. Is that impossible? There are more unlikely events described in other films. The act is good, the script is fun. The only negative comment is that the story could have ended when the family moved away from the original house instead of expanding to explore whether the man retains any residual homosexuality.
