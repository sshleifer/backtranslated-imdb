This film was made by one of the most absurd humorists in Canada, Yves P. Pelletier. I was shocked for a moment that he made a ROMANTIC comedy, but knowing he was a hardcore filmmaker, he was seen in every local festival and in the local cinema, I had a positive feeling about this movie. Hell, I was right. Even on bats, the scenario (written by Pelletier himself) is a little twisted and hard to follow, but in Pelletier's mode, this is a 90-minute jack-in-the-box. <br /> <br /> Inspired and largely transformed allusion to dangerous links (by Laclos) "Les Aimants" consists of a twisted game of writing notes on the fridge. Throughout the movie you will have the chance to find out who is who and who writes for who in that refrigerator ... which appears in an interesting love affair. A great story, a great photo, quoted by other films. Should we ask more for a first film?
