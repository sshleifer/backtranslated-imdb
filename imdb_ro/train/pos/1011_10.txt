I like Jack's jokes as "The Blind is ..." or "On the top clich√© type, black, fat, fairly scary ...". He's just hilarious! Daniel starts to catch him! Good that Jack is no longer in the team (in some way) or otherwise it would have been sarcasm maniac !!!! I just like all the parcels (season 8, a bit less, I have to admit), the characters are wonderful, the actors are wonderful, I start to pick up facial expressions (and more) from Jack, Daniel and Teal'c ... It's just theoretically possible and interesting ... oops! I'm going again! I'm sorry, too, I'm starting to remember the Carter characters, and all this leads our NUTZ parents !!!!!!! In conclusion, I think it's good for three more seasons or so, especially if they continue to pack episodes with all this humor, drama, action and so on !!!!!!!!!!!!!! ! !
