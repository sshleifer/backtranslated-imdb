Stylish, lively, full of witchcraft, fast, sexy, extravagant, slothful, erotic, unimaginable and stingy, Footlight Parade is a first class entertainment that all movies are about. the treatment offers a fresh edge to the material, and its rhythm and delivery is breathtaking. Let's just think they just started making pictures talking about 7 years before! The brilliance of the dialogue can never be right today, especially since "realism" has taken over and swallowed contemporary cinema. This film was made at a time when the restriction of Hayes's content was ignored and the result is a fresh, self-referential, critically and alive cinema that spoke directly to contemporary audiences suffering from depression and the general aggression of the era. I would recommend watching any movie from this period, namely 1930-1935, for a vision of what someone might be popular with.
