It was great. When I first saw the Japanese version, it was probably the most frightening film I've ever seen. It was not blood and courage, it was strange, atmospheric and frightening. When the mother's ghost lent over the bed in the Japanese version, I almost had a heart attack ... I worry that the American version will be wet and that Buffy would take away the dark shades of the original version. He did not have to worry. Producers of this film have wisely kept the same Japanese people who were involved in the original film at hand and gave direction to the film of the same man. They also put it in Japan in the same location, in the same house. In fact, the Japanese director tried to remember the same film as the original, the only difference being the distribution of American actors. This has turned into a benefit, adding the "Aliens in a Weird Country" element to the general horror. Not only have they been haunted by an absolutely terrifying and endless ghost, but they have also been stuck in a completely foreign country with difficulties in integrating into society. It only added general anxiety to the film and I thought it was an excellent touch. Buffy actually does a really good job. She seems to be vulnerable and able to spread her fear well. There is not one of the intelligent remarks of the Alexis that are so common for American horror films, or a line that fumes the darkness and general horror of the characters' situation. In fact, it was just as good as the ring that I also enjoyed a lot. I hope the future of American horror follows closely the new wave of horror Japanese, which began with Ringu's incredible success. Finally, we get movies that can actually be classified as "Horror"! 8/10
