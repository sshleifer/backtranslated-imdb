Set up and actors make this television film for me the best interpretation of Dickens's classic story. George C. Scott is very credible as other distributors. His scrooge scatters unconsciously until the end of the movie. Then his character changes to the one who truly repents. The 19th century English town chosen for decoration creates an ambience that fits with Dickens and adds to the plausibility of this film. It's a movie that I look at every Christmas with the real Grinch and it's a wonderful life.
