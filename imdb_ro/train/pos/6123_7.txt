Before you comment on this movie, you must realize that when I saw this movie, I was expecting stupidity, horror, movie B and I just wanted to have fun. Jack Frost is one that not only offers, it's actually one of the best I've seen for a long time. Scott McDonald is great as Jack Frost, in fact, he thinks he has a future to be psychopaths in high-time films if he ever had the chance. McDonald is a serial killer who becomes a snowman by accidentally mixing ridiculous elements. As soon as the snowman begins to move and kill people, however, it will be hard not to laugh. The lines that are said are completely retarded, but really funny. The fact that the rest of the cast expressed over-action just adds to the stupidity of the movie, but stupidity is genius. The scene in which the snowman is with a teenage girl is truly classic in film B, horror film fashion. I really hope there is a sequel and I'll be there to watch any cable channel do this. Of course it's just fun to watch a few times and it's not a good work of film technology, but I like seeing snowmen kill people. I gave her 7 out of 10, this is a wonderful movie for meetings and couples in the late hours.
