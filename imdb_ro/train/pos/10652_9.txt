I do not know why critics have hit this movie. I do not agree with them anyway. The movie could have been a little frightening - I usually do not go horror movies! I really woke up to see myself during the day. I do not have to bother! ;) (The cinema was full of kids too, heh!) ... Liam was great as always. I also liked Catharine Zeta Jones (Theo) and Lili Taylor (Eleanor-Nell). The house was very gothic and beautiful in a scary way. The special and sound effects were great. I also enjoyed the musical score, especially the delicate songs for Eleanor and her journey to save the children, how she grew up in her routine and stagnant life, and eventually won her power, peace and freedom.
