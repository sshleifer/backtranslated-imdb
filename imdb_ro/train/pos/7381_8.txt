IVAN (Marco Ricca) and GILBERTO (Alexandre Borges) are partners in a company together with ESTEVÃO (George Freire), but the first contracted a professional criminal, ANISIO, to kill ESTEVÃO (the plot at least at first explains very well what the). The guy does this and after he gets the money, he starts to blackmail the two partners who appear in their company and says he wants a job there (as a supervisor or something?). Meanwhile, he meets Marina (Mariana Ximenes), ESTEVÃO's daughter, and begins to meet her! In such a story, where criminality, corruption, betrayal and blackmail go hand in hand, nobody is innocent or victimized, except for MARINA, the only person you do not know what is happening and you did not betray anyone? This film portrays with sarcasm the sad and cruel reality that exists in the large metropolis like São Paulo, where crime is the daily presence. We can feel the irony, but also the truth with characters such as ANISIO (played by Paulo Miklos), which gives blackmail to those who paid him unscrupulously and even flirting with the daughter of the guy he killed! It really has to be a monster to do that, but of course I know there are people like him in Brazil or any other place? It's a very good movie, cruel but true, about a sad reality? The actor is great and the soundtrack.
