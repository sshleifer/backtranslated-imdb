Fever Pitch is a pretty funny movie. It has a lot of fun moments (including a hilarious showering show). Like most romantic comedies, it has a "dead zone" in which all the heavy stuff, "it is splitting," but apart from that continues to be fun to the end. <br /> <br /> Even if the plot revolves around Red Sox fanaticism, it is not overloaded with sport. You do not have to be a fan to enjoy this movie. Of course it's easy to say: I've been a Red Sox fan since I was a boy. > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
