I'm a great movie classic, but I just got into silent movies. Many silent films do not care, but Show People is a notable exception. Marion Davies and William Haines are simply wonderful in this photo. Davies, in particular, has a wide range as she turns from a girl with a scary little town into a starlet who takes too little seriously. Show People is a fast-paced movie with a fantastic series of comets by some of the biggest stars of the silent era. The film captured my attention immediately and I actually forgot that it was a silent film. (I know it does not make sense, but that's what happened.) The actors are so skilled in their job that some dialogue books are needed. Show People is a perfect introduction to silent films. It's a fast and exciting film with two of the best stars of the silent era. Add to the satire of Hollywood and Show People should be on the "must see" list for all classic movie fans.
