Sure, this movie is healthy and sweet and full of clich√©s, but it's fun and that's why I watch movies. To be entertained. Natasha Henstridge is stunning, even with short hair. Her smile is radiant and her beauty can not be disguised. As for Michael Vartan, I'm sure women love him. The two seemed to really like the others in this movie. I do not understand the comments that there is no chemistry between them. I think we see what we want to see. Olivia d'Abo and Michael Rigoli were fun to look at, even if d'Abo's British accent slipped into his alleged Bronx speech. To tell you the truth, I did not notice until I read these comments but I went back to the DVD and now her dialogue sounds more British than American for me but it was ideal for her role with that exception. <br /> <br /> It's a story of two cute people who marry other significant people but who find their soul mate in each other. It could be an unlikely story, but who says all the movies should play as documentaries? It is no longer unrealistic than any of the dramas that are watched every hour on the tube. That's why we follow them, get rid of the noise of daily life for a short period of time and enter the characters world on the screen. I thought these actors did a good job, but hey, I'm a slightly sentimental type. Do not get me wrong, it has to be a sentimental scene, and this movie had a lot of. <br /> <br /> I only give him 9/10 because I save myself 10/10 for this yet another super-magnificent movie that I know will come someday. If you see it is announced as coming to the movie or live movies or anything else, make a note to watch it. I think you will like it.
