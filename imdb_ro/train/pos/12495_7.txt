What's good about it: Some small, inventive and really creepy effects that will come under the skin of even the most horny fan of horror. It's not based on the soundtrack of the pieces on hackney for its "getcha" moments. Even though you've seen everything, there are still a few things in this movie that will make your jaw fall. What might have been better for him: The act was sometimes flat and unconvincing. He had a shot-on-video quality in some places (though he achieved most of the atmosphere he was trying to do) and work in the room is full of useless useless actions. Although the effects are truly horrible, I think they would have gone to the well several times too many times with some of them. The end seemed to repeat itself and to take seriously what could have been more moments of impact. The visitor is left to discover a lot of things for themselves, not as a challenge by the filmmakers, but because it just missed them. However, a small indie film of horror, which is easily several stages over the media. Well, it's worth the rent.
