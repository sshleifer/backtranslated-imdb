This movie, for me, is about the family. Jimmy Morris lived his dream not only for himself but for his family. I can not begin to tell you how I can tell my little girl that my father was going to Kansas City to cover priest Holmes and Kansas City bosses. He would have thought it was the best thing, as if he were doing Morris' son. Dreams come true with family is what this is about. I think only a father who has a close relationship with his family can really appreciate what Jimmy Morris did.
