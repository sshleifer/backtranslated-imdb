California is a film about lost ideals. A trip on the darkest road. The road without turning. The plot is about a couple who set out to find a better life in California. The man (David Duchovny, in his best role so far) wants to write a book about the famous murders that happened in America, and the girl - the photographer - will photograph. So they started on a famous murder trail without knowing what awaits them on the road. To share travel expenses, they decide to find another couple and put up an ad. But the couple who responds is not just a couple. She's one of the weirdest couples ever. The girl is a naive, fragile creature that dreams much and loves cactuses. Man is exactly the opposite. A cruel cruel killer. We learn that at the beginning of the film we are following his journey to California (not with C, as usual, but with K, probably symbolizing the killer), along his journey of betrayal, killing and ultimately defeat . All the directors, Duchovny, Pitt, Lewis and Forbes, offer very good performances and you have to keep in mind that when the movie was shot none of them was a star. The photo is stunning, with the darkness covering the biggest parts of the movie, and the music fits into the darkness of the movie. On the whole, this is a very good movie. Do not miss. You will think again before taking a stranger in the car to divide the gas with!
