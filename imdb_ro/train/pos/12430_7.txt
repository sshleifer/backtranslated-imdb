Normally, I do not watch movies because of the fact that they are usually all pretty similar. This film had many scenic scenarios of stereotypical action, but the characters and the originality of the movie's premise made it much easier to watch. David Duchovny tilted his normal approach, which was great to see. Angelina Jolie, of course, was beautiful and made great action. Great has all thrown together. I have to see people get bored with the same old action movie.
