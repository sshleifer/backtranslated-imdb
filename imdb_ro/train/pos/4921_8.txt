Like a Streetcar Named Desire (directed by Gadg both on stage and on screen) Panic In The Streets describes a New Orleans in which his claim fits into fame - the birthplace of Jazz - does not even mention it. This was Richard Widmark's seventh film and undoubtedly went a long way to establishing him as a good actor, indeed, he was not just a psychotic killer. Gadg himself appears in a small, unbelievable role in the role of morgue, but the film is rich in talent, starting with Jack Palance (who is still charged as Walter Jack Palance), while Mr. Big watched Zero Mostel , Barbara Bel Geddes, Emile Meyer, Tommy Rettig, and Paul Douglas, whom he has ever seen on the solid scene as a policeman who comes to Widmark's vision. It's a very nice movie, more to be seen a little. Grab her if you can.
