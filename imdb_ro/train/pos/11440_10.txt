I went and saw the Rivers and Tides again. It's the second time in two days and yes, I see movies I love as many times as necessary. Yesterday I was struck by the brightness of the images and the works of Goldsworthy. This morning when I threw the coins I received # 29 The Abysmal (Water). Goldsworthy has a water affinity, so the title. I got the 5th change that moved to the # 7 Army. For Blake Art it was a war. Anyway, I knew I had to see the movie again. I've read one of the few online reviews from the SF Examiner. The critic loved the film, but said Goldsworthy's comments prevented him from enjoying the film. He would rather have only the pictures and the wonderful soundtrack. So I was aware of this when I looked for the second time. Yesterday I thought I would vote for Andy Goldsworthy as king of the world. Well, today I could go a little beyond the pictures and listen to what she had to say. Can I enjoy the film without his comments? What he does, what he says goes far beyond "art." His understanding of Water, Time, Stone, Change, and on and on has made me think that man is the reincarnation of Lao Tsu or an Avatar. Some of his works / words are Zen. His knowledge ... However, the film is only (apparently) presented here in the Bay area. Be a trendsetter. Go to the local cinema and tell them, do not insist that you have to create a movie you heard from hinter. It's called Rivers and Tides. <br /> <br />
