I began to watch a resumption of this TV movie on a Sunday afternoon, considering it was just another mischief plane disaster. I was wrong. "Pandora's Clock" is a clever political thriller that far exceeds the quality of most TV films. It could be as easy to make a debut on the big screen. Distribution is excellent, including veteran actors Richard Dean Anderson, Edward Herrmann, Robert Guillaume and Robert Loggia. Daphne Zuniga turns into one of her best performances as a medical specialist working for the CIA, and Jane Leeves of Frasier is also very good. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is well written and the story is convincing throughout. In fact, the last hour is so full of ups and downs that you can not leave it for a second. If you have the chance to see this movie, invest time - almost four hours. You will be rewarded with much wealth!
