Larry Burrows has the feeling he's missing something. Ever since he missed a crucial baseball hit at school, which cost the championship, he was convinced that his life would have been better if he had made that shot. Then one night the car collapses again. Going to the nearest bar to wait for the towing truck, Larry happens to bartender Mike, who does not know that Larry is about to change his life forever ... The premise of alternative life in cinema is hardly a thing new, stretching back to such as "Wonderful Life" and no signs of deviation from the recent Sandler vehicle that was Click. It is a genre that produced very different results. In 1990, this production led by James Belushi, rarely mentioned when the theme appeared, seems to have been largely forgotten. What is a shame, since it oozes charm and is not short in the humorous department. We know that we are condemned to the final message that comes to the end, but it is a fun and pleasant way to be led. The film also serves attention to what a good actor James Belushi was. I mean if his clever style of quipping and larking exasperation is not your thing ,? then there are chances to avoid this movie anyway. But for those employed by Red Heat, K-9 and Business Care, all right, Mr. Destiny is right on your street. Together with Linda Hamilton, Michael Caine, Jon Lovitz, Hart Bochner, Jay O. Sanders, Rene Russo and Courteney Cox. Destiny, Fun Fun Escapist with a kicker of a message to his heart. 7/10
