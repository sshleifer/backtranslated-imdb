"Le Locataire" is undoubtedly one of the most important horror films ever made. Polanski is a Trelkovsky, a shy clerk living in Paris who responds to an advertisement for an apartment, the previous tenant attempted suicide by jumping off the apartment window. Trelkovsky is obliged to visit her in the hospital and there she meets Stella (Isabelle Adjani). Trelkovsky moves immediately when the previous tenant dies and at first is very pleased to find such a beautiful apartment. His happiness is soon replaced by waves of paranoia, as he becomes increasingly suspicious of his neighbors, who seem to try to challenge Trelkovski in repeating the previous suicide of the tenant. This film is great. Polanski succeeds create a surreal atmosphere of horror and paranoia.Plenty of shining moments such as the classic scene where Trelkovsky discovers the tenant's anterior tooth in a hole in the wall or the dreams of fever where he wanders in the building to find the walls covered with hieroglyphs. Sven Nykvist's photo is really beautiful. The "tenant" is a neglected gemstone. It can be difficult to track, but it is more than worth the effort.
