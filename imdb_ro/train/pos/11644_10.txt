This show is great! I've been a fan since it was premiered and it just keeps me ... I've seen some awful things here that I wish I did not have, but it really shows you how addiction affects everyone involved , not just dependent. You can see all sorts of different addictions, from drugs and alcohol to shopping addictions or dependence on eating disorders. And, in fact, it is really sad to see some of the famous faces that have passed. I have seen musicians, an NBA player and even young people in need of help. And since they started showing some follow-ups, that was great. Now you can see how long they are after their EP. If you did not check it out, please. It's on A & E, and it's great! The new eps are Sunday nights at 10PM EST, if I remember correctly ... so put TiVo!
