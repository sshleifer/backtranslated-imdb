Now, that's what I would call a good horror. With occult / supernatural subtleties, this low-budget, low-budget film has attracted my attention since the first scene. This proves that you do not need wild FX or a lot of gore to make an effective horror movie. The land revolves around 4 roommates in a prison, and each of these characters (and their motives) gradually becomes more exciting, the film building up its tension to the end. Most of the action we see through the eyes of Carrere, who just got into prison and must get used to living with these three other inmates. I will not say too much because this film really deserves to be seen more widely. But there are some flaws: FX is not so good, but is used effectively; the plot leaves some open mysteries; and things get very confused to the end, but Malefique is redeeming until it's over. I thought it was a very good movie, 8/10
