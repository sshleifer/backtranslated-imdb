This tranche makes it very much that the CIA appears to be a very bad organization. In fact, I'm probably. After all, the way the plot happens in this case, it seems that a man has the power to sanction killing everyone, including his own people, to kill Jason Bourne. Matt Damon makes a very credible job as Bourne tries to stay one step ahead of the whole movie. Still trying to remember who he was and how he got where he is. He gets help from a few people and it seems that every minute of the movie somebody is trying to kill him. There is little time for rest in this movie and the sequences of action seem very real. There are a lot of crazy camouflage sequences that somehow add to realism and make it look less Hollywood than many pictures. These sequences add the realism of the film to sensation. The suspicion in some of the sequences is brilliant, while you wonder if someone will die or if Bourne can remove them. This is the kind of suspense of action you will see when you want to have fun and I'm sure this will lead to the next movie in the series.
