This movie is a classic in every sense of the word. It is very fun and also very disturbing. The act in this movie is well done. The story itself is credible, suspenseful and well thought out. Character development is also done well, the audience can clearly see how each of the characters is emotionally tested through this movie. The villains of this film are very threatening, from the first moment the audience sees them as saying they are at something. This film shows how a human being, when taken from civilization and placed in the middle of a forest, experiencing a life or death situation, can slowly become almost as wild and feral as the animals that live it. Not everyone will enjoy this movie, there is a lot of disturbing content that could make some viewers inconvenient. It's definitely worth watching. This movie is a masterpiece.
