My Ex Ex Ex Girlfriend is a fun movie no less. <br /> <br /> The story is quiet. Matt Saunders (Luke Wilson) meets Jenny (Uma Thurman) in the subway and joins her. At the beginning of their relationship, everything seems to be fine, but then Matt discovers that he is G-Girl. At first, Matt looks very cool, but it seems G-Girl is very jealous and needy. So he decides to break up and join his colleague Hannah (Anna Faris). This makes G-Girl very crazy and she starts to take revenge on her ex-boyfriend. What I liked the most in the movie are the scenes where G-Girl takes revenge on Matt. It was also nice to see Anna Faris in another role, then her character in Scary Movie. I gave this movie 7 out of 10 and I recommend it to everyone who likes a pleasant comedy.
