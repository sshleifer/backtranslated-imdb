This is a great, awesome horror film that captures the essence of the obsession between mid-late 80s as to how malicious metal music was supposed to be. I remember being frightened by metal teens when I was a kid. It does not help me find a profane grave in my town cemetery when I was ten years old. It seems that this strange metal kid dug some old bodies and used his bones in a strange sacrifice for Satan. So maybe things like they discouraged me metal for a while, but now I like it like a 24-year-old. I bought this DVD used for $ 6 and I was expecting to suck out of the blade lid, but to my surprise, she decided. It is the extreme demonic power of the metal. And you have to love a scene where a guitar pulls lazers and vaporises his head in the crowd. This movie is great, if you like 80 metal and bad movies, this is for you. 9/10!
