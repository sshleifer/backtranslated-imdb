I just saw this movie on TV. I lost my father when I was young and this movie really felt. I feel lost. the little girl Although she felt .. the feeling of wanting to see her father again .. wanting to talk to him .. <br /> <br /> or at least give the chance to to say goodbye .. and I'm so touched with the letter that was written back to her .. saying that her father read her letter, and sent him back to someone to answer and buy him a gift for that there is no store in the sky ... it lets me feel that miracles exist.
