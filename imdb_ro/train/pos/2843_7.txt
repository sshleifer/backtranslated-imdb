If you are not in the mood for more than an hour film than this movie I might give you some variation. What I like are surprises in progress. There is only one time you want to continue one or more of the short films of New York I Love You. Yes, some of the short movies make you curious, some very short, some longer, some have finishes, some of them not. Most stories show the sad part of the capital. This shows many different foundations of nationality. Many of them make them feel the same if I once went to a capital in other countries for a year in which many people came from different countries. This movie explores many kinds of things that you would have known, but for all the characters there are new things. Perhaps some of you have been traveling alone abroad to stay for a year or two just to feel new, meet new people; feel sad, sad, but the kind of sadness you are looking for because it's just that you were bored that you were in your own home. You may want to return it again, following this.
