I thought it was a charming movie. The story seems to be a slim autobiography by John Waters: Pecker's greatest gift is his ability to find beauty in unexpected places. Edward Furlong is doing very well, but the best performances are by his grandmother, Mink Stole (a hilarious camel) and by all the people, Patty Hearst. I think reviewers are about to rely on that. They seem to take Pecker's greatest assessment of his work as a gospel, when they think the film says quite clearly that he is indeed a promising artist.
