A featherweight plot and dubious characters make no difference when a movie is as fun to watch as it is. Lively action and spectacular stunts - for their day - give this film a real zip. And there is a real comedy in the breaking chemistry between the two rulers. Quinn is also a good bastard, though his role is completely overshadowed. But do not be fooled by Maureen O'Hara's tough role, it is as sexist as any Hollywood film of that era. You may forgive this because of the time it was made, but it is still hard to go. For all the heroism and extraordinary situations of the adult, this is still a little more than a good adolescent time.
