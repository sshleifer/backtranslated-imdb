It's undoubtedly one of the best movies I've ever seen. The first time I saw that I was 9 or 10 years old. I started looking for some time before the rape scene. And when I saw it, I was very shocked to think, "What kind of sick movie is that?" Today I saw it from the beginning and I really understand how big this movie really is. It is exciting, frightening, shocking and, in its own way, annoying. But the best thing about this is the end of the audience being shown that this experience will haunt the characters for the rest of their lives. They will torture their conscience and worry for the rest of their lives about the bodies that are in that river. And I can not do anything about it, she has to live. This end is one of the most unfortunate endings in cinematic history and very intelligent, brilliant and terrible. The actor is also very good, especially Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds. A magnificent actor in this movie. In total, John Boorman has created one of the best movies in the history of the film based on Dick Chaney's novel. He has to see for all film lovers
