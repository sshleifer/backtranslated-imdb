I wanted to say this in a good way, believe me. True to life, it is not. The whole Oirish thing gets pretty thick, but you enjoy the distribution here - Flynn, Smith, Bond, Watson, Frawley, etc. I also liked seeing Mike Mazurki - he certainly played a boxer, what else? Flynn is okay like Gentleman Jim, you never go through a 1 dimensional look at him or the rest of it, I guess, but it's okay, it's a cartoon and you have to be happy, that's all. The boxing scenes were pretty good, Ward Bond's vaudeville logging is a revolt, and you had to see that all those pool billiards came in racing twice. Very funny, Flynn was in a role at that moment and it is clear to see why the audiences loved him. <br /> <br />
