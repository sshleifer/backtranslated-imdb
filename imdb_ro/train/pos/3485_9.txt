This Wrestlemania just did not do it to me. While some things, such as the royal struggle and celebrity involvement, have been a return to old times, so to speak, it seemed more of a "In Your Home" spiritism than anything else. Above average ... it is worth more matches, such as the team title, although it is noteworthy that changing titles meant nothing because it was reversed the following night.
