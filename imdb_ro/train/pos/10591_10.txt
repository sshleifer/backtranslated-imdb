There is no doubt that the Ealing comedy is good, but for me this film is highlighting as one of the best. The basic premise of the film is that a small part of Pimlico in London is discovered to be a part of Burgundy, not the United Kingdom. Then we follow the lives of the inhabitants in their struggle to keep the treasure discovered after bombing the bomb and to keep the black markets on the market, which soon realize that being exempt from British law, rationalization does not exist. When they become prisoners on their own street, because the government has decided to close the board, we see them struggling against the system. They are obliged to reason water and food in their stand for what is good. In fact, becoming worse than they were before it all began, there morale enters. When I lose all the food that they consider beaten and calls for a teaching, only the whole of London responds to their situation by sending food, lots of it. Thus, he allowed them to continue their struggle. This movie has rightly hit her, the act being superb, with Stanley Holloway, Margaret Rutherford, Hermione Baddeley and Betty Warren standing. It's very good, not too sentimental, and the morality of the story has not been forced down into the throat. Well worth a watch
