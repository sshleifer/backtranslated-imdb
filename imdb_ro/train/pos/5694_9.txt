Val Kilmer and Dylan McDermott are great. I saw Kilmer on The Doors, but John Holmes's performance is superb. Nothing compared to Boogie Nights, which was kind of slow. Wonderland is a movie that can show you a horrible story from the perspective of a guy who is just indulgent in his drug victims and indolently of what ever happens around. At the same time, the character of John Holmes shows a very intelligent hustler who can go through the worst and worst situations, almost unharmed. The movie is worth watching several times. The ambiance of the seventy, sensual and drug-intensive, is amazing.
