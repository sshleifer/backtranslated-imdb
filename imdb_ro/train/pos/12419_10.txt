I like this movie like no other. Once again, I will try to explain the virtues of the uninitiated ones, but for now, allow me to quote a few pieces of the remarkable dialogue, which, please remember, is still the tongue in the cheek. Aussies and Poms will understand, anybody else - okay? (Lyrical version singer) "he can sink a beer, he can choose a queer in the latest Bondi double breas." <Br /> <br /> (Another lyric song) "All the trees are bastards, bastards or worse, and England is the e-hole of the Universe." an "artistic program"): Mr. Mackenzie, what artists have impressed you the most since you were in England? (Barry's answer) Flamin "bull artists!" (While talking to a naive girl on a tree): Mr. Mackenzie, I assume you have a lot of aboriginal servants back in Australia? (Barry's answer) Abos? I have never seen an Abo in my life. The mother makes most of the solid yacca (ie hard work) around us. <br /> <br /> This is just a taste of the hilarious freaks of this Aussie scholar. If you can get a copy of it, watch and enjoy yourself.
