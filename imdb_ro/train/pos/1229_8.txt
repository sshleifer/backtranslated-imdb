I waited for the time before seeing this, because all the reviews I've read about it said it was horrible! I rent it waiting for the worst, and while it's hardly the best sandal film out there, I'm worse! Sandler talks frequently with the camera and the movie is not taken seriously, but that's part of the fun! A great way to lose an afternoon, and you might even find yourself laughing twice! A good, good rental movie!
