this movie takes you in the first few minutes and keeps you to the end. has a very human story and very well-selected music. The action of Moritz Bleibtreu (Giancarlo Amato) and Barnaby Metschurat (Gigi Amato) is satisfactory. Recommended for people who get bored of action movies and want to see a good movie.
