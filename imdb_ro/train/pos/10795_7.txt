Overall, the movie was good enough, a good action plot, with a fairly large amount of explosions and battle scenes, but Chuck Norris did nothing, except disarming the bomb and shooting a few characters. The film was very similar to the events of September 11, with a bin-charged terrorist, sending a video to the president (Urich) and threatening to detonate him. Judson Mills had some great acting roles, revealing Rashid's composition and different roles in the hit, but there was a lack of Chuck Norris. Judson took most of the action, leaving Joshua (chuck) with Que on his computer. But overall, it was realistic and there was no action, but only on Mr. Norris' side. I gave the movie 7/10.
