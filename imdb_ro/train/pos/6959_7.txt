well, this is a film by Ivan Reitman. except for rare occasions, Ivan likes to have fun. In general, his films are not "deep", but they are often quite fun. My Super Ex girlfriend surprised me that I laughed more than I thought I would. Uma Thurman is just as big and I like my portraits. I also like Luke Wilson, and Rainn Wilson was a straight kid. It's never taken seriously, the movie is over the top and yet it's not very unique, nor does it go where nobody went before ... it's a nice rental and probably a good movie, especially if you have a headache and you do not want to strain your brain. It's fun and there's nothing wrong with that. When you give up "super-girl" stuff, you have a story about relationships and relationships have been bad. He's a boy who meets a girl, the boy leaves a girl. And finally, the characters are looking for love. Not all are taken as if they could ... a slice of life with a twist.
