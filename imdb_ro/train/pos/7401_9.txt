It seemed very interesting to me that the film managed to put an end to the gap between my American culture and that of originals, that is, Chinese. It becomes a story about values ​​and causes the observer to reevaluate his own choices in life and loyalty to institutions. Quite amazing, he managed to do this in a gentle, humorous manner that only men in retrospect threaten the statu-quo. I liked the movie and would look back again if I could.
