We received this movie from Netflix after a long wait, so we anticipated a lot when it arrived. My worst fears were that it would be breeding, as well ... well, you know what they were drinking all the fan girls screaming? GACKTnHYDE = love hawt yaoi? That kind of work? It scares him. I was very, very pleasantly surprised. The movie was surprisingly to be watched, even though the filming and the music made him feel like someone would pull out a pair of nuns on every two scenes, and Gackt's role was pretty good. Hyde, Hyde, acted as a quasi-romantic friend / bandage member, that anyone who sees him on the stage will certainly not be surprised by him. It is one of two beef with the film itself. But the rest of the camp (including the child's actors in the opening scene) were very good at doing what they did - which was most often shot and screamed at. But my second problem was very small, having to do with the gorillas. It seemed to me too much suspense-horror to me-like any scene where someone was shot, whether they collapsed, really the most sincere dead, or left there for a long time. But Sho just ... takes pictures, repeatedly doubts, bubbles a lot while talking and makes Hyde cry. Generally, if you are a fan of any actor or just a fan of the movie, it definitely deserves a watch.
