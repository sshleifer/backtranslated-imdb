Come on good people. This movie is better than 4. I can see that this is happening ... rich people have done more crazy than that. And I was funny. I notice a comedy to be entertained, to get rid of the pressures of the world for a short while and not have to take anything too serious. This movie fits perfectly to this purpose. Judge a movie on her own merits and I'm not going to compare the surviving Christmas with the lit litters. I looked at people totally dysfunctional to become gritty individuals who could easily live on the street in my house. It will remain on my list of "favorite ..... have to look for the holiday season". If you just want to have a 90-minute fun, look at this.
