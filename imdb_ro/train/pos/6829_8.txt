Genre Rowlands interprets an actress who loses adherence to reality when she witnesses to the death of her fan. She becomes increasingly mistaken for reality, and as a result her emotional turbulence enters her work as an actress. In the sense that it violates all the rules to act and improvise everything, but still manages to engage its audience, this film makes it interesting (if less important) to be a parallel to Cassavettes' fights as a director. There are so many ideas thrown around, and as a result it gets a little muddled (I still think of the relationship between dead fan and Rowlands among many other things) but how they are presented in their worst form makes exciting and challenging movies. It would be great on a double invoice with Mulholland Drive. <br /> <br />
