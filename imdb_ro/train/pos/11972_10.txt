I grew up when I saw the house full of a child. I stopped viewing for years, but a couple of weeks ago I started seeing it again. Now my children are looking at the show and she likes to look at her. My kids can not believe that the DJ, at the show, and I am the same age. I really enjoy the show because it is a show you can watch with your family. She has good teachings that your children can teach. There is also no drug and violence. Also, when children have a problem in the show, they can always open their family for help. This is the message children should receive from TV a few days ago, ask your family for help, not drugs. Children should watch more shows, such as Full House, instead of half the misery on TV a few days ago. I also like the show because it makes you laugh and it's on the ground. She talks about real life issues and family issues. There is always a lesson you can learn from the show. Vote on the show 10.
