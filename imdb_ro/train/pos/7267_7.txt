Curly Sue is 6 years old with an abundance of hair and a life like a rider. She and her father, Bill (Jim Belushi), try to survive on the streets, being small con artists. In Chicago, Bill decides to jump in front of a car in an expensive parking garage, while Curly will scream about the processes and traction to the victim. It happens to be a very tall lawyer called Gray (Kelly Lynch), who is properly terrified of what he did. Not only do scammers make some money, they get to spend the night at Gray's plush apartment. Even then, Gray feels he owes them more, so the three of them hang him together for a spell. Gray knows only the law work and nothing about life. Who should learn better than Bill and Curly, those real-life experts? But all good things have to come to an end and there is no life for a legal expert and for a few men. Or is it there? This is a sweet and funny movie about unexpected. Curly is, of course, as fun as Shirley Temple, but a lot cleaner, of course. Belushi offers a rare touch performance, while down his luck cone and Lynch is bright as a snooty attorney, but soft touch. John Hughes, as a writer and director, shows us once again his magical touch, because the script is lively and unpredictable. Just watch Curly and Bill take Gray out for a night without money, and see the humorous results. Do you long for happy endings, promised for a long time and finally delivered, with a few insecure moments between them? This is your custom made movie.
