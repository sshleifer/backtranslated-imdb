Dev Anand (or Prashant) and Zeenat Aman (Jasbir / Janice) are educated brothers in single-parent families. Jasbir (sister) grows in a rich environment, but this is not enough to lead her to reject her life and eventually to join a hippie movement that eventually leads to drugs. Prashant (brother), on the other hand, grows in a less prosperous environment, but grows up until he is a mature gentleman. The story marks Prashant making efforts to save his younger sister (who is always in a trance) from a hippie hostile environment. This film is the test of time, commenting that cults and hippie groups are a place for those who give up their lives when they should stand up and be counted against adversity. Excellent musical compositions in this movie that mean different things in different situations and different people, and the director brings a strange feeling.
