The film is very pleasant, with a great distribution and excellent direction by James Eves. The film is fun with a very charismatic performance by Stephanie Beecham and everyone is perfectly expressive. James Eves has a good eye for casting and leads a conductor knowing exactly when to turn the action, fall and then rise to a climax. He does this with an element of humor, a lot of twists, emotions, and blood. This is a return of the old vampire movie, with a lot of gore, blood and screams. The movie works at high speed and the characters lead you into a terrible adventure, but what makes them work is that the movie does not take too seriously with a lot of language in action.
