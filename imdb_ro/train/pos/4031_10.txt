I was a Hindi movie guy at the age of 4, but never in my life did I see such a moving and impact film, especially as a Hindi movie. In recent years, I have stopped watching modern Hindi movies and returned to watching the classics (Teesri Kasam, Mere Huzoor, Madhumati, Mother India, Sholay, etc.). But this movie has changed everything. It's one of the best movies I've ever seen. I have discovered that she is not only moving but also educating someone who is a first-generation Indian woman growing up in America. It helped me understand my family history, which has always been something very abstract for me. But in order to "see", feel and understand, it helped me to sympathize with generations in front of me and with the struggle that the Indian people suffered. The film helped me put more things in perspective for me, especially given the current events of the world. I never thought a movie could change the way they think so ... before ... it did. The terrain is fantastic, acting superbly and the direction is perfect. Two fingers up!
