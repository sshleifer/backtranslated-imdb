1936 was the most prolific year for Astaire and Rogers. The second film for RKO that year is the third film in this collection? Sandric's marker, "Follow the fleet." This time Astaire is painfully uncomfortable as Bake Baker, a vacation sailor who just happens to stumble across the giant waterfront caf√© where Sherry Martin (Rogers) is sweetly warbling nothing romantic in everyone's ear. Yes, did you guess? are hot one another once more. Only this time Sherry's sister, Connie (Harriet Hillard) threatens the whole story, falling for Bake's robust friend Bilge Smith (Randolph Scott); a kind of use, and get them off of a guy, forcing Sherry to reconsider his opinion of sailors in general. Irving Berlin offers an immeasurable class with classical classic score that includes "Let go," "I put all the eggs in a basket" and "Let's face the music and dance." the latter is a divinely inspired sketch about suicide that turns into another deux step, immediately recognized and sublime, for Fred and Ginger. <br /> <br /> The "Watch the fleet" transfer is weaker. The gray scale remains beautifully balanced, but now it's a rough look with no tonal variation than previous titles. Cereals are still present. Also, there are artifacts related to age. Once you have settled on the slightly dense image quality and sometimes less focused, the overall impression is more than acceptable for a movie of that era. The sound is mono, but very nice balanced. Extract includes a feature, theatrical trailer and short but strange topic ?? no audio commentary. Given the importance of this film in Astaire / Rogers's general canon, this is an unusual surveillance from Warner Home Video.
