The show is about two sisters who live together. Holly, being the youngest, has adolescent problems, on the other hand her sister Val has a job, a boy friend, a fianc√©e problem like most women on the planet. They try to support each other that they sometimes make mistakes, but do not give up and continue. And the show is also about friendship. Life priorities. I really enjoyed this show. It's funny and the actors are so good. I'm really sad that the show's over. I'm still looking at time back on time :) Amanda Bynes is very talented. Jenny Garth can be new to comedy, but she plays very well. She is one of the actresses I like to watch. I like the relationship between Vince and Holly, they're very natural. Gary is a natural talent and makes you laugh every time he appears. Tina Holly had found a real friend and even liked to stay there. The character Lauren is so funny and is a natural talent. I'd like to see her more. This show really takes you and makes you laugh. I want the show to be over.
