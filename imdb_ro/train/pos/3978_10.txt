I had the pleasure of reading Martin Torgoff's book "Can not Find My Way Home," which is full of information about America's drug culture dating back to 1945-2000. This guy knows his stuff! I found him as an excellent spokesman for this documentary. I especially enjoyed watching hippie films and stoner culture in the '70s. The soundtrack was great. Whoever compiled it was certainly about the melodies of every era. We hope they pack them and sell them as a set of CDs. I would recommend this to anyone interested in how the LSD experiments in the 1960s have forever changed American culture as we know it. One missing thing was any mention of George Jung (played by Johnny Depp in the movie "Blow"), who is supposed to be responsible for a large proportion of marijuana and cocaine coming to this country in the 1960s and 1980s.
