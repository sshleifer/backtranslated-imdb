Whenever I ask people to name the most frightening film I have ever seen, I invariably respond to "Black Noon," and until today no one has ever heard of it. I've seen it for more than 30 years now, when I was 13 years old when my parents left for the evening. As far as I know, the only time was once introduced in the UK and unfortunately is not available on DVD or VHS. If anyone can find a copy, let me know. <br /> <br /> If I chased him again now, it would probably be a great disappointment, but I always remembered it as a very disturbing little film!
