I'm shocked. Shocked and amazed that the 428 IMDB users who voted in front of me did not give this movie a rating over 7 7 ?! ?? - That's C! If I could give FOBH 20, I would do it with joy. This film is at the top of the modern comedy pantheon, alongside Half Baked and Mallrats, being one of the most hilarious films of all time. If you know _anything_ about rap music - you need to see this! If you do not know anything about rap music - find out something! Comparisons with "Spinal Tap" fail to appreciate the inspired genius of this unique film. If you liked Bob Roberts, you'd like that. Watch it and vote at 10!
