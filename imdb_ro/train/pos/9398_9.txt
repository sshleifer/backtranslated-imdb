This is an excellent modern noir movie ... "great" in the fact that it is interesting, it begins to the end. There are holes inside and some loose parts that make you shake your head in unbelief ..... but I have not found anyone who was not caught in this story. The film has the right to act, suspense, plotting, and interesting characters. In addition, the sport has beautiful colors and cinemas, plus a good guitar soundtrack. <br /> <br /> We called this crime film a "noir movie" because it's rocky and all the characters are not good. Even the only good guy, played by Nicholas Cage, is in a lousy trouble and has a fast business that he should not have. He also does something to the end, which is not right, but I'm not going to ruin him. Suffice it to say, however, that the rest of the characters are so bad that they make Cage look good! Speaking of "bad guys," does anyone do better than Dennis Hopper? Not many. At least in the "disturbed" category, it's hard to beat. Lara Flynn Boyle is fun to look for a lot of reasons. J.T. Walsh also offers excellent support performance. This is one of those movies that did not have too much advertising, but it should have. You will enjoy watching this. By the way, try to say the name of this movie out loud three times quickly without disturbing it!
