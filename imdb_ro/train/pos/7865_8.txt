It's a great movie. The story is so refreshing and interesting. Not once during the movie I woke up looking at space. Konkana Sen did a good job in the film, though I think someone with more brilliance or enthusiasm would have been better, but she did a great job. All supporting actors were also very good and helped the film over time. Bomber Irani has done a great job. There is one thing that is highlighted in this movie STORY is wonderful and very realistic, does not beat around the bush, it is very clear in the transmission of its message. I think more movies like this should be done, I get sick to watch the same candy candy movies again and again, now they become hard to digest. Everyone has to look, it's a great movie. - Just 2 cents :)
