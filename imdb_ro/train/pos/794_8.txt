I was very surprised at how much I liked this movie. I thought it was fun, sexy, painful and hot. Andie MacDowell's performance was nuanced and vulnerable. For once, the director of a MacDowell film did not make her beauty another character in the movie. The romance between Kate and her young man is great to look and play very well. Her relationship with her friends is both a thorn and a balm in her life. Imelda Stalinson, who was a MVP in so many British films, is doing a great job in this respect. There are a number of tragedies, but I think the movie is finally saved by the brilliance of the act, the clean direction and the voice-writing. The quality of the movie is excellent and the music is good, although it is not available on the soundtrack.
