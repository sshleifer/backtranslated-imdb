Oscar-caliber performance by Peter Falk in an Oscar-caliber-writing role. I loved the tinted and balanced exploration of a long marriage - how often do we get it in movies, where usually the movie ends when the boy and girl gather together? This is an adult film, a complex view through the eyes of all parties - husband, wife, son - how each one has adapted each other in the past and grew up during the story. Moreover, she gave me about 10 big belly laughs and I am one of those people who usually stay unassumed when the rest of the audience laughs. This was one of the few really funny movies I've ever seen. Great jokes original.
