I do not agree with the other comments posted on this movie. For example, the film is based on the book and if the writer had a homosexual character, then how could Hollywood cast a gay character in a movie. And, moreover, there were two homosexual characters and I thought they mirrored each other. One was normal and the other was more feminine, but it was not over the top. And Diane Keaton gave a wonderful performance, and if the other reviewer had the decency to actually track the whole movie, she would have seen her character develop through film interacting with the other characters. For example, when she and Adam went to look at the car that Sara collapsed in the junkyard, you could see her mother's part, and later in the movie you saw she was invincible. But I think if you are too worried about homosexual characters and characters that are wrong then this movie is bad. But if you are more open and do not really know how to get suggestions about what is good, then you will enjoy this movie.
