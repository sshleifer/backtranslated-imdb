This is such a fantastic movie, a Western man about himself (Jimmy Stewart) going to Klondike for gold. Along the way, he gets insulted by a local sheriff from Alaska (John McIntire, who gives a wonderful bad show), which he has wronged back. McIntire threatens to be dead if he ever comes back through his town, which, unfortunately, is the only way back to the States. Most of the story refers to the peaceful town of Dawson in Klondike, which was turned upside down by our inhabitants of McIntire. Ruth Roman, for example, who came with Stewart and his two companions (Jay C. Flippen and Walter Brennen, who plays Stewart's best friend), builds a salon (a Hollywood front for a gossip) and trying to run the city's restaurant out of business. It opens the way for McIntire and his monks to come. In 1953, Jimmy Stewart and director Anthony Mann made one of the spikes of the Western genre, The Naked Spur. The Far Country is just a little smaller and contains 99.9% of what made this film so special, without, of course, feeling like a cheap copy. Like Spurul gol, Country Far boasts a beautiful and localized cinema. The scenery is superb. Stewart gives one of the best performances (almost equal to the greatest success of 1954, The Rear Window). I suppose he could be considered a cliche because he starts a lonely selfish and teaches how that kind of existence ultimately plays. Still, Stewart plays so well, making this character very human. And the support performances are fantastic universal. In addition to what I mentioned, the adorable French actress Corinne Calvet is very good. And he should identify Walter Brennen. He seems to have specialized in playing the best friends. His relationship with Stewart is very moving, because at first he is the only person who can bring humanity out of the cynical man. The script is very well written, and Mann's direction is impeccable. A masterpiece. 10/10.
