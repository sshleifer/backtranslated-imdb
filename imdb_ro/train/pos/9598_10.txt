I watched the trip two years ago on the Internet - now I saw the movie! What a walk! And what a trip you finally know about Darius Weems! A spirit so brave, wise, funny and talented! And what crew! To listen to Darius laughing to be in the water in Panama City, seeing himself afraid of being too close to Louisiana's alligators, wondering in his eyes when he was traveling in a hot air balloon, the enthusiasm floating in the old days , you bet to eat a teaspoon of wasabi, and the phone rings at home and as usual boys will be boys. This film must be seen by everybody - young and old. Darius and his mother are models of force and courage. And crew members are wills for the heart of the younger generation. They received Darius a new wheelchair; have documented accessibility issues; they took Darius on the journey of his life; and have reached many, many lives. By raising DMD awareness and encouraging funding for research, this film will help achieve the ultimate goal of Darius Goes West - a cure for DMD.
