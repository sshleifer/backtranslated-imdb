Coming from the same director who made "Candyman" and "Immortal Beloved," I'm not surprised that it's a good movie. Ironically, "Papierhaus" is a movie I have not heard before, yet it has to be one of the best movies of the late '80s - partly because it's the worst movie of the past decades. (We are not talking about Iranian or Swedish "cinema" here ...) The actor is not brilliant, but just solid - unlike what some people claim (they probably dreamed of this "wonderful action," like Anna). The story is an interesting fantasy that does not end in a clever way that links all the other free heads together. These unanswered questions are probably left there intentionally, leaving it to the individual's interpretation, and there is nothing wrong with that with a theme like this. "Pepperhaus" is a somewhat unusual combination of film and horror for children, with the efficient use of sounds and music. I like the fact that the central character is not your typical type of ultra-shy, but secret-brilliant, social-outcast girl, but a normal, normal child; very refreshing. I am sick and tired of writers who project their own childhood in their books and on the screens, as if someone else wants to follow or read about another miserable childhood alone as if it were as if it were so the characteristic backdrop holds a monopoly on good potential. The scene with Anna and the boy "snogging" (quite stretched out) was a bit more - evoking so disgusting feelings and vague fun - considering that it should have been only 11, but predictably, proved that Burke was 13 when he was shot. I have no idea why they did not improve the age of the character or a younger actress. It was obvious that Burke was not so young. Why directors always throw kids bigger than what they play, so dilute realism, I will never know.
