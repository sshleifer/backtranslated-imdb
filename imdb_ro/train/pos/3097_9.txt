This show was fabulous. It was complicated and well written and all the characters where she feels nice without being horrible sweet. Even Jonathan Cake, the friendly boyfriend was nice. Because our radio waves are full of shit like American Idol and Dancing with the Stars, it was nice to see a drama that was not too sympathetic. It has always been intriguing to see how each character would be connected to the next circumstance. It is very annoying to finally get a show that makes you think a little and throw it away because of a mysterious number that most of us do not even pay attention to. Some of us are not sheep. This show will be missed by a lot of people, but by fairly loyal fans.
