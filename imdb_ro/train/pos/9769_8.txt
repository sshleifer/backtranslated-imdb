I liked. Generally, I'm not a fan of comedies and comedies, but I like Whoopi. I'm also part of Fantasy Sci / Fi. And the dinosaur madness. I read for pleasure, but when I feel overwhelmed or even lying, I watch TV and movies to escape. Theodore Rex allowed me to do that. This is a success in my eyes! I did not even go to do anything while running. Whether or not it was rated "good" or not, does not really matter to me. And no, I'm not a minor. I'm not crazy either.
