A fascinating but unsettling look at Edith Bouvier Beale (Big Edie) and her aunt (Little Edie) and the first cousin of Jacquelyn Kennedy Onasis. They live in an infested manor, dug out of rodents, which was considered a danger to the health of the city. It becomes very clear very quickly that these two are well eccentric. Little Edie seems to be the freest as she acts with the mentality of a ten-year-old, even though she is actually 53. The content is pretty much made up of two things. The first talks were Little Edie lambastes Big Edie to eliminate all her potential boys and destroy her aspiring career as a writer, actress and dancer. These discussions are usually very rhetorical, meaningless and often funny. The second part includes long periods of attempts to sing on both sides. Everyone, of course, thinks their singing is perfect and only others sound bad. In an amazing scene, Big Edie physically attacks Little Edie with her cane just to stop her. Very captivating, however, someone has the feeling that there is a serious exploitation here, and the subjects are too far to know him. The directors seem to treat this as a strange circus show, coming every day to record (and chicote) any bizarre behavior can take place. Finally, this is a sad picture because it shows how the world has simply gone through these two. Their hopes and dreams are faded as the mansion they live in. In spite of their fear, the two need each other more than ever. For without the other there would be no refuge from solitude. The most amazing line comes from Big Edie, whose cats sink into the bedroom. Her response to a smell complaint is simply unbelievable.
