A tour of deforestation! Okay, the kid who plays Oliver is a little too sweet! Beginning with the most impressive cinemas, colors, costumes and performances, I have to watch a movie. I have seen some adaptations of this wonderful novel, but it is above all and is a musical to be uploaded! He is a master Fagan, who never lets his character make a song. You never know if you like it or not, the same feeling I got in the book. In other versions you hate it from beginning to end. Bill Sykes .... when you read the book is average, so it's in the movie. Oliver Reed was a master. His wife directed this masterpiece. I went and saw his last film, Gladiator, based on his many shows, not to see the chaplains. Music fits in with times and mood. Who will buy this beautiful movie? You should!
