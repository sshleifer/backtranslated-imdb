This is a trio of stories, "Shakti", "Devi" and "Kali," about an experimental community (or such thing) called the Taylor-Eriksson group, which has led people on trips in themselves and in the unknown field, and left a little damage here and there, I would say. Many years later, some of these damages still hide and wait for the right time to look. Shakti tells about a woman whose husband died mysteriously, in fact, he was broken and the suspect was a man who probably would not have existed. It seems that this woman is capable of designing an inner demon or discovers the sister of the man who was killed when she tries to talk to this woman while she is a reporter. Devi tells the story of a young man who wants to "jump out of his skin." He is a skinhead, a strange speed and is sent to see a psychiatrist who just happens to be a former member of that community, which results in a good doctor helping the young man to achieve his desire. This is probably the best of the three segments. Kali tells the story of a healer who is trying to "cure" this woman who was part of this community and to let go of a sort of demon who lived in this woman, but someone wonders if she did it or if I abolished it for that she could not survive in her. All three of these stories are pretty creepy and suspicious, because you're never sure what to expect, and the premise and settings are so different from those of conventional horror movies that they add to strange. This has a kind of low-budget look and feel at it, but it also manages to evoke a fairly creepy atmosphere all the time, much to be credited. I followed this with my mouth hanging open much of the time and when the real scared (and gore) came struck quite hard. I found this movie very interesting and disturbing and I really liked it. A little discovery, that, I'd give 8 out of 10.
