This film is about development. People grow up and people fade, surprised people and disappointed people. It has everything even more. There is hope, frustration, injustice, justice, love and hatred. It is truly a classical drama that has fantastic performances throughout the cast, but in particular Whoopi Goldberg in her debut role. This movie made me feel very humane and proud of this and I suggest that this film should be compulsory every Saturday in all the prisons in the world - it touches your compassion. Rating: 10 out of 10. PS: I admit: I shed a tear of joy during the final stage.
