This is an excellent documentary, full of action racing and a wonderful story. IMAX cameras give you a very broad perspective, being a perfect DVD movie. Listen to each speaker that works almost all the time, the movie is not accelerated and gives you a natural feel of 230 mph. Of course, there are some added sound effects, but I think they are good, they give a depth of driving scenes ...
