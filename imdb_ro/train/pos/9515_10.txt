One of my favorite films, with an extremely nostalgic ending. The film is about the Sullivan family, obviously that Michael Sullivan (the father) is one of the main members of the mafia, the killer who says so, and an expert. One of the children wants to know his father's work (a terrible mistake), so he's hiding on his father's car and well, he sees Tom Hanks in action to say that. <br /> <br /> Mafia no There are no rules in the Mafia no one wins, when they get out, they'll get you out. Of course, you can see someone working at the mafia with a huge house, the best car in the world no matter what you like, but doing a wrong job or doing something your boss does not want and you were fired, and he was killed . You can see what I mean in the movie, Sullivan Jr. sees something he did not have to see and, well, almost all his family is killed for that "wrong thing" his son did. The movie is very fun, you see how Sullivan lives after being watched by the mob or something. This movie is a little sad, shows us the revenge, those dirty work that people do, almost everything you like. Let's hope this guy reads this comment does not work for the mafia, and if you work at the mafia, do a favor and get it out of the country before being killed by your boss and their laborers. <br /> This film gets: 10/10
