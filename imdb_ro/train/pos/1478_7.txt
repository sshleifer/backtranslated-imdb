I liked this film, although halfway through, I managed to tell her who the secret admirer was. I also wonder if it's based on a true story because it told about "real people" at the end of the movie. I think I'll have to search him out and let you know. Does anyone remember what happened? I think they moved to North Carolina if I'm not mistaken. Of course, states could have been changed to protect the innocent. You would think this man might have figured out how easily I did. Was it bad or what?
