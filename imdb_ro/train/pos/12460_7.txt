Adio L'Ami / Honor Among Thieves is not perfect, but is a neat and fun thriller that sees Algerian French veterans of war, Alain Delon and Charles Bronson abducted in the same underground segments, one to return stolen links, others to to clean the two million employees who stay there over the Christmas weekend. Of course, things are not that simple, even after opening the vault, leading to some ups and downs. On the debit side, there is a bizarre scene of striptease in a car park, Bronson has a very irritating crisis phrase she uses at the most unfortunate moments, Brigitte Fossey, who probably sported the most hidden hair of the 1960s looks like a cheerleader whose wig is thrown behind her head by a strong wind) is there something to say? "I will cook spaghetti, I will teach you to love you, I will read Shakespeare!" Is the speech hysterical in all the wrong ways? and it's a shame about the last horizontal hour line, but otherwise it's a surprising number of fun and unpretentious, which deserves to check if you can find a decent print. Cinema Club UK DVD offers English only the soundtrack, but since Delon expresses his voice and the rest of the song is quite well-known, this is not a big issue, especially since the widescreen transfer is pretty good quality.
