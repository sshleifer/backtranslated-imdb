Well ... easy to watch TV serials ever. Tell me an e-mail cliche, but include violence, mafia, sex, gambling, drugs, etc. in a show and you already get points in my book. Combine all of this with action that goes beyond everything you've ever seen on the small screen, add the targeting that suits the age-old cinema and, above all, the blowing mind (and some brains along the way) and you've made spectacle that will be quite difficult to compete with. First, there are two actors, James Gandolfini like Tony Soprano, and Edie Falco as Carmela's wife ... as well as Gandolfini, fits his role in a way that words can not express unless you have it seen as you see it now! <br /> <br /> I can continue on every character in the show, psychological shine, scenes, etc., but you could not stop me, so all I can say is that it's just a show with Seinfeld , that I can always look from start to finish and enjoy even more.
