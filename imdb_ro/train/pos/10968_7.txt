Gray Gardens was delightful and crazy and you just could not really forget. He was so weird, funny, sad and sick and really no word can describe. The Gray Gardens movement is beyond the bizarre. I learned about this movie by reading the great bathroom reader from Uncle John, from the Bath Readers Institute, and it is worth hiring and colliding at the top of my film. This movie is about the most awkward most eccentric people who could ever have been filmed. One should look for his favorite Edie clothes, which are sure to include curtains. When I get older I almost want to be like Big Edie, moving my nose to normality and society.
