A horror film is shot and things are not going well. This is a masked killer. The director tells the killer the cast and crew. He goes mad and kills two people. He has committed suicide and the movie is never finished. Twelve years later, a bunch of students decided to try and finish it - but there's a curse. People trying to finish it are killed. Students ignore this. Guess what's going on yet? The plot is the old hat, but this is not bad ... for what it is (a movie with low budget slasher). It is well done with a young and talented young woman. No one is great, but none is terrible. It also avoids mandatory (and useless) nude scenes. It moves fast, the bore is beautiful and bloody, and the script does not offend your intelligence. Also, Molly Ringwald is still spending her life in a troubled actress. The old man does not move, but he is not bad at all. I give her a 7.
