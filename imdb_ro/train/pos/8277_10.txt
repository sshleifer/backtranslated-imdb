A haunting piece that the horror film fan of discernment will fall with gratitude. Keep your Freddys and Jason - this movie is in the same company as "Haunting" (the original). Liric and truthful, it stays with you much in the night, just like those terrible CBS Radio Mystery Theater shows. A smart rent.
