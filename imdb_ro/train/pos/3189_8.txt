This is one of the best cinematic / musical "B" movies I've seen (and since I'm 40 years old now and I just see this now, I'm not an expert, but I've seen all the movies known there). When there are a lot of actors taking their lead for a few minutes, the comedy usually interferes with the music bits and, very often, the musical pieces interrupt the comedy stream. Call me in a state of madness, but when I saw this on TCM Europe, I laughed loudly out of pleasure! So, who gave me the laugh? Undoubtedly, Mischa Auer gave me some terrible intestine laughter, even the end, it was great! Talking about this, I think why this movie works is because, although L & H is a point of sale (and why I grew to see him (her and Hal Roach), I love them in their stuff since the beginning of Hal Roach) these are at a minimum and remain properly on the ADULT tariff (until the 1930s, and not so far from today's standards if you read between lines). Jack Haley is also great to watch, I admit I only met him from W OZ and I loved him there and I laughed aloud here at his waiter in the show. Patsy Kelly is the only "ugly" woman in the 30s, which actually transforms me (something tells me it was a spitfire in real life); and the musical numbers have real workmanship (Busby Berkley'ish), which departed me from what I am used to. I could go on, but be sure I enjoyed this movie. 8 of 10 I have seen TCM Europe and I will register to watch my wife again on TCM USA. Good things!
