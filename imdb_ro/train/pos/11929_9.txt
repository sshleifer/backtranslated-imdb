A piece of trivia that is often forgotten by this family film is a business one. At that time, in 1994, this film held the record for the biggest film premiere in the history of the film (and may continue to you). It was held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania - undoubtedly in honor of the original movie "Angels", which "haunts" the Pittsburgh Pirates. In this remake, they "haunt" the California Angels. However, the premiere took place at the Three Rivers long gone stadium, which was Pitasburgh Pirates and Pittsburgh Steelers at that time (Pirates are now hosted at PNC Park and Steelers at Heinz Field). The premiere took place on a cinema screen that was five storeys high inside the stadium and held (and may continue to hold) the record for the biggest film premiere in history to the 60,000 fans. Danny Glover, Tony Danza and Christopher Lloyd were present at the admiration of thousands of sports fans.
