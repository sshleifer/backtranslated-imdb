A brilliant portrait of a traitor (Victor McLaglen in the role of Oscar) who is hunted by his conscience. McLaglen plays a red IRA who betray his leader to collect a reward during the Irish rebellion of Sinn Fein. Scenes showing battles and mob actions are very realistic, focusing on despair among individuals. Lack of hope for a better future seems to be a worse fate than death. Director John Ford superbly creates a troubled and tense atmosphere, enhanced by the misty and dirty image of the Irish landscape. Max Steiner's musical score adds cinematic delight. Oscar Winner also for Best Screenplay nominated for Best Picture. This is one of Hollywood's classic.
