This was a good movie with a strong message of love and redemption. I liked the brother's transformation and the repercussions of a horrible disease on the family. He acted well and well. If there was a defect, I should have said the story once again showed the typical suburban family and their difficulties. What about all the people in all cultural environments? I would love to see a movie in which all these cultures are presented - as in real life. However, the film has grown in terms of values ​​and understanding of how a disease can bring someone closer to his producer. He loved the movie and brought tears to my eyes
