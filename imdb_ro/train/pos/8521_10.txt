I loved this show absolutely. I watched her from the moment she first broadcast in the late 90's until the last episode. In my sincere opinion, it was a wonderful family drama that is so rare these days. Definitely a show you could watch with a friend or your kids. Yes, things have changed a bit with Jo since I last saw it in books, but it is still convincing of stories and good lessons. The actress who plays Jo Bhaer (Michelle Burke) is doing a great job, just like the actor who plays Nick Riley (Spencer Rochfort). Throughout the series we see the growing romance between Jo and Nick, as well as daily stories and lessons, children and students learn. I recommend this show to anyone.
