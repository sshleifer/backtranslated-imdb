Harvey Keital's best performance so far, the new century. Very nice shot, a beautiful snap-shot of pre-Castro Cuba. The story revolves around the nephew of a minor homicide boss who develops a friendship with an American Hollywood ties. This is the moment when a boy wakes up to the fact that the small circle of people he knows actually lives in a much wider, more complex world he does not yet understand. The script is powerful and humorous, the direction is clear. Moreover, a truly professional workplace that fits well with the tradition of Latin American cinema. The only weakness is the decision to shoot in synchronous English, rather than Spanish - probably to improve sales in the US. Unfortunately, this makes the movie a bit more convincing. But if you can see beyond this, you will find a sincere journey in another world. Recommended.
