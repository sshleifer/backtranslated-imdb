How can someone say it's bad is beyond me. I liked the show before I saw it. For 3 reasons, 1. The story intrigued me, 2. Jessica Alba and 3. James Cameron! Please ignore the bad comments and please watch the entire first season before you decide it's bad because I know that if you watch the first season you will LOVE and go out and buy Season 1 as well as Season 2 on DVD and then join, Get Your Campaign To Get Season 3 Made! <br /> <br /> I hate Fox and I'm sure a lot of your Dark Angel fans hate them too. They have something for Canning Good Shows! Do not you all agree?
