When I got my first N64 when I was five or six, I fell in love with him and my first game was Super Mario 64. And I loved him! The graphics were great for the time, a good plot, all the best music I've heard in a Nintendo game. I do not completely remember the plot, but I think Princess Peach was kidnapped by Bowser, and Mario must save her. the game is to get 120 stars out of the curses in the castle. Each of them had about five or six challenges to get the stars. There are relics of the castle, where you can get more stars. Of course, you beat Bowser. * I think there are three levels to beat Bowser on * Let's start with characters.Mario is the main character, and he gets useful tips from Toad, so he is basically one of your alliances but I just heard that Luigi and Yoshi are at the end of their game. The main character is Bowser, and there are a bunch of other characters like Boo and Goomba. Characters are very good. graphics? People say Gameplay is more important than graphics, and I completely agree. But with the great intrigue, there is great graphics. Especially because it's time. I have a lot of other Nintendo games like 007 and their graphics do not compare to Super Mario Bright colors, great effects and great sound effects. I found the graphics in the very good watercourses. Following the world of Bowser, it has the best graphics in the game. <br /> <br /> Now, music. This is my favorite part of the game. I grew up when I played this from a young age, I would like to go play all night so the music will dress me. Jolly Roger Bay, which was quiet and wonderful. There are others who are even better, especially in the world again with Bowser, who are the ones who keep me the most and are favorite. <br /> <br /> This game has been the favorite time favorite as a developing player, and he loves it. This game gets 10/10 or ***** (5) / ***** ( 5) GO PLAY THE GAME!
