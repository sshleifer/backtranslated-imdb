It was a bit bizarre and bad and I enjoyed it a lot, the characters in the show were great and complimented each other well. I was sick to see it was cut off. I would have liked to see where he could go. You found yourself leaning toward Luca Buck, the sheriff who had more secrets than anyone. Lucas was scary and attractive. And I would have liked to have seen more about him and how he became his character. However, I will buy the show just to enjoy, it was great at something different on TV. And Paige Turrco, the cousin of Caleb, was a great mystery about the place and what Lucas meant. It is a shame that it is not around yet .. or it has never been done, I would have liked to see what would have happened.
