For the spectator who comes after him, "Winchester" 73 has something in common with "Casablanca." As you watch it, you have the feeling that you are looking at a series of cliques that are so often encountered in that genre; then you realize that the clichés have become clichés only after they have been copied from this movie and that they have been copied so much because this movie was so great. In other words, it is a seminal work. <br /> <br /> "Winchester '73" is a joy to watch. The broad lines of the plot are somewhat predictable, but especially because you've seen them copied so many times in later movies, but still contain a series of twists and turns that surprise you. Mann's dialogue, rhythm and direction are excellent. Stewart shines especially, and if you're a fan is a must-see, but he's not alone in delivering a good performance. Remarkably, many of the most careful and / or spiritual lines go to minor characters. Because this makes these characters (much) more than cardboard cuts, it has given an extra realism to the movie. <br /> <br /> This is a remarkably undervalued movie, and it's worthwhile to keep an eye out. The DVD also contains an interview with Stewart, which offers some backgrounds about the film.
