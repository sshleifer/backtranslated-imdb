If you loved Long Way Round, you will enjoy this almost as much. It's educational, funny, interesting and tense. Charley divides the screen with two interesting colleagues, two tired mechanics, two excellent cameramen and too much Russ. Ewan makes some appearances, but Charley really pulls her out. He is funny, hired and yet a pile of stress and doubt. Extraordinary things! The series is packed in 7 episodes. Like LWR, training is almost as interesting as race. Even if they covered well and well, they could have explained the trucks and cars, which are just mentioned and rarely seen racing. It's a motorcycle movie and anyone on two wheels will love this. The series presents stunning photos as well as some interviews with the mouths of the people. Oops. There is another extremely appealing melody like the LWR, but it is not nearly as good as Stereophonics. If you live in the American god knows when it will be released so buy on Amazon.uk and watch it on the computer like me. Oh, and be prepared to buy another motorcycle.
