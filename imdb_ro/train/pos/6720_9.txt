Riders Giants <br /> <br /> This documentary tracks the history of the navigation and follows three well-made and appreciated surfer films, Endless Summer by Dana Brown, Endless Summer II by Bruce Brown, Dana's son and Step in Liquid IMAX). I saw the first, not the others. <br /> <br /> While the movie is spectacular, I have appreciated the greatest historical perspective of the filmmaker. It takes us back to the origin of sport nearly a hundred years ago and shows how it has evolved to its present form. This includes extensive interviews with personalities and leading artists, how the surfboard drawings changed over time, which the beaches of Hawaii and California were most frequented by world class surfers, and what adrenaline had given the athlete. Athletes lived on the beach for months, sailing from dawn to evening, straddling rustic beds, fishing for food, and going back to their planks the next day. What euphoric way to spend your youthful days. <br /> <br /> We see how the media has discovered and promoted sports after a slow start. What was the biggest impetus for this sport? Believe it or not, it was Gidget, though I suspect that copyright issues could hinder credit for Beachboys surfing songs, such as Surfer Girl and Surfing USA. Surfing and Encyclopedia of Surfing (who knew there was such a tone) were mentioned. We also see comments from sports pioneers, their families, and how the current generation benefited from origins in the 1960s. Such a story is how Laird Hamilton, 40, considered the the biggest surfer of today, linked to a previous surfer, presented her mother to herself, whom she married before becoming her stepfather. <br /> <br /> A refreshing musical backdrop of contemporary music from all ages accompanies the story. Have I swallowed your appetite? Wonderful. Make a wonderful trip.
