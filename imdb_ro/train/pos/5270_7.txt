This movie can be very bad, but it's really fun. Bad action and poor direction increase the hystericality of the film. Twins are very funny in their Conanesque roles. If you come into this movie waiting for the first Conan or Excalibur, then you will hate it. If you keep track of it while you are in good mood and accept it as a good, awesome fun, you will have a lot of time. Watch the scene where the brothers are trying to hang, the funniest scene in the movie. I want the Mystery 3000 Science Theater to have done this!
