The first two thirds of this Betty Page fetish biopic are very interesting. Betty, as she is portrayed with enormous sincerity by Gretchen Mol, meets up as a nice, girl-like guy who does not see anything wrong with what she was doing (and certainly was not "wrong" with her). Director Mary Harron, who also made "I filmed Andy Warhol" and "American Psycho," recharges America to Betty, mixing old black and white black and white black and white. Once Betty lands in Florida and starts work with Bunny Yeager, the color is introduced. Betty's notoriety was largely the result of his work with Paula and Irving Klaw (Lili Taylor in a great performance, and Chris Bauer) as well as John Willie (Jared Harris). The scenes in which Harron recreates Betty's sessions of shooting are fascinating and fairly executed. The first providers of fetish material are not portrayed too convincingly, and we have a feeling that these people were part of a "close" community. Betty has never had much of a problem with her notoriety, though we have the impression that her reputation has prevented her from gaining legitimacy in the cinematic world. Since the third act of the film is virtually non-existent, I have the impression that I have been watching a lengthy documentary on Betty Page, not a structured drama. Far, it's a movie worth capturing and it's still a fine spot in the head of producer Christine Vachon.
