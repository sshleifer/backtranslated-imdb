Good. As you can see, this is one of your favorite movies, if not preferred. This is a drama of absolutely hilarious characters. The main character is a businessman who is stuck in a "the same thing, another day" mentality. He sees a woman who looks melancholy at the window of a dance studio in her daily train and wonders about her and decides to find out more about her. He decides to join the dance class just to find out he is not the instructor. From there, he binds with four other dancers and learns to enjoy dancing and learn about the mysterious woman. There is no free sex (or whatever) involved, as a small group of people learn how to form and develop friendships. This movie has been remodeled with Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez, and the new one, while the attractor is not at all pleasing to the original. The film has never made it big in America because it was not eligible for Oscars because it was broadcast on television in Japan (films can not be televised or disqualified for Oscar nominations). He has won numerous awards in Japan for best film, distribution, director, etc. for the Oscar Awards.
