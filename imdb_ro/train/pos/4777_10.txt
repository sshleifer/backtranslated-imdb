Perhaps the most personal of David Lynch's works are the most accessible. This time, rather than the enigmatic thematic structures that may or may not involve a plot or represent a bit more than a nightmare, Lynch offers reflexive and fragile meditation on the universal subjects of aging and family and finds reassurance in both. The simple story of a farmer in Iowa (Richard Farnsworth), who runs a lawn mower in Wisconsin to visit his alien and defeated brother, is still a bunch of unique and original visual scenes (some pretty striking aerial photographs of hearts, filmed by cinematographer veteran Freddy Francis) to make an indisputable Lynch effort and characterizations that are some of his most unforgettable. Farnsworth is excellent in a stoic and pleasant manner, allowing the stories I hear on his journey to become a part of his life, and Sissy Spacek turns into a part of the most beautiful work in a smaller role as the daughter it was mentally challenged, the secret is revealed in a strange way, by a slight return in the sensible scenario by John Roach and Mary Sweeney), but the rest of the small cast for one person offers indelible performances, one of the most notable being Barbara Robertson, whose accidental killing of the deer is both ugly and sad at the same time. But this is the Lynch harvest, with its ability to engage and disturb you to the fullest. For those who are not familiar with Lynch or know it only because of its violent and disturbing reputation, this is a great place to start; for those who know his work, this is one of the best in his repertoire.
