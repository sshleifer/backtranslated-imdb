A ugly, ugly retro-action thriller about a bodyguard who is determined to find (and destroy!) The killers of the girl she was supposed to protect. This film is almost an anachronism in the right atmosphere of our day. Director Scott has no desire to apologize for the inherent immorality behind the film's dramatic structure. Scott does not know or cares about 30 years of social advances. I really do not think we'll soon see a more violent movie, so you'd better go and see it while you can. In spite of his relentless complaint, I think film is a powerful example of cinema at the most sinister, exploitative and effective. Scott has something hard to sell, but I think I'm a buyer. The extraordinary technical aspects of this movie are too effective to ignore me. Scott's directorial scenes are just amazing and he's doing a great rendition by Denzel Washington. The sensitive soul has to stay away from it, but I have recommended it to those spectators who are looking for an extraordinary, action-packed film.
