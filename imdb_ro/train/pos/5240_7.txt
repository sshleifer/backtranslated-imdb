Some of the actors were a little suspicious. I remember that Alexander Walker (critic Evening Standard, OK, now dead) released a movie about this film saying it was a shame describing NI Protestants as killers. Now, with all NI protesters, this film is freely based on Shankill (loyalists) who have traveled to Belfast in the 1970s. Believe me, they have not been called butchers for nothing. my main death about this movie is that it does not show any ray of light or hope, it's all doom & gloom, I mean the little girl at the end has to die. Perhaps it sounds like this, but it might have been the tact that not all Prods & Tiags are bad or all good either.
