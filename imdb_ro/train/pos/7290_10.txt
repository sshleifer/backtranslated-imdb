After some extremely good ratings up to the SUPERB point, I was extremely pleased with the film. The film was dark, moving, anger, grief, guilt, and a very convincing demon. I initially expected to see many special effects and, as a lover's comfort, gave me out with its subtlety and correctness. Brian, I'm back with your soul along with your story and your concern for the special effects. You will go much, buddy. I will surely be the president of your fan club. Eric Etebari, Best Actor Award, was the number one choice. You made Jr. Lopez look like a child compared to Kasadya. :) <br /> <br /> In general, the line of acting, story, high quality movies and great effects has been fantastic. I wish it was more. I look forward to The Dreamless, with extremely high expectations.
