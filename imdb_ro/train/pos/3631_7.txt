The movie actually has a pretty good story, but it's stuck in several key places. It's almost like the director cast the film together without taking the time to make some essential cuts in the movie. Dennis Quaid does a pretty decent job in his role ... but something is clearly devoid of some key scenes. This 2.5 hour film could have been reduced to about 2 hours of film. And it would have been a better movie if he did not feel like he'd thrown together. <br /> <br />
