I watched personally to see the 1960s and '70s. It was fascinating to find out how the drug movement began, and it became the pope culture and eventual uncompromising force in life. Interviews of classic rock stars are titilatoare and humorous. You feel like you are in a secret and at the same time the head of the head ... because it feels so good and familiar. I liked all segments of the 1960s-present. I highly recommend this for all aspects, including rock music, driver movement, politics and good history. I checked the box by saying that it contains a spoiler just because I have no idea what to consider as a spoiler or not in this regard because we discussed what is happening in the 4 segments so I wanted to be in safety.
