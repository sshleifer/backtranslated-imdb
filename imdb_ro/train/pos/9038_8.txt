I liked October. What I liked most was music. It worked in two ways: in the first hour of the film, it gives the spectator a period of time. This is done by playing songs from the late fifties. In the second hour, an instrumental score takes over. Music fits perfectly with the film's mood. Not only did I enjoy music, but I also enjoyed the song. Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer Hickam was a surprise to me. He gave up first-class performance, like Chris Owen (Quentin) and Chris Cooper (John Hickam). I've seen this movie about the life span already set for you two times now, and both times I enjoyed myself.
