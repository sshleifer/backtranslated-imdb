I hate long-lasting French films, but my favorite film of all time is the longest and most prominent French film of all this. I saw her twice in the mid-70s, then disappeared. But eventually I managed to see her again in 1999 and I fell in love again. What is most remarkable is that she feels just as bad today as she did 25 years ago. If you have not seen him, do not miss the chance!
