If I did not see this movie in 20 years, I'm still impressed by its tough impact and star action. Of course, a gentleman, Mickey Rooney, is really INCREDIBLE in his role as "Killer" on the ring. (Referring to another review here, none other than Orson Welles evoked the name of the greatest actor Mickey Rooney). I also remember the jazz-brassy score and the naked black and white photograph. I like Mick's last line before leaving the lead poisoning dose. (I think the Stranglers have picked it up for a line in one of their songs - Grip on Yourself.) This is a great movie and ungrafted film. Let's get out! Side-bye - A recent review of the Film Review magazine made a great story about Don Segal's "Babyface Nelson", a few years before "Last Mile" and Mickey Rooney. Another zeal for Mick's intense and sympathetic performance. Perhaps it is the beginning of a strike to appreciate truly superior cinematic performances.
