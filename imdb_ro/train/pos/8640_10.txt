This movie is great! Brad Pitt will never be able to interpret the performance he has made in this movie. Duchovny was top, like Forbes and Lewis. The four main characters engage in a scenic panoramic tour of historical murder sites in one of the hottest cars ever made, the 1960s Lincoln Continental. Early Grace is a simpleton with a taste for dry toothbrushes and carnage. She likes women not to curse or smoke and wear PWT dresses. Duchovny and Forbes are a pair of artists in the city, while Early and Lewis are caravan parks in rural outskirts. Even though the majority of the movie is dark, there are plenty of fun scenes. Writing, conducting and interpreting are brilliant. If you like road movies, killing, humor and storytelling, watch this movie. Everyone offers and you will want more when credits roll down. One of my preferences of all time. "hey ... laughs that dog to teach him to hunt!"
