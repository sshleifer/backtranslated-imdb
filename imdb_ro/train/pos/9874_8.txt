In this 1943 film, Judy Garland is considered not to be ready for the longest time by the man who loves her - Van Heflin. This movie was certainly a big change for Mr. Heflin, especially after winning the Oscar a year earlier in "Johnny Eager". Was not Byington spring too old to be the widowed mother of five children, four of whom seemed to resemble her grandchildren? Songs and dances are just great, but the way the flourishing romance between Heflin and Garland has been described has left many things desirable. She was a Gigi guy, in which a young girl is finally shattered by a charmer.
