Tom Hanks was in films like Forrest Gump, Save the Private Ryan and The Green Mile. For the most part, his roles were good boys he calls. In Road to Perdition, his character Michael Sullivanis is slightly different. In Sam Mendes 'Road to Perdition, based on Max Allan Collins' graphic novel, he portrays the story of a man and his son on the road during the Great Depression in Chicago. What is different about this little road trip is that Sullivan is a man who was hunted by his former partner. His boss or former head John Rooney (Paul Newman) loves him more than his son, Sullivan's partner, Connor (Daniel Craig). After the misconduct of Connor, the only witness to his mistake is Sullivan and his son who should not have been there. So Connor is trying to get Sullivan and his family out, but only the wife and the other, Peter's son. Sullivan overcame the shot and hurries home to find Michael Jr. sitting at the table ... just sitting. With his wife and dead child, Sullivan is on his way to find answers. The story follows the two as Sullivan tries to do things in memory of his wife and child, and for Michael who feels he is the blame for all this. He feels that his curiosity has killed his mother and his brother. Tyler Hoechlin does a wonderful job like Michael Jr. He brings maturity and also a feeling of being still minor. His loss of innocence is well done while he travels from city to town, leaving nothing behind him. Mendes's previous film was American Beauty, which received five Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director. This film did almost as good at Oscar winning only a prize for best cinema but received five other nominations for music, sound and a best actor in support of Paul Newman. This picture is a wonderful story that makes you walk through the Midwest and make the legend of Mike Sullivan: husband, beggar and devoted father. This movie is a sleeping film that should be watched for years.
