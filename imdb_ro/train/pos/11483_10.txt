The thing that makes this movie so scary is how it portrays Andre and Calvin as (relatively) normal guys. These are certainly not people who want to become professional filmmakers when they hide in front of the room, forget the script lines, etc. They just make the video as a diary to show "survivors" how normal their lives were. Their parents think the boys are filming for a family movie. By researching other children attacking their schools, Andre and Calvin learn not to do and inform (potentially, in a bad way about "The Old House") any potential "Andres and Calvin" who could watch this video how make bombs, get weapons and do not get caught before Day Zero (the day of the attack).
