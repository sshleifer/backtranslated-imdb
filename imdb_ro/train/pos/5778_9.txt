Despite budget constraints, this is a great movie, proof that effort and imagination can overcome the lack of money. The opening, where cave paintings seem to show that some dinosaurs at least survived in the age of humans, is a beautiful red herring. Then a meteor falls into a lake and causes heat that in turn causes the hatching of a frozen dinosaur egg (perhaps the paintings in the cave suggest it is not the first time that happened). When the prehistoric beast appears, it is a well animated Plesiosaur, which soon causes disparities in the local area. Okay, so it's not Jurassic Park, but it's still real fun for fans of monster movies.
