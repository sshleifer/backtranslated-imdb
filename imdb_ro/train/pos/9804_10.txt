"Batman: The Mystery of the Batwoman" is about as fun as the animated Batman movies. <br /> <br /> While still true with comic books, animation is made easier than in animated series. Bruce Wayne looks the same as in the past, but now seems less imposing. Dick Grayson Robin was replaced by Tim Drake Robin less nervous, younger. Kevin Conroy, as usual, invoked Batman's voice better than most live actors. <br /> <br /> Kelly Ripa made a much more decent job than the one we expected. As in the live film Batman, the film lives or dies on the quality of the wicked. My favorite favorite, Penguin, is here. His design is more elegant than he has ever seen, listening more to Burgess Meredith's image of the 1960s than Danny DeVito's portrait of "Batman Returns." David Ogden Stiers is the perfect choice for Penguin's voice. The penguin is finally portrayed as a sly sophisticated, as it appears most often in the comic strip. Hector Elizondo's voice creates a Bane that is more memorable than the unforgettable version of "Batman & Robin." And finally, Batman has a mystery of descent to solve, putting "Detective" back in "Detective Comics" (that's what "DC" means, after all.) The Revolution to the Mystery is a delightful turn of anger . > <br /> The score adds to the mysterious ambience of the movie. It sounds like a mixture of the "Poirot" score and the "Mission: Impossible" score. Generally, it's more fun than your average drawing.
