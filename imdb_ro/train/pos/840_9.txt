He was not sure what to expect from this movie. I like to see Brosnan in any movie, he's always good, but that was completely different. It is a mess and it plays a mess very well. In fact, he reminded me a few times back in a uni :) So yes, there is not much violence, it is not a lot of action, but the dialogue is cracking, the act is gorgeous and very refreshing and it is quite fun too :) No I think you're going out of the cinema going "Wow, I've been defeated," but you'll come out smiling after you've enjoyed a good movie. I can not ask for more than that. Oh, and if you're lucky, a fool puts your ad in the bar and you'll be reversed, inversely, reversed (with reversed sound) advertising! Brilliant. There's nothing like seeing an ad Jack Daniels where the drink comes back in glass from the glass with an American commentary "Twin Peaks"
