I really enjoyed this version of "Vanishing Point", unlike the 1971 version. I found the 1971 version quite dull. If I can pick up in the middle of a movie a few times (as I did with the 1971 version) than with me, it's not that great. Of course, this may be due to the fact that I was only nine when the 1971 version was removed. However, I have seen many remakes, where I liked the original and the oldest. We found that the 1997 version was easier to understand and kept the original without undermining the meaning of the 1971 version. In my opinion, I felt that the 1997 version was more enthusiastic and not so "blasted" (Boring)
