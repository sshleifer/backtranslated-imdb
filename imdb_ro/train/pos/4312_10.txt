If you have not seen this excellent movie about life in the 90s (in L.A.), then you have missed a special treatment. This is one of the most stunning and powerful films ever made about the lives of Americans in the 1990s and even heading for the world we live in today. It covers everything from raising a child, bias (more than one way) love, adultery, empty nest syndrome, selfishness, etc., and the list goes on. This story rises to a final climax, and when nothing else matters, she always returns to love with friends, family, and love of life. It helps us dig deep into ourselves and make us look for what we want in life. It makes us ask ourselves about ourselves. We have done enough for others, we are like this, etc. ??? Stay back and enjoy a wonderful and emotional movie that I'm sure others will enjoy for a lifetime. Take note of Mary McDonnell, Kevin Kline and Danny Glover's wonderful performance through this whole movie. These actors are amazing and really show the true splendor and significance of the message that is sent to all of us. These are three of my favorite actors for life after seeing this movie 10 years ago. I'm glad once more again and again. Also enjoy the wonderful soundtrack with her and do not forget to count how many times do you see the helicopter flight and try to realize it is symbolism for the movie? I almost forgot that he is probably the first Steve Martin acting in any movie he ever did. He also has an excellent job in this movie. This can be a surprise for most of you. Stay back, relax and enjoy a really good movie .....
