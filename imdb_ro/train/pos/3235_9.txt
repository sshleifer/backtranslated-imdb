Excellent film, a realistic picture of contemporary Finland, touching and profound. One of the finest finnish films ever made. Loves everyday life in a small town in central Finland, people's desires and weaknesses, joys and tribulations. The bright early sun of autumn creates a cold atmosphere for this lucid examination of people in a welfare society. Lampela is indeed one of the most promising Finnish films. He shows that it is possible to make captivating movies without machine guns and shedding blood. Her next film, Eila, also deserves to be seen, though the story of cleaning women fighting for their job is not as appealing as the Joki destinies.
