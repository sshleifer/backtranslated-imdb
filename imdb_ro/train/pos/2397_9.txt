After seeing and loving Greg Lombardo's most recent film, "Nodes" (co-wrote and directed that feature), I decided to see his previous work and this movie deserved the effort and hiring . Macbeth in Manhattan is a tongue in the cheek, enjoys excellent Shakespeare's favorite, updates and moves to NYC. I was impressed by the underlined scenario and intelligence, and I was amazed at how the production story of the film reflects the story of the play itself - and very clever about it. Attempts and troubles of Manhattan life parallel to a Shakespeare play, and the Central Park was rarely used for better use than the forest surrounding Macbeth's castle. Mr. Lombardo obviously has a good place in his heart for the stories in New York and New York (Knots are a funny and hot sex comedy, about sixty thirty people in New York, located first in a charming neighborhood in Brooklyn, with offices in Manhattan and a downtown corridor to a great extent) and spent much time around Shakespeare's plays. The film is well adapted and the story reflects a deep understanding of essential drama in the center of Macbeth. He remembered Al Pacino's song "Looking for Richard" - another wonderful Shakespeare movie "In a Motion Picture". I very much recommend checking Macbeth in Manhattan.
