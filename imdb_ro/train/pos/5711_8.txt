At Le Million, Rene Clair, one of the great filmmakers and great pioneers, has created a gentle comedy gem that, with all its ease, is a brilliant and profoundly technical film that has clearly influenced filmmakers such as the Marx, Lubitsch, and Mamoulian brothers. Complot, a witty tale of a poor artist who wins a big lottery jackpot, but who has to freneticly search all over the city for the missing ticket, is basically just a device to support a series of funny comic scenes, adopted in a dream world the director's imagination. One of the most impressive things about this film is that although it is in the middle of Paris and does not include anything really impossible, it touches a sustained and implicit story / fantasy atmosphere in which it is natural for people to sing as much as they speak or that a scam over a stolen jacket should take the form of a football game. Another memorable feature is that Le Million includes what can be the funniest work ever done on the film (A soprano braided by the blonde! "Laughing, ha! Ha!") It is also a delight that distribution: Clair has gathered a group stunning characters, different actors, each illustrating with a satirical moral precision a French bourgeois "guy", so the film seems like a set of Daumier prints to come to life. Iaryness takes a bit to run, and I found the characters not so moving as they can even be in a light comedy (as they are, for example, in many Lubitsch films.) For these reasons, I gave up giving the highest rating. But these minor cages should not distract from an enthusiastic recommendation. If you see her? By all means. Highly recommended if you want classic and influential cinema or just a fun comedy.
