Terry Gilliam traveled again in the future (he already did in "Brazil") to tell this story about a virus that destroys the human race. The script is completely crazy with some light tricks on it, but it's pretty fun and Gilliam proves he has imagination (futuristic scenes are wonderful). As for the distribution, Bruce Willis and the beautiful Madeleine Stowe (what happened to her?) I'm fine, but Brad Pitt is so annoying, whenever he plays roles that are in his hand, it results so forcefully and not is credible at all. He should just play successful young people successful. <br /> <br /> * My Ratio: 7/10
