This movie was amazing. It had an original concept (the one of a vampire film that meets Yakuza mob). It is a humorous and yet extremely dramatic and tragic film about friendship, love, immortality, death and happiness, and subtly comment on society. From Gackt Camui's part, Sho's role was excellent, and HYDE was surprisingly good for his first film as the tortured and humorous vampire, Kei. I also laughed and yelled at the happy Toshi, who grew up with Sho. I liked every second of this film, especially moments like the funny scene, battle scenes and, above all, the end of the heart.
