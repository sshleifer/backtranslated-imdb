Basically, the movie could be one of the most fascinating titles made by any of the two Scotts (Ridley and Tony). Let's make it right, the movie was worth the hype as one of the most stylish actresses / thrillers ever made. When it comes to the tragically dissatisfied heroes, Denzel Washington and Tony Scotts make a perfect duo. Both this movie and Deja Vu are the better thrillers you can expect. Washington felt very comfortable in the steady rooms and in all the scenes of the film's execution. One was easily linked to the emotions of his character, so they enjoyed all the road crimes. It is a success that they have created a super-dark Mexico city with many tricks that happen. One would be easily convinced of the degree of corruption described in Man On Fire. I do not know what the Mexicans would think when watching her ... Well, let's do it again. It is among the best of the kind "Death Wish", but also suffered much of the violence. It is a little annoying that they justify the actions of a vigilant, making the film very realistic and have let Denzel Washington interpret the "sheepless hero" of a tragic hero. Eventually, they even kidnapped shot in their own pool as a documentary. I checked IMDb if the movie was based on real events for this ... So that's for you to consider if you also find the movie theme is a bit fake. Finally, I hope someone would not make this movie real. 8/10 for art / publishing / cinema / Denzel Washington.
