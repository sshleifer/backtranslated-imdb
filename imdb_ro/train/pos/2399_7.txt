This was a hit at last year's South By Southwest (SXSW) film festival in Austin and features a fine piece, led by Gloria Reuben from E.R., and a sculptor John Glover. Although shot in a small NYC budget, the film looks and sounds fabulous and takes us to a stage behind the stage by rehearsing and assembling actors called "Scottish Games" as a reference to the word "Macbeth" thinking of bringing the curse old part of the play. The acting company presents all the emotions of the game itself, lust, jealousy, anger, suspicion and a bit of fun. The games begin when an accomplished actor is replaced (in the lead role) by a famous "beautiful girl" on stage TV soap opera to attract the bigger crowd. The green-monster takes over from there and the drama unfolds nicely. Good music and good performance around. The DVD includes directories comments and some deleted scenes as well.
