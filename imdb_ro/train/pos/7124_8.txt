Quite a little imaginative film and not just for kids. John Thaw is brilliant as always (without any hint of Inspector Morse about him). The boy who played William did a good job, although I did not find it convincing in every scene. I liked the whole feeling of the small village and the slower rhythm of life in those times. I also felt the scenes in London, where it was exactly from the historical point of view, as far as I could say. He reminded me of a Scandinavian film that I saw a few years ago, called the Mother of God. This film included a boy who was evacuated from Finland to Sweden during the Second World War. The family wife who took her asked for a girl because (apparently) she lost her daughter. Let's take a boy instead, completely ignore him. The fact that the boy speaks Finnish complicates things even more. I recommend this movie to Goodnight Mr. Tom, it has the same feeling.
