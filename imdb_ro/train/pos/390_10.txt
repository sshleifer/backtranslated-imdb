The first thing I thought when I saw these movies was: It's not really a movie, at least we do not imagine it spontaneously when we hear the word "movie." is entirely symbolic, all that has a figurative meaning in it. So if you are not accustomed to expressing anything in a symbolic way, you will find it strange, if you are not familiar with philosophy, religion, spiritual life, you will think it is just a fairy tale ... and even a weird, chaotic one. For me "Legend of Zu" is perfectly transparent. And I like it. She tells us in the pictures the story of the struggle between light and darkness, the struggle that is as old as humanity, and every one who is looking for meaning in this life is confronted with it. The film is obviously made by Buddhists. I'm not Buddhist. My religion and world and human vision are different. But as long as we are all human and have the same human nature, we have common experiences and we can understand each other. It's a beautiful movie! And I've had several movies like that - movies that make sense. There are too many empty stories that are good only to make time pass faster.
