The British magazine seems to have focused on the fact that reviewers tend to know Toby Young, the real-life journalist who relies on this film. The keyword here is "based". How to lose friends is a Romcom fiction. Sidney Young joins a prestigious gossip magazine in New York, where he continues to blunder after the blunder before finally going to the right and doing it. This involves him selling it, and the film has some serious points to do about journalistic integrity. However, they are not exaggerated: the main substance remains a comedy that centers around Sidney's misadventures. The script has a cake and ate it in the fact that Sidney is a stupid and well-defined buffoon at the same time being a smart, moderately dishonest, skilled writer. This contradiction is never a big deal, because Simon Pegg (as Sidney) is planning too much. Jeff Bridges throws Sidney's editor a little too quickly, and Kirsten Dunst is rather anonymous, the subject of Sidney Si's affections, as far as Megan Fox (staring bimbo airhead) is concerned, I can only say, say the word, Miss Fox , and I'll let my wife sell all my stuff and get the plane ticket to take my place for you. Of course, since I am a 56-year-old English accountant, you may not find the offer too attractive, but anyway there is a table on the table. Considering how short the career has been so far, it might be thought that it's a little too early for Megan Fox to take on a role that undoubtedly brings to light the kind of actress that might be considered to become: however, it makes it sweet, abilities, and extremely sexual. This girl will go away. There is strong support from a variety of experienced artists - Miriam Margolyes and Bill Paterson from the UK, Gillian Anderson and Danny Huston from the United States. <br /> <br /> There are more moments of laugh-out, and I smiled the most. As always, word F makes appearances when it does not need it, although at least some of these are very funny.
