This is a very easy comedy about a wonderful family who has a son called Pecker because he's using Peck for his food. Pecker loves to make all sorts of pictures of people in a small suburb in Baltimore, Maryland, and manages to attract the attention of a group of photo lovers in New York. Pecker has a nice sister, who simply goes nuts over SUGAR and is actually an ADDICT, taking sugar spoons from a bag. There are scenes of men showing the pieces in their jockey with grinding and jerking movements doing almost the same thing. It's hard enough to keep your mind from the gutter with this movie, but who cares, is just a movie that gives you some laughs at a simple picture made in 1998.
