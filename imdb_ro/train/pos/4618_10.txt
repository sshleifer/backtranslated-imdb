I really enjoyed this movie. I was fifteen when this movie came out and I could refer. This will be a movie I would show the children to tell them, their feelings are normal. It's fun to see how we would be so devoted to things from such a young age ... who knew we would come back ... again and again ... Great movie !!!!
