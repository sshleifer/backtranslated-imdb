Paul Hennessy and his wife Cate has to deal with the two teenage daughters and a strange son ... But after John Ritter's premature passage, the show has become more about coping with a lover's loss ... < I found this show, going through the channels after an afternoon and I have to say I laugh myself, until my pains were painful, simply by lot of characters; the lines full of sorcery, and the situation in which Paul will deal mostly with his daughters ... Since then I have caught the rest of the show when I was free and I have to say that the writing was very good ... But then I read about John Ritter's death ... Shortly thereafter, I saw part 2 of "Goodbye," and I must say that I was almost in tears, watching the emotions of the characters, losing the loved one ... How Rory gives a wall in anger and frustration. .. How much does she have to sleep in her own bed ... Briget and Kerry were talking about what he should have done. But the show does not go any further, bringing with him Jim Egan and CJ Barnes, who laugh at sea, Cate's father tries to protect his family and give Rory "talk about man" ... But the real jewel is CJ ... who is absolutely hilarious as a wild cousin. <br /> <br /> It will always be the masterpiece of John Ritter.
