If anyone ever wonders if cinema is a form of art, you can do worse than directing it to this movie. Quite simply, it's the perfect combination of storytelling, script, actors and cinema that have ever embarked on celluloid. <br /> <br /> The story of a condemned bomber pilot who is missed by his heavenly ruler in English fog during the Second World War, and his subsequent brushes with the Celestial Authorities (or is in the head) with David's couch Niven and Kim Hunter, and is incredibly touching - especially in opening scenes when the condemned pilot (Niven) describes his situation to the ground operator (Hunter). The feeling of the past is exalted by Jack Cardiff's photography and incredible production design. The supreme attributes extend to the rays of heavens that appear in black and white scenes in the Technicolor - this is even mentioned by the heavenly conductor (a fantastic Marius Goring). <br /> <br /> Not only a climax in British cinema, but a point of reference in cinematography, period.
