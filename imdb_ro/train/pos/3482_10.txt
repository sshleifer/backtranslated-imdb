This is my first comment on the IMDb site, and the reason I'm writing is that we're talking about one of the best movies ever! - Need! it will make you laugh and cry at the same time, you will fall in love (if you are not a fan yet!) with the Georgian choir singing tradition and you will eventually accept the hardships of your own existence and you will feel good after you look :) what I like about this movie is that actors in non-conducting roles create live and memorable characters and are as interesting and important as the central character. The film plays Vahtang Kikabidze (which is great), but you will remember every aspect of the film. You will find quoting their lines, which have become a household name for so many Russian-speaking people. A movie to live with. Simple but profound, you'll want to watch it again and again.
