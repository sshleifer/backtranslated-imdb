I was a Star Trek fan as long as I remember. When they announced the planning and the premiere of the fifth series, I was very excited. Premier Enterprise deserved the expectations. It was well done with the perfect setting and great work done by all the characters. NX-01, Enterprise is the perfect bowl to show the beginning of what many people have come to love. Scott Bakula was just superior to Captain Jonathan Archer. Jolene Blalock gave a commanding performance as T'Pol Subcommander. That only two of this awesome new crew fall in love to take us into the great history of the Starfleet. The business seems to be a good series that is worth watching and I recommend that. Look.
