Orson Welles manages to beat my ass with every picture I see. Lady of Shanghai is at the same level as its other masterpieces, The Ambersons Magnificent, Touch of Evil, The Process and Chimes at midnight. The plot may sometimes be confused, and sometimes it seems to be moving too little, too fast (about an hour of time was edited when test projections were bad). However, it does not matter. You can not watch Welles' movies and you can concentrate too much on the plot. Its direction defines what direction it is. Almost every scene in this movie can withstand any other scenes she has guided. Check the court room. Usually these are stock scenes that can not bear. In this case, try to stick to Welles' own speech near the end of Compulsion. To the lady of Shanghai, you just have to be careful about the level of detail in the scene of that meeting. Follow the oath that sneezes and interrupt the procedures. Or just take a look at the light in that scene. I know, it's just a simple Venetian blind, and it's been used constantly in new crime films and movies of the time, but Welles offers it its own beauty. Dialogue is also remarkable. Welles had the ability, an ability that no one else seemed to have, to make a murder film containing examples of the greatest poetry. Whether he talked about Shakespeare or spit from hot lines, he had the power to move his soul. 10/10.
