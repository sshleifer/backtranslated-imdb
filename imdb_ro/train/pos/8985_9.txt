Although DiG! has been hailed as being closest to what the music industry is as if it's very manufactured. The director has misled the audience to believe that Brian Jonestown's massacre has disappeared from the face of the post-'98 earth. And the rivalry between Dandy Warhols and Jonestown was milled. The truth of this issue is not really exposed in this film. That said, this movie is extremely cozy and is an interesting watch because we look at two groups of highly talented musicians who create their art. One of the best things this movie has made is a unique perspective between the indie music scene and the larger corporate scene. Recommended especially for music and the two fantastic bands.
