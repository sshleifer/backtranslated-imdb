This is a good movie, but it's not recommended if you do not like smart movies. It's about two guys who want the world to disappear, and that's what they get. The actor is great, the conclusion was not predictable and actually had a good story unlike most movies these days. People complain that the movie is too simple or too boring. I think it should only stay on movies like Avenger Toxic (Actually, I love B films) or Grim Adventures to Billy and Mandy. A note: if you notice this, they have exactly the same Cube actors, except for four actors. Make two notes: Wait for credits (trust me). Enjoy the movie.
