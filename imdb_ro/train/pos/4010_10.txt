In my mind, it remains one of Superman's best representations on television, as well as one of the most faithful for a comic period. This series paid tribute to both the Superman films of the 1970s and 1980s and Superman's reboot series of 1986 ("Steelman," "Superman Vol 2", "Comics of Action," Adventures of Superman, etc. The opening score and titles were shaken, based on the John Williams score in the movies, updated for Saturday morning action series Marv Wolfman, one of the main contributors to comic reboot (the writer "Adventures of Superman" ) was a perfect choice to be involved in this animated series. "The series had a more mature feel as it continued to be very friendly to children, and Superman was portrayed as credible, powerful and iconic. his recurring was Lex Luthor in his megalomanic / CEO's incarnation Daily Planet, Lois, Jimmy and Perry characters were portrayed well One of my favorite appearances was Wonder Woman and the story rolled around its island of Themyscira ("Paradise Island"). Both her design and that of her mother, Hippolyte, were in line with the similar Wonder Woman cartoon series in the era, and it seemed that an animated series just as well made could have been developed for her if it were treated the same. > <br /> The only thing hard to believe is that it was not released on DVD / Blu-ray! It deserves to be.
