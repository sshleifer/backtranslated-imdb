A couple (Janet and Richard) go camping in the woods near a huge swamp. After camping and enjoying nature, the couple shelters themselves in what they think is an abandoned farmhouse. Soon, a pair of escaped convicts appeared and, after a long delay of inevitability, they continued to kill Janet and close Richard in a pussy. This LAST HOUSE on the left film must be one of the most subtle horror films ever made. He is one of the worse and twisted shooters of the 1970s. Moreover, I realized that this is quite delightful and beautiful in its perverse tone. I like TERROR CAGED. Music definitely helps to provide a sense of personality to the movie as well as plenty of beauty. I find that the movie is pretty creepy. The flaws are mainly related to the rhythm of the movie, that is, the film is slow and meandering. While I was not disturbed by the rhythm of the beauty and suspense of the film in question, I think it will be so many people. The act is not good or dialogue, at least in early scenes. This film has much more patience than usual and is not for everyone. In short, it was a good movie. It's not the biggest horror film I've ever seen, but it's certainly very fun. It's not even the simplest movie you find. You may find it in the USED section of a bunch of stores if you look pretty hard. It's not for everyone, but if you're a fan of cinema, then it's worth checking out.
