When I first saw "A murder in the dark," I had no idea what the plot was. But when I saw her, I was shocked by what she represented. When we saw it for the second time in an Australian class, we did a second: communication problems. See, when a dingo snatched Lindy Chamberlain's child (Meryl Streep), she and her husband Michael (Sam Neill) were upset, but they did not show it. As Seventh-day Adventists, they believed that God wanted this to happen, and so they could not jest. But when people across Australia saw their lack of sadness, everyone began to think that Lindy did it alone. The point is that the wrong message was communicated to the public and turned people against Lindy. Even if it was a clean accident, it happened. It can be one of the biggest disasters resulting from the existence of the media, regardless of the political opinion of any media. In terms of performance, Streep does a very good job with an Australian accent (no surprise there), and Sam Neill is as big. You'll probably suffocate just what you see here. Definitely one of Fred Schepisi's best movies.
