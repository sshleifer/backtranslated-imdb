The movie "Moonstruck" is a wonderful little movie, directed by the gorgeous storyteller, Norman Jewison, Fiddler on the Roof, The Hurricane. The film is great on many levels. It shows a good slice of Italian culture, has a moving story and, best of all, is a hilarious comedy. One thing I liked most in the film was the relatively unconventional aspect of the actors. Nicolas Cage seems weird for most of the movie, and Cher ... well, Cher always seems a little weird. Generally, it's a fun and easy-to-recommend movie. <br /> <br /> 7
