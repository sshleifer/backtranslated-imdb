A surprising rent at a local video store, I was delighted to find a media satire worthy enough to challenge Oliver Stone's "Natural Born Killers." And almost as disturbing. I think it went well with my view of being at the end of 2004 following the Republican car doing magic on most of the American television viewing population. This raises the question: "Are we really manipulative?" <br /> <br /> I certainly deceived my vision. Also, a greater theological problem was provoked - the story of Christ. Could it be about the mouth and the overwhelming dependence on something explosive, as television produces a moon? Could the story of Christ be exaggerated? Could it have been completely manufactured? There's something the film puts in a very perceptual light.
