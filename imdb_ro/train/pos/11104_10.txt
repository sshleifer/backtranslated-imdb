As Godfather's saga was the point of view of the mafia in the executive suite, this series is a complex story of the mafia from the point of view of the working man. If you have never watched this show, you are looking for extended treatment. Yes, there is violence and nudity, but it is never free, and it is necessary to contrast Tony Soprano, the gangster of the thinking man, with the reality of life to which he was born, and sincerely would never have let him know how so many of his associates have arrived. Tony Soprano can discuss Sun Tzu with his therapist, then beat a man to death with a frying pan in a form of anger, and while dismembering and throwing his body with his nephew, take a break, sit down and get watching TV while eating peanut butter in the jar and giving the nephew's advice about his close marriage just as he had just finished an afternoon watching NFL football on Sunday. Even Carmella, his wife, when offered a chance for an exit, finds that she really prefers Tony's life and the benefits that go with him and looking back to his indiscretion of self-living. If you've followed everything, you know how it's over. If you did not, believe me that you have never seen a television show like this.
