Dramaturgist Sidney Bruhl (a wonderful super-Michael Caine) would kill for a successful piece. Enter the wonderful young child (a solid Reeve) who just wrote such a piece. Enter into this excessively hysterical wife of Bruhl (excellently played by Cannon) and a German psychic (a very funny Irene Worth) and you have made a funny suspense move. While you did not think about the "Sleuth" standards, "Deathtrap" is a challenging ride, based on a terrible play by Ira Levin. Performers obviously have a field day with the material, and Caine, in particular, offers top-of-the-line gusto lines. The film loses a bit of steam half way and the end is much less satisfying than a hilarious one in the original track, but generally "Deathtrap" is solid, well acting and fun suspense.
