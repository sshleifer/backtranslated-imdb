Playing as a runner-up prize at The Great Escape about 13 years later, this little British film that faces him, plays him as emotionless and dares to do too well. The first part of the film is the subsequent establishment and escape of our protagonists, while the second part focuses on their survival while they are in full swing as they try to reach Sweden. The film is based on pure characters, with a simple, efficient, and credible dialogue to carry it and manages to achieve its goals with much power. No small amount of suspense keeps the movie and, as a story of adventure, works perfectly for the time it takes, so a big finger for the film that might be the first of its kind? <br /> <br /> <br /> 7/10
