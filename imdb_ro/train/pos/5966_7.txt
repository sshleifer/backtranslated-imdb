In fact, I never bought in metal was satanic and stuff, but this movie has played on this idea. Although it is certainly not a movie that takes seriously or really appreciates a great one, it does not fulfill the purpose in which it has fun while playing. The story has a metal band burnt to death in their hotel, one of their fans has a dream about it and said the band is starting to go to a sister of murders beyond the grave. So yes, a little plot "Nightmare on Elm Street" is happening here. Freddy admits he never molested a girl in a car. There was another film that contained a heavy metal band, but it was very different in the way it played because it had a band that took over a city of kids and made them crazy. He simply has one fan of the band, who at first helped the killer spirit, then tried to stop him. Nothing is frightening, because I do not remember everything that kills much. Very honestly, the scene I remember the most is the scene of the girl wearing the headphones and then it is molested by an incarnation of the creature of the band. Nothing great, but a nice filling.
