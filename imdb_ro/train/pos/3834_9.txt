A great movie! Slow: YES. But original, deeply atmospheric, dark and frightening, perfectly SURREAL (I feel like a nightmare). I'd compare to David Lynch (Eraserhead, Inland Empire, Blue Velvet), style mixed with a bit of Barton Fink and Pranz Naked (Insects!). Also a little of Jodorowsky (Fando y Lis) .... Add a night on earth, Angel Heart and a little of Begotten, Pi, (would it be wrong to mention Tetsuo?) Jacob's Ladder, Barker's The Forbidden and Salome - who should together form at least the concept of a dark night ... NUIT NOIRE. If you are out for the advanced and / or surrealist cinema (like me) you will like this. If you expect something else like a film full of action with a medium plot - try luck with something else. The final words: The plot is very, very strange and unusual, 1 reason why most people who do not appreciate this movie hate it.
