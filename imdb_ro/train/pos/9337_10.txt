This series is "something different". Sometimes the European series are less accurate than the ones in the US, but this time the authors hit the right target, creating a mix that works smoothly. Edel & Starck is great, it has everything: a wonderful park, intelligent lines, full of spirit, always well delivered, an amazing stage of theater presented by all the stars and beautiful pictures of Berlin, one of the most interesting cities in the world. It's fun to see how things work in the field of justice in countries other than the US and because you "feel" once "the old way of treating life in Europe." Kudos for all distribution and crew for a well-done comedy that will be a must see in the years to come. Watching the series in German is great.
