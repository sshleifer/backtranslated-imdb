Bender generates more things for x files. This episode has an interesting concern, a good story, but an end that is desirable. Bender Sex is also the debut of x files for actor Nicholas Lea, better known as Alex Krycek. In this episode he interprets Michael, a man attacked by one of the "Rodeni". You have to see this episode just to see Nic Lea start less spectacular. An interesting thing about Kindred's "seductive power". When Marty deals with his victims, they turn into him. However, when Andrew seduces Scully, she just because she is disoriented and groggy, and does not get attracted to Andrew. Perhaps because Marty has more experience than Andrew. This episode reminds me of why it would sometimes be miserable to film in British Columbia. Throughout the episode it is so damp, soggy and muddy, it could not have been so fun. Despite the disappointing end, the Bender sex is still a decent episode to see.
