At first I followed 8 simple rules on the Disney UK channel for the first series and I was completely comprised. When they did not look anymore, he was upset, but then abc 1 sat in the 2nd series. I do not think another series would start after I read that John Ritter died, however the second series was not amazing, the latest series is back to its excellent old standard. I hope they will go on to produce more shows soon, even if I could watch each show a thousand times. Kaley couco is my favorite character as Bridget's airhead and also plays amazingly in Charmed. Rory is also good, he shares my name and Grampa, too. I'll keep watching it until it's over, I hope it's going as fun as never before
