I like the movie, it was a fantastic fantastic film b / c of the true sense of the family, the history of our country, the fun-filled action shown in the film. I'm looking at the time of top 4 x a week and I really like it! I wish there was a follow-up to see more about Susan's father in the past and watch Susan delt with her new sister and no phone, computers, gameboys or anything else in the 21st century. I hope everyone else will enjoy the film as much as I do. I think you could say I'm a time of top fanaticism and I do not mind. The boy in Robert Lincoln Walker was just adorable, I wonder who he is and how old he is today. Does anyone know if he played in movies or TV shows?
