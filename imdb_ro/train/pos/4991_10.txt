It's a shame that this movie is so hard to get hands in the US. I found it through a rare video distributor and it was definitely worth it. This is undoubtedly the best film made in the pre-code era and the best 1930s film. Master Frank Frank Borzage made wonderful movies about the depression, and with MAN's castle he created a fairytale amidst the weights of the era. Loretta Young and Spencer Tracy have wonderful chemistry between them and help make this movie a wonderful story. Young's trine is sweet and hopeful, while Bill Tracy is gruff and closed. The dynamics between the character creates one of the toughest, but ultimately rewards film relationships. MAN'S CASTLE is the most soft pre-coding movie I've ever seen. Borzage uses the muddy and dreamy technique to transform the village he lives in, where Bill and Trina live in a palace. The depression weights are never ignored, in fact they are an integral part of the film. But as Borzage crafts the film as a story of fairy tale, the love of the characters makes the situation look less harsh. This makes the movie warm and affectionate. THE MAN'S CAST is the crowning of the pre-coding era. If only more people could see him.
