Another masterpiece of Woo! This is the best wuxi movie I've ever seen! Woo - RULEZ forever (except for Hollywood moments ...). John Woo - the greatest director of the century. Perhaps hi is no more intellectual than many of the great directors ... But he is a lyrical and spiritual idol of all free people! <br /> <br /> His movies as great poetry! Woo is a Sheakspeare movie! Woo is a Biron movie! Woo is a Mozart of Bloodshet !!!! IMHO violent in Woo movies is not a director of blood, but an art tool. The themes of Woo films are more humanistic than those of new movies.
