This was an excellent two-part episode, although I have never seen the oldest, I never thought the doctor would go against everything that is paranormal, tertiary extra, of course, but not paranormal. the episode brings the things we fear most and how we humans are, in a futuristic time, to fight and defeat real evil when most chances say it would be impossible. Being a family movie, I'm surprised that they've brought some stuff like fear and faith, especially if it's going to entertain American audiences. But who takes care of what Yanks says, shit! The doctor who has demonstrated the potential since Episode 1 of the new 2005 series was first so harmless to scary, from fun to serious, from light to dark. I hope many old fans say someday that "Old Doctor Who Returns". 10 out of 10
