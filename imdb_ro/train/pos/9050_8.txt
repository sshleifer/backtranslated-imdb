This is a jewel, a real piece of American for all this involves this. If you are self-programmed to resist stories "affirming life," stay away and let others enjoy what they still believe. And what makes frosting on the cake really delicate is that it is based on a real story of wealth cloth, there is no need to choose what details have changed to make a compact story. Chris Cooper is one of the greatest live actors, and the complex, self-confrontational composition of the good bottom line, to the basic father he interpreted, could only be succeeded by someone with skill and understanding. The simple minds, refusing to accept a father who tries to establish the law, always feeling that he can be stopped, exposes the limitation of the commentator, not of the writers or the act. This is not for cynical or simple.
