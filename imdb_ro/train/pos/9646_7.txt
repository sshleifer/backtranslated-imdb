There is, of course, excitement between the two main characters while exploring their relationship - one based primarily on physical attraction from the beginning. And there is also an excitement in the inner work of Mathieu's family dealing with her mother's problems - and how this is in their relationship. But the problem is that it leaves many things unanswered (if I'm not too stupid to take them). Why is Mathieu in a psychiatric hospital? What led to the breakup of the boys? And the intermittent between the present and the past is a bit difficult to follow at first. It seems that the main reason to rent this movie is to enjoy some homarierotic emotions or vicarious male nudity. But as a love story or a character study is lacking and unsatisfactory.
