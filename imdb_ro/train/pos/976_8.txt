Takashi Miike's incursion into the children's territory has earned me almost immediately, because he demonstrates nervousness and courage in dealing with fantastic elements. This is a fairy tale that dares to be dark. Even a child, I thought there was something sinister about most fairy tales; Horrible things happen to people in most children's books. Miike understands that these classic stories are a little more frightening (and more disturbing) than what they seem to be at first glance. The filmmaker takes the archetypal story of a child into a wonderful preschool class. It emphasizes the very real fears of a world full of dangerous missions that do not end. Westerners prefer to reduce the seriousness behind bedtime stories specifically written for children. I appreciate Miike being more honest than most American filming. He goes to the jugular of the story, but shows signs of collapse. But a Miike possessed by himself is even brighter than most of the filming. I thought it was a great movie. Highly recommended.
