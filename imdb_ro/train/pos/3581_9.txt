I saw the movie back in the 80's and almost forgot when I noticed it was back on TV and I saw it. I remembered the fact that I liked this little puppy when I first saw it and I liked it even better on the second view. All the actors, especially Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, Wilfred Brimley, Frederic Forrest and Jason Presson (as a twelve-year-old boy who feels responsible for the accidental death of his older brother), are great. The film has a very authentic feeling - an understated, quiet story, in the deep motion of a painful family of pain. Dialogue is rare, but it says, and the nonverbal act is remarkable. A kind of simpler, rural version of ordinary people is not a psychiatrist, but an equally impressive family dynamics. <br /> <br /> The boy's stone deserves the time and emotional energy involved in watching her.
