Disney (and the wonderful people at PIXAR, of course) offer a beautiful humorous story combined with the best computer animation. I admit that maybe the "faces" of the bugs were a bit more static than in "Antz" and they only had four legs (in "Antz" six ...). But the background was superb and the animation was breathtaking. But that would be a lesson: it was not the computer that made such a great success: it was the man behind the car who added the wonderful movements we lost in Antz. Some important things were, of course, "bloopers" at the end (So, keep track of the end, it's worth it!) That were very funny and original. The "Fully filmed in-place" line was intended for more attentive viewers.
