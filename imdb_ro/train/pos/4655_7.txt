Peter Ustinov plays an embezzler who just came out of prison when the movie began. As soon as he leaves the gates, he immediately begins to work on a scheme to make a packet again by theft, though this time he has his eyes quite high. This is actually one of the weaknesses of the movie because he knows nothing about computers (few came back in 1968), but they manage to become a computer genius literally overnight! Yeah sure. Anyway, he comes up with a scheme to become a computer expert and get a job with a large American corporation so he can finally pull off a sum of money. Given that his knowledge of computers is rudimentary, it is amazing how he implements a brilliant plan and manages to infiltrate the computer system and defend it. But still, it's a movie, so I've managed to suspend my unbelief. By the end of the movie, he and his new wife (Maggie Smith) have the opportunity to run a million pounds. However, at the end, she becomes very confused, and Smith announces that she has managed to accumulate more than two million through huge investments in the companies Ustinov began (though he did not realize they were all fictitious companies). This would mean that, ultimately, these stocks that they bought were of no value. What seems to imply (and I might guess wrong here) is that Ustinov and his new partners quickly cashed up their shares before they became acquainted, and stocks would then become worthless. In any case, the movie seems to post a magical end, where no one is injured and everyone is happy - and that did not make much sense. It is a shame, indeed, because acting and most of the writing was great. Karl Malden, Bob Newhart, Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith were just great. If they seem to have interpreted the end, let me know because the movie seemed very vague in detail at the end.
