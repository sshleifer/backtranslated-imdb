This review is taking place almost 30 years late. However, it should be noted that we recorded a copy of this movie sometime in early 2008 and I have seen it repeatedly for 4 months right! I had to write about it! I was killed and I forgot nothing else since I saw this movie. How ironic it is to see the most ugly male protagonist of literature portrayed by the most beautiful man! however, what a good irony! It fits me even better, because Timothy Dalton has done his righteousness. Has made a stunning and triumphant performance! I've never seen that before! All the other actors are very good. The entire movie was built beautifully. I do not care what anyone says about this movie. I love and love! He made me happy and pleased. It crushes me a bit, but I prefer Jane Eyre 1983 for P & J's A & E, which I think is the final mini-series. <br /> <br /> Extracts from Jane Eyre have scared me a little in school. I have never come to read the books seriously knowing the story line so well. Seeing this special production, the story came to life for me and led me to a close frenzy. The scenes and voice of Mr. Dalton haunted me endlessly, and eventually made me read seriously the book, which, of course, is a masterpiece. Bravo for the whole team and especially for Mr. Dalton! This movie is now a part of me. <br /> <br /> They give it 10/10.
