Imagine being hindered by a bureaucracy that a man spends for 8 years in his life and has a mental breakdown that tries to solve a mass murder case by himself! Crime technique is clear, but a government that does not want to admit the truth, allows a monster to destroy dozens of lives. When I think my job is stressful, I just remember the true story behind this wonder movement. The dedication to debt of the main character was creatively presented by Rea. The comical (and almost tragic) relationship between Rea and the Sutherland character made this film one of my favorite films in the last 5 years. Winning one of the worst mass murderers in history had me at the edge of the chair. Although it was not so well published and talked about "Silence of the Lamb," the plot was just as suspenseful.
