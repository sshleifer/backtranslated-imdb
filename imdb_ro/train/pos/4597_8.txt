After winning his first fame with Drunken Master, Jackie Chan has entered the spotlight since 1983 with Project A, a very pleasant pirate, which has restored him as an important star. Until the police were released two years later, Jackie's extravagance approached the zenith, and the crowds gathered to see this frenzied mix of marvelous stunts, brutal fighting scenes and questionable comedy. Broke a lot of box office records and inspired a 50% increase in police recruits, but watched for 20 years is something good? As an action movie, Police Story is undoubtedly raised. There are some extraordinary battle scenes, some stuntwork that remind of the best of Chan's heroes, Buster Keaton, and all-encompassing climber. Jackie's performance is also very strong, and while frequent blows in comedy comedy, the impact of the movie is a little bit, his charisma leads her. In addition, in presenting our hero as a borderless psychopath whose indiscipline puts others at risk, Jackie took an important bet ... though if no one seems to have noticed! While praising Politia Story as a "good vs. evil" struggle, critics have diminished the ambiguity of the film with the tone, and although the Karamazov Brothers are hard to describe, the film was nevertheless a notable change in describing such uncertainty and commendable to conventional ideas. > <br /> In short, it remains a quality popcorn * film (although you can clear your stomach as many villains resist or sit in glass displays in the final scene of the movie) - a movie powerful action, ranks with the best times.
