Sunny, a waitress in the DC area, is a little diminished. She runs an old baton and rents a tiny room from a homosexual couple. However, it saves the life of a prominent Arab, taking a bullet behind the official. She fascinates her national press with her zany remarks and sweet looks. Looking for an opportunity, presidential assistants install it in the protocol department for the US government. Even then, she sometimes does things right, but she tries hard and learns a lot. It even attracts the romantic attention of a state department official. But is there another sinister plot in the process involving an Arab man who wants to take another wife? A blonde? LOL LOL LOL. This film features Goldie as beautiful as a picture and as stupid "like a fox", as they say. Sunny is well aware of the road around the US jungle. It even has important things to say about honesty and its lack in its protocol environment. Probably the Arab community would be less enthusiastic about this work, but for those who like to laugh, rent it today.
