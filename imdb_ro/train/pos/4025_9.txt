Superb. I initially thought that, given Amrita Pritam's communist inclinations, and Dwivedi's nationalist film would be more honest than the novel, but when I read the novel, I was surprised to find that it was the reverse. Kudos to enlarge Pritam not to be pseudo-sec and to Dwivedi to be objective. This movie touches a sensitive subject in a sensible way. The accidents of any war are women, as a poet says, and this film personalizes it. It is also a sad comment on the Hindu psychic because they can not oppose the kidnappers of their daughters or the Hindu brother who can only burn the fields of his torturer. On the other hand, it also shows the economic angles behind the partition or, in fact, why the girls were abducted first. I think the kidnappers thought that by kidnapping their girls they would become legal owners of houses and, therefore, new govt. they will not be able to ask them to return their homes. Besides, they have to salute the courage of the characters of Puro and her Bhabhi, that they are two simple girls in the village who do not think about the outside world and risk each one trying to come back after they have been dishonored. Because there are many documented cases when such women have not been accepted by their families in India. No wonder a woman needed to understand other women's pains.
