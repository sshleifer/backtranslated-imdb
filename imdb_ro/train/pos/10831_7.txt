An excellent distribution makes this movie work; all the characters are very well developed and it is clear that the actors enjoyed filming this film. It's not really the comedy we've been waiting for, much more a glimpse of the attempt to regain the glory of youth than good humor. For music fans, there are plenty of subtle references that, by themselves, are intelligently funny. I do not like to draw direct comparisons with other films, but so much of this movie reminded me of Alan Parker's films. help her: imagine if the Commitments actually made it big - and then you tried to regain this glory 25 years later.
