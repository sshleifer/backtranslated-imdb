From the writer "What ever happened to baby Jane?" and "Hush .. Hush, Sweet Charlotte," this end of the queue of the horror cycle of the sixties has a strange and full of fun. Micheal Macliamm√≥ir is a bit like Victor Buono, but too often the film is dangerously close to a bad musical ... a particularly awful recital for children is halfway. Debbie bursts, trashes and tricks from Harlow, while Winters' religious fanaticism has a lesbian edge. Agnes Moorehead checks as evangelist. Weaver has nothing to do - and even have to pay a gigolo to dance with Debbie.
