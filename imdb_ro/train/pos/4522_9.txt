This surprised me because I was often disappointed by Adrian Pasdar in the past, but he got the perfect balance in this performance, avoiding both the farce and the pathos, while offering real humor and emotions. Julie Waters, always great, is great here and whoever did not do it in 1983, Educating Rita should rent it right away (great movie). The rest of the supporting characters are also well played, many wonderful eccentric, without going over the top. This is fun.
