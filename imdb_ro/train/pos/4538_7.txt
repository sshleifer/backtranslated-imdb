I did not even want to watch this movie after I read Maltin's review and a 1Â½ star rating. I looked at my son's advice anyway and found her much better than I expected. I would give you 2 1/2 stars from a 4 star system. You have to watch the movie more than once to understand everything. If you do not know too much about religion, you will lose a lot. I graduated from high school the year the movie was made, so maybe I can relate to him better. Yes, there is a claim in the movie and it's strange to some extent, but that was the 70's, so what do you expect. I can see why people do not like the movie; however, I can not understand that people say it is boring. The film is nothing but boring. You will hate her or love her. If you think it's boring, you're probably dead.
