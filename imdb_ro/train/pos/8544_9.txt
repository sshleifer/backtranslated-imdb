This movie has never received the attention it deserves, although this is one of the most beautiful pieces that acts and one of the most realistic stories I've seen on the screen. Clearly filmed on a small budget in a true V.A. The hospital, the center of this story is Joel, very well played by Eric Stoltz. Joel was paralyzed in a motorcycle accident and comes to the hospital at a section with other men who have spinal cord injuries. Joel is in love with Anna, his married girlfriend, played by Helen Hunt, who shows the early signs of his Academy winning work. Although the Joel-Anna relationship is the focal point of concentration, there are many other well-developed characters in the room. Wesley Snipes does a great job like Raymond angry. Even more impressive is William Forsythe as bitter and racist Blossom. I think Forsythe's two best scenes are when he gets frustrated and angry at square dancers, and later when he feels empathy for a young Korean man shot in a liquor store. My favorite scene with Snipes is the discussion of sexual options after the injury. The chemistry between Stoltz and Hunt is very strong and has two very intimate scenes, but not free. The orgasm in the salon is both sexy and fun. There is also another memorable scene in which Joel and Bloss and the Korean boy take the van specially equipped at the strip bar. It's really a comedy of errors, as they make their weak attempts to make the van see "naked ladies." The story is even more straightforward than the fact that director Neal Jimenez is paralyzed in real life. This is basically his story. This movie is real, not glossy or shiny. Having talent in a movie with such a small budget is amazing. I recommend this movie to everyone I see, because it is one of those films that improves even on a second aspect. It is a shame that such a big piece of work is overlooked, but through video, maybe it can get the attention it deserves so rich.
