Perhaps this is a very good "follow-up", better than the first 101 Dalmatian live action movie. Has good dogs, good actors, good jokes and harassment well! <br /> <br /> Cruella DeVil, who had a pretty important therapy, is now a dog lover and very fond of them. Many, including Chloe Simon, the owner of a dog Cruella once tried to kill, I do not think so. Others, like Kevin Shepherd (the owner of Dog House 2), believe it has changed. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Dipstick and his partner gave birth to three cute puppies! Little Carver, Domino and Oddball ... In the role of Eric Idle as Waddlesworth, Glenn Close in the role of Cruella and Gerard Depardieu as Le Pelt (another baddie, the name should give a clue), this is a movie good family with enthusiasm and much more! A fall of this film is that it has a lot of painful pain, but not as overwhelming as the last movie. This is also more fun than the last movie. <br /> <br /> Enjoy the "102 Dalmatian"! :-)
