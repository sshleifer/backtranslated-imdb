I saw this movie in 1976, my first year in New York. I lived there for the next 26 years, but I've never seen something so delicate and beautiful again as this little TV movie. It was part of a PBS series, as I remember, and I never forgot. <br /> <br /> There are no sex scenes to talk about, just delicate, on the move, extraordinary appealing moments full of tension and excitement, all set in a conservative environment, Boston (I think) the role of the devoted wife who awaiting her husband's return from the war and not looking for a career and financial independence. Frances Lee McCain is great in the role of the career photographer and spent the next 30 years looking for her in equally challenging roles without any results. Must be a video of this movie? Sure it should be on DVD, but certainly at least one video?
