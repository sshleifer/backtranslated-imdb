If I see a movie and never see my watch or watch to see how it will work or when I hope the last scene is not the end of the movie, it has to be pretty good. I'm not an internist or cinematographer. I watch movies and if you keep me interested until the end, then they are good enough because some of the most critically acclaimed films brought me to death (The English Patient, Shakespeare in Love, Atonement, Crash.) This movie kept me interested in and absorbed from the end. The performance is wonderful, the story is absolutely original, the very affective flash-back technique. There was a bit of Citizen Kane thrown in tho when Hoffman trassores his apartment after leaving Tomei but pardon causing it I pay homage rather than a waste of Orson.
