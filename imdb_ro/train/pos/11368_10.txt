A surprisingly complex and well-executed study of the "First" serial killer in the USSR. In the perestroika days, this intense piece is brought to life with the performance of Stephen Reah and Donald Sutherland. This examination of Cicatillo as a killer is well rounded and suggests some of his behaviors while out of favor shows others there is a subtlety that is convincing without being graphically obvious. Not for the weak of the heart, however, because the subject is often disturbing, but necessary for the complete development of the main participants in this story based on facts. HBO has provided us with an excellent movie in an unusual way. Congratulations to the director and editor of this wonderful piece. It's in my Top 10 has to see the list.
