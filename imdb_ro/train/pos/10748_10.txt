I have to say that the events of September 11 did not hit me until I saw this documentary. It took me a year to deal with devastation. I was the one who changed the station to the radio and the channel on the TV if it was talk about the towers. I'm tired of hearing about it. When it was broadcast on television a year and a day later, I cast my eyes. It was the first time I cried out of the attack. I highly recommend this documentary. I'm watching TV now, 5 years later, and I'm still crying about tragedies. The fact that it contains one of the only videos of the first plane that hits the tower is amazing. It was an accident, and look where it got. These two brothers make me want to be there to help.
