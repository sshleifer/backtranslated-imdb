Great, great, wonderful! That's all I can say about this movie, but imdb wants at least four lines of text, so I'll elaborate. The distribution was great (Jerry O'Connel is soooo cute!), Music was great (the sixties had the best music ever, imho), the historical material was interesting and so did the actors in the 1990s that they were actually there in the 1960s. And above all, the stories of the main characters brought tears to my eyes, and that is the greatness of any drama. BUT ON A WORD: GREAT!
