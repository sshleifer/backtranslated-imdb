Do you like to solve the mysteries? Do you like complex narratives? This is for you. Brilliant, intelligent film by Francis Leclerc (the son of a legendary French Canadian Felix Leclerc). Flash photography and intelligent editing is Leclerc's word, strongly helped by Roy Dupuis, who is dythirambic in the lead role. The land refers to Alexandre Tourneur, a 40-year-old veterinarian who just woke up from a coma after being unplugged by someone unknown. The Tourneur strives to remember who struck him as he completes a deer's suffering on the road. Throughout the fight, he has a strange behavior and seems to have taken something over it. It's not a scary film, but very mysterious and well-played. I have my assumption about the end (I think the Indian caused the accident), but this end was open to all the explanations. I recommend recommending it 9.5 / 10
