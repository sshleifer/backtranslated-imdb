It takes patience to pass through David Lynch's eccentric, but for a chronical change of Alvin Straight's life, but to stay with him. Although he moves so slowly as John Deere from Straight, when he meets with strangers along our pilgrimage, we learn a lot about the isolation of aging, the painful and secret regrets, and ultimately the power of family and reconciliation. Richard Farnsworth places his career with the most authentic performance, sad and poetic, frightening and thoughtful. And Sissy Spacek suits him as his "slow" daughter, Rose, who loses her own private loss while dealing with her father. Rarely a modern film has preached so positively about the family.
