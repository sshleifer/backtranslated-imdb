Any screening adaptation of John Grisham's story deserves a holistic approach to Hollywood, and Robert Altman is about the last director I'd like to take to get something on the table. But this southern frying boiler is pretty good. Although it is not among Altman's best, it is certainly not among the movies he made to let you scratch your head and ask what he thought. Altman elevated his hat with the thriller of the mystery before, in his 1973 The Long Goodbye. "The Gingerbread Man" is not nearly as good as that movie, but it's pretty good on its own. Kenneth Branagh is a confident lawyer who gets involved in murder after embarking on a client (Embeth Davidtz) who helped them protect her from his cousin's father (Robert Duvall). The film is set in Savannah, Georgia, when a tropical storm approaches, giving the film an oppressive atmosphere that I really enjoyed. The twists and turns to the end of the movie become more clunky and clandestine, and Altman proves to be the least adherent of the filming, but generally the film is not a bad addition to Altman's canon. Robert Downey, Jr., Daryl Hannah, Tom Berenger and Famke Janssen. <br /> <br /> Grade: B
