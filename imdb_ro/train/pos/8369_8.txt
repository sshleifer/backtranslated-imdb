Hrm - I think the line was on the old movie posters. This is a bad movie that seems to have been translated from a language that was not familiar with the translator. Here's a tip: Any movie that starts with a black screen and the text "In the future ..." will be fun. That means the premise is so implausible that it has to explain this to you. In this case, "In the future ..." means that, instead of fighting wars, robot giants and I take it out to determine, well, that is never clear, but it is probably something really important. There are good boys (obviously capitalists, that is, "we") and bad boys ("Commies!") And there are big stop-motion robots. Unfortunately, the budget of the effects was rather thin, not enough to see a lot of big robots. There are many cheap interior scenarios and then a big space battle near the end. The space struggle is particularly nice because it has no purpose other than to hit the rest of the budget of effects. With the money now called, the climate battle degenerates into (and does not) two boys who hit each other with sticks. I can always laugh at a bar, re-educate the final stage, completing with a last line guaranteed to let the audience scratch their heads. As I said - it's stupid. That's why I bought the tape.
