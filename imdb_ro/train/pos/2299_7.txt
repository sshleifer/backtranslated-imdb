Who said horror was not a kind of educational film, was it? Thanks to this awesome movie by Hammer, I NEED at least NEVER give a strange wine visitor and a slice of salt bread to my house because it could be just a hypnotist and this combination will give her the power to control my thoughts and minds forever! Thanks Hammer! The tenth episode of the House of Horror series is another one I expected to see, mainly because the guy in the director's chair was Don Sharp; one of the best directors in the UK but still suburban. Sharp was responsible for some very interesting Hammer films, such as Kiss of the Vampire and Rasputin: The Crazy Monk, as well as some independent productions such as Dark Places and Psychomania. His contribution to the House of Horror is easily one of the best in the series, with a complex and fascinating sketch of the facts and revolving around delightful occult themes. The center focuses on two antique dealers who hide on a strange object that resembles a mirror, but it is actually an old sculpting device that can be used to call Choronzhon; demonic guardian of the abyss. The mirror is highly desired by a Satanic cult because it needs it for their ceremonies, but Michael does not want to sell it before knowing the real value of the device. When he takes over a fearful girl running from worship to avoid being sacrificed, Michael is drawn even deeper into an occult conspiracy. Satanic cultures and the carnal sacrifice of young women are typical of British horror, but David Fischer's script is never boring and offers a lot of neatly plotting sketches, of which an extremely inventive climate. There is also a lot of tension to admire, dialogues are awake, and acting performances are splendid (especially John Carson as the leader of the cult is really dizzying). Recommended!
