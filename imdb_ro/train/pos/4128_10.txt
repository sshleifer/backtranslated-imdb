With all the violence on television and local news, it's refreshing to have a show that does not have any violence or language for adults, but it's still fun. Our children are looking forward to watching us every week Everyone of us has a favorite chef and favorite judges. We all enjoy Elton Brown. We like to learn about the background of the main ingredient, vegetables and spices. We've been playing around home for guess who will be the winner. It's a great hour of entertainment as well as information. The best of all in our bus life, the bus, is an hour spent by the family together.
