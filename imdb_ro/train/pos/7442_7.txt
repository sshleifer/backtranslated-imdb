I hired the movie (I do not think she got a theater show here) waiting worse. The previews made the movie look terrible. In fact, I was very surprised, it was worth looking; has been written freely, almost like an overall movie. They had very funny moments in it and, although erroneous, is an effective satire of the show and the people on the show without being too scary. It is wrong, mainly due to the terrible soundtrack of the effects of the terrifying "comedy", but as a whole it meets equally honest and generally true with the form of the show in a different way or Larry Sanders. when fashion is critical to Jerry Springer, it is also an easy target. Springer could have made Citizen Kane and would have proclaimed "the worst movie ever made." I recommend this movie to anyone interested in the show. An incomplete but innovative and interesting piece of film.
