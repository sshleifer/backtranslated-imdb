Of course you could not enter a theater and listen to the types of sets you get in this movie. From this point of view, there is a total fantasy. But who cares? It is certainly true that you will not find the movie with Citizen Kane, Battleship Potyomkin and all the other movies that pseudonyms tell us that we should follow. Movies like that deserve a hundred Kanes citizens. It's about what cinematic cinemas are doing best: a great camera work, wonderful settings and great performances. The three spectacular scenes at the end are probably the best in the order they are presented, keeping the best to the last. <br /> <br /> I'm glad to look at this movie again and again and again ...
