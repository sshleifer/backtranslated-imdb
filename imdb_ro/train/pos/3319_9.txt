Like a long-time Red Sox fan, I had to go see the movie. Was awesome! Although there may not be enough live recording from the 2004 Red Sox miracle season, some of my favorite Red Sox players have taken good photos. While the movie is definitely a chicken fillet, it has enough baseball record from the amazing Red Sox return of 2004 to become one of my top top movies of all time. I was especially happy with the Red Sox fans who were part of Ben's baseball family. The scene where Ben meets with his friends on the day of design to determine who will get places to certain games is hilarious! You have to see if you are looking for a good movie to watch with your spouse, date or other significant ... especially if you are a baseball fan ... and especially if you are a Red Sox fan!
