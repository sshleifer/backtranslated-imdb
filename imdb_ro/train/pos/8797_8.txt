A great idea: 11 stories about September 11. 11 directors from different countries with different results. Ken Loach talking about an immigrant (as usual) is just brilliant (as usual). The French do a very good job, while the Burkina Faso movie was a pleasant surprise. However, the film in Israel was a little bit boring, and the Mexican guy, well, should give up the director and work in a Mexican restaurant. 8/10
