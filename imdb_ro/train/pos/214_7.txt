An old team from Wilde Clark (Walter Matthau) and Al Lewis (George Burns) were one of the most famous, but they broke hating each other. More than 20 years later, they agree to meet for a special TV ... but find out that they are still hating each other. Willy's nephew / agent (Richard Benjamin) tries to make them work together. A great success in his day and George Burns won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. I (somewhat) liked it. It was written by Neil Simon so he could handle a non-stop. Some of them were funny, but the jokes of Willy and Sen were not. I also never liked Matthau. I never thought he was a good actor and something about him just rubbed my wrong path. Also, his character here is so caustic that you get sick quickly. Everything was fun. Burns is very good to easily throw one-liners and even Matthau was well suited to him. Their verbal fights are the best sequences in the movie. Benjamin is also very good as Willy's nephew trying to make the two work with each other. It's worthwhile to see for Burns only. This jump began his career in a great way and two years later he had another hit with "Oh God". So that's good. Just fine - not great. Matthau's character hardly makes this hard to be loved. I give her a 7.
