<br /> <br /> I once saw the Country of No Man (1987) - the IMDB link http://us.imdb.com/Title?0093638 - and I found it ok. The movie is about a guy who just steals Porsches. Found in sixty seconds it comes after 13 years and does not add anything to it. Actually, it has a lot of scenes that are worthless. And the end is very, very bad. The sphinx has a magnetic presence that should have been better used ...
