Those who love Jane Eyre's book like me (my favorite all the time, and I read it at least once a year) like this version. Timothy Dalton is just a young man too good to be Mr. Rochester, but besides, he does a wonderful job portraying Thornfield's fiery master. Zela Clarke could have been a little too old to play Jane for 18 years, but when I see this movie, I do not think about the characters' ages. The dialogue in the film is almost verbatim from the book, which was very clever. Sure, this movie might seem a bit long, but it's the only version I've seen it includes the third part. I want the people who made this film to have been involved in the new version of Zeferelli because it would have helped that misery of a movie. I also realized that the last time I watched this video Judy Cornwell plays "Aunt Reed"! She is so versatile that I did not recognize her. She plays Daisy in keeping appearances, and also played Mrs. Musgrove in the Persuasion of 1995 (another great adaptation). UPDATE: We've got the DVD this week and it's great to see the original needless. There are many more in the beginning (Young Jane at Gateshead and Lowood.) And finally, they have restored many things (I always wondered why St. John had a sheet of paper when he revealed that he knew who Jane was - because the part she breaks from her painting was edited from the US VHS version!). Rosamund Oliver is in it ... she was completely cut off from the VHS. As far as I know, they did not write any of Timothy Dalton's songs, so nothing new there, but it's great to see the whole miniseries entirely after all these years of enjoying VHS. Thank you, BBC (PS ... I would have paid more for a special DVD edition ... with some interviews with the stars ... or a show production)
