Carol, a young woman at the heart of the story, is transplanted into a foreign country, Spain, at the height of the civil war conflict in the late 1930s. For this girl, everything is new abroad. War and her father are her permanent concerns, while she must sink into a provincial culture that is behind what she has in New York. Imanol Uribe directs this movie to numbers. Carol's family is clearly divided, while Carol's mother is married to someone who is a left-wing air force pilot, the rest of the family's sympathy with Franco and the fascists who won the conflict. The story does not add anything to what has been said, much better, but it's an easy-to-follow movie. The splendid landscape of Northern Spain is presented. Do not expect a lot of action, because most of what's happening turns around Carol and the young boys he's fond of. Clara Lago plays Carol with sincerity and innocence. Maria Barranco is the mother of Carol Aurora, who left for America. Rosa Maria Sarda is Maruja, a teacher who makes friends with Carol. Carmelo Gomez plays Alfonso, the man Aurora left behind when he left for America. This actor, who usually has major roles in most Spanish films, has nothing to do, because he remains an enigma in the whole movie.
