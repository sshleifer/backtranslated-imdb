Raggedy Ann & Andy is the first movie I've ever seen in theaters. My father took my sister and me, and the funny thing is - when we got back home, our father asked, "What do you want to do now?" and I said we wanted to watch Raggedy Ann & Andy again! lol and my dad actually took us back to the theater to look at him again - at least so I remember. I was five years old. <br /> <br /> This movie was quite scary for a five-year age. The scene with the gigantic sweets ocean and the camel hypnotic scene ... I do not remember too much about this movie, of course the beginning was magic and a few scenes - I would like to find it again and I probably will be looking for it now. I remember I liked Raggedy Ann & Andy.
