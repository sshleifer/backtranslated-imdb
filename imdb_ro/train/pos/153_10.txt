This film is, in short, a cinematic masterpiece. The film is shifted sharply through intense images that move the sensitive spectator deeply. The film opens during the Spanish Civil War as a group of children seeking to revenge another child. Actually, they act in their world a version of what they have witnessed in the adult world around them. Later we meet three of these children again as adults in a sanitarium. Here we see what life has done to each of them. One is a repressed sexually repressed patient. Another man is a sick man. The third child, a young lady, became a nun and served in the sanitarium. This film is an allegory about the effect of violence on the psyche. This movie has a climax that is certainly not for scandalous members of the viewing audience, but it is logical and profound. The actor is excellent, and the script is pretty well written. There is a musical score that offers a horror underground along this movie. This is not a movie for thrillers, but a movie for a close audience.
