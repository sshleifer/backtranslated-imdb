I've seen the trailer for this movie several times and I have to say that Ned Kelly looks like a great movie. When I saw the trailer for the first time, I could not take my eyes away from it (it took my attention for sure). Heath Ledger sticks to what he knows and what works for him, parts of the era. Not to mention Orlando Bloom, who is seen for a second second, looks great. I think this movie will be a blow and will be seen and quickly seen by many people.
