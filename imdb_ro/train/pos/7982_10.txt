I'm amazed that movies like this can be made. I look at all kinds of movies with my friends and I can say that this is one of the best I've ever seen. I never thought a 146-minute movie could make me think about that and farther. Washington, charismatic and intense as ever, interprets Creasy, an ex-counter-terrorist agent who was taken to the glass. Once appointed to protect young Pita (Dakota Fanning) in Mexico City, his emotional and redeemer bow starts with a leap in the way he can only offer an adorable little girl. Inevitably, Pita is kidnapped by criminals, and Creasy decides that most of Mexico has to pay the price because she dares to take his character's bearded cat. Yes, he became ... a Man on fire. <br /> <br /> You have to watch this movie.
