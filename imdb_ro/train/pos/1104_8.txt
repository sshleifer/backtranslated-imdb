The film opens with Bill Coles (Melvyn Douglas), telling a story about how his best friend Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) and his family are packed in a small apartment in New York with enough cabinet space and too few baths. When Jim's wife, Muriel (Myrna Loy), wants to renovate the apartment, Jim falls in love with (or falls for!) An ad for a house. Once he bought the house, bills and frustrations are constantly multiplying, because anything that can go wrong with Jim's Dream House is going wrong. One of the three collaborations between Grant and Loy is a charming comedy - not very impressive without a wonderful message, but a great way to spend an hour or two. The laughter is from the very beginning when the alarm clock goes out and Jim tries to stop him, just to be overturned by Muriel every turn. The moment and delivery of comedy lines and situations can only be provided by a few experienced professionals, and that's what Grant and Loy give us: polished performances, simple chemistry and a lot of fun. Myrna Loy is in a rather ingenious role (Jim Grant is obviously taking the lion's share of the lines and the actor, and Grant, as always, pulls out both with a remarkable aplomb), but gives Muriel a color, life and bite that only Myrna Loy can give a character. Melvyn Douglas plays amusing fun to perfection, never hitting a single bad note. One of my favorite scenes is for sure when Bill gets stuck in the "storehouse," and Jim goes to "save" him ... just to catch everyone in! Every little problem that appears for the Blandings renovation project - including little jealousy and an ad campaign for "Wham" - seems to bring together everything that could go wrong in building a new house but making it credible and a pleasant watch. 8/10
