This will be another type of review. I have seen this movie twice on TV and would like to have a copy because she talks about Panama City and the beach during the winter, which is my favorite time to be there. It was the first movie I saw with Ashley Judd and she was great and I enjoyed all the other things I've seen. Sundance's reaction made me feel, as did director Nunez directed and wrote some movies about Florida. This movie speaks to me and I have not seen anything to compare it to. The land speaks less to me than to the surroundings. Well, I told you it would be a different review.
