Simply the best Estonian movie I've ever seen, though it's done by a Finnish director Ilkka Järvi-Laturi. Tallinn Pimeduses is a thriller of entertainment about a bunch of gangsters trying to steal a huge amount of gold, a national treasure belonging to the republic of Estonia. But at the same time it is a kind of summary of the conditions of many East European countries at the time. In the early 1990s, the Soviet Union fell into pieces and many countries, such as Estonia, became independent. Now conditions can be better in most of these countries. But in the early 1990s, many of these new nations had to fight against corruption and organized crime that the Soviet era left behind as an inheritance. (And many of them still do ... at least at a certain level ...) Tallinn Pimeduses is a very realistic film of that era with credible characters and a well-written script. The actors are also very good, especially Jüri Järvet (probably the best-known Estonian actor, plays Snaut in Tarkovsky's Solaris), playing an old gangster who is slowly getting tired of his way of life. But the most amazing show comes from Monika Mäger, a child actress who plays Terje, a little girl in her early adolescence, whose presence in the plot is very essential. (and her name is not even mentioned in the IMDb credits list) <br /> <br /> There are not many movies in the world that are both entertaining and artistic at the same time. But Tallinn Pimeduses does that. Undoubtedly, other Järvi-Laturi films are far from such achievements. His first, Kotia Päin, was too artificial, and his last, History is done at night, was just a strange mess.
