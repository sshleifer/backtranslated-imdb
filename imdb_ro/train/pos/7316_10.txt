This movie is one of the best of all times, certainly in the horror genre. The claustrophobic atmosphere is remarkable, the music is as good as the movie and the killer is as creepy as it can be! The actors are fantastic, RIP Donald Pleasance was fantastic as Dr Loomis, made the movie even better. Without him the film would be devoid of a vital ingredient. Jamie Lee Curtis is also gorgeous as our dear beloved queen! Her innocence makes her not aware of the true evil she is after her until she finds her friends in the house, who, of course, is one of the best movie scenes. It delivers tremendous performance. I liked this movie because it scared me back when I saw it in the early 80s and I still watch this day as a wonderful movie that brings you into this world if you could be eviscerated like a fish at every return! The fact that it's a simple form of a crazy man in a mask that escapes from a mental asylum and is ready to kill everyone without the idea of ​​being there is just terribly shocking and gathers you more in the movie as events, though fiction could really become reality. We all know that, unfortunately, evil exists in this world and that a crazy man with a knife is certainly not unusual, a very worrying fear for all this. Death at any return. Halloween certainly shows this in the most terrifying way. Horror must be credible, and that makes the movie enjoyable. It's just a simple story that turns into an excellent and terrifying atmosphere. Besides the psycho's wonderful story, both of which I adore, I think the formats are the best horror they have to offer. For me, Halloween and Psycho are the best movies I've ever seen, and I'll follow them all my life, and I'll never get tired of them anymore. Halloween is undoubtedly one of the best movies of all time.
