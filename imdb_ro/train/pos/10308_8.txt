Morgan Freeman was more unusual than God than George Burns? This movie was certainly better than the one who wore, "Oh, my God." I was completely worried and LMAO all the way through. Carrey was perfect as a kind of wannabe anchorman, and Aniston fulfilled her role as a frustrated girlfriend in her usual performance. I, for one person, do not consider it to be either ugly or untouched. I think my favorite scenario was when Carrey opened the file cabinet, thinking she could not keep her life history. See if you can see the file in the cabinet holding the bathroom humor events: I rolled on this. Very well written and even better played, this comedy will descend as one of the best amateurs.
