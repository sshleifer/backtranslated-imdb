Though critically malign, Johnny Dangerously is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It's a film that needs to be looked at closely; some of the funny bits happen in the pass and have not drawn their usual attention. For example, it takes into account Michael Keaton's use of the price tag at the pet shop ... and also in the documentary years that appear at the beginning of the scenes. It's one of those rare movies where humor hits you unexpectedly, even if you know it's a comedy. Amy Heckerling, the director, is really sharp here. If you enjoyed her best-known movies (Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Clueless, European Vacation etc.), you should show it to one. > Michael Keaton is extremely pleasing in the lead role, and the support piece (Griffin Dunne, Maureen Stapleton, Joe Piscopo, Peter Boyle) is great. Highly recommended.
