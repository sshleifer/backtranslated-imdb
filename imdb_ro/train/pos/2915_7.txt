The Bunny Comes Home "This Navy Man" deserves more credit than he receives, a clever script by Borden Chase, directed by "Wild Bill" Wellman, the film has just the right sense of early euphoria post-WW11 and benevolence, and none of the blind terror that came into play a few years later. Produced in 1944, the Japanese defeated little déjà vu scenes, Tom Drake's melancholic attraction for the young radiant Jan Clayton has solid chemistry, real play and validates Drake's career at Metro. The following year Jan was opened on Broadway in Carusel. Wally Beery, a small blue-eyed eye, boasts Jimmy Gleason always distrustful? his memories an improvement from reality and giving Beery a shadow similar to Ulysses. Navy LTA (Lighter Than Air) photos are authentic, photographed at Tustin and Lakehurst, and the P-38 squad is from AFB in March. Lot 3 doubled for India, and Bunny's Tower? Bunny comes home? gives back to Beery an authentic slice of his past, what he wanted to believe was true? then, the future we turn back to is fantastic? now on a larger scale, a new designed Marine Leta with launch capabilities for a reconnaissance plane? how expensive, happy and optimistic? Still, "Do you have to believe in it, that's how it makes things come true?"
