<br /> <br /> I have to admit that I was expecting something quite different from my first "cut" view last night, although I was thrilled by the unexpected Australian horror gem. I am a true fan of horror as if it were to come and discover "Cut" not only is the best of the genre Australia has ever produced, but one of the great parody / comedy films at the end of the year. <br /> <br /> My only concern is that the mass audience can not pick up on a lot of comic elements - the movie was not too smart in its application, but it made me laugh at every round trying to fit in ANY possible cliche of the horror genre he could have. I'm sure this was intended as humor ... hoping that this was intended as humor. And, of course, there was a gore. The use of personalized "garden scissors was the brilliance - besides the expected stages and blows." In short, there was a great variety and creativity in many violent deaths, enough to please even the skeptics of these films. as her appearance was) and Molly Ringwald was just another reason to see the movie - both shows were fantastic, and Simon Bossell ("The Castle") in a brilliant role as a joker technician. <br /> < br /> I think this movie is one of the best horror products of the past few years or years, and a beautiful satire / parody - toungue-in-cheek by the end of the year. <br /> <br /> A Have a look.
