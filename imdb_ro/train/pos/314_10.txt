This show is a great story of history. It has everything from slavery to the way they were treated, to religion, to the ways in which the Jews were hiding, the prison, the belief in Orisha the African gods, the way women were treated, including the daughters. Even to homosexuality. The way the characters get together and that Violent, that character is sorry for me. She is so desperate to be loved to destroy everyone around her. I'm so glad they decided to release her at t.v. again. Though I would like to see the needless version. Xica has become my heroine. I look up just as she uses her power to help everyone who is looking for it. I like all the characters and I have discovered that they can refer to many people now in this century. I look forward to giving myself Xica every night. It would be great to copy it in English, so Americans can love her too.
