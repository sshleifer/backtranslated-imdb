"Secret Sunshine" reminded me of "The Rapture" (1991) with Mimi Rogers and David Duchovny, but this Korean production is a better film. Expresses super-religious Korean Christians in a provincial Korean city, and the experiences of the main character interact with them following a horrible personal tragedy. Shin-ae is a single widow who moves to Milyang ("Secret Sunshine" in Chinese) in Seoul and her young son. He chose Milyang because her late husband (killed in a car crash) was born there and feels he needs to make a new start to life in a new place. It does not respond well to the overlaps of local Christian zealots, one of whose members is trying to persuade her to come to their church and prayer meetings. Shin-ae is essentially irrelevant and brushes these people as politely as they can. In fact, she tries to start almost everyone in Milyang, but some of them persist in trying to invade her world, and the consequences are often hilarious. To say more is to quit the movie, but it should be noted that the performance of the woman in the lead role (Jeon Do-yeon) is amazing. After reading that she won the Best Actress Award in Cannes in 2007, I expected a decent job. But Mrs. Jeon is captivating and it's impossible to take your eyes off her when she's on the screen. The film is a kind of sudden work by Evelyn Waugh-esquire, showing how Fate can feel crazy, as strangely inevitable.
