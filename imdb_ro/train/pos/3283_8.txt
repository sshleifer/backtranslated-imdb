As a lover of surreality (art and film), I was delighted to discover this film on IFC. He is definitely a goalkeeper. Most of the other reviews tell the general story (not all the correct), so I do not mind giving up somebody with it. The main thing is the alternative concept of the world that is brought about by Ana's imminent illness and how she manages to bind someone else after she was so "alone," and eventually her family, whom I think is still a bit cloudy. It can only be called a horror movie in that it has frightening scenes, but it's a fantasy (with a little hint of "coming of age" just because Ana is a pre-teenager who "hates boys"). I trust it to those who appreciate the extent of their imagination.
