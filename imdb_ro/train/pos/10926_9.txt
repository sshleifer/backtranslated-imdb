If you like kung-fu movies and have not seen this movie, it inserts you. This film is one of the only cheap kung-fu that could be recommended to fans of all types of film. Normally, a heavy-duty fan of the genre is needed to see something in these movies, but it has everything! The story is well said and completed. The battle scenes are wonderful and tend to end before you get bored of them completely (unlike the Crouching Tiger). Throw yourself into a little mystery and torture and have fun with a movie. See this at any price. Heck, my wife even enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Wu Du it! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
