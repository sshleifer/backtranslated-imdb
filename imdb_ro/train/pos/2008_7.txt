The original Vampiri (1998) is one of my favorites. I was curious to see how it will continue, since they did not use any of the original characters. I was quite surprised at how he played it. As a rule, continuations are never as good as the original, with a few exceptions. Although this film was not a great movie, the writer managed to keep the main themes and the vampire tradition from the first in tact. Jon Bon Jovi was an initial disadvantage, but turned out to be a decent Slayer. I doubt anyone could take on James Wood's performance in the first, though ... unless you brought Buffy! In total, it was a decent watch and I would look it again. > <br /> I was left with two questions, although ... what happened to Jack Crow and how did Derek Bliss become a killer? I think we have to leave this to imagination.
