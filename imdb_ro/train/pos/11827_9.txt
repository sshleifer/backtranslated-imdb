If Dick Tracy was white and black, the Pope would not be religious. Delivering a new sense of color concept in a movie, we are given a unique experience in a comic world and is one of the few movies that managed to do it, thanks to a serious scenario, good direction, excellent performance (Al Pacino is amazing) and, most importantly, a powerful mix of cinema, art direction and costume design. Using just the primary colors, the experience is quite different from what I saw before. And there is also a fairly successful homage to all sorts of gangster films, virtually gone from modern cinema. Generally, I see this movie as a fresh attempt and a touch of originality in a cinema that is increasingly based on old and already seen formulas. 7 out of 10.
