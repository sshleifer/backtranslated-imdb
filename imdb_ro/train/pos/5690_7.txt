I just watched this movie on DVD and I thought the acting was very good, but the whole story left much to be desired. This film has the same texture and appearance of Panic in Needle Park or Drugstore Cowboy. It is hard to believe that human beings can live this type of lifestyle; on the background of society, where their total existence is based on the use of drugs, crimes, violence, gender and total lack of self-esteem for anyone or anything else, including themselves. Val Kilmore is outstanding in his role of "burned" out of former porn star John Holmes. The support distribution is just as good. However, this is a grim, dark, disturbing and depressing film. Crime was brutal, but the daily life of these people was brutal. Unless you're interested in these crimes, or you've been a fan of John Holmes, it's not really a movie to see. If you want to see a documentary about crime, Truman Capote's film in 1960 in the movie "Cold Blood" with Scott Wilson and Robert Blake is much better.
