Overall, I liked this film and would recommend it to indie film lovers. However, I want to note the similarities between the parts of this film and Nichols' Closer. A scene in particular when Adrian Grenier's character casts doubt on Rosario Dawson about his sexual life while he was away is remarkably similar to the scene in Closer where Clive Owen's character asks Julia Roberts, of "Love" less harsh and intensive. Note also that "Anna" is the name of the characters of Dawson and Roberts. It can not be a coincidence. Now Closer is based on Patrick Marber's play and is supposed to be based on "Reigen" by Arthur Schnitzler, so I'm not sure how this connection was formed. Whoever has an idea?
