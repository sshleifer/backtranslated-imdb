I think if you asked the majority of JW if he expects a miraculous treatment because of their faith, you will find that not. I know I'm not doing this. What you will find in return is that they believe the promises made by Christ of a resurrection. So even if the worst thing happened and we die while we hold on to our integrity, Jehovah can and will correct this. Indeed, he comes to a simple question: Is God true to you is this just to believe? If it's real and you trust it, you'll follow its instructions no matter what the short-term result. I had a heart attack a year and a half ago. One of my family was horrified when he saw the words "NO ONE" written in large letters on my map. I argued with her that if I were in a position where only a blood transfusion would save my life, would it be a good time for anger, the only one could resume my life when the time came? He did not get it - God is not real enough for her. Sin. I want her to have the comfort that a strong belief offers.
