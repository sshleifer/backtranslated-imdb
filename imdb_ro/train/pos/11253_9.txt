This is an extremely long film, which means you can become very bored before it becomes interesting, but its length offers the opportunity for its characters to find a permanent attachment to your sympathies. <br /> <br /> If you are moved by the guilty guilt you will find it especially heart, because it is a story that finds the heroes among the wicked and the weak. If you can love a monster, you will cry for Magnus Pym, the spy who betrays everyone - especially the country, his friends and his family - a man who has also been manipulated and cast from childhood by the same people. <br /> <br /> There is not a genuinely liked person in the whole story, not a loyal, "moral" personality to sympathize. But forgetting everything without the help of a tissue would be remarkable. I really enjoyed it very much. It's worth it for those who enjoy exciting movies about the higher human character.
