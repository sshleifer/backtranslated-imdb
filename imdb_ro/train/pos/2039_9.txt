First of all, I would like to point out that the people who criticized this film made some flagrant errors. Anything that has a rating of less than 6/10 is simply nonsense. <br /> <br /> Creep is an absolutely fantastic movie with stunning movie effects. Actors are extremely credible, provocative narrative thought and horror and extremely disturbing graphic content. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of mysticism in this movie. Many questions arise because the public is revealed to the strange and strange creature that makes habitat in dark tunnels of rats. How was Craig created and what happened to him? A fantastic movie with a cool cooling factor. A movie with so many unanswered questions and a movie that has to be appreciated with others, like 28 days later, Bunker, Dog Soldiers and Deathwatch. I look forward to more of these fantastic movies!
