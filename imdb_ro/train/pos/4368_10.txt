This is a very interesting and romantic film. I've seen it many times and never get bored of it. Everything is realistic and is a good plot. The actors are excellent Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, Tim Roth and Brian Cox. I actually prefer this Braveheart movie as Braveheart that contains so many historical mistakes. There are many exciting scenes - take care of the Bridge Scene and the last enclosure scene. This is a very good and surprising scene. Music is great ... it really matches the movie. The setting is amazing.
