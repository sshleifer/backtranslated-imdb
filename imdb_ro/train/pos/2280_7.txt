It's hard to categorize the movie - maybe it's an avant-garde spy thriller? Mom Night is a very good novel about Vonnegut and certainly one of the simplest novels to adapt to a feature film. Adaptation to the movie is very loyal to the original book. The "indie" approach to how this movie was produced is probably more effective than having a great Hollywood studio to fund it. Nowadays, I doubt that a smart novel like Mother Nopta will ever get green light from Hollywood's big spaces. And, normally, it's too bad, but not in this case. Mother's night has a tight direction and a solid distribution. Nick Nolte, who seems to have better roles as he gets older, still has that character "man" that allows him to take on a wide range of different characters. Sheryl Lee is beautiful and wonderful as always. I always thought it was better than it was out of the entertainment industry. I think that making your debut as a dead girl (Twin Peaks) with little air time is not the most selected role, even if the TV show becomes a minor phenomenon. However, this movie is completely enjoyable and you do not have to read the book to understand the movie. In fact, given the current geopolitical realities, the premise of the novel may appear dated, and some younger viewers with little knowledge of history will be completely confused by the events that are taking place (I speak with you, American colleagues who are students and which records the smallest industrialized world in geography, history and the Lord knows what other subjects!).
