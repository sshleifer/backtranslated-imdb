24 must be the best spy / adventure television ever emitted. The whole idea of ​​telling a story in a 24-hour real-time is dazzling. The style of shooting and rhythm is what makes us forget. And Jack Bauer is one of the greatest protagonists in a long series of television. I have evaluated this, along with the Simpsons and X Files, the three most popular TV series. This first episode begins with the conspiratorial assassination of US Senator David Palmer, who is also president. Bauer is called to his office to find out who is behind all of these things and at the same time to imagine his daughter's path to annoyance after she has fled her bedroom. Thus, an adventure begins on the best political style and, best of all, it always takes place in real time, which makes this TV series a true work of originality at a time when almost all programs the TV seems to show us the same things over and over and over.
