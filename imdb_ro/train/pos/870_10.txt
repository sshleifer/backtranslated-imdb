"Read My Rips" (which probably has a different idiomatic resonance in its French title) is a contemporary story of office politics, which unexpectedly becomes a murder murder, while unusually suitable characters slid up and down an ethic and the Parties are magnetic, Emmanuelle Devos (which I have not seen before, despite his long summary in French films) and Vincent Cassel (who brought sexy and / or threatening to some of the films in the US) . The first half of the film is on the lawn in a competitive real estate office and he is the neophyte. The second half is on her ground as an ex-con and her scary adaptation to this environment. Writer / director Jacques Audiard uses the hearing loss woman very cleverly as an entr√©e for us in her perceptions, turning the sound up and down so that we can hear it as she does (so it's even more annoying than usual when I speak audience members) using visual as sensory reactors. None of the characters act as expected (it is not like that collapsible victim in "In the Company of Men," not in individual interactions, not in the scene, and not in the general arch of the story line unpredictable at the last blow, but heck the audience was expecting this fulfillment), as we move from a modern office, to a stirring disco, to romantic and criminal raids. There is a side story that is redundant and useless thematically, but that gives us a few minutes to catch our breath. This is one of my favorites in the year! <br /> <br /> (Originally written 7/28/2002)
