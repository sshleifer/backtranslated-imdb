I looked at this series. I was seven / eight when I was. I still remember the first episode that was called "New House". He scared me! I can still hear that statue, laughing madly. And the end, God! The Horror Spirit Comes Into the Baby Room: Yikes! It was classical television and it was a variety. I found a DVD collection for sale on the internet: 2 actually. My question to any reader: Has anyone bought this set? It's a bootleg. Both vendors claim they have a very good copy. I have a DVD episode "The New House" and some other episodes that are a bit better if someone knows if they are much clearer and worth buying and sharing their children. A great, intelligent, frightening and supernatural bold series. Thanks in advance to any fan who has the lowest values ​​because of that - In fact, I would love to discuss it. Chris Walker
