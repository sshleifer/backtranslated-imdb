Kell's Secret is one of the most unique, beautiful, and animated movies I've ever seen. Before watching this movie, I was convinced that nothing could give up a run for his money and that it was a shoo-in to win in this category, but I found in Kells a serious competitor. Kell's secret tells the story of a young orphan named Brendan, who lives with his uncle, Kell's abbot. The abbot is a loving guard, but perhaps a little too strict and much more concerned with fortification of the wall around the city due to a vice coming from the Vikings than to care for the boy's imagination. When legendary brother Aidan (who looks surprisingly like Willie Nelson) appears and takes the boy under his wing, Brendan goes on a trip in the woods and meets a wonderful forest called Aisling who likes to enjoy more once time). With Aisling's help, he tries to save the city and help Brother Aidan complete the mystical book that the legend can turn into darkness in the light.
