Vladimir Navokov's literary genius is brought back to the screen, and many of the culture world will get acquainted. The director puts us in touch with Alexander's story, a absentminded study of chess dependence. Nastasya rests in a marble resort with a chess championship. He meets Alexander by taking a piece of queen he escapes through his pocket. A magnetic attraction evolves by proposing the next day, mother alarmed her husband telegrams. He arrives and casts doubt on Alexander that we are confronted with the past, for the Second Priest, where we see the young Alexander, a wonderful child. He is taken under the wing of school teachers and exploits his genius for 10 years, making large sums. Think Alexander has reached the top, abandons him, but becomes a legend. The old professor returns, provoking evil, trying to win an old rival of Alexander. In a serious chess game where the world victory of the chess champion is a way of immortality, the chess clock beats, the time of the game ends to end the next day. On that day is Nastasya's wedding, the old teacher intervenes, and Alexander is sent in a nervous breakdown. Nastasya, holding his stomach and looking through the coat of love, finds the strategy for the match and follows the movements. Although the film, unfortunately, swells by its Russian roots, its beautiful dresses are beautiful, Alexander plays his sublime role. The director has underestimated the audience, we can not ever play the one and the only suggestion of The Luzhin Defense is after quitting the queen, the opponent King with the 3 paws and the king, sacrificing the castle for the partner. Nastasya is a wonderful match, but he feels that his conclusion deserves greater intensity, but perhaps the emotions were directed to check chess that meant more to him than to her. The defense lure gives the honor to Navokov, the complexity of his work in images is a world event that should not be missed.
