I liked this movie I remember that there is a scene well done in this movie where Riff Randell (played by PJ Soles) is in her smoking bed and then begins to see that Ramones are in the room with her playing the song "I Want You Around "... very cool stuff. It was fun, energetic, weird and cool. Yes, I admit that the end is on the big road and looking for ... but it does not matter because it's fun that it's a really fun movie. It's Sex, Pot and Rock n Rocll Forever I've read that cheap trick was the band that was originally staying in this one. But I do not know whether this is true or not
