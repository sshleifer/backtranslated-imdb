Tom Hanks, as you have never seen before. Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, "The Angel of Death." He is a hitman for his surrogate father, John Rooney (Paul Newman), an elderly Irish mafia boss. Sullivan's young son (Tyler Hoechlin) witnesses what his father is doing, and both are soon on the road for seven weeks, robbing the banks to avenge the killing of Sullivan's wife and another son. Enter Jude Law as a reporter / photographer who wants to kill Sullivan for his chance to add to his collection of photos of dead mobs. Filmed nicely capturing the drama of life in the 1930s. Sometimes the rhythm gets worse, but then an explosion of graphic violence sustains the story. Director Sam Mendes leads this dramatic drama about loyalty, responsibility, betrayal, and the bond of a secret man and his son. Other notable members are: Dylan Baker, Stanley Tucci, Daniel Craig and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Hanks proves to be excellent again in a very memorable movie. Make room for some Oscars!
