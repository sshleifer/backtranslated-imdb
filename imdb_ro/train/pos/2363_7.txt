This adaptation of MR James's story "A View From A Hill" was first shown on British television in 2005 on the BBC 4 digital channel. I saw it was repeated on BBC 4 again and decided to give it Go, reminding him of the BBC's successful 1970 adaptations of other James James stories, including "Whistle And I Will Come To You" and "The Signalman". Although not in the same class as these masterpieces, "A View From A Hill" is nevertheless a pleasant drama and sometimes suspense. A historian arrives in a small rural village to look at the collection of a recent deceased collector of ancient artifacts. While in the countryside, he sees a monastery that has been in ruins for hundreds of years. But what does that have to do with a pair of old binoculars and a frightening legend about Gallows Hill? And what do I know about this situation, the country ruler and his servant? Although I was not afraid at all, I enjoyed this small production, and if the running time was longer than 40 minutes, it could have been a real adaptation. As it happens, everything feels a little hurried, and a smaller exposure to establish mood would have been welcome. Give 7 out of 10.
