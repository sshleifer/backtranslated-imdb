An ultramodern house in a rich neighborhood seems to be the cause of every bizarre (and deadly) behavior of its inhabitants. Or at least that's the argument of Lara Flynn Boyle's character, Col Kennedy. After a series of deadly events in a gargantuan house, Col knows something has to give. Mark-Paul Gosselaar also plays the role of the mysterious architect. My Opinion: House Next Door works because of Lara Flynn Boyle and its location (beautiful house) and elegant sets. Boyle is a talented and dynamic actress, not to mention absolutely amazing. It brings credibility to her character and makes the film interesting. Without her, it would have failed. "It's so alive," says a potential buyer for the house. Yeah, he's alive. But the story itself is not so much. Barring Boyle's presence does not happen too much here, as an enormous amount of movie is spent watching or waiting to see how the house will affect the current owners. The results are predictable. But I liked it anyway. Cinema gives the film a polished look. 8/10 due to Boyle, premise of an ultra-modern house, locations and cinema, decoration and cabinet.
