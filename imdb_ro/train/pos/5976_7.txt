Trick or Treat, Quickie Review This zany romp of a movie revolves around the 80's Heavy Metal culture and horror films - two things they love very much. So, as you can imagine, this movie made me quite easy. In addition, for no apparent reason, Ozzy Osbourne plays a preacher. This film is about an unpopular high school boy who, like all our losers, has died in a world of "bad" Heavy Metal. His favorite metal dies and, of course, he is miraculously resurrected - playing his last album incessantly back. This allows the sophisticated singer to go around killing people with demons and help him. Okay, she's pretty cheesy sometimes, but you know what? It has a surprising number of good qualities. Decent action (including Gene Simmons as a radio DJ), good special effects, very short nudity, decent atmosphere ... Overall, it's actually a decent horror movie. But what sucks greatly is music. Ironic, right? Well, this metal uber-evil metal is one of the most inappropriate, angry, crying, motley Crue rejects on the planet - and "Metal" is a bit more than metal Pop / He hits all the cliches here, from to walk like a homosexual fair, to show bad, to scream "Rock and Roll !!!" at a height high enough to make King Diamond Retch. Apart from that atrocious musical representation, it's actually pretty good. 7/10 <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
