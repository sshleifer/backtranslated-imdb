Rachel McAdams. Cillian Murphy. Wes Craven. Dream Team. This is one of the best thrillers since 2005. A wonderful plot. A great twist. A big candy. This is one of Wes Craven's greatest movies, besides "Scream" and "A Nightmare on Elm Street". It could be the best. Film is one of the best things about the movie and it's very simple. Lisa Reisert (McAdams), a fighting hotel manager, returns to Los Angeles. He knows a little that he was followed by Jackson Ripner AKA Jack Ripper (Murphy). They have two drinks and they get together on the plane. Later, he reveals that he is an assassin who was sent to kill the Secretary of Homeland Security, who lives in Lisa's hotel. And what should she have with Lisa? Well, he'll have to move his room to the suite so he can bomb him if he does not kill Ripner on her father (Brian Cox). Twisting and bringing the story really gives him extra zing, and side characters and side jokes really add to it. Overall, definitely one of the best thrillers in 2005. It's definitely worth seeing. 3 1/2 of 4 stars
