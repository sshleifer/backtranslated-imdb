Clint Eastwood has certainly produced better movies than that, but that does not make him shame. Dirty Harry draws everyone's attention, and if someone does not want to look at romance, there's no reason why they do not like it. It's wonderful because it's dirty, it's great because it kills without much thought, it's perfect because it gets the right bullet through your heart and a hero because it does not care. From what I have seen in Eastwood's films, leadership always captures the audience. In the heart of White Hunter Black, he is the crazy director, in "in the Line of Fire" he is "old" a "while" here is "almost" unemployment with his work, ie he does work for himself, does not care by someone about his superiors who practically send him for a holiday. "Based on a rape victim, this film is promising to all" no no-sense "film observers. these things, which makes it slightly inferior to Eastwood's best movies, is that, although the character of the main role is captivating, the plot is not because it's too obvious from the beginning. It's not a movie that makes you stand out, a place without moving. There are too many more dirty people than Dirty Harry.
