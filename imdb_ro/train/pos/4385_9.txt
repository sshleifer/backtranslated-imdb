What can be said about a movie that has one of the darkest, the nihilist and, occasionally, the weirdest - I will not say "sympathetic". Will I say "charismatic" bastards in the history of Cinema and the best sword fight at Flynn and Fairbanks were old? This is an epic about a stubborn, sometimes bad, fight with such brave and honest struggle for its honor and freedom against tyranny. I liked. John Hurt and Tim Roth were great villains. Jessica Lange was very cool, trendy and sensual.
