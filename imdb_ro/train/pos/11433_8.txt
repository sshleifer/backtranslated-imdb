Despite the patronage of George Lucas, this captivating and original fantasy in "Lumage" (a combination of live action animation) is just as far away from children's usual price as anything else done by Ralph Bakshi during the glory. Dramatically designed characters such as the Ralph dog (a duo of humility, the heroes rejected), Sinonamess Botch and Rod Rescueman (the superhero pomp) give life to a unique intelligent concept: Frivoli vs. Murkwood or the eternal struggle between dreams and nightmares. In this context, songs infected with MOR on the soundtrack should not have worked, but somehow they do. Is it a real sin, therefore, that I had to follow this through a really scary boot (which was sacrificed from a television movie) of the uncensored version? is there also a milder version that tightened the language for VHS release? because the movie is otherwise unavailable on DVD. Interestingly, both Henry Selick and David Fincher have worked on this image in subordinate capabilities.
