When you compare what Brian De Palma did in the 80's with what's going on today for entertainment, his films keep getting better and better. "Dressed To Kill", "Blow Out", "Body Double", "Scarface" and "Way Carlito" are the superb works of a cinematographer at the top of his powers. The guy had a long duration of better than average movies. This is a 80-year-old Hitchcock glass, a story of affectionate kissing and killing, with a lot of twists, a huge style game, an amazing Pino Donaggio score and a guilty plot. the work of the desk and the stylized and bloody images help to overcome logical holes, while the extraordinary performances of Dennis Franz, Keith Gordon (a good director himself), Nancy Allen (De Palma's wife at that time) and Michael Caine every special scene. Let the virtuoso take you to a surreal, frightening and erotic load of Odyssey and enjoy every Dressed To Kill frame.
