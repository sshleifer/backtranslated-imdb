The film "Crush" examines female friendship, largely avoiding the quality of sugar that destroys so many films on the same theme (eg, "Steel Magnolias"). At the same time, it reveals the power of a sudden passion to overwhelm and surprise. The events described were very improbable, but the subjective emotional truth seemed very authentic to me. It's not a movie for the speed-vehicle crowd and explosion, but the adult women are sure they will respond with both laughter and tears.
