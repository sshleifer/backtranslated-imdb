The first installment of this series of notorious horror shows a woman kidnapped by a band of black men who tortures her a few days before killing her. He is beaten wild, rotated in an endless chair, pulls his nails, animal consciousness is thrown on it, and hot boiling water is poured on it, and finally her eye is punctured with a needle (very sick and ugly scene). The producers of this unforgettable torture show have tried to make it as real as possible and for me one is the closest thing to a tobacco movie that you can get without committing killing on the tape. of course, some of the special effects are quite weak, but the idea of ​​making a smoker is quite terrible. I also saw the "Flowers of blood and blood" that is more aggressive and sadistic but less disturbing. In any case, this is a must for horror fans!
