What Happens: Four Grain Cereal Cereals Dinosaurs and are now friendly and friendly dinosaurs they'll be cute with the kids. Are they entering New York with big plans? <br /> <br /> My thoughts: This is a cute animated movie. Animation of dinosaurs when they are cute and friendly is a bit floppy and not-so-good, but looks pleasing in the same way. I like dinosaurs when they are cute and friendly, they are cute, friendly and good. I love (almost) all the characters presented, especially Elsa and Cecilia, but of course I like the others. On the whole, I really like this movie! :-) Recommended for: People who love the animated films of good children, people who love dinosaurs, John Goodman and people who think circuses are not always what they seem? Enjoy! :-)
