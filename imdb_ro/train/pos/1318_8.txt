I felt compelled to write a review for Space Cobra because it received a good 7.3 star rating, but only a few of the comments from the time I wrote this were particularly positive. A strange situation and we hope that my positive review will turn people to this old and most forgotten film by Anime. Space Cobra is the funky story of a smuggler and a dishonest who gets involved with the three sisters of an ancient and dead planet and a bad force that wants to exploit the powers of the planets. This is an old movie and animation shows, but what it lacks in modern sophistication makes it abundantly charming. Space Cobra is very oriented towards a Western audience and very easy to follow. There are few references to a certain Japanese culture and excellent for beginners at Anime to look and enjoy. Space Cobra himself is wizarding and pleasant. I can not say how much is due to the English doubles or the manufacturer's intentions, but this is one of the few Japanese comedic characters they find really funny. The style is sixty-year-old Barbarellish with a fantastic soundtrack by Yello. Style is colorful and imaginative and there is constant action to move the story along. The strangest aspect of this film is how it begins as a comedy and ends on a very poor drama. I can not think of another Anime or general movie that has been able to do this without a problem and convincing. You barely realize it is happening, but it is so subtle and looks perfectly natural. You also feel that the characters have traveled and that life has been changed by the whole experience. Check if you can.
