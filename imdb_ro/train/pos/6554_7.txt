OK, heres what I say: The movie was great. I'm a great fan of Nancy and I read all the original books of 1-56 and I continued to read more. I am now 96. Beware of villains who give this film a smaller degree than they should have. All clues indicate a great movie! I liked everything. So what's at Nancy today. She is still old fashioned as she is in the books! People who have not read more than 5 books complain about Nancy's view. I read them all and I think Emma is perfect and Nancy was perfect. I found parts of the scary movie. I liked the interesting searches of the cars and I took it. I liked the clues. I've solved the mystery myself! Was awesome. I suggest you see it, because people who complain do not know anything about A what good movie and B about Nancy Drew. Go see. He may not be Oscar-winning, but even a good movie.
