This is a very good movie, made for television. She describes problems in the suburbs around 1970 and the genre of neighbors certainly does not want to have around. The most serious and disturbing part of the movie was when punk teenagers killed the family dog. Adolescents do everything to upset and harass this poor family. But guys, the character of lead avenge those teenagers punk in the end. The father / owner of the house will not easily take away all the aggravation from the punk adolescents and will repress quickly after the police have no help. He rises to them and protects his home and family. A very good actor. I could add. I saw this on TV when I was like 8 or 9. I never saw him on TV and I would like to do it. Definitely a good one! It's a kind of movie that you can catch on a weekly night late too late at night and can not stop viewing or an afternoon movie over a weekend. I'm the kind she does not look like. It's worth seeing!
