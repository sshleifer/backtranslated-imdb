This film is brilliant in every respect. It touches the complexity of loving relationships in a significant way, but never teaches. The script never condemns any character, not even the unfortunate Johnny. It also benefits from spot-on direction, production design, casting and performance. The fact that Cher is so perfect in the movie and is rather different from "Cher" than it ever was is a wonder for me. I look at Moonstruck at least once a year and I just saw her again on Christmas Eve with my six-year-old twins and she also liked it. It has something for everyone with a heart and it finally gives you joy.
