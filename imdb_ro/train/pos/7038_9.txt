"The First War was 100% outsourced." Dan Ackroyd's line says it all. This is a hard-to-describe film; comedy, satire, action, screwdriver. He reminded me once or twice of Dr. Strangelove, especially in scenes with Ben Kingsley (who made remarkable things to me). I do not have special expectations for this movie, though I'm a great fan of John Cusack, so I let the movie wash over me. And as a result, I was quite fun. Political satire is painfully precise and quite condemning the US military-business complex. Sub-parcels were somewhat predictable, but the ultimate interconnection of story lines has made them all worthwhile. I understand why this movie was not very popular in the US, but for the rest of the world, it's a timely story.
