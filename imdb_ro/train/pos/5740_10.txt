The powers and emotional characters of Dominick and Eugene are the things Hollywood no longer does. This is one of the most exciting, sensitive, and heartful movies I've ever seen! Roy Liotta, Tom Hulce and supporting actress Jamie Lee Curtis deliver Oscar winning shows! There are not enough words to express how great this movie is. Sure, people are not sentimental films may not care as much as the rest of us about Dominick and Eugene, but for the rest of us, this movie goes right to the heart and sole of compassion and humanity. You will never forget this movie EVER! <br /> <br /> MORE SPOILER ***** ***** <br /> <br /> The story simple, but eloquent, says proudly. Eugene is a mid-school trainee who faces long hours and has a demanding job at the hospital. His brother Dominick twin brothers (born 12 minutes earlier) is a little slow and awkward due to brain damage caused by a victim of abuse by their father. (A moment full of heart when this is the movie that will leave you in tears!) Eugene (A.K. "Geno") faces a painful dilemma. He must decide whether to finish medical school, which would mean accepting residency in another city and leave Dominick (ie, "Nicky") behind, or lose the rest of his education to take care of him. Nicky helps pay med school for school to his brother working as a collector garbage bin. <br /> <br /> Ethics, morals and responsibilities are sharply mixed in this landmark movie. Only when Gino thinks Nicky could make progress towards independence, Dominick is back and winds do things like helping a drug dealer, or binding to using a defective cable he finds at the garbage dump an electrical appliance. <br /> <br /> Larry is "character" and his partner Nicky path of trash that fills the head gullible Dominick with all kinds of stories like Geno and Jennifer (his girlfriend, he is tutoring clinical pharmacology) go to the Atlantic City and gambling at all their money. But deep, you can see that Larry cares about him. In their tournaments, Nicky is also friends with a little boy, whom we learn that he was beaten by his father. A final result is also tragic and the pain you see on Nicky's face when it happens, speaks volumes. <br /> <br /> The sensitivity that the share of two brothers for each other can not be overstated enough. All Nicky wants to do is be loved and seek acceptance anyway. (that is, going to church, loving Hulk Hogan) Geno loves Nicky more than anything in the world. But can his brother become independent enough for Geno to pursue his dream of becoming a doctor? A brilliant film that should have gained more recognition than it deserves, but unfortunately it went out at the same time as Rain Man, dealing with a similar problem. However, I love Dominick and Eugene more because they have a much stronger emotional component. Be warned that this movie is directed directly to the channels of tears, so have Kleenex at hand! What movie!
