I'll be honest. I took the movie to have fun. I mean, come on, "Hood of the Dead"? What other reaction could I have? The thing is, however, that the movie (and its factors) have decided it will not be fun. Instead, he was going to try all the best to be a good movie. And you know what? It was very close. A little less cheese in incidental music, a little more professionalism in photography, acting, happenings (like the props - love the Best Buy bag) ... well, it's not a classic of the kind of zombie movie, but it's still a film pretty tidy on his own. And the action, writing and rhythm are surprisingly good than I would have expected. There's even decent humor, because two of our leaders are debating how to decide if a dead zombie is really dead. If you can overlook the low budget (which leaves its fingerprints altogether, unfortunately) and almost constant profanity, this can be a fun time for movies. No, it's not great. Yes, it could have been better. But the producers, the actors, the crew, all tried to make a good movie (instead of the classic camp) and that matters a lot. The zombie campy line is a mile long and thank you, guys, because you do not add them. Kudos to the Quiroz Brothers. I'd love to see what they're doing next. And hey, somebody, give them a budget!
