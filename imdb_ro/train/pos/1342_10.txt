A delightful and wonderful look at the films that inspired the excellent Martin Scorsese. Many of the films he talks about are easily related to his works, especially to his earlier works, to the silent epic. Very enjoyable, despite being long, I thought it was one of the best documentaries on the film. Compulsory watch if you admire Martin Scorsese and his work.
