At first you think another Disney movie, it might be good, but it's a movie for kids. But when you watch it you can only help yourself. All ages will love this movie. I saw the first movie when I was 10 years old and 8 years later I still love! Danny Glover is great and could not play the better part. Christopher Lloyd is hilarious and is perfect for a party. Tony Danza is as credible as Mel Clark. You can not help but enjoy this movie! I give it a 10/10!
