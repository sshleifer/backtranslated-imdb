"Dressed to Kill" is certainly one of the best horror / thriller movies ever made. It is an elegant and highly suspicious mix of sex and violence. The act is pretty good, Pino Donaggio's orchestral score is unforgettable and there are a lot of surprises ("Angry Dickinson"), her teenage daughter (Keith Gordon), her psychoanalyst (Michael Caine) and a girlfriend (Nancy Allen )). The killer in the film is a transsexual called Bobbi, who is also one of Caine's patients. The film is full of amazing moments: the infamous crime scene of the elevator is extremely stylish and pretty red as well. Highly recommended.
