I hired this movie because of my interest in American history and, in particular, the strange story of the Mormons. This film tries to make sense of the way Joseph Smith can turn his "vision" into a major world religion. He first focuses on the problems that the Mormons had in their settlement in Navuoo, Illinois. She describes the process of Joseph Smith. During this process, Brigham Young rises to say about his conversion to Mormonism and his belief in Smith's spiritual message. Then Smith is assassinated, and Young has to deal with his own doubts as to whether he was chosen to lead the Mormons to a new site. Despite his serious doubts, he perseveres and, ultimately, has a vision (that Utah is the place of his colony) that gives him confidence in the fairness of his leadership. Later, when crops are destroyed by crickets, he doubts once again that he was really chosen - yet, there is a miracle that cherishes his place in history. I found the performances to move and the story to be convincing and interesting. I would love to know if the Mormons believe this is a precise portrait. Polygamy is part of the story, but the reasons why this is essential for LDS are not high. The problem is not underlined. I'm sure people are away from this movie because of their religious object, but they have excellent distribution and will keep you going all the way.
