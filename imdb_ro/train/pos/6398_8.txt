"Inspirational" stories about the "triumph of the human spirit" are usually great attacks for me. The most surprising thing about men of honor is how much I liked in my life. The movie is as predictable and cliche as it happens, but it works. A lot of credits refer to the extraordinary performance of the two leaders. It is a perfect role for Cuba Gooding, Jr., who is wonderfull retained here. We have come to expect many of De Niro and he does not disappoint. Create a fun portrait. Director George Tillman, Jr., has set out to make an old film and comes with a winner.
