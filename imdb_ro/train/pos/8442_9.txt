The film was excellent, except for several scenes with Esposito. I liked how he brought every detective of the series together and wrapped up some figures that had never been solved during the show (thanks to NBC ...). It was great to see Pembleton and Bayliss together with the most humane and elementary people. Braugher and Secor did a good job, but as usual they will be overlooked. It hurts to see this was the end of the Homicide. The memories, tapes, and rehearsals on CourtTV are not the same as watching every Friday. But the movie did its job and did it very well, presenting a great picture of the life after Al retired and the family relationship that existed between the unit. I liked very much.
