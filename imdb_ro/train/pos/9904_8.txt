Slaughter High is about a boy named Marty. He was harassed and took her to high school. A group of children played more jokes on it, and these jokes were REALLY negative. The last joke ended tragically. <br /> <br /> 5 years later. The group of children meets again for a meeting. One of them put it in the old high school. The school is abandoned now and must enter. For some reason, Janitor is still there, but tells them to go ahead and have fun because I give him a beer. parties, staring at their old locker room, and seeing something about Marty. A girl feels bad for Marty, but another guy calms her down. Once the killings begin, it's great. Every killing is creative and upsetting. We see a figure in a mask of shit, hunting them one by one in the whole school. Apparently Marty returns to exact revenge. After the first person is killed, they find they are stuck in school. They are starting to look for an exit. Now there are a number of illogical things in this movie. First of all, I do not know anyone who has a five-year meeting. Secondly, after the first child dies, a girl has blood everywhere. Everybody runs into panic, yet goes to the bathroom and finds a bathtub. Hrr's boyfriend was just killed and she decides to make a bath! More importantly, why is there a bath in a school bathroom. Anyway, the bathtub does not seem to really work ... and a horrible death dies, it's a 1980s movie. is a horror siren. Who does it if it has some illogical parts. I do not. This movie has really great death. The end ... there's a turn. After seeing Haute Tension recently, I can compare the two. The only way they are similar is that there is a twist that left me disappointed ... right after twisting, there comes a big, if not the best, death in the movie. <br /> <br /> After the last death, the killer looks at the screen and also does something crazy, and was the perfect way to end the movie. I'm going "wow ..."
