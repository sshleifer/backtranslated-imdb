No, that's not Alice's story to my friends! This "Wonderland" fable is based on the true story of Wonderland's bloody crimes that took place in the 1980s in California. At the center of this bloodbath was nothing but "Johnny Wad" himself. Yeah, John Holmes! Daddy ding-dong also used other rifles than the infamous 13-inch milk machine. In addition to being a legendary adult film actor, Holmes was a drug addict, who was friends with various Hollywood drugs. Val Kilmer was sometimes majestic than Holmes, but because once Holmes did not dump him completely. The film possesses a "who's" who supports the players: Josh Lucas and Dylan McDermott as Hollywood riffraffs, Kate Bosworth and Lisa Kudrow as Holmes women, and Eric Bogosian as a threatening contractor for Tinsletown. These characters play integral parts, either directly or indirectly, in the Wonderland assassinations. From this support group, Josh Lucas was the fiercest and most impressive as the ardent Ron Launius. Lucas progresses gradually into a major Hollywood player with such charismatic towers in the movie "A Beautiful Mind" and "Sweet Home Alabama." Director James Cox turned out to be a bit of coxsucker, showing a huge amount of overexposed scenes, like Holmes's famous organ. Holmes was eventually acquitted of "Wonderland" crimes. He died of AIDS virus complications. "The Wonderland" will keep you wondering what really happened that bloody night and whether Holmes put his gun on. Oops! The wrong film Holmes! O.K! That's pretty long before I penalize. I mean penalized. Bye Holmies! *** Average
