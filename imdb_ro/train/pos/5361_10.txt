If you have been raised on a gaming board diet, you will understand that you need a greater and better repair. Well, in the runner's world, your needs will be saturated. Because in this play, prisoners compete for freedom and the final prize - their lives. I liked this movie. It was a parody of the stutter we look every day. It's not one of Schwarzenegger's best performances, but overall it's a great movie. The idea behind the fact that television corporations will one day be the real "real" leaders of the planet is very credible and is very well portrayed in this film. Of course they are the usual ones from Arnie, my favorite is when it is about to be catapulted into the game area, the host of the game asks "All the last words"? Arnie says, "Yes, I'll be back," but the host will try "Just in a resume" and press the eject button. I give this film a 10th originality. I've probably seen it 30 or more times. The only film, apart from the Die Hard series, I've often watched! <br /> <br /> In short, do not think you have your own T.V. - Holds you .....
