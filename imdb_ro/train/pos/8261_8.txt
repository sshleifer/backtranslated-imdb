Sentimental and naive but undoubtedly affectionate, emotional, human-helper man, in this case personified as the German and French miners forced to be locked up after the Great War due to a new frontier, leading to disillusionment on the German side because the French are the bosses. But when a French fire begins, the common decency of the German men leads to assistance, safety and even friendship. This was a reason that would fall on deaf ears in the decade, as a certain man from Pabst would break that piece and turn the Great War into a simple prelude. But it is obvious to me that Pabst believes or at least wants to increase this kind of fundamental humanism, because this film shines with this optimism, while his more flippant and cynical adaptation of The Threepenny Opera did not have the biting needed to do that work. Also, promoting his honest faith is the fact that the characters here are not a simplistic spokesperson for positions, but real people, with real families whose home we live and we are known for. These are ordinary, working class people who just think they deserve to care and treat your fellow man, and on this day of individualistic opportunism, I will give you a little thinness to get a positive message that is a point of a view I think we can all aspire to. (Note: It seems that the end is cut in most prints, where the French rebuilds the mining gate, shutting men once again, a brutal turn of events, and maybe the movie made a better film, but I would cry I was surprised by the positive vibrations of the final sequence, so in short, I'm glad it was cut.) {Grade: 8/10 (B) / # 7 (of 11) of 1931}
