It's not a big movie. The act is not amazing (some of the submarines are even played badly), the movie is not nice in any sense. Nothing is truly inventive or new. If you like big movies, this is not for you but it has a great - REAL great story. Larry's story works because we know this story in our own life. The girl I did not ask for at a meeting, the test we failed, the friend we let down, is still in our history. This movie works because it touches it, it's a wonderful story because it's a small story. It is the life we ​​all have, with regret, we all have the message that strikes: every life we ​​could have had the disadvantage. The first time I saw her, I was 15 years old. She showed up at a school party. 16 years later, I still reflect on it from time to time, and every time I see it, I smiled at my face. Look. It'll do you good. You will be happier with what you have.
