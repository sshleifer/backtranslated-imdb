this movie probably had a budget of $ 750 and still managed to exceed titanic. I rented it the day I crashed my mother's car and it was the only thing that cheered me beyond the faith! must be tied to "The Assault of the Killer Bimbos". The things you need to look for are: 1. Workplace unit from the Chinese girl work place 2. Blonde lined in a sassoon shirt that does not change 3. Flinstone-like spark-like spark 4. The collision ensemble worn by the red just before it gets killed (do not you worry, do not ruin surprises, because it's so predictable) 5. The guy who finds it necessary to scream. 6. The psychic patient who plays a compelling role to be crazy, drawing the eyes of a maniquen. 7. Exercise at the end of the hour at the end of which the teacher and the priest attend. 8. Write graphite on the wall of the toilet. 9. Finally, but not least, wonderful special effects - especially stabbing in the boob that made a ... ask to help me ... popping noise. <br /> <br /> Enjoy! <br /> <br />
