In the classic sense of the four humor (which are not specific to the concept of entertainment or even entertainment), Altman "H.E.A.L.T.H" treats all the humor and, in fact, in fun, fun ways. There is Flegm, personified by the very slow, guarded and protective character of Lauren Bacall, Esther Brill, who has a mission in life, seems to be all about appearance, protecting the secrets of her age and beauty more than her welfare. There is Paul Dooley's colleague, Dr. Gil Gainey, who as a fish in the water (perhaps more like a seal) flopped around frenetic, barking and urging the crowds to subscribe to his aquatic madness. Glenda Jackson's Isabella Garnell's melancholy makes Hamlet, troubled and deceptive to Shakespeare, even offering a soliloquie or two. And let's not forget the character of Henry Gibson's Ball, Bobby Hammer ("The Breastfeeding Child Governs the World"). Then there are the characters Harry Wolff and Gloria Burbank (James Garner and Carol Burnett, respectively), relatively healthy characters striving to strike a balance between all the accompanying and extreme humor that convened for H.E.A.L.T.H. - a kind of world trade organization specializing in HEALTH, which means anything other than health. Altman is the best of them.
