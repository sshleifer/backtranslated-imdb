To a great extent, in the face of the suffering of her adult children and almost immediately after the death of Elizabeth's husband (Dame Judy Dench), the saxophonist, widow, returns back to his musical hobby. Now that George is dead, Elizabeth no longer has to practice playing sax in the attic. As she grows happier to play outdoors, Elizabeth takes a stroll on her memory tape, reminding her of a 15-year-old swing jazz band "The Bombshells Blonde": supposedly, jazz swing musicians. One of the members of "Blonde Bombshells" was a beaten drummer, Patrick (Ian Holm), with whom Elizabeth remained friends. Both, Patrick & Elizabeth, 12-year-old daughter, Joanna (Millie Findlay), press Elizabeth to round up band members and reunite together; this time like a bunch of sexagenarians. Among the members of the band he finds is the bass (still foxy!), Madeleine (Leslie Caron); Dinah (Olimpia Dukakis), a trumpet playing, divorced and widowed with alcohol and out, living off the wealth of many marriages in a Scottish castle Craigievar; Gwen, (Clio Laine, American real-life jazz singer), having a voice voice; Annie, (June Whitfield), as a Rescue Army trombone player; Betty (the young pianist, Joan Sims) who prepared the ivory keys in a Hastings pub. As Elizabeth, Patrick & Joanna searched the world for band members in the 1940s and tries to convince Elizabeth to be with her while she learns more than she wants to know about her adult life - including her - while she an explosion plays wonderful music with the last of the "Blonde Bombs" living. <br /> <br /> Fun, nostalgic, historical, sentimental, multi-generational entertainment that is seriously fun. The actors offer great performances. Regardless of their ages, they are still Bombshell animators who have put a pretty big show. (The DVD is currently worthwhile due to its bonus features and Dolby Digital sound). Definitely a fan of any terrible actor, the VHS is a collection element.
