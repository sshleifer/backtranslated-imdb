Atlantis: The lost empire is a better movie than I thought. I never thought this movie would lead to my expectations. True, this movie started slowly, but, as the film did, it became more enjoyable. The story takes place in 1914 and is about a guy named Milo. Milo believes in Atlantis. Together with his grandfather's friends, he embarks on an amazing adventure. On the way, you must endure friendship, betrayal, trust, and more. Voice broadcasting is great. They know for sure how to play movies just with their voice talent. Music is nothing special, but nice anyway. Animation is not the best, but it's still pretty good. Generally, this is a good family film for all ages. I rate this movie 9/10.
