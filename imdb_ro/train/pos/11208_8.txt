Oh, where are you going, my little baby? Turn around and you are two, turn around and you are four ... I remember these shows when they first appeared on Disneyland . I remember standing there, electrified by Werner Van Braune's explanations of missile science. I watched as history, science and humor were intertwined in a captivating story of possibilities. It was fifty years ago. And the shows are back in the Disney Treasures series and what treasure they are. I watched them last night and tonight with my eight-year-old daughter, who at first never came into the room, but later he changed his mind when he saw that they were partially animated. As she looked at her, she watched her and, to the end, she was almost as terrified as me. Come back and you're a young wife with your kids ... Of course, some predictions about the month's end were wrong. But there is a lot of information that is still quite accurate, and the overall presentation is still impressive. I woke up thinking that my daughter's teacher might want to show her class not only as a 50-year-old artifact but also as fun and easy to understand lessons in history. , come back and again ... you wonder how much has really changed in 50 years.
