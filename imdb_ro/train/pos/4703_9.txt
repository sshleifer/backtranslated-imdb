This movie is very hilarious. Its filming tower immediately clicks on the first frame and takes us a wonderful stroll through fake gangster movies. The conflict between brother and brother occurs when Johnny's brother becomes a D.A. However, the best character is rival Johnny crimelord, Moroni too accentuated. As Johnny says, "This man should be arrested for cutting English." Check it on the video. It's worth a look.
