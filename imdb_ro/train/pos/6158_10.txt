What can I say about such a story? This magical tale followed me from my early childhood, evoking warm memories in my heart. Characters lead you in so many whimsical places, which makes you want more of each scene. For example, in the market there were so many different lore flavors. I liked exotic dancers who accompanied steel drums. The story line was wonderful. I wanted so bad for Landsbury to decide to keep the kids early and for her to also stay with Mr. Brown, and find the other half of the spell, so men less weapons to win the war. I'm still a child inside, and this movie appeals to my inner child as well as another. This movie is my definitive favorite of all time. I hope all children will be able to follow this classic and will be removed and transported at another time.
