Personally, it seems to me that the movie is a good watch. It highlights the real situation of the Hong Kong triads and gives the spectator a glimpse into how the triads are organized. Not only does it show the viewer how the Hong Kong police control the situation of the triads, and why the police are not just going out and wiping the triads. Generally, the film is violent because of killing and torture methods. However, the movie remains true in the real world, so the violence on the screen is just a reflection of what really happens. I would recommend this movie to a fan of Triad / Mafia. Another good watch would be the Dragon Squad. This film has more weapons than this because there are more knives in the film than guns (actually, I do not remember seeing a single gun).
