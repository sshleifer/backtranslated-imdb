I have always been a big fan of Cybill Shepperd since I saw her series a few years ago! This film certainly shows him in the best light yet! The movie was so greatly expressed and played! Now, from time to time, he paints funny lines, just to make this movie one of the best I've ever seen! Everybody really does it themselves !! Especially Robert Downey Jr and Cybill Shepperd have really made the movie come true! I also loved the little place where Mavis loses his wig and almost dies when he falls to the floor! This is the best movie!
