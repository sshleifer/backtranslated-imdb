Maybe I'm too generous with the rating ... but I like this movie! I have seen it so many times, but every time I see it, I fall in love with it again. It's just a simple romantic comedy, with nothing immense or monumental that's going on. But I'm a great romantic and this movie * is * romantic. I love Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins, and Walter Mathau is so funny. Scientists make me laugh so much ... I definitely recommend this movie to anyone I have not seen. It's such a clean and good movie - and these are so rare now! My 20-year-old brother also likes this movie, so it's not just a chicken shot. ;-) I recommend you to laugh or if you are alone and have to look at a love story if you can not attend one. It's a good one!
