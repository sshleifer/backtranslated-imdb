I think this has the potential to be the best Star Trek series yet, I say POTENTIAL .. we all know there's a chance they'll give up the bubble and get rid of ideas ... BUT NOT YOU ARE NOT! For those who did not see it .. SEE IT! Without that annoying "headline" floating over their heads, every time they meet with breeds, it could be cool .. and Scott Bakula was undoubtedly a great choice for the Captain, and the Babe Volcano is also hot (see the scene of the decontamination ) I gave it a FULL 10 ... blow away ALL other series openers .. I hope this takes more than 7 years ...
