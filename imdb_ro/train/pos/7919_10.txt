Undoubtedly intentional as a full-fledged joke, "Full Moon High" portrays 1950s adolescent Tony Walker (Adam Arkin) who accompanies his father (Ed McMahon) on a trip to Romania. Sure enough, Tony is bitten and grows fur and tits whenever there's a full moon. A particularly interesting aspect in this film is that he can not get old as long as he has a werewolf curse and that he has to fulfill a destiny - even if it lasts twenty years. But otherwise, the movie is simply funny once it starts to work. Ed McMahon's character is a right-wing yahoo over patriotism (he thinks everyone should have heard Joe McCarthy), Kenneth Mars coach / director is a tense dweeb and then there's plenty. One of the most interesting casts is Demond Wilson - most remembered as Lamont on "Sanford and the Son" - as a bus driver who gets a big surprise. But perhaps the funniest scene is changing the presidents; then gag with Gerald Ford really summed it up! Anyway, it's a real treat. Since Alan Arkin - who plays an angry psychiatrist - has just won an Oscar on Sunday night and thanked his sons, I wondered whether or not he remembers with two of them in this film (besides Adam, his son Anthony a small role). Pretty funny. Also plays Elizabeth Hartman. PS: Director Larry Cohen is probably best known for the child's criminals "It's Alive."
