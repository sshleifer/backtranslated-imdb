There seems to be no way to this movie! Most of it takes place in a dream and, like most dreams, is often stupid and illogical. It is also a superb production with some excellent songs and performances, especially by our angel. Jeanette's win, unknown insults and various other famous steps at the dream reception are hilarious, and the jitterbug with Binnie Barnes is a surprise and a delight. At one point, she plays a piece from Carmen, followed by Faust's last trio (holding a lap-dog, for a strange reason), then "Aloha Oe" on the beach! <br /> <br /> It's a surreal comedy - very funny if you can get into the groove.
