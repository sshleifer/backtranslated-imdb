You simply can not overcome how brilliant the connection between Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon is. It's like the movie does not need extra characters because you can never bore the dialogue between these two. Lemmon had already been featured in several well-known films such as Mr. Roberts and The Apartment and Matthau was freshly won by Oscar for The Fortune Cookie (another Billy Wilder film also with Lemmon). The film was not as big as it was because the story could not sustain such a long time (I think it was almost 2 hours). However, this happens at an hour and a half hour, even if the introduction of the events that led to Lemmon ending at Matthau's apartment is a long time (so was this sentence). This is a minor offender, and yet for the rest of your running time you have a wonderful time. I have already written a comment about how the pursuit of this movie sucks and I will not go deeper into this. The reason for such joy is that the film was made just as the innocence of American movies began to fade quickly into oblivion. There are some sexual references, but they are treated so innocently that you could not even get a "Well, never ..." from the most cautious person out there. It's quite fun to watch a movie from a long time, and that's probably why the sequel did not work because you had Matthau and Lemmon saying a few words and that just does not fit them. > <br /> Of course, now they are both missing and you can be happy that you can enjoy them in a great movie like this. I think the only male actor in this movie that's still alive is John Fiedler. Edelman recently died. So you have it. Simply one of the best comedies and movies ever. Add: I just recently learned that John Fiedler died so much for all his fans I'm sorry. I did not mean to say no disrespect and I will try to be more careful about what I am bla bla blahing next time.
