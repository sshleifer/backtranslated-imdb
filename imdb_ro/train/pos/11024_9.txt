This movie is great. It's fun from start to finish, you'll always be at the edge of the chair throughout the movie. In my opinion, this film is highly underestimated by critics. Sly fits perfectly with the role of a well-trained mountain rescue, Gabe Walker. Together with him Michael Rooker makes a wonderful look like Hal Tucker. And then, John Lithgow, one of the best performances I've ever seen from him as a bastard. And the fact that 75% of the movie takes place in a mountain with a lot of bad guys on it makes room for a lot of action! <br /> <br /> Brilliant film!
