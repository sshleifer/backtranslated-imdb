This documentary has been broadcast on both TTE and the BBC in the last few months. After seeing it twice now, I would recommend it to anyone interested in the production of artistic and documentary films. Initially, this documentary was intended to detail the political life of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. The Irish crew started with these intentions. What happens when I get to Venezuela is surprising, as it first testifies to the attempt to overthrow the rebel factions (especially Venezuelan oil issues) of Chavez and his government. What we, the witness of the public, is how the media manipulate the situation and, in fact, supports the overthrow of Chavez by distorting the events that happen while the state coup is rising. It's really an excellent documentary and a remarkable piece of work is working for some novice directors. <br /> <br />
