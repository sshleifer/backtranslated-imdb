From an artistic point of view, this is a beautiful movie - cinema, music and costumes are superb. In fact, this movie is more beautiful than those directed by Akira Kurasawa himself. In this case, he only wrote the film as it did a few years after his death. So, with regard to writing, the dialogue was well written and the story was sometimes interesting. However, the story was also rather depressing and yet irrelevant in some respects - after all, it is the story of a group of women working in a brothel. Interestingly, although prostitution was seen as a much more acceptable business in Japan, STILL women wanted a better life. This reminds me of a lot of Shame Stories, though the characters of the Shame Street are much less pleasant and more unidimensional. So overall it becomes a 7 - especially because of all that writing. It's too bad that the worst link in this movie is Kurasawa's story.
