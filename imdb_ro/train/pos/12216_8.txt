The film is only featured in Indonesia's cinematography this year (2007), two years after its official launch, and many illegal DVDs have found their way to the public. Apparently, the popularity of illegal DVDs leads to the release in theaters, with yet the public coming to watch. The film is a great epic, bringing Japanese culture to your home in an exiting way. In a sometimes humorous manner, it is said of a theater writer who writes a story for his theater, because the Kabuki theater of theater is something he finds boring. At first the audience might be a bit confused about the story we are following, but when the story unfolds, we see that love between a man and a female demon leads to a wonderful story for a new Kabuki theater play. the audience is left in the dark if this is a story that is supposed to have really happened in Japanese traditions and mythology, but that does not matter. The way the story is told with love for theater, expression, vivid colors, humor and tragedy, makes an extraordinary stroll on the roller coaster of the Japanese cinema as well as in the theater. Let yourself go completely when watching this movie, try to see it in a cinema instead of a TV at home. A critical point though: the soundtrack is sometimes a little annoying. Although most of them are excellent music, there are some moments in the movie that they think should have chosen more dramatic music. But perhaps the fact that the story contains moments of humor has made the director choose even lighter moments in music.
