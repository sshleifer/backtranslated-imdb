This is a fun glimpse of the Gospel, as presented by Johnny Cash (adorned in black, of course), who plays a lot and tells a little. If you like Johnny Cash, this movie is pretty nice. Also note the blond image of Jesus in this work ... just for fun, try to think of five Jewish men who have blond hair ...? Anyway, it's a fun showcase of the biggest and most important story of all.
