I think this is still the best routine. There are others, such as Rock's Pain, and Allen's "Men's Pigs", who are hated; "Damon Waynes' last stand is also funny in a lacy way - but this routine has no mistake. All jokes are fun, and the 70-minute time limit is perfect. Quite long to take 20 years. I like how it allows the audience to be totally and unrestricted. I'm a classic fan and for a guy who watched most of Jim Carrey grow up, seeing a more wandering comic is pretty cool. You do not fit into a category with Ellen and Newhart, but something you can watch if you're bloated. Thanks to Eddie, blessed.
