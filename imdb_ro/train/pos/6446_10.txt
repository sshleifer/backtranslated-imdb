"I'm in the Himmelen" was probably one of the 3 most beautiful movies I've ever seen in my life. That he did not win the Oscar, I will not shed a tear. This movie is somewhat of a class of his own, that an Oscar victory could have escaped her! My dear friend Anders (Nyberg), you have made a great greatness with your pen here! Kay Pollak, with your creation and all those who contributed, you all gave a gift of the love of our world. Between the points to enter into this world of ours, then to get out of it - indeed, you can say that you have done it better! Great staff thank you from all of my heart for bringing back some precious memories of the second decade of my life. I grew up in Sweden and my young mind and the presence of Beingness was formed and formed by many beautiful Swedish influences, individuals, traditions, music and nature. My blessings with gratitude to all of you. With Love and Light, George-Gabriel Berkovits Soulhealer, Johannesburg, South Africa
