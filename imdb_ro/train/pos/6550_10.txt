Look, if I was interested in a book by Nancy Drew, I'd make a book and read it. I'm not. Ever since I remember reading people shooting movies because it was not like the book. I'm sorry - in the digital age, we can no longer watch movies on flip books, but I'm sure you can still find some short book-shaped short movies. When the Lord of the Rings came out, people complained. When the third won an Academy Award - "The book was better". When I looked to kill a mockingbird, "the book was better." Now a bunch of people are upset again, because Nancy Drew was not like a book. I'm not saying that Nancy Drew will win an Oscar - if it's one of those Nickelodeon Blimps or Kids Choice Awards. I'm saying the movie a break. It's film, not paper. Like a movie, I found Nancy Drew pretty nice - with Bruce Willis and Adam Goldberg's (Jewish Hammer) cameos and supporting roles with Tate Donovan (Jimmy Cooper on O.C.) and Rachel Leigh Cook. This is the first time I saw Emma Roberts in a movie and, frankly, I like her work more than most of Julia and Eric; its character remains consistent throughout the film and reacts well with the conflict. A light movie in the spirit of Harriet Spy is beautiful from time to time. I give it ten stars because I enjoyed the film, I would love to see it again and probably will buy it on DVD release.
