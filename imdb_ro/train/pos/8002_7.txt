I've seen Maslin Beach a couple of times - on Brisbane's free air television. I will not go into whether it is good, bad or otherwise, as others have covered it well. I'll say he's so Australian. Only in Australia can we have a movie about the relationships between people who spend the day as naked as the day they were born and to see it on free TV. I have a friend in the US who is always amazed by what we put on our free TV as compared to his home country. Sex and CIty and Huff are just examples. Despite the fact that our government is trying to turn us into the 51st American state, it is good to know that at least some things really remain Aussie
