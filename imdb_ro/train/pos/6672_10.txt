I have seen Mystery Men as a media policeman and the general public (to take the imdb vote for example), but my overall feeling is that Mystery Men is more fun than most movies, certainly more dizzying than most so-called comedy and very "smart" movies. The distribution is superb; Greg Kinnear is excellent, just like Geoffrey Rush and Tom Waits. The scene of Kinnear's limo with Ricky Jay is a "wandering star" of perfect movies and dresses his character with the right balance of the quality of comic caricatures and realism to make it work. I will admit that the rhythm is a bit of a place, and visuals are certainly very bang bang, possibly at the expense of later characterization, but at the end of the day, this is a great film - it's about the little moments "What is Tiger Lily? " - and there is a lot in this movie to make it worthwhile repeated viewing.
