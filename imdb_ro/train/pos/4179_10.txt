This is the story of the Australian commandos captured from the uniform after a raid. Since they are not in uniform, they are rightly treated as spies. As such, they are judged, sentenced and sentenced to death. The Japanese martial court, admiring their heroism, authorizes the death of a warrior. Of course, under Bushido's code, that means they have to be decapitated. A fate for which, as Westerners, they are not ready.
