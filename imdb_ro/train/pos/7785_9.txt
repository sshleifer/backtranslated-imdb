I watched only 2 films by Pang, The Eye and One taking only. When I looked at The Eye, I was a little disappointed by these two guys, whom I had heard good words about before. This movie (The Eye) has a very bad scenario, especially the end (childish, clich√© and too coincident in my opinion), but still good in photography and experimental pictures. So I decided to see Just take and I did not disappoint again. Still a wonderful photo, an amazing picture, MTV style editing, great music and this time, the story has a lot of indie, logical and beautiful spirit, you will see some small holes of plot, but it does not cause any problem with the story. The only problem with this movie is that I have a bad DVD.
