This is an excellent Sammo Hung movie. In fact, this is a great piece of Hong Kong cinema action. The story tells the story of pedicab drivers in Macau, looking for love and mingling with a vicious pimp. The performances are excellent, and the characters are nice and well defined. The story involves and has enough story of love, drama, comedy and suspense to keep watch between battle scenes. Sammo Hung proves here that he is probably the best choreographer of business struggle. The action is simply amazing, in particular. fight with Lau Kar Leung and the final. Billy Chow and Sammo Hung are amazing. I have to see for any fan of the action.
