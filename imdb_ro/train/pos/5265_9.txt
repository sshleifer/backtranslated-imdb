I remember seeing this for the first time when I was 9 years old. I wanted to be one of the "barbarian brothers". This movie is still wonderful. An original look was that battle scenes where very short. Let's suppose the "barbarian brothers", where so good that the enemies quickly ended there! In addition, you have tracking, a cage fight, a dragon and even a bar fight! <br /> <br /> Yes, the act is bad, that's why it's not a ten, too, the story line has received a lot of criticism. I think it's pretty original. Not many movies of their genre have the same original story lines or colorful dialogue. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie.
