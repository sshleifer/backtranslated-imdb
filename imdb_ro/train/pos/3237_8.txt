After my experience in Finland for a little more than a week, I would say that this film describes very well the nature of Finnish society. Especially the serious problem with the young couple-with-child-having a child is very familiar, because I witnessed the same thing in person when I was in Finland. People's relationships and problems, the fragility of the marriage institution, the beverage culture, unemployment, and the upward money issue are all well done without any subjectivity or exaggeration. a film that is not necessarily easy to understand and relate to each other, but the common picture is nevertheless rewarding. Not every short story is exciting or profound, but as stated above, the overall picture fails to lead to the feeling of "real life" and to captivate the viewer. I happen to think in a calm moment: What happens in the life of all these people on the street? Well, that's what's happening. Movies of this kind are good to feed your imaginative power. It would be safe to assume that this film could apply to life in many countries, but Finland in particular reflects the way it is, and quite well. A commentary on acting: Being the Finnish cinema fan, I have never seen any of these actors on any other film, but I realized that they act in this feature right next to each other to be perfect. Maybe it's not a masterpiece, it's a very good test of the entire crew. I'll have an eye on the future versions of the director and the cast. 7.5 / 10
