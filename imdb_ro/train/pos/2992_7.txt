It seems even that the director does not like this movie, but for me I think it's a little rough for him. Of course it's not perfect, but there are some atmospheric photos, and the story is good enough to keep your interest all along. He is shot in what seems to be quite a pretty village that adds to the atmosphere as well. If you like horror movies shot in England, give me a go. I have seen only a trailer for this director's latest film "The Devil's Chair", which looks quite amazing. There are not enough horror English movies for me, so whoever comes, deserves our attention, and this is not as bad as you think
