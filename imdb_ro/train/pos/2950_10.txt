If you've ever been sad to not be able to get a movie on DVD, it was probably the "Delirious" you are looking for. How often do you laugh when you watch stand up comedy routines? I was too young to see Richard Pryor in the biggest time, and when I was big enough to see Eddie Murphy's "Delirious" and "Raw" (not as funny), I never knew where Eddie he took a great deal of his inspiration. Now that I'm older, they've seen both Pryor and many of the comedians after Murphy, I realize two things: Everybody steals from Eddie, while Eddie borrowed from Richard's love. That's the big difference: Eddie was original, funny, provocative, thoughtful? and other. It was something that has not been seen before. It was all I ever needed. On these days Eddie Murphy is boring and old? but once at a time he was the king, and "Delirious" was the largest castle ever built. Really one of the funniest routines of all time.
