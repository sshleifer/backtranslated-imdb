The movie I thought was great was supposed to be about romance, with a bit of suspense in between. Rob Stewart is a wonderful actor I do not know why people continue to give him a bad rap. As for Mel Harris, she is a great actress, and for those who think she looks too old for Rob is only five years old. Rob had a leading role in his television series, as well as one on the Scifi Channel. I'm sure you remember Topical Heat aka Sweating Bullets and PainKiller Jane. He also starred in a series of TV films and now makes a Mini TV series. <br /> <br /> They have to give him more leadership roles, which is best for him.
