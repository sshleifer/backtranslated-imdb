Incredibly NOBODY artistic could do them now. Seems to be perfectly the greatest and greatest music ever made to listen to beautiful songs are quite poetry. I'm Italian and admired by American MUSICAL. why can not you do that now? The Americans were the best and that's why I showed absolutely the devotion to you with this movie. are words that describe the perfection of this film. Suddenly, my heart sings, what makes the sunset? I love in love, jealousy ... and the scene with Tom and Jerry. the largest unreserved. if you do not know my eyes are not open my friends need to see and appreciate ... wake up!
