This movie is an absolute classic for the camp. That's why it was a classic Elvira and MST3000. Everybody knows the story. The scientist keeps his girlfriend's head alive in a lasagna skillet in his basement as he cuts the city and tries to find a corpse by checking local chickens. Eventually, he finds a real body of the hourglass with the head of a scar on the top. The cut head makes friends with the failed experiment in the closet, and the conehead goes out of the closet and breaks off the assistant's "good" arm (the other is not right from a former scientist's failure) and the place is burning down . <br /> <br /> The film has scared us so much like kids that my boyfriend will not go to his basement for a year after seeing her. As children, we have ranked the most frightening films of all time and this was number four. Only one of those frightening films was really good ("The Haunting"). I had to give this film seven ratings for the extraordinary amount of entertainment she offers, her strange effect due to poor production and strange sexual anguish when the scientist searches for the bodies (complete with the porno pornography) scares the hell of innocent children, while the ridiculous aspects make him a prime material to watch and laugh. I could watch this movie tonight and I'm glad while I'd rather go to the dentist than see Chicago again. Seven are the most that I can give, because her entertainment value is just luck. "Film, like cinema, is a disaster.
