When Braveheart came out for the first time, I was excited, and he was certainly one of the most crazy movie fans. When Rob Roy came out, I was intrigued, and although I liked the movie, I did not think it was a great movie. However, as time passed, my appreciation for Rob Roy increased, and my enthusiasm for Braveheart diminished. Braveheart is a great fun to be sure, but there are flaws. The most significant, in my opinion, is the unpleasant representation of Robert Bruce, who was undoubtedly the greatest king of Scotland. Another is the historical inaccuracy of the film, which destroys the film in proportion to the many historical distortions. I think I'm also bothered by the fact that in this film, just viewed (at least by me) in retrospect, Mel Gibson's Beginning of Eggmania can be clearly seen for the first time. Instead, Rob Roy has grown on me over the years. Partly because it greatly avoids the mistakes I have most in Braveheart. But also because Rob Roy is like a good wine, more mature and more complex with each view.
