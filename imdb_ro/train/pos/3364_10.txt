And I was quite amazed to see how few people voted this movie and I just wanted to write something about it, although my comments are pretty similar to those already written. I like many things about the movie. The spectacular show between Mastroianni & Loren. The way in which the film is filmed: Humanity and love develop slowly between these two outsiders and contrasts with the passive rhythm of going at the same time and continuously of the fascist radio station (which happens to be a colleague of Mastroianni) and the adherents "and coming from the show". For me, this is a very beautiful film about what it means to be human. Perhaps some of you would argue that the anti-fascist "message" is too clear, but for me this did not destroy the movie in any way. My vote is 10/10.
