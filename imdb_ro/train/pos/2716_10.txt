Everything I remember about it was great ... a good distribution with Sam Waterston and George Innes (before becoming more familiar with US audiences) .... Excellent scripts that English can do - Edwardian Sherlock Holmes / Lord Peter Wimsey / Albert Campion mystery, but with a twist Jules Verne. A sort of MacGyver would have been if he had been in England 80 years earlier ... right at the beginning of the 20th century scientific / technological revolution. I often wondered if the creators of MacGyver had seen these shows. MacGyver has been running for about three years later. I still have an episode on a badly damaged tape.
