In Stand By Me, Vern and Teddy discuss who was tougher, Superman or Mighty Mouse. My friends and I often talk about who will win and fight. Sometimes we get absurd and we compare guys like MacGyver and The Terminator or Rambo and Matrix. But now we're talking about guys like Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee and Jet Li. It's an unnecessary comparison seeing Lee as dead, but it's fun. And if you go after what I saw from Jet Li in Letal 4 and Black Mask, you have to say at least that it will fit well with Chan. In this film he meets like a God of martial arts. The Black Mask is about a man who was created with many other men to be supreme fighting machines. Their only goal is to win the wars that other people lose. They are invincible in some respects. Now, this is the premise for the film, but what it does is to set all the amazingly choreographed battle scenes. Jet Li is a miracle. He can do things with and in his body, which no human being should be able to do. And that's what makes him so entertaining. In addition to the martial arts in the film, the Black Mask is powerful with humor, and this is due to the chemistry Jet has with its co-star, police officer. They are wonderful together. But to be honest. if anyone reads this review, they want to know if the movie is a head shot in the action department. And the answer to this is a YES resounding! A lot of mindless action. You will love this movie.
