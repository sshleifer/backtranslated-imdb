JUST CAUSE is a faulty but decent film, held together by powerful performances and some creative writing (though highly predictable). Sean Connery is a crusader for the death penalty brought to save a seemingly innocent black (Blair Underwood) from the final punishment. To do things well, Connery ventures into the crime scene, where he has to fight not only with the passing of time, but also with a mixed sheriff (Laurence Fishbourne). Turnovers, twists and rolls of roles abound - some surprising, others not - as the aged crusade tries to uncover the mystery. Climate termination is a bit ridiculous, but JUST CAUSE is worth watching on a slow night.
