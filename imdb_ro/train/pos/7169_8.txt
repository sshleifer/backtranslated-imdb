Children's films are typically annoying, making it too seventh and unbearable for someone over the age of 13. But again, before the Holes hit the scene. Sure, it has the same moments that often provide a kid's quality with the above-mentioned quality, but this movie does a good job of staying away from such conventions. The act was decent, and the unfortunate dynamics that Stanley had with some of the other camps was more realistic than most films are trying to portray. What I really liked about this movie was that this movie did not try to break your heart or make you cry. Emotional power was more natural than most would have imagined, such as Shawshank's redemption in many ways (which holes also have a similar and redeeming end). The only one down? Hockey lizards. Overall, however, a 8/10.
