This program is a lot of fun and the title song is so exciting that I can not get it out of my head. As I grow older, I feel attracted to the wrinkles that do things, and these four are excellent in their efforts. Some of what they do are scandalous but brilliant, considering that today with the PC world we will never be able to do it in real life. I always learn something from the shows. But if you like mystery, drama, comedy and a small legal medicine, you like this show. Reminds me of Quincy, ME in a way and Barney Miller in another way in which he works and interreaction with each other. They make a lot of mistake, but they do their job, and that counts.
