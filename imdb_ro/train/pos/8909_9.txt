This is quite well known, so I will not get too deep into it. The basic story is about two teenagers who find out about a glowing goo fur that reaches the earth through a meteor. Human contact with this sludge ball burns through the flesh like acid. It also absorbs human bodies, making it grow. No one thinks that adolescents (Steeve McQueen and his girlfriend) and when it seems, finally, it can not stop the blob. It is very well done for his age and unlike many other 50 blows, the rhythm is pretty fast. The story is very unique doing it and must see for any fan of the old SF and Monster movies. If you can dig the gooey horror gore from the '80s, make sure you checked out the remake of '88 as well.
