Every country that has a cinema industry has some healthy artists (and maybe some madmen) making movies that you can only understand when you are part of that country. I think Hundstage is such a movie. You see the lowest level of the Austrian society, dirty, disturbed, strange, ugly. But they still have enough money to be able to afford tuned cars and big houses. And they certainly do here many strange things that may seem to them "normal," because they do it all their lives. From a normal human point of view you can easily watch the movie now and be disgusted or fascinated and watch a fine piece of Austrian art films. <br /> <br /> But if you live here and you know the people you see the characters in Hundstage as a tumor of society. A society that is becoming increasingly crazy everyday, creating its own rules that no one else can understand, overwhelms the social system inside. And see the people. He sat in the park, sitting at the corner of the opposite street, sitting in the queue on the same line. Maybe you meet them in a bar or a disco that you can visit. Perhaps you even work with them in the workplace or living near your home. You start hating them without knowing exactly why. You'll try to escape, but you can not. Maybe you'll be like them. But it looks "normal" for you because you do it all your life now ... Life is not so bright, though Austria is one of the richest countries in the world. He has nice people ... but some are also ugly. There are a lot of people working hard trying their best ... but there are also some riding on the back of others and destroying everything that the Austrian has built so far. <br /> <br /> A very pessimistic movie.
