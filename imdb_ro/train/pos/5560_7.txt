SPOILERS One of my friends said NEXT MOVIE was the best Cheech & Chong movie and went out of his way to borrow him and BLUES BROTHERS. NEXT MOVIE has no plot, has no pacing, has nothing of what defines a movie ... but it's funny. And for what it deserves, Cheech and Chong show a heart. Well, in this small paragraph I plotted, but being that four-fifths of the movie, nothing happens that would usually start a story. I mean, Cheech's cousin appears. Was there no more funny moment when Chong made Cheech drink twice? What about the cock? Was Pee-Wee Herman's first movie? You should watch the movie to enjoy it. I do not think NEXT MOVIE has balls strong enough to make it wonderful, but the movie has heart and hey, my girlfriend let me borrow so it gets 7.
