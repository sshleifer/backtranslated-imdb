I like this show! Mr. Blick, Gordon and Waffle are cats so different from each other, but they refer collectively to them as "brothers." I often find myself trying to imitate the tired and sighing accent of their queen, Hovis, or even in Scotland's Gordon district. There should be more episodes about Human Kimberly. The episode about cats hiding as pre-teen girls to get Kimberly's sleeping party to get her thirst for her favorite drink, Rootbeer, is a classic hilarious. We can not drink the root in our house now, without making the voices of Catscratch or Brothers Hanson in the movie "Slap Shot". The classic future. Where can I get the first two seasons on DVD?
