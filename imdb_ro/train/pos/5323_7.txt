There are a number of things that are not correct, although this is not very important since it happened with whom and when it is still in dispute. The most dangerous freedom with the facts I think is when they start playing at Bruno Koschmidder's Kaiserkeller, when they actually played at Indra and later moved to Kaiserkeller. I agree with Semprinni20 that the film was biased in favor of the Pete Best version, but if he is the story consultant, I think he's calling the pictures. I also agree with Semprinni that the records of Pete Best play the last word on why he was fired. Although the film is not such a generous production as the movie "Backbeat" I prefer this movie because it is more accurate and because it has a better script with a deeper characterization. There's a lot in the movie that's pretty substantial - like Brian Epstein trying to hide the fact that he was "queer-bashed" just to find out that the band knew he was Gay all the time. Little touches such as the band enter a cafe and order "Corn-Flakes with Milch". My favorite scene, which basically has a bass, is when, at an audition, Stuart Sutcliffe just bought his bass guitar, but he can not play it, so he's back with the impreser and trying to fake him , but it is caught. That's rock'n'roll. It's worth watching.
