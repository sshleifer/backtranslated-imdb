I really enjoyed the performance of the main cast. Emma Lung is courageous and interesting. The director has developed performance in which characters are not dimensional. A complex story with the change between the epochs. He also appreciated the basic story of the unions who lose the strength and effect of a large employer who closes in a small town. I do not agree with the comment that the older man must be attractive. There have been many relationships with older men and younger women - without the men being good. The depth of character can be appealing to not so superficial. The film has a good look, and cinema is also good.
