Too many sources have traditionally faced this drama of the challenging period of thought, partly on the basis of the historical fact, along with the similar superficial "nudspoitaţia", which was a point of support in the 1970s European rubbish cinema, which looked at the right anger leading the whole effort. Maybe coincidence was also the unique attempt of director Gianfranco Mingozzi for narrative films, besides many well-documented documentaries. FLAVIA, certainly in a historical context, characterizes the rising revolt of a 15th-century Italian nun (Florin Bolkan's career performance, surpassing even her sterling work in the devastation DOES NOT TAKE A DUCKLING by Lucio Fulci ), enclosed in the monastery by her father, so noble, in a desperate attempt to stop the sensual nature of the face. Asking why women are relegated to secondary roles in the best way of life, as in Holy Scripture, she faces ways in which masculine domination can break the feminine life, inspiring rebellion fueled by the laughter of a more agate sister, Maria Casarès from LES ENFANTS DU PARADIS from Marcel Carné) and - more constructively - of a Muslim invasion. Together with the oppressors and probably manipulating them unintentionally to make an offer, Flavia is truly renowned that she already feels to be, with tragic results expected. With his astonishing broad-screen Alfio Contini, who shot Antonioni's Michelangelo ZABRISKIE POINT, this is an unconditional and auspicious account of the ferocious struggle and eventually useless of a woman against the patriarchal society that he did not assign him any right beyond birth or drunkenness, as Sister Agatha says. A long, drug-induced fantasy sequence, clearly modeled on Ken Russell's film, despite the fact that the film proves to be rather stingy in the skin department, making the semi-pornographic reputation mockery. This is a serious work worth the rediscovery and restoration of his unfair reputation.
