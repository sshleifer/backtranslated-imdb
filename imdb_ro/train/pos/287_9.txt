We liked the movie. I'm a mother to two men. I like to have a movie that I can watch with them where men have integrity and character. Moveis where money is not the most important thing. And the family is forever, and love means more than words. <br /> <br /> I want to see more of the Davis family. But everything I liked left me the same feeling that the others did, "please, do not advise." We both want the actors not to change. The new actor was a good replacement. <br /> <br /> My 9 year old son loved this movie as well. asked me to buy them all. He's a film critic, so he says he's telling me something. The family should see this move to buy for friends. Help restore value time. We'll read the books now, we're hanging. We really hope to see more. Be blessed happy on the move
