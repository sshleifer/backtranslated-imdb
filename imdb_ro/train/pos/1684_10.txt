Tell me what you want about Andy Milligan - but if his family was even 10% as disturbed as the one in this movie, then I think it might have been worse. Unfortunately, video footage of this movie contains sex scenes inserts originally launched by the vendor to stimulate box-office appeal. Several times during the film, Milligan's stunning shooting film and silent film music ended suddenly, and suddenly, the good arrangements for Milligan's family actors took over and began to make it to the psychedelic guitar rock. It is easy enough to move forward if you try to pay attention to Milligan's original film, which, unfortunately, lacks enough action that has been cut to make room for added sex scenes. What remains, however, is still convincing. I do not think I've ever seen a more ugly mother in any movie.
