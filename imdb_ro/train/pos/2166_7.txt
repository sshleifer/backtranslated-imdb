I'm not a big fan Tim Matheson, but I have to admit I liked this movie. It was dark and a bit disturbing, with some little edgy scenes, I do not know to categorize this movie is a bit SF and a bit of horror slash thriller. I've seen this at about 2.00 am or so on my channel local was not anything else so I decided to watch it. If you have not seen this id id recommend it not so bad, the characters are quite interesting, but they have not really been explored to their full potential that could have made this movie even better. I do not know if this movie went to the cinema, but it felt like it was done for television or went straight to the movie, if it is, the DVD fits well with my movie type and has a little bit of story X -FILES attached to her. Government enterprises or shifty corporations involved in business dodgy shadowy.Overall a good movie.
