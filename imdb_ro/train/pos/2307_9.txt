I must say that this movie is really amazing and delightful. Reese Witherspoon is so charming and Jason London is not that bad! it's so sweet to forget that Dani falls in love and broke my heart and still warms my heart at the same time looking at the Court in love with Maureen. however, it is even sweeter forgot how much cared for Dani. I have to admit I wanted him to fall for Dani in the end. she's so nice she's watching her fall for him. I do not want her to get that bad heart. but the greatest tragedy I've ever seen in this movie. looking at death made me cry for a whole day. I could not believe it. nevertheless, never a loving relationship was ever presented in a movie, then Maureen and Dani. they really can do it through anything. I give this movie 9, because I did not want the Court to die, but it was still one of the most amazing movies I've ever seen.
