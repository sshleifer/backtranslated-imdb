The King over Me (2007) *** Adam Sandler, Don Cheadle, Jada Pinkett-Smith, Liv Tyler, Saffron Burrows, Donald Sutherland, Robert Klein, Melinda Dillon, Mike Binder, Jonathan Banks, Paula Newsome. Sometimes he affects and sometimes he thinks of a depressed man who lost his family on September 11 (Sandler, in the best part of "Punch-Drunk Love"), who meets his old roommate and friend ( Cheadle continuing to do impressive work with every role so far), a well-done dentist who seems to have everything? family, fortune, happiness? but really sees an ally at liberty with his own tender troubled friend's personal life offers. Written and directed by Binder (who collaborates with Sandler's ex-boyfriend and actress) with humor and true heart, the movie works best when the two stars share the screen until the last act falls into a cinematic film over the week, in order to order a solution to the issues at hand.
