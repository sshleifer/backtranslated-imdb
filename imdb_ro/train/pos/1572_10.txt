When you read a review from another user, saying it is a terrible game, I could not stand idle and do nothing! Well, this game is awesome, from news clips (with two real people, full of humor and credibility!) To the story, I find it very good! I only complain that the enemies begin to blink when they die until they disappear; and some frustrating situations about LEILA VR missions when riding the bike here and there ... Except it's a great game with a great story, good graphics, great characters, a great soundtrack ... We recommend! Surely! May be a bit old, but still nice! At least on Dreamcast ... but the PS2 version will be the same.
