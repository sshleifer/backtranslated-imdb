The poor quality of the DVD is the only reason I gave this movie 9 instead of 10. That could have been a lot better, this movie deserves this. This is really a movie that covers several themes at the same time. If you do not like movies about serial killers, but you are fascinated by the amazing culture of bureaucracy in the former Soviet Union, you have to watch this movie anyway. We can not compare it to "Silence of the Lambs" for several reasons. The way in which the serial killer is presented has been done much better in Citizen X. You can see more details of his private life because you "travel" with the killer, which gives you an idea of ​​the source of his constant anger and frustration sexual. The only other movie I've seen is as realistic as this was "Henry - the portrait of a serial killer." If you were fascinated by this movie, you certainly have to take a look at Citizen X.
