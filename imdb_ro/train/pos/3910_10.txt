So I'm home, flipping through the channels one night, and I met this man wearing heels and makeup, standing in front of a colorful background on HBO. Of course, I took a double pickup and decided to look a little. I did not change the channel until it was finished, it was so incredibly hilarious. The next time I went on, I made sure to record it so I could watch it again and again and it was one of my favorite things to watch. In the first few minutes, you can say that the audience is not quite sure why to think, but quickly gains them with its incredible humor and spirit. While many comedians in the stand-up are in my brain, Eddie Izzard stands out as one of the best. Its style is incredibly refreshing and it's nice to hear jokes about things like history and puberty, when most comedians are watching current events. His show stayed with me afterwards. I went to Italy in the summer and all I could think of while I was there was that "the Italians are always on the scooter going" CIAO ... "" 10 out of 10. See. You won t regret.
