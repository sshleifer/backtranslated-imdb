So I overturned the digital subscriber channels one evening a few years ago, and I thought I'd spend half an hour watching "Girlfight" while waiting for "Hart's War" to start. With a title like this, I realized it was a "B" operation on city gangs in town. Instead, it's a well-pitched story about a young woman who, almost accidentally, enters the female boxing. She is responsible for taking her younger brother to practice sessions and interest while she is observing her situations. Because he really does not want to be a boxer (following only his father's wishes), convince the coach to take it for him. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds in a smart and credible way as it goes through different processes in its search. For starters, her brother's coach does not want to take on a female boxer. Having done it patiently, there is a problem of aligning matches for her. Then confront her father when she finds out what's going on. Yes, an interest in love develops, but serves to strengthen the plot, which is found more in an interesting inter-human reaction, with its battle-related consequences. Everything is a wonderful movie, few seem to have heard of. Sometimes, after seeing a much better published and appreciated "Million Dollar Baby," I thought "wait a minute, this seems a bit familiar." Needless to say, I did not follow the "Hart war" that night.
