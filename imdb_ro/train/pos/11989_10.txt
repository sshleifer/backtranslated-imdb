Thanks to Jymn Magon to create the best 2 Disney cartoons. This show has greatly improved over the years. As a child, I did not like it because I thought it was a broken-off Ducktales, which was my favorite Disney thing at the time (like Grandmoffromero). Then, later, although it was good, but not great. But after reading the reviews here, I decided to give him another chance, bought my DVD and saw the whole pilot the first day I received it and I was very pleasantly surprised. It's my favorite episode, though the series has lived so far. And by the end of disk 1, I knew it would be a top tenner. Characters are so complex and charming. My favorite is Wildcat. He is absolutely hilarious and sweet to boot. My next favorite is Baloo, the best show pilot. I'm seeing why "Jymn built the show around him, then it's the Cloudkicker Kit." El & Baloo had the best relationship in the series, after which Louie Jim Cummings did a perfect job of adorning herself with the original voice. he, Rebecca, made me laugh hard enough, and I think she and Baloo finally get married, and finally (for the heroes), Molly, although she is the least favorite, I still like it. that he is a very cute character (much better than Webby from Ducktales) and the villains were very original Don Karnage and his pirates of air always break me, Kahn is cold and ruthless, and Thembrians are always at least funny. The stories range from hilarious (Time Waits For No Bear, Romance of Chimp Red) to nothing less to reach (The Old Man & Seaduck, Paradise Lost), fun, exciting and exciting adventures Ancient and preference gates my knuckle who's calling Klangs.) These are just a few of my favorite episodes. Anyway, Talespin is the best Disney, besides Gummi Bears. Are there some reasons for that? GB had a decent amount of my favorite character (Cubbi), while TS did not have enough Wildcat. But, ultimately, Talespin remains a classic. BOTTOM LINE- 10/10 The 6th best cartoon ever.
