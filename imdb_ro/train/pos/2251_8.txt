I'm sorry that Alan Jacobs is reviewing the movie a lot, but I had the opportunity to rent the blockbuster DVD with a comment from BYU curator, James D'Arc's film archive. Then the LDS prophet, Heber J. Grant, approved the film by understanding the deviations from historical content for dramatic expression and telescopic events. For example, the film showed that Joseph Smith is being judged. Despite Brigham Young's great orator in Joseph Smith's defense, he was condemned anyway. Then Joseph was killed. Historically, Joseph Smith has never been condemned for anything. Brigham Young was in Boston when Joseph Smith was arrested for this trial. Joseph Smith and his brother, Hyrum, where both were killed before the trial.
