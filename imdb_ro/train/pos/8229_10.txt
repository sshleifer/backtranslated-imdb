This is a slow-moving movie, slowly building the story of an ex-striptease who begins a new family life with a complete stranger. The theater slowly feels there is something wrong here ... I really liked this movie, even if it finally leaves a bitter taste. He is intelligent, well-off and very well acting. Both Philippe Toretton and Emmannuelle Seigner are deep in their characters. <br /> <br /> Little son "pierrot" is also very moving. A thriller that does not seem to be one. A very unconventional movie, a very special atmosphere throughout the movie, although you might feel weird a few times with some scenes. I give her a 8/10 !!
