Although time has revealed how some of the effects have been made, this love and adventure story is still special. If you have not seen this movie before being shocked how much was stolen by filmmakers later on. I was looking at this with a friend who was amazed at how much Disney's Aladdin got from the movie. They loved the film and enjoyed being a real milestone for so many other movies and film makers. I gave the film an 8 out of 10 instead of 10 out of ten, which is where a good part of this movie is, because in the last 15 minutes the film breaks down in rhythm. Everything is rushed as if it should suddenly come to an end. From the starting point of the djinn to the end it seems to be more sketch, then painting finished. It does not kill the movie, but it does not weaken it. However, the necessary viewing for anyone loves a good fairy tale or even a great movie.
