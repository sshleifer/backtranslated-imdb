It's a great movie, not only for fans of Lady Death, but also for those who love animation / adventure and fantasy series. The film is about an innocent girl about whom she died for something she did not, but about being the daughter of hell, Lucifer himself. Then she's looking for revenge ... and the rest you see better from the movie. <br /> <br /> I liked the film a lot, the characters are like original comics, creating chaos. I have never had the chance to read the first parts of the comic story, just the last, after the passages of the movie, so I can not tell if the events are exactly like the comics, but ... in one way or another is the story of Lady Death!
