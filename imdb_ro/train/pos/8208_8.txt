I liked almost all Dirty Harry movies, except for what I think is called "Enforcer". "Deadpool" was a bit weak in the areas, too, but I still enjoyed it. This is one of my favorites in the series, if not for the big line of "Go, make me the day". It also has an interesting, though familiar plot by someone killing those who have done it wrong. Just think of "Magnum Force" with less mystery about who is behind the killings and you have the plot. Granted is a bit more than that, because it has a very beautiful final presentation in a fun park. He also gives Dirty Harry a bulldog as a gift and stops Sandra Locke in a pretty humorous scene. The only remaining question remains why Clint Eastwood had to have the fairly mediocre actress Sandra Locke in so many of his films. It brings the score to a point every time, even though the movie is generally good for me. It was not bad here, but her character might have been a lot better than anyone else. Another issue with this movie and other Dirty Harry movies, sometimes they almost seem to be commercials for weapons. I like the weapons as much as the next person, but do we really need scenes from him that explain all the strengths of the newest weapon and how many bullets it holds? However, very nice entry into the Dirty Harry movie series.
