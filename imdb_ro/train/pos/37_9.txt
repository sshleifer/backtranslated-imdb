Among the things that make it the best at this point, I have to say that # 1 is Christine McIntire. Shemp scene when it's poisoned and her reaction is truly magnificent. I imagine that, as a poster suggests, Christine tries to prevent laughter in that scene, but actually made her look even more delicious, smile at the death of Shemp. Another character who helps this point of view is Goon. His gaze was a big cross between the terrible and the comic balloon. Almost a character I'd like to meet in a dark alley or anyway anywhere. I would have preferred a bit of true mystery in this regard, but hey, when a short is this good, who will complain. No I.
