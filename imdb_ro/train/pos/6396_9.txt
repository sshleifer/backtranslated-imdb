Do you think you did it hard? You should check this movie. Carl Brashear is the symbol of courage and determination. What this man had to do to become a marine diver, should be a source of inspiration for all of us. And significantly, after seeing this movie, I learned that what is shown is not even half! Cuba Gooding, Jr. does some of his best works so far as Brashear. De Niro, as usual, is good as a southern red that trains him. George Tillman, in his second major play (after "Soul Food"), made a quantum leap as a director. If you want to move and inspire yourself, you should certainly check this out.
