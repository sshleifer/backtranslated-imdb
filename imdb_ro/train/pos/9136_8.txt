This film is NOT as bad as other reviewers, and as it sums up the IMDB page for this movie, it says it is. Why? The first is that in 1984 filmmakers were bold enough to confront one of the plot elements with the problem of domestic violence - so reviewers who complain about the plot unfortunately lose one of the main points! Secondly, without the plot element in Prince's movie relationship with his abusive father, the musical climax would not work as well as he did - so those commentators who say that only good music have lost one more time of the points - especially why it is so good ... because all the music in this movie has a background of plotting elements that make music more efficient. Third, give this film a break! For film makers and directors for the first time, this is not so bad! There are much worse movies out there by movie people! Finally, reviewers who say that music is "good" have also lost the point - checking Prince's range of stylistic musical treatments, variety, musicality and stage performance - truly unique, going musically where no one went on in the 1980s, and with a style seen in the work of other artists (clothes and movements: who cost the items, Michael Jackson or the Prince?) in front of the eyes that Prince is making in this film long before Pulp Fiction Quentin Tarentino). As the amount of parts, not a bad movie at all.
