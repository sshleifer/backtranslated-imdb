Story about four teenage girls growing up in California. Jeanie (Jodie Foster) is the most fervent group - but she wants to move from her home where she lives with her divorced mother (Sally Kellerman). Annie (Cherie Currie) is addicted to drugs, alcohol and bad boys and is beaten by her father. Madge (Marilyn Kagan) has over-protective parents. Deirde (Kandice Stroh) thinks she's more mature than the others. There is nothing new of what I have seen many times before - but it has a big difference - is accurate. I graduated from high school in 1980 (when I first saw the film) and I was surprised at how realistic it was. They have completely taken on the dialogue, the clothes and the attitudes. Even the main feature of the movie ("On The Radio" by Donna Summer) was a great success before going out. This movie hit me harder than any other teen movie of the time, because I could understand and relate to the characters. I knew high school girls that were like that! The movie is dated (of course), but it takes a time that we will never see again. The actor is good in all respects, and Foster performs the best. The relationship between her and Kellerman (which was excellent) was realistic and well done. Even Scott Baio (who has a small role as girlfriend) has played more or less realistically a teenage boy. A very good movie - essential viewing if you are elderly in 1980. The film has a merit R (a lot of drug use and swearing), but it should be seen by all adolescents. I give her 8.
