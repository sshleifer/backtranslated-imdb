Saving Grace is a nice movie to watch on a boring afternoon when you look for something different from the usual scenarios and want to have fun. I mean, the whole idea of ​​this movie and the whole marijuana in it is such a madness! It was the first movie I looked at with this theme (drugs / marijuana) that does not really criticize it, but just the jokes about it. Grace Trevethyn is a widow who lives in a small town in the UK and has many financial problems because of her dead husband who has committed suicide since he was full of debt. The problem is that Grace, who has imagined she has some money saved for her, discovers she needs to pay all her husband's debt in debt so she does not lose all her belongings, especially her home she loves so much . She has never worked and is in a tragic situation until Matthew, her great-found gardener, decides to make a partnership with her in selling marijuana on a large scale.
