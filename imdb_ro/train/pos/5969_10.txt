This film is a kind of Carrie encountered Heavy Metal. This is a type of high school that chooses a lot and totally avenges with the help of a heavy metal ghost. is so classic. The soundtrack is A ++++. You have live legends about Metal in it. And Marc Price was great in this movie. This is a must for metal fans.
