A Aussie-Rules (Mat) country player goes to the city the night before a very important match in an AFL match where he will be taken by his cousin. And then things go wrong. His cousin, who was not a hoper, has become involved in a drug deal involving a local-shark / drug dealer Tiny (which looks like any gangster anywhere but is definitely Australian). Needless to say that Mat is stuck in chaos and it is not long before the thoughts of tomorrow's match are thrown behind his mind as the frenzied events of the night are unleashed. Western Australian professional Shakespearean actor Toby Malone puts a naive young man, Matt country boy, into a sterling performance, and successfully plays a part far below his age. Best support comes from John Batchelor as Tiny and David Ngoombujarra's entertainment role as one of the policemen who followed the events. Roll is a fast, often funny rhythm and a very useful one-hour use.
