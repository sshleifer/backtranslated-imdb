OK, here is my top personal list Nicktoons looks like today: <br /> <br /> 1. All Grown Up / SpongeBob SquarePants games <br /> 2. My life as a teenager robot < <br /> <br /> 3. Invader Zim <br /> <br /> 4. Catscratch / Rugrats <br /> <br /> Note a word with only capital letters? That means this is the show Nick will talk about <br /> <br /> "Catscratch" is actually a simple, but great animated comedy about three rich cats -. Mr. Blik, Gordon, and Napolitane - who get in strange and indeed surreal situations, from trying to join a party in human pimples Kimberely for root beer to rescue a planet of snails from the evil space ship. This is a Nick show that will simply have your funny bones beaten sooner or later! The theme song is attractive and memorable. voice actors - including Wayne Knight from "Seinfield" franchise - brings characters to fresh life with very strange personalities. Stories are pleasant (fans' episodes would be "King All Root Beer" and "Gordon Lucky Claw"). And humor is all done in the style of Earthworm Jim. In conclusion, "Catscratch" is one of the Nicktoons series, such as "Invader Zim" and "MLAATR", which is becoming popular all over the world in just three seasons or less.
