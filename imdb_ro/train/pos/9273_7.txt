In Iran, the Islamic Revolution has shaped all aspects of life, including everyday things. But people continue to live their lives, generally doing just the things you would expect, such as going to football matches to encourage the national team because it is running to qualify for the World Cup. Except that women are not allowed to go to the football stadium to watch the game. A small, frequently watched film follows the small group of women who were trapped in the football stadium and the small group of bored soldiers assigned to guard them in a pen just outside the stadium. The absurdity of the situation, the simple desire of these women to enjoy the team (nothing subversive there) and the little human touch on the life of each one adds to a wonderful commentary on humanity towards ideology. Amateur actors, good script and dialogue, a really enjoyable movie. Bend It Like Beckham, a kind of warm heart and joy in the everyday interests and pleasures of the people.
