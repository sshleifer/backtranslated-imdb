This movie is so great. Returning probably to 40 and Meg Ryan, he struggles to be known as "smart." Plus Tim Robbins is so cute in this movie. And everything about him has a magical feeling about him. Every time I look, I feel happy. It's definitely a face film, and I'm a girl, so I like it. I like music too. The violin is wonderful. but in addition, I think it's a nice story and everyone should look at it.
