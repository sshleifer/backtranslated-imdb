Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves return as the two San Dimas plugs, who are sent in another lifetime journey, as someone in the future feels exactly the opposite of how he was featured in the first movie. <br /> <br /> The only difference is that their journey is "somewhere" between Heaven and Hell and reaches both. When they meet with Grim Reaper, they have the chance of a later life to play it for a chance to come back and stop two evil robots from destroying what future they should have. In addition to playing roles that they have ... er ... perfected, they also play (and revive some additional sales in the process) some classic games (even I have my original Battleship in the closet). <br /> <br /> The reason I liked this movie better than the original is that it deals with "what could be" instead of "what it was". Without breaking the movie, I can not give you more information about this (I think you'll have to track both of them and decide for yourself! 8 out of 10 stars.
