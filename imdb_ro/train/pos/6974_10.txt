I recently visited Caprica again and I thought it would be good to come and write a review! I saw this for the first time after seeing the final series of Battlestar Galactica (being a big boy to rescue the show, I got stuck with everything I could see from the show's universe), so I did not know what to expect. .. but I came out with a smile, although I must admit ... The story begins dramatically on the planet Caprica and we are introduced with a variety of interesting characters ... I will not give too much but there is a dramatic event that dictates the course story, but I suggest you follow this. I have to say ... Esai Morales is an actor hell that brought out a young Joseph Adama. .. (Admiral's father in Battlestar Galactica) I found his place of action and I think he is the father of William Adama from BSG ... Eric Stoltz also matches exactly his role. ..! Special note was good to see Polly Walker outside Rome! Do not sit down and watch Caprica hoping it would be like the Battlestar Galactica because the story line is pretty straight and anyone can watch ... without having to see BSG! is a well-written drama for those who love the drama there with a bit of science fiction!
