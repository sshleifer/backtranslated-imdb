Okay, so borrow a little of "It's a wonderful life," but that was 44 years before this movie, so why not a new try. Belushi has a 35-year celebration. He did not take his coffee, his coffee and lost his job. Capper is when his car described "the big blue sh ** car" breaks at the end of the day. He's going to an empty bar to call a trailer. While waiting, he is recognized by the barman (Caine) as a child who lost the baseball game in the city championship 20 years earlier. This makes him think what life would have been like if he had won the game. He finds out that, without knowing, Caine serves a potion of motion in a glass that gives him a mansion, the queen of the ball (Russo) as a wife, and makes him the president of the sports goods company he has preserved. The dog later reveals that who is responsible for this change, but Belushi is not entirely on board. She never fully adapts to a scene of development that does not kill the movie but is still strange, trying to persuade her wife (Hamilton) of her real life, who is married to someone else. The good move is that they do not spend too much time on it, for they practically rip "Ghost," and Belushi always told Hamilton things she could only know. He also brings a dramatic element of hockey as two of his lovers, kevetch in the shadows, the new wife Russo and his unbalanced lover Cox. But the movie keys are the start of somewhat long and the happy ending. Also, good work from the big and acknowledged distribution, because Belushi is very pleasant, VERY attractive ladies, and Caine is very easy to go as a title type. Strangely, this was Belushi's second film in 1990, dealing with an alternative wealth lifestyle that was found in "Take Care of Business." Although they are similar, both films are at the same level of laughter provided. So check this for a fun exploration of "what if?"
