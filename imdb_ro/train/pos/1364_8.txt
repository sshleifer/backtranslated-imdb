I remember Parker Posey about "As The World Turns" before becoming the queen of independent films. In this film, Posey shows her potential of top actress. In this supportive film, which includes Omar Townsend as Moustafa, a Lebanese immigrant who works as a street falafeller who aspires to become a professor. The Supporting Association offers a wonderful actress who plays her godfather and a family relative only as Judy, the librarian who is old, dedicated and menopaulted. Posey as Mary teaches she has to grow up and mature. Losing her position as a librarian, she realizes how much she lacks as a place in her life. Mary's life is surrounded by friends in the Lower East Side village of New York before becoming gentrified with yuppies. This movie is good enough for an independent and we have come to enjoy Parker Posey as Mary as well as other characters from other movies.
