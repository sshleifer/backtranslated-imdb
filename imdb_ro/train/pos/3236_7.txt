Half a dozen stories of different interest illuminate our lives in Finland. These stories are interconnected and each one contains a scene in which a sonic boom is heard. This indicates that the events described are happening at the same time. The movie starts with a bumpy jump that promises a bit of excitement, but the early stories are the pretty low key. The film improves to stay with him. Two marriages broken in the following stories offer a lot of drama while a scene in a hospital gives us a sick patient finished begging to relieve pain. The last moments with his wife are both convincing and moving. While different scenes of family life take place in Finland, the themes are of a general nature, no matter where you are going to live. Stories collections are rarely as satisfying as a good 90-minute drama.
