Do you know how Star Trek fans clustered to all Star Trek movies, even the bad guys? Why? To see his heroes in action once again. That's how I feel about Doc Savage. I'm a major fanatic of the character, and the prospect of seeing Doc and his crew in an adventure was overwhelming. And the first 20 minutes of the movie have only widened that sense of anticipation. Then they decided to keep the elements of a number of Doc adventures and throw them into this film, resulting in a somewhat disjunctive film. There are a lot of promises here, diluted by a series of unfortunate choices (music, camp elements, etc.). But Doc's spirit is there, and those of us familiar with Doc and his crew are responding. So in my long-lasting way, what I'm trying to say is that it's not a bad movie: it's not as good as it should have been. And anyone who is a fan of Superman, James Bond, Indiana Jones, Buckaroo Banzai and many other characters should check this movie just to get acquainted with the hero who inspired them all.
