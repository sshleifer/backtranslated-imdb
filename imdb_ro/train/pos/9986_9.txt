As one of the few Canadians who did not read the book in high school, I thought I'd add my comments. Seeing the movie without knowing the story beforehand did not drop in any way from the movie. Characters have so many complexities, each can relate to them in their own way. The brilliance of adaptation is that anyone who is allowed to design their own perception of character life rather than want an opinion. You can love them or do not like them, and still feel the emotional impact of the movie. Fabulous performances by Ellen Burstyn and Christine Horne bring the characters to life. I would recommend it very much.
