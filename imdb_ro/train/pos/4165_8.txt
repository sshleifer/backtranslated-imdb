No, this 70-year-old television horror clinker is not about a demon-cherished dessert cake. However, this extremely terrible, but undoubtedly funny, and therefore pleasant cathode refusal, reaches a stunning summit of absolute, unceasing holiness and atrocity that is quite delicious in such a delicious way. Richard Crenna, in search of the haggard and possibly alongside him, and Yvette Mimieux, who behaves as if he had not gone through the brutal rape he endured in Jackson County, slowly portrays a disgusting couple of beautiful and respectable suburban whose strange little town, existence becomes destroyed when the cute German Shepard takes them while the family animal turns out to be a badly fat ancient spirit. Pretty soon, Mimieux and her two children, Kim Richards and Ike Eisenmann (foreign psychologist from the Disney paintings "Witch Mountain") worship a crude pencil drawing of the ugly and ugly canine of the day. Boys, does not it really sound scary and disturbing now? Well, scary and disturbing, is not it, but it's funny, thanks to Curtis ("Night Tide"), Harrington's poor direction, special cartoon effects (not so special), painful risible'n ' ridiculous a plot and a gaming distribution that courageously fights with the absurd story (besides leadership both Martine Beswicke and RG Armstrong appear briefly as members of a satanic cult, and Victor Jory has a beautiful cameo a native American shaman). Preferred scene: The Mephestophelion mutt shore puts whammy on Crenna, basically forcing him to hold his hand on a lawn mower. While fans in the scary snobby of the film can keep their nose at the perfectly disordered smell of this often dirty trick, devoted devotees of television should consider this product abominably abominable the boot tube equivalent to Alpo.
