I first saw this movie 40 years ago on New York television and thought it was a depressing look at the future. Wells sees restricting private freedoms as a good thing. ("No Private Airplane") The war in the 30-year film was the reason why the film was not portrayed by British filmmakers who made the war, the concept of the future, and the concept of Korda and Co. the future is the true stars of the film. This performance is Ralph Richardson's best actress as the boss. A combination of Winston Churchill and Edina from the Absolutely Fabulous comedy series. It's interesting to note that the boss's negative personality is somewhat similar to Churchill War.
