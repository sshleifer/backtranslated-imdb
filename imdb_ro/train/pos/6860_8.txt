Bobbie's transsexual psychotherapy kills the patient (Angie Dickinson) by a prominent doctor (Michael Caine) and then watches the prostitute at high prices (Nancy Allen), who took a look at Bobbi in the elevator. Liz (Allen) is under suspicion of murder and joins the patient's son (Keith Gordon) to catch the murderer. It can be summed up in a few words: it is very sexy (Dickinson and Allen look great), it is very bloody - with the genre, usually reserved for brilliant films, and the boy is well-crafted. The script of writer / director De Palma is OK, but he has an overall chance for man's ability to create movies. It is very successful at a visceral level and actually involved me in / interested in these characters. I can observe the standards from Palma from Palma to Ritchie at Hitchcock - at least from one of Master's images. And at first, everything has a professional and credible distribution. <br /> <br /> This was De Palma's third film with ex-wife Nancy Allen (after "Carrie" and "Home Movies"). By the way, the dancing actress, Rachel Ticotin, was one of the production assistants. There's a bit of trivia for you. I do not think a thriller could be classical and bloody at the same time, but this image pulls it off. One of the best things about this is a typical Pino Donaggio music score. <br /> <br /> 8/10
