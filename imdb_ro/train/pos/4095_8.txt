Now, my friends, movies like "La BÃªte" (aka "Beast" or "O Monstro") shall be subject to the old continent :), in this film we see everything: horses dirty sex, Nymphomaniac gorilla etc. In terms of serious, an allegory of that sometimes people might be bestial, visceral and brutal, Walerian Borowczyk (Director) shows loss of innocence, sexual violence, rape and brutality. It is a breathtaking cinematic experience, bizarre and full of grotesque scenes. For all fans of shocking European exploitation, I recommend this movie. If you like this I recommend: "Orloff Against the Invisible Man" and "Altered States".
