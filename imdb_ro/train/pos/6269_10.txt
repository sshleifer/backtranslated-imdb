A nice surprise! I was expecting another downgrade along the line: Rock (9) -> Con Air (7) -> Armaggeddon (4). Especially for such an excessive film. Perhaps this is the reason why so few approved this new type of Bruckheimer tariff. Intelligent dialogue, instead of a single cage, a decent background / motivation instead of stereotypes, and when you followed the pursuit, you were really scared. Fanboys is waiting for an Armageddon rollercoaster: stay away. This is one for fans of smarter action. I do not even bother that Jolie has appeared so little.
