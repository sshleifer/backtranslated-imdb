I would give almost 10 out of 10. However, there are some confusing parts as well as sections that are driving miss that hurt the flow / continuity of the movie. The story line is wonderful and well composed; you will surely want to watch this quietly to fully understand this. Characters are complicated, just like the story line, expect to be given enough information to not scratch your head, is a movie in which everything is finally explained. The animation is wonderful, and the combination of fatal females and film noir results in a wonderful movie that does not resemble anything else I've ever seen in animation. It's a black and white film and its quiet darkness in some scenes, so it's worth watching on a T.V or a good plasma. The characters' vowels save this movie in the English version, but it would have been more convincing if there were French accents to emphasize that it is happening in Paris, I enjoyed much more in French with English subtitles. One of them is well worth buying on DVD or BlueRay if they have it! And personally, if you would like this movie, you might also want it; Waking Life & Ghost in a Shell 2 innocence, this is just a personal suggestion.
