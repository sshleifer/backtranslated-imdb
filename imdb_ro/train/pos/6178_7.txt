Mitchell Leisen's fifth role, as a director, shows his versatility by directing a musical after his previous films were heavy dramas. He also plays a diamond as a conductor. You can tell it is a pre-code movie, and nothing like it has been done in the US for quite a long time (like 30 years). Leisen shot the musical numbers so they were what the audience would see - no widescreen or above Busby Berkeley. What seems funny or interesting to me is that you never see the audience. As others have said that these leaders are quite devoid of characters, Jack Oakie and Victor McLaghlan interpret their normal characters in the film. Gertrude Michael still offers a little sparkle. The musical numbers are interesting and some good (Rhapsody violation in particular is funny), but the unbelievable and false drama - three crimes are too many and have minimal emotional impact on the characters. Here the movie could have been much better.
