There is no way to confront the "Zabriskie point" rationally or to try to describe it using words and conventions that you would use for other movies. This is because it is not a movie. It's an idea and a feeling that filmmakers have somehow gotten into a play as playful as a movie. What we see is not the outcome of a plot, but rather a series of events that we do not see in movies every day, but just imagining that it happens in the background that we ourselves will provide when we hear about a a tragic event in news or friends. We see that it is our imagination of people that are abstractions for us - no one knows, but no doubt we have heard of them in a book or on television or somewhere. So what do we see? Events. We see that people argue, lead, and inevitably escape. Only escape is from something intangible - it is the collective situation and the cruelty that a mass of civilization has allowed to exist, however, laziness or ... human nature. Situated in the late 1960s in Los Angeles, our players act against and in response to the self-provocative mess of modern existence. These creatures are actually a witness that can show any trait that we can imagine if we want. Although the actions taken may be seen as criminal or irresponsible, the characters are not themselves criminals. They are human beings who seek a return to a familiar, un-fabricated existence that goes beyond the normality that they feel every day. Not that they are ever happy or sad, but they realize a type of self-update when they move beyond and away from the suicide of modern life. They reach a real life in the natural world, even if it is the next victim of modern existence. Finally, "Zabriski Point" is an eulogy of the humanistic attachment to the natural world. Because even the most desolate parts of the earth give way to our notions of progress, we lose our souls on the path to the death of the human spirit.
