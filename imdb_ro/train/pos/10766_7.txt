A thin story with many beautiful pictures. Look here are the three ladies of D.R.E.A.M. team. And, to a lesser extent, the guy who accompanied them. Traci Lords convincingly acts the female half of an evil business partner who intends to poison the world with anthrax. The original in this movie is a bra bum, put on a captured member of D.R.E.M. Of course, it is saved by a co-member three seconds before the explosion. Although it has been clearly borrowed from "Goldfinger" and "You only live twice", such a climax always works well. However, a nice watch, James Bond replaced here by Charlie's three Angels.
