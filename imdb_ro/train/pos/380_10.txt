Taking a break from the early 1980s, Steven Spielberg directed Whoopi Goldberg in an adaptation of Alice Walker "The Purple Color," about the desperate existence of an African-American woman in the 1930s. Looking to Goldberg to play Celie, it is incredible that she is the same woman who has starred in films like the "Sister Act". This is a kind of movie that could be easy - no, it should be - part of the curriculum in Black and Women Studies. There is a scene that can be the most magnificent editing work ever on the screen (you'll know when you see it). I can not believe that this has not won an Oscar; may be Spielberg's second best film behind "Schindler's List" (perhaps even linked to him). Also starring Danny Glover, Adolph Caesar, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey, Willard E. Pugh, Akosua Busia and Laurence Fishburne.
