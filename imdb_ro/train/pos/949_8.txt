"Telefilms" tends to fall under the trap of a low budget and a snap shot program, which is why this movie always tends to lose its trend. George C. Scott embodies the perfect Ebenezer Scrooge, encompassing all his cool tendencies and still making him a sympathetic character. The production value for this movie was exceptional, never relying on boffo special effects or sound sets, but based on the depth and clarity of on-site footage and strong foundations. A movie that is certainly alone.
