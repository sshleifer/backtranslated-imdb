Right from the start you will see that "Anchors Aweigh" is a great comedy. Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra make such a funny team! The songs they sing together are pure entertainment. Kathryn Grayson is gorgeous and very sweet. Dean Stockwell is the prettiest actor I've never seen. If you like the piano, you will be amazed by Jos√© Iturbi. This movie was the first to combine animation with real actors and did this wonderful in an unforgettable dance. Undoubtedly, one of Kelly's funniest movies.
