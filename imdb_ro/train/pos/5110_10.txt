I was 11 years old and found out that I live at a distance of 0.48 km from my uncle's home. Uncle's house is on Westway Dr, Deer Park, TX. have added homes since the movie was made. I do not know the house number, but you can look. I'm 21 now and I like to watch this movie. the Spencer bar is no longer theirs. Pasadena ISD wants to build a school. I walked past the house last week, the house still looks great. My father and my uncle would go to the street where the house is and see the actors come in and out of the house trying to make the movie. where John crosses the cracks they have made 225 bigger. when I heard about John leaving his son to start thinking about when he made a urban cowboy, he was 26 or 25 years old.
