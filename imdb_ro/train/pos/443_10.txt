I first saw this movie in the early 1990s, when it was first released. The view room was also recent. Enchanted April has much more to offer! It seemed to me more real and wider, more credible characters to be "normal". By the end of the movie, I felt the same thing as when I first saw BBC's Pride and Prejudice production, I was looking for the characters to find what they were looking for, whether it was isolation, peace, freedom or love. You have a sense throughout Italy that it is so far removed from everything you've ever known, that you are so decadent to take the risk and to leave behind everything that is humorous and constrictor. But in the spring heat of April, everyone's life breaks and unleashes (according to Victorian corsets) and slowly rebuilds to the satisfaction of everyone. What a gem of a movie! Why is not it better known?
