Unfortunately, this film has been largely unavailable (as other posters have mentioned), but this is one of the dramatic essays of the Great Depression, a lyrical and moving drama of love, located in a busy city. He has performances by Spencer Tracy and Loretta Young, who are only the best of their careers, and is an example that particularly shows how director Frank Borzage has managed to create a close aura around the elements of poverty, a terrible social inequity that only proves that his true romantic and spiritual talents were. This film shows how love survives in the midst of misery and desperate need, and is entirely affirming life. This is a true masterpiece of the period and is a film that deserves to be better known.
