A masterpiece of comedy, a masterpiece of horror, a masterpiece of romance, if there is anything to say about a story of a Chinese ghost, the special effects might be dated compared to modern technology. The film has a simple premise: a poor debt collector must remain in a secluded area, trying to collect a debt. Of course, he also happens to be haunted. What I did not expect the first time I saw this movie is that it's one of the most appealing love stories I've ever seen; which is without losing any playlist comedy that will have you in the seams. Unlike some movies in Asian cinema, a Chinese ghost story is not hard to swallow for those who are not versed in Chinese culture. Indeed, it plays on immortal themes without a culture of paranormal and romanticism. Think of Evil Dead 2 if you've been throwing a wonderful love story into the mix. This film is real, despite being overlooked by many. I'm absolutely among the best I've ever seen. It's the ability to combine the best aspects of multiple genres and cross-cultural boundaries to attract humanity from everywhere, it's not fantastic at all. Highly recommended, 10/10.
