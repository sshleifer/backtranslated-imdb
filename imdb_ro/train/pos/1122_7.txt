Four teenage friends head to Fort Laurdale for a spring break. Unfortunately, they have a flat tire in Medley, Georgia, and one of the girls is witnessing a brutal murder in the woods. The local sheriff is behind the murder and the nightmare begins ... "Shallow Grave" is a pleasant surprise with a low budget. The turn is quite pleasant, the direction is constant and the violence is particularly ugly and misogynistic. Especially the second crime is pretty bleak. The killer sheriff is not a one-dimensional character, a pair of scenes seem to be remorse for what he did. The subplot involving the two boys they meet in the house does not go anywhere, but the spider scene in the woods is tense and exciting.7 out of 10.
