Dirty Harry has to discover a rape victim who extracts vengeance by shooting the assailants in guns before killing them. Perhaps a more appropriate punishment would be to let them live after the initial blow and to let them suffer forever like her and her sister ... Anyway ..... an action story set up again in San Francisco and Santa Cruz. The main offender, played by Andy Drake, is appropriately misleading and receives the penalty at the end (of course!). It's not a classic movie, but better than others, except the original Dirty Harry.
