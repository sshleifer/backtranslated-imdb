but I want to say that I can not agree more with Moira. What a wonderful movie. I was only thinking this morning, I wanted to give some advice to dopey sod who lost money on her debit card and wanted to say, "Keep your money in your pocket," and you realize I'm talking about James Mason . Even he did not say these words, I still think it would be! I never forgot, "Are you a bearer?" in reconciliation with his son, Hywel Bennet: "You always have money in your pocket!" Good advice. Insufficient children do not have parents with such unintelligible, but well-intentioned attitudes. Or any father. <br /> <br /> It would be good for us to re-enter you, "you" and "you" into our language to show that we care. This is just the same as "tutoyer" in French or "du" in German. Addendum: I just realized that many of my remarks were about James Mason in the Family Way! <br /> <br /> I think it's because I mixed Susan George with Hayley Mills. Well, easy mistake. I stand by tho comments. And the spring and the harbor are so similar to the Family Way. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When you took a girlfriend in those days, you really had something to say and talk about afterwards, something that affected your knowledge of the world and the development your personal. The theatrical experiences are almost real, and they are important to help young people grow up. It's not happening now, I think, that adolescents can only go to pictures like us.
