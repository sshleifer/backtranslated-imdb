The film refers to Philip (Leslie Howard), a serious but handicapped student who falls in love with a merciless waitress called Mildred (Bette Davis). He lets him engage with others (Alan Hale, Reginald Denny). Meanwhile, he is romanticated with other contenders (Kay Johnson, Frances Dee), but she returns to a mutually destructive business. Easily the best and the first of the many versions of the Somerset Maugham novel. Bette Davis as the cruel waitress winning yet another magnificent performance with an appealing and tumultuous performance, absolutely hypnotic in her bondage from the beginning to the end. Davis uplifted her style with her performance. Her role as rough and crude the dominant woman will repeat itself several times in the posteriori. Leslie Howard, as an essentially good and decent student, subtly destroyed, offers excellent and melancholic performance. He was a wonderful actor alongside the producer and writer, and died in a plane crash during the Second World War. Both will play again in the "Persecuted Forest" (1936). The atmospheric film is creatively recreated in the RKO studio (Radio Picture Inc.), which is totally convincing. Remade in 1946 by Edmund Goulding, Eleanor Parker and Paul Henreid; and in 1964 by Ken Hughes with Kim Novak and Laurence Harvey. The filming picture will be enjoyable to fans of classic cinema. Rating: Very good but a little dated.
