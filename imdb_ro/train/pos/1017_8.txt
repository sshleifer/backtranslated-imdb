I started looking at the show from the first season, and at first I was pretty skeptical about it. The original film was kind of childish and I was just looking for a SF show while waiting for the new BSG season. But after a few episodes, I became a fan. I loved the characters - not the stupid, how do you think is Jack O'Neill, Samantha Carter, not only the smart, glorious Teal'c, the brilliant women and children Dr. Daniel Jackson. Of course, stories sometimes are not serious, sometimes ridiculous, but they are no longer about technology or space fights - it's about helping your friend, even if you risk your life for him. It's about "we do not let anyone go". It struggles to the end when all hope is lost. About the free will and all the good qualities that make man - the Man. And now it's a record break, going into season 10, and still doing well.
