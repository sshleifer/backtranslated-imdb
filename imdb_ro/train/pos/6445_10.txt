Beyond the excellent direction, predictable production, acting and drama is an essential message in the scenario: "Listening leads all the way" For the voice to flourish, listen. To harmonize with others in the voice, listen. To get closer, listen. To discover the needs of any situation or others, listen. It seems that script writers are transmitting a "secret of life". Listening leads to the awareness of oneself. It awakens the other senses, especially the vision and expands the horizon. The soul can also be discovered. The artist of this film, "As It Is in Heaven," showed magnificently the unfolding of life, not only joy and sadness, but ultimately the hope of life. All this, through the first instruction of the main character to the chorus; <br /> <br /> "Just listen, drive all the way"
