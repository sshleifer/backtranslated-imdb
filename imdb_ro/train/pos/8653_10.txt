I just watched "California" on Showtime for the fourth time since I saw it for the first time in July 2001. You would think that with the recent serial killer movies, California would be among some of the previous films worth mentioning, but he did not. Perhaps if this movie was released sometime between 1996-1999, it might have been more successful. In my opinion, "California" is far different from most serial killer movies released in the late 1990s. It has an almost completely different atmosphere from most serial crime films today such as "Seven" or "The Bone Collector". Many serials in series have shown a killer, but that person is always behind a mask or we never see them enough to actually find out about them. "California" is a movie that actually tries to get through this barrier and actually understands the criminal mind. They try to answer questions such as "Why do they do things? Is it because of things that happened in their past - makes them feel superior or strong?" Or do they do because they like the thrill of killing? These are some of the things California is trying to answer, but it also leaves room for us to try to think about things for ourselves. Brad Pitt makes an eternal impression like Early Grayce. When we meet for the first time at the beginning of the movie, we see that a troubled individual is obvious. When we see it for the first time, late at night. Early is probably drunk. Then we see him pick up a stone, throw it off the bridge, and later land on the windscreen of a passing car. Pitt is fierce in this movie. It's always good to see him playing psychically or bad people. It's funny that this would have made him later play it in a real game like "12 Monkeys" and that he would be at the other end of the spectrum in David Fincher's "Seven".
