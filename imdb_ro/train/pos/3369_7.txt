Despite what the title may mean, "Pigs Is Pigs" does not wear the Porky Pig picture. Rather, he has a younger pig with a more unsavory appeal than John Belushi's "Animal House" character. His mother repeatedly reproaches him, but he is not right. So much to go to another house where an annoying scientist nourishes him more than any mortal man can do (but there is a surprise at the end). I would say more than anything that this cartoon seemed like a placeholder between really big cartoons (Daffy Duck started three months after he left). But make no mistake, do some things allowed here. The whole force-feeding sequence seems to be more relevant today, given the epidemic of obesity that goes beyond our country. Anyway, not the biggest cartoon, but it's worth seeing.
