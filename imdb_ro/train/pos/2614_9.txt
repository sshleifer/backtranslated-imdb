Why has not this been released? I thought it had to be a bit of garbage because it was not. How wrong can a girl be! This movie is, in a word, enthusiastic. <br /> <br /> You will be captivated. It draws your attention from the beginning and its rhythm never slows down. The final part of the movie, the "episode" as it was (did not give anything you saw in the trailer) is also unmissable. You will choose a favorite, you will be shocked, you will not be able to go and make a cup of coffee because you have to find out what's going on. Adrenaline rises and you can not watch. Cudos for the actors, it's very credible. And it does not stop there, they have a final shock to you <br /> <br /> It also makes you wonder Realitatea TV and if you look. And how far are we really? Endemol (who makes a big brother) made a TV show in the Netherlands last year, giving the kidney a dying woman to patients who need a transplant. The show was revealed at the end of the year as a farce, apparently to raise awareness of organ donation, but are we too close to comfort?
