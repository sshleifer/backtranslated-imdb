The part where Meg visits the mechanic and says - "Does the piston burned short?" (which involves a poor sexual energy from her fianc√©) was hilarious. I love Meg Ryan and it's as sweet as ever in this wonderful movie. Very pleasant and very intelligent. Her innocent indigenous expressions want to be yours. The hero deals with the garage mechanic to make the physicist a good one. Einstein had a romantic side to his psyche? The puzzle round in front of the press and the audience was good. It is terribly underestimated and deserves fun and renaissance attempts. Loses a vote to include the extremely unlikely theory that was bought by the US government. I do not see why it does not appear in the first 20 romantic comedies of the century. The big movie, has the presidential seal of approval on it!
