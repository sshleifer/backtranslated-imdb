He saw this on SBS TV here in Australia last week, where he was titled "Laputa: The Castle in the Sky". We created subtitles and I think SBS has assured its own for that, which, as usual, has a very good quality. Luputa sought Wikipedia and confirms what I suspected ... the floating island of this story is taken from Jonathan Swift's classic novel "Traveling Gulliver," which was published in the early 1700s. However, it is a Japanese fairy tale, speaking voice cast. It is suitable for small children, I think, but it lasts for over two hours, so it may be too long for some, though not for an adult like me. The story refers to two children who are looking to find a legendary floating island that has a castle on it. Children are not the only ones looking for this island. They have pirates, the army, and spies looking for the island and seeking to capture the children (Sheeta, the girl, expressed by Anna Paquin and Pazu, the boy, expressed by James Van Der Beek) to help them find. The graphics are magnificent ... sometimes a realistic picture, especially the scenes of stone lit by torchlight or beautiful scenes of bright and sunny days with white clouds or fog. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
