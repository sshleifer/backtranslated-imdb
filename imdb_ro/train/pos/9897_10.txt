Okay, I'm sorry, but I liked this movie. I like the genre of the whole year of 80 such films, because you do not see it anymore! I want to ask all those who say that this film is just a rip-off or imitation cheese, what does it imitate? I've never seen another movie like this one, it's no horror. Actually, about the school folk group who likes to make everyone live hell, so they decided to choose this mad little boy called Marty. It turns into a fatal girl when it's really hurt by one of their little jokes. So, like 10 years later, and the group of friends suffering Marty begins to receive letters of reunion at high school. But ... they are the only ones who receive them! So they go back to the old school and one by one are beaten by ... Yes, you probably know what's going on! The only part that disappointed me was the end. It could have been left out or thought better. I think you should try and try not to be critics! CupidGrl ~ * ~
