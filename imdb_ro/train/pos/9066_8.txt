~ ~ I was able to see this movie yesterday morning in an early viewing visit I am a mother of 2 children, ranging from 11 to 6. So I'm sure a lot of parents can refer to having to to see many "kids" movies. It was refreshing for me. I have not read this special book, so I do not know whether it was true in the book or not. But it certainly took the factor of thickness at a high level. This is the story of the "new" kid in town and it just happens that there is a group of boys who have formed a kind club and love to choose the kids ... sound familiar? We have not all suffered this one thing or another. He has his little brother he can not stand and his parents are embarrassed. What I liked most was to see how each character was completely different from the one they just noticed. Intimidation (why do I always bully a red head? My daughter has red hair and she is not a bully! Lol) is a good bully who seems to be shouted by his own big brother. It took turns and transformations and you fell in love with all of this, and you guided yourself for all the characters! Even the parents, a great bond between father and son. All around pleasant, sweet, funny, raw, etc ...... Get your kids! You will enjoy it as much as they do!
