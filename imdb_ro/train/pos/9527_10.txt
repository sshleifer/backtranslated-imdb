This is the best mob movie ever made. He deserved more than he did at the Oscars. Nominated for things like score, art direction, supporting role (Newman), this film could easily be nominated for best film, director (Mendes), actor (Hanks), actor (Newman and Law) Hanks gives one of his best performances, and the child who played Michel Jr. was so good that I'm surprised I do not see him in several movies today. Critics themselves did not give this film enough credit. But besides incredible performances, another true star of this movie is incredible music. This was by far the best score of the year. He was nominated but did not win. This is a great movie to be seen by everyone. My grade A +
