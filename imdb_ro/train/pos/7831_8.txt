Fritz Lang is in Die Nibelungen: Kriemhilds Rache (1924). Kriemhild (Margarete Schoen) wants to revenge her husband killed, Siegfried. His brother is too weak to bring Hagen to the court, murdered. King of the Hunt (Rudolf Klein-Rogge). He bids a child and invites his brothers to the party. Etzel and the other Huni should occupy Hagen, but he is protected by his brothers. We see an immense battle of life, and death begins and it puts fire in its entirety. In fact, Hagen is dead and Kriemhild. These films deal with great themes such as revenge and unhappy love. Of course I've seen some better movies later on those topics, but it was one of the first.
