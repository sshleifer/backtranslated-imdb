This movie was made in 1943 when I think Judy was at the top (looks wise). In his earlier film, "Me and the Gal", they often say she seems to be emaciated. In this movie she looks perfect. She is beautiful and shows she has a flair for comedy. I think this movie is hilarious, especially at first, when trying to hold an audition with John Thornway. One of the funniest scenes is, in my opinion, Judy's interpretation of Lady Macbeth, and when John is looking at the party to give him a shot (Lol). One criticism I have is that there is no hole in the plot when John and Lily fall in love. I mean a minute he despises her and in the next they will come out at once, then the next time they meet after that date they are in love. Another point I did not like was the opening night. If I were Lily, I'd be angry with John, but it's not ... it just does not make sense. But I should have given this movie a 10, because it's just great and almost perfect.
