Bugs life is a good movie. But for me, they do not really compare to movies like the story of toys and others. Do not misunderstand me, I liked this movie, but it was not as good as the Toy story. The movie has visual, laugh and others that had the Toy story. But the movie did not feel as ... I do not know, but I thought it was still a pretty good movie. <br /> <br /> A life of bugs ... I do not mean that, it's a movie that I do not remember. I saw her years ago. Of course, I have not seen the Toy story for years, but I still remember. I should not have reviewed this movie, but I am. I give a big finger, though it's not even the best work Pixar did. The Life of a Bug: *** / ****
