I'm a massive fan of Jet Li! He is the best HK action live action ... and therefore - This movie rocked! I saw it in the video store and, as it was in the main section of this mainstream video store, I did not register it at first and I had to look twice. I knew as soon as I had rented. My only calm (I suppose I'm expecting) is that it was called (AAARGh) and not subtitled. Otherwise, the original / strange / cold plot of the film, and full of action, made him one of Jet Li's best movies ... even if all fall into that category ....
