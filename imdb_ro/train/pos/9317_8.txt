I've seen this critically acclaimed movie saying "If you can go through moralization ..." That's pointless. Morality is in the viewer's consciousness, as it was. This is a decent movie with a mysterious murder mystery but with a twisting twist that is halfway down the road. The resolution leaves the viewer wondering, "What would I do in this position?" And I have to think that's exactly what the director intended. To this end, and to the end of the audience's fun, the movie succeeds. I also love how violence is never on the scene, but just out of the room. We know what happened; we did not serve in front of us, then we rubbed our face, as it is today with contemporary blood and dressing gore. In addition, violence is not the point. The idea is the moral dilemma of the protagonist, who is intelligent, though disturbing, solved.
