"Enter the Fat Dragon" is one of the most fun martial art films I've had the chance to see. Sammo Hung portrays a Chinese boy who comes to visit a friend from the city. Just like Tung Lung of "The Dragon's Way". Wherever Sammo goes, the problems start, so he has to rely on his martial art skills to solve the differences. Fortunately, Sammo's character learns martial arts by imitating and imitating his idol, Bruce Lee. He even touched his nose exactly as Bruce Lee does, and he also releases his roar. He also uses nunchucks in a scene. It was like seeing a fat man Bruce Lee. There is a great show near the end of the movie, made up of foreign fighters. Sammo has to meet each opponent one by one. A kind of "death game," where each fighter possesses a martial art discipline different from each other. This is one of the movies I really enjoyed watching and also the first Sammo Hung movies I've seen. Excellent battle scenes and lots of laughs. A classic classic Sammo Hung movie, I strongly recommend martial artists there. 8.5 / 10!
