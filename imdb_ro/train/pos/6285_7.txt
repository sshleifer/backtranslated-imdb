What's in a name? If the name is Jerry Bruckheimer wait for it to be filled with action. In the producer Bruckheimer's latest film, Gone in 60 seconds, all about the nomenclature. With character characters such as Kip, Sway and Sphinx and idealized cars with names like Diane, Sue and Eleanor, it's just a non-stop action that prevents you from playing the name-playing game. <br /> <br /> It's not a profound scenario in any way, but it's a great vehicle for action, just as Nicolas Cage, like Memphis Raines, along with Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall, comes out of retirement to save lives his brother by stealing a list of 50 exotic cars in one night. A remake of the 1974 hit, the film may not be intended for the same cult status, but it's fun. Surprisingly, it's the action that your actor does not follow. Although they are loaded with stars, none of them have remarkable performance, including very poor performance by one of the most favorite and the best, Giovanni Ribisi. Even Jolie, coming out of Oscar's recent victory, is just a love token love with almost any time on the screen. Can a number of beautiful cars and the car aim to get involved in making a great movie? I think so. The film is a pleasure to look at, and although a certain scene takes you to the realm of unbelief, action is non-stop and suspense is convincing. Just be afraid of the other drivers who are fighting for a pole position while leaving the theater. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 of 5
