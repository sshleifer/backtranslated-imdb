In a small town in Montana two brothers grow up. One of them is Norman (Craig Sheffer), the other is Paul (Brad Pitt). Their father is Reverend Maclean and they grow up with his lessons related to religion and flying lessons. In this film, fishing is life, a bit. The story is good and keeps attention, although there are some moments that you need a small action. Probably the movie has these moments, because it is not really about the events that take place, but about the message. But some things happen. Norman goes to Dartmouth to study. After six years she returns and gets involved in a pretty girl named Jessie (Emily Lloyd) and is invited to teach in Chicago. Paul became a reporter and is known as a "fishing reporter." He is famous and seems to have a beautiful life, but he drinks a little too much and plays too much. The film is very well directed, has a beautiful score and all the actors are good. The most beautiful thing in this movie is cinema. The mountains, the forest and the river look very nice. If the movie was made just for these things, it was good enough to look. Fortunately, there is more.
