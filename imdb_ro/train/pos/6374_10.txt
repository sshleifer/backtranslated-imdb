Atlantis was much better than we anticipated. In some respects, it has had a better story than other films that aim at a more advanced age. Although this film sometimes demanded increased attention. It was a great movie for all ages. I have noticed that some of the younger audience is waiting for a comedy but has an affair. I think everyone is tired of an endless parade of extreme parodies. Many of these children have only seen parodies. After a short period of time, everyone seemed very attentive to Atlantis.
