When we started watching this series on the cable, I had no idea how dependent it was. Even when you hate a character, stay back because they are so well-developed, you almost understand why they react to frustration, fear, greed or temptation as they do. It's almost as if the viewer faces one of Christopher's curves. I do not understand why Adriana will refrain from Christopher's abuse of it verbally, physically and emotionally, but I just have to read the newspaper to see how many women can and tolerate such behavior. Carmella has a dream house, an endless delivery of expensive things, but I'm sure she'll give up a loving and faithful husband - or maybe not. That's why I look. No matter how many times you watch an episode, you can find something you've lost the first five times. We even look at the episodes of the sequence (1 night late night with commercials, but all languages, A & E with censorship of language, renewal of the film) - whenever they are, we are there. I was completely spoiled now. I like Malapropuri. "A blue around my neck" is my favorite for Johnny Boy. When these jewels have entered our family vocabulary, it's a sign that I should get a life. When the series is over, I've collected all the DVDs and put the collection in my will.
