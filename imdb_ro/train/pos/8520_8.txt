I thought the movie was pretty good. I liked the acting and moved well. The director seemed to really understand the story he was trying to say. I have to see the big budget coming out today, obviously they had a lot more money to throw at him, but he was very watched. When you see a movie like this for a small budget, you need to consider it when you view it. There were a few things that could have been better, but most were budget-related. The actress was pretty good for F / X and the stunts were doing well. Some guys were the guy who played the room. and the boy who played the baby. These types of movies have kept LA work and it is one that proved to be OK.
