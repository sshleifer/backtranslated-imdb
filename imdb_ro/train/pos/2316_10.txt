I watched this movie by chance, becoming curious about the trailer on TV. I like when I find movies like this, some little stories about ordinary people. Even if the end is tragic, "Man on the Moon" has some funny moments, especially in Dani's first characterization, with his innocent and pure love with the Court. It's a beautiful, moving love story with 3 high points: Reese Witherspoon's performance, who has kept his promises in the world of cinema, the beautiful "Lion" Freddie Francis cinematography, and James Newton Howard's fantastic score, the soul of the movie. His themes (which deserve an Oscar nomination) are so intimate and lyrical that they seem to have turned the script into music.
