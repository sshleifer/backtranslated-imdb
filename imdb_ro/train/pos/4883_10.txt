We, as a family, were so excited about "The Last of the Blonde Bombshells," we bought a copy for our home video library. The act is A1, and the cast contains many favorite actors and singers. The theme is unusual and the script is well written. The music / songs are timeless and we get back to our young days when we sang the songs at the top of our voices. To highlight the story here, the "plot" would be spoiled, because it is very nice to sit back and enjoy the story while it unfolds. The complete brand of this most enjoyable and high-quality production and we recommend the heart of anyone looking for a belly laugh and a lot of music.
