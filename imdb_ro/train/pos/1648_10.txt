This is one of the best movies ever made. It is a realistic picture of the rural life that has been a major part of American history. The setting is 1906 Wyoming, where life has not changed much since the last century. The movie keeps you interested without the Hollywood myths. The whole family can see this movie and can be intrigued about how life was in America when it was more of a rural nation. With this movie, you will get rid of the present and you will witness the everyday life 100 years ago. In a beautiful and scenic environment, you will see the hard work required to survive, as well as constant concerns and concerns about the elements and market pressures that will make the difference between success or failure. See this movie and the experience of life, as it was for most of our nation's history. This movie is worth your time to see. My only question is - why are not there more movies like this?
