The symbolic use of the objects, the editing of the shapes, the position of the characters in the scene ... all of this was used with such a pleasant Hitchcock abandonment that you can really see what fertility genius had. The way the wife moves from one corner of the ring to another as the fight advances, the edition when the wedding ring is put on his finger ... while they may seem a little obvious to today's standards in the silent era which the volumes about the story spoke without a word being spoken. Even the title has at least four meanings that I can see; the box ring, the wedding ring, the bracelet that the boyfriend is buying, and the love triangle in the heart of the story.
