Do not worry, Disney fans - this special DVD edition of Cinderella's beloved will not turn into a pumpkin at the midnight strike. One of the most enduring animated films of all time, the adaptation of Disney-Fide to the fable of Brothers Grimm has become a classic by itself, thanks to memorable songs ("Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo" and the song of the title) and some funny fun comic relief. Known slippers (click for a larger image) We all know the story - the stepmother of evil and the stadiums simply will not have it, this Cinderella madness believing it goes to a a ball designed to find the nice prince a right dick, animal friends and a well-established entry by a fairy goddess ensures that things turn out to be good. There are some striking sequences of pure animation - for example, Cinderella is reflected in the bubbles that travel through the air - and the design is rich and evocative throughout. It's a simple story, full of business comedies, especially hensive from Cinderella (consciously dressed as gnomes dwarf other famous heroine of Disney) and their adventures with a fucking cat named Lucifer. There is also a lot of harrumfing and exhibition, which was brought by the King and Grand Duke. It is a much simpler and graceful work than the most animated films of today, which makes it strange and very pleasant.
