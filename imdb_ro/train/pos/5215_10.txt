All I can say is the first movie this season that caught my attention. I chose it because of the actors, Gere and Claire, and the story seemed promising ... I just saw it and I can say - I'm overwhelmed. There are shocking, real scenes ... but that makes it more realistic. We should not run away from our reality, things are happening right now. And there are experts who try to change things and make things better and laugh about their commitment to the cause. Actually, I can not feel the "Hollywood touch" in the movie ... and that's better. Both Claire and Richard have performed great roles and deserve a score of 10.
