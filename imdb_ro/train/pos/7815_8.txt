"Cry Freedom" is a movie about how far people will go to find the truth. The first half is an interesting portrait of an unlikely friendship between activist Steve Biko and Editor Don Woods (fanatically played by Dezel Washington and Kevin Klein). While the second half deals with Woods, he looks for answers to Biko's death. Although most people favor the first half of the film that focuses on the unlikely friendship between Biko and Woods. I found the second half about the Don forests that struggle for Biko's story to be heard all over the world much more interesting.
