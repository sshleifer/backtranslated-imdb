I saw this movie at the International Film Festival in Brussels. I also met with the director of the film. I heard Ed Wood wrote the story in 10 years! I'm sure he thought it would be his masterpiece - his triumph. Well, if you take the movie seriously (as Mr. Wood did), this is indeed one of the worst movies you'll ever see. And that's cool. The big joke of I Wake Up Early, The day we died is not even trying to be a decent film. This makes the film very, very good. The script is full of nihilism and anarchism - a lot of black humor. Billy Zane's role is absolutely excellent. You see, this is either high art ... or low trash. <br /> <br />
