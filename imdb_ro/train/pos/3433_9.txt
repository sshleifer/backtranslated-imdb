I first saw this at a foreign film festival. It's a beautiful bitter nail about a plot to improve the $ 1 billion in the Estonian treasury. Everything is shot in a grandiose and granular style that Hollywood rarely uses - but captures the atmosphere of the new emancipated Balkan states (note: Tallin was really warmer in 2003 when I was there) <br /> There is a lots of humor and a love story. I do not want to ruin a series of surprising yet logical surprises, so I'm going to say this heist movie starts out from a great script, and the directors and shows are top. DARKNESS IN TALLIN is simply the fastest and most nervous example of his genre - I would put it against RAFIFI, TOPKAPI and is a few kilometers ahead of the new OCEAN 11, though (deliberately) not as glossy. RENT or BUY NOW.
