As an employee of the Swedish Air Force, I enjoyed the Gripen and Hkp 9 (MBB Bo 105) flight scenes from this film. One of the few disappointments was the EWS 39 jammer bridge, in this case an inert Rb 75 (Maverick) painted in black with the letters "EWS 39" in white along the side. Real jammer troops do not look definitely, at least not what I've seen. But besides, it's a funny movie with a very fun final (last minute). Anyone interested in seeing various Swedish military units, including the legendary SSG on film, should see this. <br /> <br />
