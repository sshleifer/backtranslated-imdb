This is a scary movie. Creepier than any David Lynch, and that shows what a great director Polanski is because he is not the regular type of work and he is BRILLIANT. It all starts with Trelkovski moving into a lock block in Paris. Soon, he learns that the previous tenant, a young man, has committed suicide and believes that the rest of the people who lived there have led him to him. He also thinks he's trying to do the same thing. What result has a stunning and frightening look at paranoia. All production has a classical horror written along it: from images to music, the spectator can feel Trelkovski's poverty. <br /> <br /> Are they all out to kill him? Or maybe you just make him mad? Is there a difference? Find yourself. 10/10
