A wonderful old fashion thriller comes as a cross between Alfred Hitchcock and David Lynch, "Red Rock West" follows the misfortunes of the veteran of the injured Ukrainian worker, Mr. N. Cage, because his luck turns from worse to worse after he finished an empty gas tank and barely enough money for a cup of coffee in a town behind behind. It has been established from the very beginning that Mr. Cage may be down but he is not out, and he could be broken but he will not steal, even in his current direct circumstances. Consequently, when confused by Mr. Walsh for the man he ordered to kill his wife, Mr. Cage invites his wife to warn her of her husband's intentions. In her turn, in the person of Miss LFBoyle, she offers him even more money to kill Mr Walsh. Mr Cage decides to leave while he is still in front, but as he leaves the city, he hits a man on road. Mortal as if to lead, takes the man to the hospital where he seems to have been shot. Mister. Cage is retained by deputies who call the sheriff who turns out to be Mr. JTWalsh. The events take another complicated stretch when Mr Cage, escaping from custody, avoids being driven by the real blow on his way to commit his commission. Now you may be forgiven for thinking "pretty much already," but as the screening appears to be a completely logical change of events, the narrative flow of the film at this time seemed unstoppable. Mr. D. Hopper is comfortably distributed as the committed killer, like Mr Cage a USMC veteran. This little piece of serendipity keeps Mr. Cage alive long enough to believe that the killer tribe and survive, a little bit beaten, but still untouched. It is a tribute to all those involved that what strikes on paper remarkably like a piece of nonsense is actually a tense, well-done image with fine performances throughout the course. "Red Rock West" is the filmmaker's film. In the five minutes, you know you're going somewhere that you've been several times, but you'll be very happy on the way.
