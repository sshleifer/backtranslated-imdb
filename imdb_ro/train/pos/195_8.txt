"Show People" is an absolutely delightful silence, directed by King Vidor, with Marion Davies and Billy Haines. What stones are both in this charming comedy about a young girl, Peggy Pepper, whose action is about Savannah trying to make it on the big screen. Although he is a comedy success, what he wants to do is make "art" so he moves to the High Arts Studio. Soon she becomes Patricia Pepoire and she's too good for her Billy girlfriends. Many stars of the silent age have showcases in Show People, including Davies himself without hair and makeup. I am sure that when people saw the film in 1928, they recognized all those who appeared in the elaborate lunch scene; Unfortunately, nowadays, it is not the case, even for film lovers. In one part of the film she meets Charlie Chaplin; In another, author Elinor Glyn was shown, and Vidor himself has a cameo at the end of the film. Other celebrities appearing in Show People include John Gilbert, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, Leatrice Joy, Bess Flowers, Renee Adoree, Rod LaRoque, Aileen Pringle and many others. Davies was adorable and a lively comedy. It's a shame, William Haines gave up the movies - he was cute and energetic, perfectly a huge star that day. "Show People" is a simple story told in a spiritual way. It's also a look back at an exciting time in Hollywood history and contains wonderful two-star shows.
