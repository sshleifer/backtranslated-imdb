Whoopi was the only reason I watched the Oscars of that year. She is hilarious. Of course, there was a big part of the show. It was great not only because it was fun, but because it said a few things that had to be said in a public forum. The white people have to recall that the Hollywood awards ceremony, employment and representation are not racially balanced. There should be no need for "black" prizes. White shepherds, nomads and milletoast judges need to bring their heads in the sunlight and see that the great material is not limited to directors, producers, actors, etc. "Alba". Allowing Woody Allen in the air was the depth of poor taste. He had no business there. The fact is that this is the first Oscar show I've ever seen since "The Purple Color" was presented for the awards. This spontaneous abortion comforted me for the show until 2002. What should not denigrate other moderators. Billy Crystal is a revolt.
