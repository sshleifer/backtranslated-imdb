I do not understand why the other comments focus on McConaughey. He was never a very interesting film actor. <br /> <br /> The best part of this film is writing and spirit. Alfred Molina and Patrick McGaw are making an unusual comic duel, certainly not action types. Although it can not be said that their characters are well developed, which does not make them less fun. The version I saw was on HDNET and had subtitles for the Spanish dialogue, so it certainly was not a problem. The use of the Spaniards gives them more authenticity. <br /> <br /> A highly underestimated film, judged by IMDb members, is unusually low. I thought it was fun and interesting and it's worth at least 7 years. A lot of slick movies with higher scores and making big money at the box office are a lot less interesting.
