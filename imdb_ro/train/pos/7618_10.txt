Hi: <br /> <br /> I heard about a lost from a co-worker who had obvious differences of opinion on the entertainment he loved. Well, I watched an episode or two in the early seasons and got bored, so I gave it up. After a few years, I came across lost; bored with the current sci-fi fare. Wow was surprised. You can say gravity, well, I was sucked. Rhythm and scripting are very good, some of the front / rear flashlights are so appealing with lamellar characters, but all over the good. My favorite characters are Ben, Locke, Jacob, Richard Alpert, Sayid Jarrah, Sawyer, Hurley, Daniel Faraday, Jin & Wife, Walt, Charlie, Desmond and Jack's father. Jack and Michael are definitely imbecile, very sober and immature. Kate a step above them, Juliet was much more stylish than Kate. Mr. Eko has been under-rated at Charlie's level if not more, too bad have both died. The black man talking to Jacob (back) is a real curiosity. Like a whole big, very layered series: we're looking for more
