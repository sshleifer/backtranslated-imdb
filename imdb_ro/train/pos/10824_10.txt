"Still Crazy" is undoubtedly the greatest rock comedy of all time. It has been mistakenly compared to "This Is Spinal Tap," with which it has nothing to do with it. "Spinal Tap" is a satire (and, frankly, it is not a very good one, despite the "exit" of many rock cliques). Unlike Tap, "Still Crazy" is populated by great actors, great songs and human situations. Watch out for the people of "still crazy". This is all that matters. Oh, yeah, the music is pretty good, too, written by Mick Jones by Foreigner and Chris Difford of Squeeze. The Americans were already familiar with Stephen Rea (The Crying Game), but only later became acquainted with Bill Nighy (Underworld, Love Actually, Pirates of the Caribbean II) and Timothy Spall (Harry Potter Movies).
