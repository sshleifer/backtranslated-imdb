This is one of the most amazing stories I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> If this movie was directed by Larry Clark, then the story of a school would have been shown through the eyes of the killer and whichever would have led that person to go crazy first. Instead, the plot focuses mainly on the school's school and the way it has made the surviving victims. I once again saw Busy Phillips in other movies, but her performance in this movie is by far the best. The only other movie I've seen with Erika Christensen is "Swim Fan," which made me almost not to watch this movie, but it turned into a very good performance. the few movies I've seen have made me cry. Trust me when I tell you, it does not happen very often. The first room is a beautiful movie, and that's all it is ...
