Who would not want to go on the road with Peter Falk? The type of that type has a much larger character than most of today's actors. This is a kind of funny and exciting movie we all look for as a counterbalance for all the special effects bombs. Women will love it for all the romance tips for men, and men will love it for studying the character of his father / son - a wonderful scene after another. And it has quite a margin to be a true indie find. Obviously, this is a love work for Paul Reiser, who understands what it means to be a father and son, and to have both laughter and tears while you're moving alive. The most fun part, however, watched Reiser watch Falk. You could say that his character has come to a new appreciation of his father, as well as of another actor who truly enjoys the special craft of Peter Falk. Very charming. Let's hope this movie will do it in theaters around the country soon, so everyone will have the chance to laugh and cry with Paul Reiser and good people.
