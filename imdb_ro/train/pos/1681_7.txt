The "Scorpio Tail Case" has all the elements necessary to make an effective film. The story is the giallo standard. When a man dies in a plane crash, his wife (Ida Galli) collects a $ 1 million life insurance policy. The widow is heading for Greece for payment, but it follows a series of huge crimes. There are a lot of suspects, including a tenacious investigator (George Hilton) from the insurance agency and the widow's lover. Director Martino keeps the story moving at a fast pace while the spectator tries to guess the identity of the killer. Anita Strindberg (also memorable in "Your Vice is a closed room and only I have the key" and "Who has seen it?") He is an amazing heroine. It's one of Martino's best movies.
