Dramaturgist Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) had a series of flop after a huge hit. He gets a piece written by a student of his, Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve), who is fantastic. It's so good that Sidney says he'll kill for it. Will el? A thriller of a man of thought. It was originally a piece ... and it looks. It's more on a set and I'm still talking, but I never got bored. It's very well written, with a lot of overturning and a good casting working full force. The dog is just as wonderful as Bruhl - one of his great shows. Reeve is surprisingly very good. I did not think too much about him as an actor, but he is very good at this role. Dyan Cannon does wonders with a role as Bruhl's wife. Irene Worth is also good (and pretty funny) like Helga ten Drop, psychic. However, her focus has become on my nerves. Director Sidney Lumet is doing very well with his only set. The camera is always on the move and keeps your attention going. <br /> <br /> EXTREME SPOILER DEAD AHEAD !!!!! My only complaint is that two homosexual characters in this movie prove to be rampant sociopaths and also contains one of the most amazing kisses I have ever seen - but these are easy complaints. good thriller. Critics hate this movie (for some reason) and they seem to have completely disappeared since it premiered in 1982. That's too bad - it's better.
