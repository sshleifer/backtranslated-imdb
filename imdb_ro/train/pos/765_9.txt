I think when "Beat Street" made a national appearance, "Flashdance" came at the same time. The problem with "Flashdance" is that there was only a pause dance scene, and the rest was a jazz and ballet dance. This was one of the reasons why "Beat Street" was better. The only film that could compete with "Beat Street" seems to be "Footloose," because both films have focused on how dances were used by people to express their maximum feelings. "Beat Street" scenes come just before the middle and at the end of the filming. And I loved everyone. Almost all break tricks were presented in pause scenes: jackhammer, rockets, head rotation, suicide, crazy feet, mortal, flip forward, figure four --- almost everything. Like "The Warriors," "Street Beat" has violence linked to the life of the hip-hop gang ... but in a much less violent way than the former. The only major battle scene in "Street Beat" was when Ramff (who was abbreviated as "Ramo" in the movie) is being watched by a member of a rival gang in New York's subway tracks ..... fighting, and the third track and both death by electrocution on that rail. Well, although this scene of tracing ended tragically, it would be better for them to die in this way than to bleed blood from a firearm. Most of the tape stuff in the movie were graffiti related to hip-hop culture and rap music. A lot of rap music appeared in the movie because hip-hop members used rap music as a diversion to the negative aspects of gang life. Even the thematic song of the film, which closed the curtain to the film, was not just a tribute to hip-hop culture - but a homage to Ramon's death. By the way, during the dance scene called "Tango, Tango," I think the female drummer in the pit orchestra, led by actress Rae Dawn Chong, was Sheila E. making a cameo look.
