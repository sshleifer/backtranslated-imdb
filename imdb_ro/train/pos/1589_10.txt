I like this show. I look at all the rehearsals every day, even though I've seen them all 6 times each. There are two sisters, Holly (Amanda Bynes) and Val (Jennie Garth), who live in New York. Holly goes to live with Val when their father is transferred to Japan. Val has the perfect life, has a loved one and a perfect apartment from the top of the East. The show essentially shows all the problems that Vall and Holly live with. the main problem is boys, but it is also about being responsible for other life choices. Holly is 16 years old and is a totally free spirit, while Val is the opposite. She is organized must have a plan to do any kind of person. The other characters are Henry, Vince, Gary, Lauren and Tina.
