I remember earlier that I saw this on TV. I could not believe TVNZ left it! I should have it! A lot of humor will be lost on non-NZ'ers, but give it a go! <br /> <br /> Since the end of the Y series of the Y series, Matt and Chris have gone to bigger and better things (?). NZ's biggest cascade, Randy Campbell, has often appeared on the British Balls of Steel series. Yet, he continues to do all his waterfalls because he's too drunk. Already Voodoo has released 2 albums, Brown Sabbath and Back in Brown. The band is made up of members of Back of the Y and singles such as "I'd give one of my beers (but I only have 6)" and "You were not really born in the 80's." The South-By-Southwest film festival also included their feature film "Devil Made Me Do It", which will be released in early 2008 in NZ. , if you do not find these fun boys then you can only F% ^ K OFF!
