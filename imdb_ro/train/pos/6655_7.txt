It's one of the best Indian movies I've seen lately, instead of crappy songs and dancing or slut dog movies. All actors showed the right emotions at the right intensity with a good time. It is the distinctive sign of a good film that makes the spectator come back and study the subject, exactly what I did to check Harilal. I always like Akshay Khanna's subtle style and, interestingly, had a complicated relationship with his father, Vinod Khanna, though not as dramatic as Gandhis, and he wonders how he helped him sneak into this character. I was impressed by the direction and two fingers for Anil Kapoor for producing such a stylish movie.
