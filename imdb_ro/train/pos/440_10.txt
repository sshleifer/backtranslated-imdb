My favorite movie all the time. Oscars-working caliber by all involved, both in front and behind the room. The script is perfect and makes the relationship between Lady Caroline and George Briggs in a completely satisfactory way, unlike the novel. The concern with which the other main characters were drawn is a tribute to writer Peter Barnes, and the intense visual beauty should have won Oscars for director Mike Newell and Rex Maidment cinema. It's Josie Lawrence's best work, and he's turned my mind into Joan Plowright. Seeing this movie at least 50 times, I find no fault in it. The music by the famous composer Richard Rodney Bennet is a miracle.
