I was raised on Doc Savage and was stoned by green death as a child, but even then, as now, I found it funny. I made countless friends and colleagues watching this movie and I was very amused by the diversity of reactions, they realized that most of them think I'm weird, but you're there. "I do not know what Doc is, but he always gets girls" must be the supreme line when you look at his sad band of people. This movie is a classic spoof on all kinds of super heroes, and it was well before the hour, it should not be taken seriously, we cross Austin Powers. Ron Ely is a God. It is regrettable that this movie was not released on DVD in the UK. I do not think it should have been remodeled and bastardized, as I said it is a classic, it can not be done without Ron (like the Italian job without Mini and Michael Caine). I'll give it 10/10.
