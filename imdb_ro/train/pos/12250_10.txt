Kate Beckinsale steals the show! Bravo! Too bad the knight is not as good as Jeremy Northam. Mark Strong did a fabulous job. Bernard Hepton was perfect as Emmas father. I like the final stage (which is an addition to the novel, but well written) when the harvest is also Knightly dinner with her high society workers and friends. Emma must show she accepts this now. She is a changed woman. It's too much too fast, but OK. I will buy. Samantha Bond plays ex-governor and confident Emma. Is wonderful. as I would have imagined it. I think when Britain makes Jane Austen the best. American versions of English literature are made for money and not for quality. See this!
