Anyone who does not laugh through this movie has been embalmed. I've watched her at least twenty times and still have tears in my eyes in many scenes. Sally Field is absolutely perfect as Celest Talbert, a faded soap star, whose support is trying to replace it in the hope that its star will grow. The fields, at the age of 45, have that wonderful and beautiful pixie quality and a perfect figure who thinks they have three children. I'm biased, I'm in love with her. The distribution of "Soapdish" is full of stars that fulfill their roles to perfection. Kevin Kline is impeccable, like Robert Downey Jr., an ing√©nue Elizabeth Shue, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher in one of his early roles, Carrie Fisher as exaggerated casting director who hears an actor for a small part as a waiter without his shirt on. Kathy Najimy is awesome as the unfortunate costume designer and Cathy Moriarty's best nanny Nan who leads the plot to get Fields out of the show is hilarious. This film would have won Best Comedy Oscars, Best Featured Lady in a Comedy, Best Comedian and Countless Other Best, including Writing, Directing and Supporting Actors and Actresses. Get the DVD so you can watch it for the next twenty-five years. You will still laugh when the disc will come out.
