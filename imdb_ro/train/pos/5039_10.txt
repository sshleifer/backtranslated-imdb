Amazing. Absolutely amazing. This is a movie about two children whose father has a sudden vision. He claims an angel visits him and tells him he has to kill the "demons." He receives instructions later, and they begin to round down the demons, who are, with the naked eye, ordinary people. They kill these so-called demons with a head ax and cut them, burying them in the garden. Their father claims he can see their sins when he touches them. The movie continues, with a turn to the end. The thing I love about this movie is that it perfectly captures the fragility of human perception. Their father is completely upset? Or tell the truth? The public is left to decide. Go to make the judgment for you, and see the movie. Now.
