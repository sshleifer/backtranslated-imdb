This is My Bush is a live action project made by South Park, Trey Parker and Matt Stone creators. The show was canceled after a season, not because of bad reviews (in fact, they had good reviews), but because it was very expensive. is a pretty funny spoof of an average network sitcom. It is also a political satire. Now this is not as good as South Park, but it is a very funny sitcom spoof and also the guy playing in that bush I find it so much like him! If you can find the show, check it out. There is plenty of laughter to do! <br /> <br /> 9/10
