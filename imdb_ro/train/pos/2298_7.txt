I love the occult horror, and the great British Hammer Studios, who made one of their biggest movies with "The Devil Rides Out" (1968), proved to be more than capable in this horror field. This episode of Hammer's Hammer House of Horror (1980), "Guardian of the Abyss", is really a terrifying serial entry. Director Don Sharp, who had previously enriched Hammer's works with Kiss of the Vampire (1963) and Rasputin the Crazy Monk (1966) and directed two "Fu Machu" films with Christopher Lee, is undoubtedly the name of well-known among the directors of HHH, and he also offers here. Michael's Antique Store (Ray Lonnen) blends over a mysterious old glass. Glass glass happens to be the object of the worship of a devil who wants to use it for their satanic rituals. When a beautiful young woman named Allison (Rosalyn Landor) who is about to be sacrificed for worship, Michael comes into deep trouble with the cult and their sinister leader (John Carson) ... Although this is not one of my absolute episodes preferred by the "Hammer House of Horror" (best of all is the seventh episode, "The Silent Scream"), is very creepy and atmospheric. The land has many interesting breaths, remaining suspense and unusual throughout the movie. Ray Lonnen is a good ruler, the young Rosalyin Landor is convincing as the innocent beauty, and John Carson is really creepy as a leader of Satanism. On the whole, "Guardian of Abyss" is another exciting and creepy story of HHH, and our colleagues Hammer should not miss.
