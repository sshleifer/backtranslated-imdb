Spoiler for anyone lucky enough to see this movie (so not even a spoiler). He saw this movie when he was released and can still remember some of it. Everything is seated in a small western town or what's left of that city. It looks more like a ghost town with few inhabitants. Among them a couple, if the wife is particularly bad. She lets her man die at the end of the movie and leaves the city, but she has to cross the desert. We never know what's going on with her before, but before she leaves, the man she's dying pulls after her and deliberately does not hit her instead of water. She does not know she will soon be thirsty. Mark Damon kills two bad guys in a funny mansion - but that's another story I do not remember very well. The rest of the film's impression was that it was one of the first moments when I saw a really bad woman on the film, who pretends to be just bad - it can not be compared to the Snowwhite witch, who, compared to learned. Very tight vest with some main characters and still absorbed.
