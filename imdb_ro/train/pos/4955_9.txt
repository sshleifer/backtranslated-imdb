I do not know why people always want a deeper sense in movies or something else they find worthless. How about just having fun? Something Morgan Freeman excels on. She has a chance to look a little. Paz Vega, his co-star, has a career boost and Brad Silberling gets a name to attract people to watch the movie. I thought it was a good movie. Some humor, some pathetic, some bitter, but nothing over the top. I received a special shot from Jim Parsons as a receptionist at a construction company. When he looks at Freeman worshiper and says, "You make me want to be a woman." It's just hilarious. The battle scene between Mrs. Vega, her ex-husband and girlfriend, is also great. In short, it's a cute and charming movie that will make you smile. You could do much, much worse.
