I did not expect too much for this movie. I was given a ticket for an advanced examination. I just left work. It was hot and I was tired. I had to wait on the film for 40 minutes and it did not seem to be cool air flowing through the hallways of the theater complex. Once in the theater, tired and frustrated, the film started, I did not recognize any of the actors at first, but the flow of the film was perfect. Right from the beginning I became consumed with the movie, more and more enthusiastic every minute. I think this movie is meant to be a classic fantasy / fairy tale. The actors were fabulous, the rhythm was perfect, and the end was magic.
