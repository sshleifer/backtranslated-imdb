A good movie and one that I will watch several times. Riches (the previous commentator) are right: much more happens than is clear from the title tables and I have to wonder how much he has suffered in translation. There were more in the original? Or was a mother tongue audience expecting to miss - read more? Or - since the script was written by the author of the novel on which it was based - was a popular story with which the audience was already very familiar? In short, it deserves a look, but probably requires more work from contemporary viewers than the original audience of 1913 had to put it into play. The Alpha Video version presents the score of the new organ, but music is in no way fitting to historical progress. Sure, it begins with promising, but degenerates into a repetitive monotony, similar to Phillip's, which does not reflect anything on the screen. After listening for a while, we stopped the sound and simply watched: much better!
