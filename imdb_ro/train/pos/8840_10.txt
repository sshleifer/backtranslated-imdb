Watching the devil is one of the best experiences of my cinema. I was intrigued by the mixed film response - and for me the extremes of opinion indicate that the film has reached something that has been embraced or disappointed by the general public. It is one of those films that has stayed with me, and I continue to reflect and think about it. Surely the DVD would light up more themes and movie items? These include: Sidney Lumet's film of reverberation, the story-changing technique, the superb combination of Lumet and Masterson, and why it works so well, the direction of the master, Hollywood films with relatively low focus give the characters male and largely condemned the struggle to become an open book for their women, the underestimated but still resonant performance of Marisa Tome and, of course, the gorgeous Hoffman with the central monologue about the sum of its parts - for me the heart of the film. <br /> <br /> Pai! Definitely a master movie. So imagine my disappointment watching the anticipated DVD - just to find no comment, no scenario, no interview, no extra. Hey - distributors - sort!
