My choice for the biggest film ever used was Laughton's "Night of the Hunter", which remains superb in my canon. But maybe it was replaced by the "Duh", the most artistic Daoist movie I've ever seen. How care for others is water flow and how water can be inspired, and comfort, cleaning, and so on. is the essence of the Dao. It is possible to argue that the NOFTH and shower themes are similar and that Lillian Gish in the first is the purest form of Christianity because the bath operators are the purest form of Taoism. I would not dispute in any way such an interpretation. Both films are visual joy in the integration of the idea and the image. However, the shower presents such an unmistakable vision of the sacredness of the everyday life that they give guidance. I respect you so much.
