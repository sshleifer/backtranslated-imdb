In this glorious story about a weekend divided among the best in literature. Mary and Percy Shelly, Lord Byron and others created an entourage. Displaying their searches for sexual enlightenment. Personal liberties from politics to morality. Use of liberal drugs for both incentives and addiction. Their creative opinions about life and writing. Describing without bothering the viewer the way each writer tries to find his muse. Along with distractions and affections each action. With wonderful landscapes that do not destroy, but greatly increase the story. Characters well created from death to love then angry at peace. With some of the most wonderful and scenery increasing the costuming to be had.
