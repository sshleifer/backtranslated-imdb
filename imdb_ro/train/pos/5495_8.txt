One of the best documentaries released in recent years. Some points ... 1. Hugo Chavez was elected President of Venezuela in 1998, his support coming largely from the poorer regions of Venezuela. <br /> <br /> 2. In 2002, a coup hit Chavez. At that time, Irish filming Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain were in Caracas, filming a documentary about Chavez for British television. Their film deconstructs the coup and its consequences and electrified the history of the scene, outside and inside the presidential palace. Chavez sought to free Venezuela from US-imposed free market policies. Although Venezuela's oil was already state, it was driven for the private benefit of executives Chavez wanted to replace. Despite being the fourth largest oil supplier in the world, Venezuela remains buried in poverty, its resources being sucked by foreign multinational corporations. The documentary begins with the portrayal of Chavez's first year as president before the coup. It focuses on its popularity with the poor and its various policies that have proven to be popular with locals in the working class (educational plans, distribution of oil revenues, democracy, etc.). Chavez was a great supporter of education and printed thousands of copies of the Venezuelan constitution, encouraging children and adults to study and understand. When Chavez came to power, he immediately pledged to redistribute oil profits. This, of course, has made the oil companies nervous. <br /> <br /> 8. A media war broke out. The six private television stations have immediately begun to oppose state television. They questioned the motives, health, and sexual orientation of Chavez. <br /> <br /> 9. Without the support of the media, the coup would not have been successful. The film clarifies that racing relies heavily on mass media to disseminate information and that news can easily be produced. 10. In the form of "restoring democracy", the opposition silenced the state-run television station, dissolved the National Electoral Council, the Supreme Court, the National Assembly, and took control of the army. <br /> <br /> 11. Banished interests, supported by the military elite (encouraged by the US and the CIA), held a march of the citizens in the presidential palace to make the coup d'état. The fighters shot Chávez's supporters, but the private television stations edited images, so it turned out that the return fire was destined for the opposition march that had, in fact, been deflected safely. <br /> <br /> 12. The police continued a street hit against Chavez's supporters, still blossoming on the streets. <br /> <br /> 13. Chavez, held captive, refused to resign. Of course, the media / government then lied, saying they resigned, but members of Chavez's cabinet have communicated the truth to the international community, which eventually received the message in Venezuela via cable TV. People got up, pushing the return of the president they chose, which only a referendum could replace constitutionally. 8.9 / 10 - At just over an hour this document is too short. However, it is an appealing piece of journalism and deals with a form of "media war", which is rarely reached. He makes a piece of company accompanied by the "Battle of Alger". <br /> <br /> It's worth watching.
