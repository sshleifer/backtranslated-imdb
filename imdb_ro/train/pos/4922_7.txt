I wonder what advertising happened when they first looked at Walter Jack Palance (Blackie). He certainly does not look like nobody else, that cranial face, flattened nose and elongated body - even now he remains an unhappy presence. And what might be more appropriate than his appearance in those New Orleans hangovers that seem terrifying like the plague that Blackie loses in the city. I'm sorry he did not have more scenes. The movie itself is very assembled ??? black humor of death, Widmark-Douglas interaction, non-touristic locations, battles between officials, all are woven into a thriller full of realism, with a different threat to each other. Even Widmark's domestic scenes, which put a woman (Bel Geddes) on the mark, do not manage to be too disturbing. Director Kazan is certainly demonstrating his ability to help a studio product (Fox), no matter how he would have felt about the commercial aspect. Widmark has a solid job as a public health officer. But my money is the only Zero Mostel. There has ever been a sweat interpreter who could have played louder or pushed more than the fallen man (eg The Enforcer, 1950). That scene with Mostel, where Palance argues with Shrewish's wife Mostel (Liswood), is a frenzy subordinate jewel like Mostel trying to pacify each one as pinball berserk. It's a shame he lost so many years on the blacklist. (I wonder if it was the Kazan who called it.) But not just the professionals who add color. Locals add both character and authenticity, especially the two Asian guys interviewed by police. The whole scene has an improvised air, as if Kazan recognized his potential and made a small scene on the spot. And then, that colorful rental room with all the decks on the deck is a pure inspiration. And how about those cafes with cats that run to go to the nearest Denny. In any case, the movie is still a well-presented and ripped thriller with an apocalyptic air that strangely prefigures many of today's -hits mega.
