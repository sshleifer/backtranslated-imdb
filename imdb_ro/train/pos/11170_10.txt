There is something about Pet Sematary that I have never felt anywhere else. Perhaps the fact that I was a child when I looked for the first time made this experience so memorable. But as they always follow him, he does not get old and I never get bored. From the opening credits with that creepy opening song to the very chaotic end, there is something crazy, sad and scary at the same time, which continues to ring in the head: sometimes dead is better! <br /> <br /> I do not think it would be useful to tell the whole story again. All you need to know is that it starts from point A (the most perfect situation for a happy American family) and step by step in point B (that is, believe me, the end of all joy). Music is perfect, the story makes sense, the special effects are cool, and the Pet Semanar is the last place I would be. As I said, sometimes dead is better!
