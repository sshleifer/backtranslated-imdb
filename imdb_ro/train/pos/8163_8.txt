Corbin Bernsen offers a tremendously intense and riveting performance like Dr Alan Feinstone, a wealthy and successful Beverly Hills dentist who is obsessed with perfection. When he finds out that his marvelous wife of the doll blonde is calling her and that the IRS is starting to hunt him about tax issues, Feinstone crashes under pressure and goes violently around the curve. Director Brian Yuzna, working from a dark, witty and dementia scenario by Stuart Gordon, Dennis Paoli and Charles Finch, exposes neurotic and psychosis clogged under the clean and well manicured surface of rich rich Americans with delightful joy. Moreover, Yuzna continues to breathe with a feeling of twinkle of black, yellow color. Bernsen shines positively like Dr. Feinstone; he completely projects a truly uncluttered kiss that is just beneath Feinstone's feasible and pleasant feat. Also, Linda Hoffman, innocent, Brooke, Earl Boen, IRS agent, Marly Goldblum, Molly Hagan, as assistant fetish, Jessica, Patty Toy, assistant Karen, Jan Hoag, Virginya Keehne, teenage girl Sarah, Ken Foree, Detective Gibbs, Tony Noakes, Gibbs's partner, Sunshine Detective Michael Stadvec as a swimming pool cleaner, Matt and Mark Ruffalo, Landers. The first f / x make-up is as full of gory, brutal and upsetting as it should be. The polished cinema of Levie Isaaks boasts a lot of angles of the sloping room and some wonderful zoom-ins. Alan Howarth's brilliant score also hits the spot with crawling. A pleasant fun life.
