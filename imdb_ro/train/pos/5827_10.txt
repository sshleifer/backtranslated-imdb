This three-stooges hit is on par with my other favorite "Disorder in Court". This is a laughing laugh for any of the fans at Three Stooges who can enjoy it. Boys are porters at a recording studio when they hear the wonderful Christine McIntyre sing a wonderful version of "Voices of Spring". A record business will be offered, but she is shaken to be honest with her father about her career choice and to prove herself a true singer. When she and the others leave the studio, the stoogies decide to have some fun and sing their recording and dress Curly as Christine. The contract lady, who can make Christine's career, sees Curly and mistakes her for Christine and invites Curly to sing for her party. Of course, there is a man who has upset at the party and destroys his solo in front of the crowd, so he will find a way to return to them. not to be missed! <br /> <br />
