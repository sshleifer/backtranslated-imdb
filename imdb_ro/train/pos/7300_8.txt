Like the good giants who make up the second half of the title of this film, Michael Oblowitz's production is graceful but slow and cumbersome. The last manufacturer's output, "Mosquitoman-3D," had the same problem. It's hard to imagine a boring shark movie, but they did somehow. The only draw for Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy was animatronix, which is always fun when dealing with the wonderful worlds beneath the ocean surface. But even that was acceptable. Poor concentration in some scenes made production seem amateur. With dolphins and whales, technology is totally lost. Brilliant scenes and too many scenes from the film's gigantic scenes do nothing to take advantage of the stunning 3D capabilities of IMAX. There are too few scenes of any depth or variety. The closings of these wonderful creatures were flat and there is often only one creature in the room, so there is no deep contrast. Michael Oblowitz tries to follow his father's steps, but when you have Shark-Week on the cable, the introspective and boring treatment of his subjects is a constant disappointment.
