This was actually my favorite Scooby Doo series when I was younger. I thought each episode had more edge, and criminals had a lot of creative thinking in them (and even very scary and credible). Some of the best episodes were "I left my throat in San Francisco," "Twenty thousand choices under the sea," "Ghoul, the boy and the ugly," and "When you want a star creature." If you have never seen these episodes, please do. This series was a bit of a mixed bag, though as there were other episodes that do not seem to have the same edge for them as "Rocky Mountain YIIII!" and "Redemption of Scooby's Chief." Like the series before her, she was very well set together, an exciting and extraordinary story. As everyone says, it would have been much better without Scrappy Doo. The character was tiring and distracting attention to the story that was told.
