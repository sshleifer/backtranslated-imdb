After watching "Beat" at the AFM distributor's examination last night, I must say I was impressed. The audience laughed all the way. Unfortunately, every territory has already been sold, so I did not have the opportunity to buy the movie, but I really think it will be a great success both domestically and overseas. I agree with the comment that "Whipped" should not be divorced as a male gender and sex, mainly because, unlike "Sex and the City," "Whipped" is a satire about meetings that do not never take seriously. "Whipped" has fun in relationships in a way that most sexual comedies would not dare. Also, the movie I visited at the AFM had more of a plot and story than "Swingers", "Clerks" and "Sex and the City" combined. "Whipped" never slowed down for a fight and offered the audience a nonstop comedy. Amanda Peet's performances and the rest of the cast were all solid, making the film more impressive than the budget.
