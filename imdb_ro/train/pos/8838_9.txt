Finally, a movie in which the audience is held guessing what's going to happen. Well, we all know that the lives of the brothers, Andy (played by Hoffman) and Hank (played by Hawke) will break down to destruction, from where else should go but down, but we do not know how or when until the end of the movie. Hoffman is gorgeous, as usual, and even Hawke was decent as the younger brother who practically does what he is told, since he can not think for himself. Hawke might have been a bit of his element, but he played pretty well. Add in this mix Andy's wife, perfectly played by Marisa Tomei, cheating on Hank; Dismantling Andy's company funds to pay for drug and gender dependence; and a father who eventually discovers exactly what happened on the day of the robbery. This movie will think about you.
