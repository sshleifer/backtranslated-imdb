I will come clean. The only reason I even found out about this DVD was that Dominic Monaghan is my favorite actor. When I heard the title of the movie, I thought it would be ... different, maybe not in such a good way. But I was wrong. After reading some reviews about this short, I was very pleased to see this. I sent for my copy as soon as possible and I received it a few weeks later. Needless to say, I was not disappointed. The film follows Jack, an insomnia that is often affected by conditions that cause them to doubt what is reality and which is still in his head. I will not give up what happens, but I will tell you that the movie can sometimes be frightening in its realism. The direction is fantastic, focusing on what is essential to the story without allowing it to lose any entertainment or challenging moments of thought. Generally, I give this wonderful movie 9 out of 10, because I was going a long way over what I thought any short could achieve.
