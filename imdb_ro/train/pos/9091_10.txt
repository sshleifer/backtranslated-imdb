A fabulous movie. With everything you might want in a movie. Huge battle scenes and a lot of other actions. Suspans and a romantic love story. <br /> <br /> A kind of old swashbuckler movie. Completely fun from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Editing was fast and you never get bored for a second. The story is like a classic story of trouble in the royal household. The actors are beautiful and the sets are magnificent. The costumes are spectacular, and stunt work is imaginative. The special effects are also amazing. Gary Stretch is really impressive as an actor and wonderful to look. Looks like a sure bet for Super Stardom. <br /> <br /> John Rhys-Davies is great as usual. He is one of the great actors of our time. And Cindy Burbridge, Ex Miss Thailand is excellent and perfect for the leading lady, even making an English accent with remarkable success. <br /> <br /> I learned that the movie won many awards, and I can see why. Everything is an amazing, independent film. See him for sure. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend. And give it a TEN + !!!
