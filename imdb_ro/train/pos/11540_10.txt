This is the work of Neil Simon, who received a lot of praise! The "weird couple" is a kind of jewel that lies inside. You have Felix Ungar (Jack Lemmon); a strange stranger and a big thorn in the part of his roommate, Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau); a total of slob. These men have a good job. Felix is ​​a news writer, and Oscar is a sports writer. Both men are divorced, Felix's wife is nearby, while the Oscar is on the other side of the US (West Coast). What to say? Two men living together in one roof without leading each other crazy is impossible and unlikely. It's a lot of laughs and a lot of fun. I liked the side where the two British neighbors who spoke with both gentlemen and after Oscar gave Felix luck and lives with them when he refused to take dinner with them the night before. It is time for Felix to get relieved. I think all the lucky lucky ones have understood. They can be agitated, yet they should also be patient. A very funny movie and a classic nuevo. Neil Simon "The odd couple" is a classic movie. 5 STEPS!
