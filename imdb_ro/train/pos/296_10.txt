Sublimity is the way we have to get to The Beauty. And sublimity is the thing that makes up this movie. If not the best, it's the most beloved movie in all Bogdanovich movies. This unique masterpiece reminds us, like most of the director's other films, what life is (or should be) about: love, lost (or failure) and hope and faith and charity. The song from which the film is titled (Gershwin's well-known composition), the film makes it impossible and tries to make us realize that no one can judge anyone; all these with the ease of a comedy and a good direction (the first ten minutes, with the detectives watching the ladies, almost without a dialogue line, built according to the appearance and views of the characters - with the fact that "Bogdanovici touch" based on the point of view - is a class on Cinema Language, something that PB has taught well from its directors admiring the movie's golden age). With a gorgeous melody and a glorious soundtrack (including the best of Sinatra's "Trilogy"), this film, full of self-consciousness and compassion and away from self-indulgence and emptiness (as some critics have written) a better place on the history of American cinema than if they were placed. It is not "long in style, short on substance": it is complex in its simplicity, and beautiful, absolutely beautiful.
