There are many reasons to watch this movie: to see the reality whipping Latin America in terms of kidnapping, police corruption at the continental level, among so many realities that the Latins live. <br /> <br /> Denzel Wahington's performance was brilliant, this guy continues to be an excellent actor and continues like that. Dakota Fanning, just 10 years old, has become an excellent actress and congratulates her. The rest of the movie was wonderful, I have it in my collection. <br /> <br /> I hope that these have happened to Hollywood makers to make a full movie in Venezuela, where they show us our better reality in terms of delinquency, drug trafficking or political issues. There have been few films that sing the Venezuelan land (for example: Aracnophobia, Jungle 2 Jungle, Dragonfly), should do more, as well as in Mexico. The song "One Mirada" I hope it leaves in the soundtrack, it is excellent. My vote is 10/10
