I really enjoyed the meeting! I would have rated a 10 if he had "Hassie" and "Little Luke". It was not even mentioned where I am today or why I did not attend the meeting. They were very popular, and I think it was a mistake not to give an explanation for their lack of appearance. Anyway, I was glad that TNN ran the series again! I've been looking for episodes for years and what a joy I've been able to record the whole series (maybe I missed some episodes). Jenny Hanahan
