I just saw this movie for the first time and I liked it. Her dance was very fun. I read somewhere that she took part in this movie because she knew how to dance. The scenery was great. Yvonne is such a talented and beautiful woman. We laughed at the scenes of silly kisses, but that's what's great about old movies! I grew up with her at The Munsters and I enjoy watching her in her previous films. They may not be the best, but deserve to be careful to see their act and sing. I slowly buy all the movies and watch them as they get them. I have a great collection of memories.
