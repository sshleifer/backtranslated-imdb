Quickly and simply, I love this movie. As others have said, I'm not from the south, I'm not interested in country music, and I never wore a cowboy hat. (I never drove in a car with a dead body in my trunk, but I like "Goodfellas"). Shot in a 2.35 aspect ratio and transferred nicely to DVD. (VHS was 1.33 on full screen). And yes, a 5.1 solid mix for your viewing pleasure. What can you say about this movie? It's just a great love / hate story in Texas with extraordinary performance. Travolta is fantastic. Along with Pulp Fiction, it's the best thing he did. It was in my first 5 years 25 years! <br /> <br /> Check it out! It's a 10 !!!!
