Being faithful to the work of Pearl S. Buck, whose years spent in China as parents of missionary parents who gave him a profound insight into Chinese culture and his philosophy, this adaptation of the film is done with glamor, both from both technically and technically. /> <br /> Wang Lung is a humble farmer grateful for the basic notions of life: to survive his land and to marry recently with Olan, a servant of a rich and powerful family village. In spite of Wang Lung and Olan's best efforts to farm the land, raise children and build economies and riches, a famine threatens to destroy everything they have done. The choice not to sell their land, a traditional Asian faith, instead travels to a major city to wait for famine. While in town, they are reduced to begging and being just one of hundreds of other unhappy homeless families. Although not a looter, Olan is trapped in a lot of looting at the home of a rich man. It has been rounded for execution by the army, but it is saved at the last minute. Her luck is to find valuable jewelery at the place of robbery that gives her family and family the opportunity to return to their farm to start again. New wealth turns into Wung Lung. He becomes selfish, selfish and takes credit for discovery. He becomes a very wealthy farmer, but this makes things worse as it becomes more and more unappreciated, arrogant and difficult to explain. He loses touch with the basic things in life that money can not buy: loyalty, commitment, trust, fairness and honesty. As a punishment, nature returns again to Wang Lung, sending an acacia plague to destroy everything he has. Knee-high, Wang Lung focuses on all friends, ex-friends, workers, and family. However, he manages to save the farm. From this experience, he again returns to humility and appreciation for the basic elements of life.
