I liked the film, first of all because she told an interesting story, but the story as it was said in the movie felt it was condensed from a much longer story. Because the book is over 400 pages, this makes sense. It stretches over a period of time from the 1920s to the 1970s, in a fictitious country in South America, also very much to fit within the available time. I think it would have been much better than a mini-series of six hours than it turned out to be a 140-minute movie. Even if it is rushed, the story does not go so much that it gets confused. What we are told is pretty well said. An error is that Clara's supernatural powers appear inconsistently; either it should have appeared more evenly during the movie or should have been left out. Two more mistakes (which may be the spoilers): Esteban's eventual return to kindness happens somewhat too suddenly, and Ferula's curse seems to stop even if the tone of the story suggests that she should endure forever. <br /> <br /> The actor is great. Glenn Close, as the young Spurster Ferula, is remarkable. Jeremy Irons, as a rich self-brutalized man, is also excellent. Meryl Streep, as her main character Clara, is great, though she is often even better than she in this movie. There have been many better executed roles. The biggest guilt is that the film did not seem to have a dialect coach; each actor seemed to speak in another kind of accent.
