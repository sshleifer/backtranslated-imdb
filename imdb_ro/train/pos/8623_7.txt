DER TODESKING is not one of my favorite films Jorg Buttgereit - but it's still an interesting movie about suicide and motives and ramifications. Those looking for a gore-fest or NEKROMANTIK or SCHRAMM-style movie will probably be disappointed. DER TODESKING is definitely an art-house movie, so those who need linear and explanatory narratives do not have to apply ... The basic concept of DER TODESKING is that there is an "episode" for each day of the week that revolves around a strange chain letter that apparently causes people to commit suicide, interjected with scenes from a slowly decaying corpse ... There are some very well-made and challenging scenes, including the man who was talking about "the problems "with his wife and the concert massacre (which, unfortunately, lost some of my" power "because I was too busy laughing at SCORPIONS on stage ...). But seriously - this is sometimes beautiful (the scene showing different angles of that giant bridge is particularly effective - especially if you understand the significance of the scene and that the names shown are people who actually committed suicide by jumping off the bridge. .) sometimes confusing, sometimes stupid (sometimes funny), sometimes disturbing (I found the scene of the guy who talks with the girl in the park about her extraordinarily effective wife) movie that is more of an "experience "than entertainment, because many of these" artistic "movies are meant to be. However, we did not find DER TODESKING as strong as NEKROMANTIK or SCHRAMM and would probably have put it in a relatively uniform position with NEKROMANTIK 2 in terms of my level of personal "joy". It's definitely worth looking at any fan of Buttgereit or "art." If you dig this kind of movie - check out SUBCONSULT CRUELIA - in my opinion, the best art / horror movie I've ever seen. 7/10 for DER TODESKING
