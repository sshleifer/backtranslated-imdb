It's a great movie. Sign that some people think this can not be based on a true story. No matter what, the movie is great and all she can think about is not why a balloon with a mermaid ends up flying in the siren city and so on, thinking that "a girl's desire is fulfilled," and that means all the dreams our peaceful will be fulfilled if we trust in us and will do everything in this world to make them true. The girl (Although - in the movie) and her mother were the best actors I've seen for a long time. Good for them, for all the actors, all for the director. If anyone can say so, please tell them: "A 25-year-old guy from Romania thanks you for making this movie."
