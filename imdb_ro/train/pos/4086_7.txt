Wow. Uhm ... well ... wow! I think I'm going to start with the plot. An engaged woman (Lucy) reaches her family home, she is the husband (Mathurin) in France, where she awaits the arrival of her bishop or cardinal or a person in the Catholic Church to marry them (to satisfy a will.) Waiting for the young Lucy learns about a legend of a Beast who has traveled with motives centuries ago, and in bed that night, she begins to fancy about the Beast and about her encounter of rape with the ex-lady of the house. The land is really quite thin (and it seems to be shooting long in the middle of the film), but the director rewards (?) Those who come out with a shocking and hilarious end. is not for everyone.If you are looking for an excellent cinema, look elsewhere.If you are looking for an extraordinary movie about bestiality (which almost takes a sympathetic look on the subject his / her film is for you! (If you have a poor stomach, do not be afraid of this. Apart from a horse-on-horse action at first, the "facts" are pretty cartoon, IMO)
