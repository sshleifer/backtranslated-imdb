This is a great movie. The non-stop patron needs more visions to fully appreciate. Busby Berkeley's musical productions will never be duplicated. I think that this film easily surpasses all its efforts. Joan Blondell and James Cagney are incredible together. Some of the humor would almost push the edges of today's films. Explain the rational explanation of how they did it and enjoy the show in which it is.
