I just got it at the Toronto International Film Festival. This is a good story, in a convincing way. The hand-room approach with action scenes adds to the intensity of these scenes (in a documentary style, not Blair Witch style). Joel Schumacher says he does not need a big budget to produce an exciting film. The actors were strong, especially the actor dealing with the film's events, Boz.
