Another reason to watch this delightful movie is Florence Rice. Florence who? This was my first response because the opening credits came out on the screen. I soon found out who was Florence Rice, a true beauty that turns into a wonderful, wonderful work. As everyone does in this whole piece. Since 1939, it is a different moment, but there is the charm in it. It takes you to another world. It starts like a light comedy, but then it becomes very serious. Florence Rice runs range from comedy to heroine. She is absolutely delightful, at the same time strong, vulnerable, evolving from a girl to a woman. See her facial expressions at the end of the movie. He made over forty films and I'll search for the other thirty-nine. Alan Marshal is Flynn / Gable type and proves a perfect fit for Florence. Buddy Ebsen and Una Merkel offer some comic moments, but the real star is Florence Rice. Fans of movies from the 1930s, do not miss this!
