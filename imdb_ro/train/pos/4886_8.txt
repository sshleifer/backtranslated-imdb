The last blonde bomber is a bit of entertainment. Judy Dench performs the role of Elizabeth, a new widow woman in free spikes. She spent most of her life being her wife and mother, but she was never really happy. Shortly after her husband's funeral, Elizabeth has a regular encounter with her kids when she paints a street performer. This sparks memories when he was a member of a swing band of all the girls in London during the Second World War. Soon, we learn that the band was not exactly a girl, because the drummer was a man who dressed like a woman named Some Like It Hot. Elizabeth takes her sax (she secretly practiced her entire marriage) and joins forces with the street musician who plays the guitar. Elizabeth is more talented than the guitarist and the money starts to run. She does not take money, she's rich and does not need her. Elizabeth is seen one day by Patrick (Ian Holm), who was the dear drummer of the band. It seems that Patrick was - and still is - quite a woman, and Elizabeth - being only fifteen at that time - was the only member of the band who had not experienced Patrick's "talents" other than drums. > Elizabeth is inspired by her granddaughter to resume the old band again to play for her grandmother's school dance. That's how it begins with a delightful journey in the memory band combined with aspects of a movie full of humorous walks - all in the top with some very good swings and blues. I think I'm at the age when I really like bigger actresses doing their things, and this movie is a treasure because it not only calls Judi Dench, it is also supported by the Dukakis Olympics, Leslie Caron and a series of British character actresses. This is entirely overwhelmed by Cleo Laine's extraordinary voice. Yeah, it's fluffy but totally delightful and extremely fun puff.
