Kristine Watts (Molie's weeks) is destroyed, missing her lover; she is unable to overcome her love for him lost in the past. He hires a stranger (Douglas Davis) and gives a list of his mistakes with things to fix. But time is irreversible and sometimes healing pain is a tragic end. The first point that impresses in "The Cure" is the stylish cinema that alternates black and white with color. The concise and sharp script is able to develop a tragic and bleak story of love with an unexpected plot point at its end in less than eight minutes. The soundtrack is beautiful, but the volume is a little loud and associated with the fact that English is not my mother tongue, at some point I had to repeat a few words whispered by the narrator. The unknown lead actress has a magnificent performance and is extremely gorgeous. I hope to have a chance to see her again on the screen. Last but not least, the debut of director and writer Ryan Jafri was not better. My vote is new. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
