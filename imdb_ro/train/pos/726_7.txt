High School Vince Lombardi has a new director - bad Mrs. Togar (Mary Woronov). She intends to ban rock and roll music together. He beats his head with Riff Randall (P.J. Soles) who loves Ramones. Also, the head of the school's football team (Vincent Van Patten) does not seem to connect with any girl - he does not realize that cute Kate Rambeau (Dey Young) is in love with him. A midnight night movie. This was put into general release and almost immediately bombed - but as a midnight movie was a huge hit and continued to play everything in the 1980s. I remember participating in more than a few of them when we were in college - it was like a party! People sang along with the songs, laughing scary at every joke and generally just having fun. Seeing him now as an adult, I can not imagine why I liked it so much. The script is juvenile and full of groans that I did not realize I heard. Characters change at random, and the movie goes everywhere. What saves these are really funny lines and wonderful shows by Soles and Woronov (who really feel). Also, everyone is full of energy and plays their roles on the road (as they should). As for Ramones ... I've never been a fan. I like the title song, but the rest of the songs have never caught me. If you are a fan of Ramones you could give a higher rating. <br /> <br /> SPOILER WARNING !!!! This is mainly for children (it has a PG rating) that will probably find it silly but fun. In particular, I think they will like the end when the high school is thrown into the air! SPOILER END !!!! <br /> <br /> So if you're in the mood of a midnight movie in the 1980s, you might like that. Otherwise, stay away. I give her a 7.
