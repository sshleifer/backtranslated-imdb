This excellent drama has always been in suspense me. I could not take my eyes off the screen for a second, because each word continued to connect them to this amazing crime. This movie really touched me because it showed how sad and hard it can be for life. I even cried in the end (which I do not want to give it!) I also realized that cruel and sick people can be when it comes to murder. <br /> <br /> The distribution was also very good. The only negative member was the actress who played Anne Marie. The actress did a good job, but the director did not. I say this because she found someone who did not even look a little like Anne Marie Fahey.
