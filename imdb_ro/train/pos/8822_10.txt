The splendid film, which in just eight minutes presents an unusual mix of genre: mystery, thriller, musical. In short, we are allowed to tell about the story: a girl enters a European Cafeteria and then ... Easy transmission from the nonsense mystery to narrative logic. In the shortest time, no Vigalondo place has managed to enjoy the B / W through imagination and despite the (most) strict budgets. Because of the space-time unit, the film reaches the intensity of a short poem (almost a haiku). Spain, land of fast poetry in B / W (remember Bu√±uel early?). We have to see to make our faith in young cinemas outside the States quiet.
