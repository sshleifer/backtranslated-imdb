I have to give the creative team behind these American Pie films. "Direct To DVD" is usually synonymous with cheap, incompetent film. However, last year I was pleasantly surprised when I found myself deeply enjoying the sequel DVD "The Naked Mile". Those who made the film took the opportunity to offer a small but funny film. This year, they offer the tracking offer, "Beta House". That's the honest truth, "Casa Beta" makes the first few films "American Pie" to look like "Little Mermaid". This is not a lively fun, no taste and laughter. Sure, the story is a bit thin, but that's the beauty of the whole thing. In the first 10 minutes, we are presented to all the main characters, the new support characters, take a handful of spit goggles, meet the villains and set the general plot line. However, the film becomes an unlimited journey. Gags are a lot and they did not stop here. I'm talking about male sperm, urine, dildos, chicken, sheep sex, female orgasm sprays and more. Not to mention that no tortoise or sex scene passes. Returning from "The Naked Mile" are John White, Jake Siegel, Steve Talley and Eugene Levy as support for the last few films). The whole castaway has a good job. Steve Talley (Dwight Stifler), in particular, has great energy and screen presence. I foresee good things for him. The film is also loaded with excellent film references for those who keep their eyes open. The biggest laugh of the film for me was the "The Deerhunter" parody. Classic. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is, if you are a fan of the show, you will feel like home with the Beta House. It really pushes the limits of good taste, but in the end it is quite funny.
