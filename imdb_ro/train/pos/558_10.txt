Classic western drama / action with incredible cinema, which is long before its time (1954). The production is very good and you can say it was made with pride and love. The only pioneer of the American pioneers NORTHT WEST is very educating and entertaining. This film is very poorly rated because most people do not like to see the reality that many "lawyers" during this time and place were very tight / corrupt, like most developing countries today. Action sequences could have been more realistic, but this film really covers most of the essentials. Not for an audience that just wants pure testoterone westerns guy for this movie is more for those who have a sense of history and philosophy .......
