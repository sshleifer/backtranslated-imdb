This documentary was very detailed and expose, and at the same time funny, what I thought was quite impressive. I felt like I did a very good job covering the sport from its origins so far, but there is a reason why I do not give such a great score to this film ... <br / > <br /> I felt that the story sometimes focused too much on the actual "nouns" of sport, so to speak: too much about the individual locations to navigate and especially too much about individual surfers. I felt that the documentary had more to do with the nature of sport, the ideology of sport, etc. it would have been better (although this was well covered, I do not think it was as long as it was justified). <br /> <br /> And for many people who are not absolutely nuts on surfing, sometimes the hearing goes on and about specific locations and specific surfers could become boring. While video and in-depth research are well respected, it could have been presented in a way that would be better for those who are not avid surfers. In addition, my biggest disappointment was when they talked about how amazing and miraculous certain events in the history of surfing were, however, they did not have the real records of these events unfolded and you always expect to see on the silver screen this amazing, men talk about moments of change of life and, ultimately, everything you get is a lot of people who talk about it, not real material. I was too tantalizing to hear these stories and then I can not see them. I understand the difficulty of getting pictures of anything, but please do not throw too much an event and then do not show it. In general, a very fresh documentary I liked to see; not the best documentary because of the reasons above, but being very fresh and having some exciting entries and a good soundtrack, is a documentary that I would advise everyone to verify.
