I liked this film because, in my mind, it seemed to me to capture perfectly what I imagined that life in French colonial France must have been like in the 1950s (my generation, anyway). But I was really dressed in his peaceful peace and the glorious end. In the last 5 minutes of this movie, you have to deliberately focus on what's happening. I was never more impressed by the "wrapping" of a movie. I remember crying "wow!" when I realized it was over. On the other hand, my two daughters fell asleep on the couch!
