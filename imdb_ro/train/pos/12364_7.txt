Taking into account the trend of "demon-clergy-encounters" in the late 1960s / early 1970s, which included the triptic "Baby Rosemary", "The Exorcist" and "The Omen", "The Sentinel" of good (though the most neglected lot). In a way, it combines the best elements of those films and to a small extent throws Polanski "The Tenant" (who went out the same year) for a good deal. A New York model unable to engage with his lawyer lover finds his home in a moss-printed house that originally seems to be the perfect place; she meets an old old neighborhood (brilliant Burgess Meredith) plus the other tenants outside the center. Shivering tremulously by noisy noises above her apartment, she soon discovered that a mute priest and herself were the only inhabitants in the otherwise deserted building. From there, director Michael Winner ("Death Wish") launches this supernatural thriller in speed, and there is a courageous rebellion to the hallucinogenic tortures that his heroine provokes. Actor Dick Smith ("The Exorcist"), "The Sentinel" is a really creepy horror film helped by a brilliant distribution of the ensemble, a subtle story and an excellent makeup.
