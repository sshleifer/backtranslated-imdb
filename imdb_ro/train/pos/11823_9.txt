I enjoyed this true form of taking Dick Tracy's character. This is a well-made product that uses modern technology to create a comic story. If you are a fan or have recently watched some of Dick Tracy's old b & w films, then you are sure to get a kick out of this teaching. Pastel colors and larger-than-life characters offered in an authentic way to take a past era are as entertaining as they should be. I personally find Madonna's musical element to be an important part of this movie - her CD of this movie is one I have often listened to over the years, it's so well made and played musically and adapted to that era. In my mind, Madonna's best moment, both on screen and especially musical. This will safely take the "baby" into you.
