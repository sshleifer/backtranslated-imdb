... On the stage, on television or in a book, "The Woman in Black" is a fantastic story. Other commentators have already said just about everything I have to say about this movie, but I thought to add my late review. The film made for television has a deliberately slow act that chronicles the main character Arthur as he deals with his business as a lawyer in the 1920s in London. I can understand why they can not use all the tastes. However, for me, I like this British style of storyline similar to any of the BBC's adaptations of "Ghost Story for Christmas" by M.R. James. In the second act, the ghostly story begins because Arthur is sent to the province by his boss to order the business of a deceased client. The third act strengthens endlessly until a conclusion of the spine ... As London, I saw the play. I own the book, DVD-R, and I also have the unabridged audio book on my iPod. What is safe for me, "Women in Black" on any medium is a ghostly story with few equal. It's time we had a legitimate 2 release DVD.
