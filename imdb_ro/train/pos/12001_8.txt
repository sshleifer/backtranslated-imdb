I do not know what movies some of these people saw, but they probably saw another "Joseph Smith: The Prophet of Restoration" than the one I saw. I think the movie was so well done and inspired. I think it's worth watching. It seems from the very beginning that much care has been taken in making this film. The background landscape is beautiful. I think the film does a good job of portraying Joseph Smith both as a man and as a prophet. Joseph's spiritual experiences are portrayed with taste and respect. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend watching this movie.
