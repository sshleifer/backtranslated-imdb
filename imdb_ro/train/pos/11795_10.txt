I will never forget this movie or the events that led up to Jonestown in Guyana. Looks like he's so tragic, but he has to be told. Powers Boothe give a commanding performance as the Rev. leader. Jim Jones from obscurity to total madness. He would easily have won an Academy Award if he had been released in cinemas. It's the kind of mini-series that you will not forget. You will not forget the images of the brutality, control and obsession of the cult. Raising and falling and threatening the outside world to destroy what he considered paradise. Mass suicide is frightening, almost unreal to one's imagination, why so many people (900+) have voluntarily left or resisted Jones's orders. I do not make mini-series like these, where we stay open and hungry to know what happened to the others.
