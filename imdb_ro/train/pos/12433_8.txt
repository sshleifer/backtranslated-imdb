This is a good movie, although the strange people with comics and books from Modesty Blaise can find it a bit slow and inappropriate. For Modesty fans, the movie will be very enjoyable, especially because it is very faithful in the presentation of Modesty Blaise's "history." Peter O'Donnell is credited as "Creative Consultant," and filmmakers must have paid attention because the plot closely follows the details that have been featured in comic books over the years (although the events have been reformed in modern day). The only thing that the real fan can find disappointing is that there is no Willie Garvin in the story. This lack of Willie is again just faithful to the chronology of Modesty Blaise, because the film takes place in the early days of Modesty's career. Alexandra Staden makes a very young, very credible young man who actually looks very much like Modesty should look. A welcome change from the portrait of Monica Vitti's portrait of Modesty.
