Let's go directly to the subject: this is the movie I would take with me on a desert island (with a dvd player). It's perfect. If a reason for you to see a movie is that you love the actors, they love to see them freely to get involved in space and feelings, this movie is for you. See scene when Myrtle (Rowlands) comes on the beat scene and Maurice (Cassavetes) has to improvise because he's not following the script. If you are sensitive to camera movements, you will be fascinated by how the camera moves on stage, the special flow that gives you the impression room the pursuit of actors as if it were driven by the theatrical principle of "private space" ... amazing . And the story is just a genius of realistic story and drama. Cassavetes is fighting again with Hollywood and Majority politics, but this time he does Broadway, making one of the most interesting films about the theater. Well, this movie is a happiness.
