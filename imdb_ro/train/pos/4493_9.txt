This is an excellent film about a traditional working class family in northern England. Filmed on location in Bolton, he sees James Mason as the father who is the dominant force in his home. Or so it seems. Intelligently, the film, based on the play, illustrates the complexity of family life. Unlike support casting, it's really great, with many familiar faces that support the support.
