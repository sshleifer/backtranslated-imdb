Perhaps the best book of Isabel Allende, the House of Spirits, describes an alternative Chilean history, a magic one, a mystical veil, and a pervasive sadness. This movie brings an excellent distribution plus a great art direction with a script that can not contain the whole quality of this book. It is unusual for a country almost unknown, such as Chile, to be so well represented as this film, whose break may be too great, and because of this has left the illiterate audience slightly disturbed, especially for that they understood very little.
