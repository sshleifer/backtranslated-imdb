This series premiered on the Comedy Central TV channel in the United States. He was cut to death and showed no success. This was sad for the audience she was supposed to attract, did not, and fell off the road. Fortunately, at the same time, my cable company has become digital and I have received the BBC. Thank you very much, because I have to see the "League of Gentlemen" in order, complete and uncircumcised. <br /> <br /> "League of Gentlemen" is right up there with "Monty Python's Circus Flying" in England and "The Kids in the Hall" in Canada. But ... a warning. "The League of Gentlemen", although they are one step further. It is not just about clothing in love and the worship of cultural misfortunes, but it goes deeper and much, much, darker. I can now tell you many of you - will offend certain groups of people, angry others. But remember, his only comedy ... If that's not your job, do not look. If you think you know the dark comedy, watch this - if you get upset and angry then you do not know DARK COMEDY at all. <br /> <br /> These guys have done it well and even the button. They are brilliant, they are excellent and I enjoyed every character creation. There is a COMPLETE story that says here from episode one to the end. You can not watch this episode sometimes, unintentionally, that's one of the charm of this series. Keep track of it. See how creative and grateful and deeply disturbed these guys are. Nobody and nothing is out of bounds. That, my dear, is "dark humor." Bravo!
