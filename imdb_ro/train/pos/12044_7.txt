A young applicant sent in a remote area to conquer the property of a recent deceased client. When he arrives, he finds that he is made less than welcomed by local villagers and that his deceased client did not like it. To speed things up, he decides to move from the local inn and settle into her home, a house that is usually fogbound and tackled only by a road that is blocked by the sea for most of the day. Once she sees visions about a black woman, it is real or imagined, he is subjected to the bloodshot of a bundle and a child drowning in the swamp, these events take their mark on him and soon he becomes quite frightened. Adapting to the Atmospheric Television of a piece known by Susan Hill, who spends the first third, builds her characters, before moving into the ghastly rural house, her poor color contrast immediately gives the roots to the TV, it should have been white -white, but, like a ghost story, he had a few unsettling moments, though, after waiting so long to see her, I have to say that unfortunately I was just a little overwhelmed.
