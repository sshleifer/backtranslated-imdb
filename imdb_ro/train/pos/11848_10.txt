Well, what can I say, this movie really got to me, it's not that bad, as many say, I even liked it, though the idea seems so simple and pretty boring, it is not. First of all I enjoyed the soundtrack (Bryan Adams), really goes with the movie. Secondly, the simple story, and the Spirit drama draws your attention. One thing I like most is that they did not give the stallion a human voice to interact with the other horses, make the film more realistic, not many animations seem realistic now but ... I do not know, making animals talk is just so ... blades. One of the most beautiful animations in 2002, in my opinion, I recommend it to all, not just to the kids :), because it is very relaxing.
