I like this movie and I've seen it several times over the years. It gets better with every view. I agree with all the positive reviews here. Yes, it is hard and brutally realistic as the life of preach in those times. I woke up commenting as I watched him. Someone here said that Rip Torn was bad. I could not help but agree. He is brilliant, just as Clyde Stewart, who does not say anything, works as a slave / worker. Conchatta Farrell is fantastic as Elinor's widow, whom Clyde hires as a cook / cook (along with her 7-year-old daughter). Lilia Skala is excellent as a distant neighbor called grandmother. Also, a star is the Montana Prairie. It is a beautiful and brutal country in which to settle. There are some scenes that are so repulsive and necessary. There are no special effects here, what you see is real! It even has a superb musical score and a great script. Once you see Heartland, you will never forget. It's worth the 10 years he's got here.
