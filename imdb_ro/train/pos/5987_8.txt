Gabe Ryan (Frankie Thomas) leaves the reform school and returns to the slums. His sister (Ann Sheridan) is doing everything he can to keep him from trouble, but he seems to be following him. Apart from its Termite band associations, Gabe is followed by real-life gangsters who have a scheme of fire for random buildings to collect insurance. They need someone to blame for arson, and Gabe is. It is the duty of third parties to work the law in their favor and to give the gangsters only their deserts. The scene that introduces Dead End Kids is really pretty good. Boys wander on the new resident's furniture on the street and continue to do their own. I talk to each other in false accents and talk about tea together; Bernard Punsley takes a nap in a chair. The boys then start fighting a new boy, but after he turns out to be a good fighter, they ask him to join their club. The initiation scene is pretty good, the bad thing seems to be dangerous at first, but it's really quite clever and innocent. Later, when Billy Halop studies to become a primary boy, he has a dream about school. This is awesome staged, with small holograms of kids walking on his face and asking questions to him. Angels wash their faces is a great title, because they play on the success of angels with dirty faces, and really say what kids do. Notorious for bad behavior on and off set, these boys make beautiful in this movie. But, rather than seem despicable, it makes some big laughs. This is a preview of what many of the boys would become in the Bowery Boys series. We even have some mistaken words from Leo Gorcey.
