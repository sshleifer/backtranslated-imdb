A great movie, quite challenging than really fun. Unfortunately, there are no memorable quotes here, but this is my favorite: Alexandre: If you leave someone you've loved, you have to say what I'm saying to you now, "Goodbye, I'm going." But to disappear, to hide as a criminal, he is ignorant. (I did not look at it with English subtitles) <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this expresses everything. There are so many tactics involved in the relationship between Alexandre and the others, and yet everyone wants a lesser truth. However, knowing the truth can hurt even more, as Alexandre lives. The usual interpretation is that the film criticizes the mere possibility of "liberated love", representing the unwanted implications of the people involved. Indeed, it shows this in a convincing manner, but I would appreciate if the reasons were treated a little deeper: it is not that released love is in itself doomed to failure, but people (especially men, I think) should work to themselves and try to overcome the moral of leadership before and not by practicing the liberated love. That being said, the film is realistic though we really forget and deserve it.
