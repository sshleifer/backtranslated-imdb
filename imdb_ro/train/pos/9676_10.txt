The film was very sweet and unimaginable! They cry almost every time they watch the movie. I would recommend this movie for everyone. The film was so inspiring for me. The actors did an excellent job of acting, and the movie was very well played and done. The film was about a little girl holding a parrot she called Paulie. Paulie had separated her from her parents because they thought she would be better for her. After Paulie experienced so many people, he came into a cage alone in a basement. Finally, the Russian man who got a job as a goalkeeper. He found Paulie in the basement and Paulie started talking to him telling him the story of his life. Eventually the man helped Paulie to meet Marie (the girl who raised Paulie). Love has overcome all the obstacles.
