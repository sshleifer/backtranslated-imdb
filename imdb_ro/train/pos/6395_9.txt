For me, this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. A common racism, struggling through life and proving that it's not just an ordinary cookie, Carl Brashear is an amazing character that puts Cuba in the best light, the best performance in his life. De Niro, who is a living legend, gives THAT SOMETHING to the movie. This is his character in the film, but he gives so much a good action to this film, a great performance. And the appearance of beautiful Charlize has always been a great addition to every movie. So, if you have not seen this movie, I strongly recommend those who love courage, the greatness that seeks inspiration. You have to show this great drama. My vote 9/10.
