This is one of the brightest movies I have seen lately. He sits above every international film of any reputation. I am very surprised why this did not receive the recognition it deserves. Sonali Kulkarni, who won the National Prize, is probably the only fact of consolidation. Renuka Daftardar simply astonishes herself, speaking volumes through her eyes. There are a few scenes that remark: When Gauri returns from town to Krishna's wedding, she and Krishna meet for the first time in many years. Krishna observes a change in Gauri, but there is no single line of dialogue. The whole range of emotions is transmitted through subtle manners and eyes. There is another one to the end when Krishna asks Abhay Kulkarni to marry Gauri. If you are not moved by that scene, you do not have a heart. Watch this movie to make your movie glow and action.
