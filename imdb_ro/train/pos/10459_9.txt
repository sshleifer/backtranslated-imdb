I did not expect to be so affected by this film, presenting a family like the one you would have expected to live with. They are ordinary people with meat and blood, not the typical Hollywood fare. They face a very common problem - debilitating illness. But the story line gathers the heart with a strong lesson. Casting, scenario, direction and stream of actors together with a surprising wave attract the viewer deep into the story. Give this film total attention and its message will really inspire you.
