One of the great mysteries of life that suffered daily is the reason why pretty girls are often more interested in robberies and heels than good boys. Worse, when the good boys really want to marry those girls, the girls still prefer robberies and heels, even after the jerks and the heels have shown their contempt, they have shown that they are only interested in using the girls. Stu Erwin is the nice guy who continues to be handsome after being lied and cheated and even after he has completely lost his face. Clark Gable is the villain and is perfect in the role, but rather a sad note for his fans. </ ref> <br /> Jean Harlow meets as a thinner Mae West, even sounds like La West in some of his cynical throwaway lines. Somewhat puzzling is the fact that so many other characters, meant to be bad guys - I mean, heck, they're locked up, so it has to be - so obvious guys are nice. In fact, there are a lot of cute people here, people who, in one place, their movie or story, swallowed back and stabbed, but here they get out of their way to help someone else. So, perhaps the story is quite clich√©d, at least by modern standards, but ultimately the viewer will be glad to have watched. The biggest complaint I have is that so many very good actors do not get credit. Once again, we can say a fervent "Thank you" to IMDb.com.
