I watched this movie when I was almost a child and, of course, was moved to tears by this story of a fox family. The fantastic landscape of Hokkaid, the excellent story and, finally, the wonderful soundtrack offers a rare intimacy with the protagonists. I'm still looking for a copy of the beautiful soundtrack. For German viewers, it may be useful to know that DEFA doubles are the only ones worth listening to. I registered both (DEFA and BR), but I only keep the first.
