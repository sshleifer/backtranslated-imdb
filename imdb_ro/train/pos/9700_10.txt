Somehow, this movie succeeds to be refreshing, sweet and amateur at the same time. Stars like Tony Shalhoub (from Providence) bring the story to life. The story itself is inspired. We see a desperate life, up and down through the most innocent imaginary eyes: a bird. Paulie begins his life as a baby parrot given to a girl (played by Hallie Eisenberg, also known as the Pepsi girl) with a speech impediment. As he learns to speak correctly, so is Paulie. However, unlike most birds, he can speak and understand everything that is said. The military father does not like the bird, so he is sent to a pawn shop and bought by an elderly artist, Ivy. He teaches manners, etc., as they travel to the country to find the owner of Paulie. The film continues with some twists of fate until Paulie reaches a laboratory where he is finally hidden in a basement and found by a Russian custodian who is touched by the story of the bird. the plot is consistent with the simple, metaphorical theme that language is a gift and a curse. I would like to say that the soundtrack is breathtaking. A beautiful blend of flute, digital base and horns increases the film to the point of pure ecstasy. The angles of sweeping room and stunning landscapes make the story even more beautiful. And, as a final remark, the doll is fully credible. (Unlike star wars where Yoda resembles a Muppet) This movie is one of my favorite films, with the added remark that my wonderful four-year-old parrot has recently died. Generally, I give this movie **** four stars, two fingers up and a big hug.
