This is a brilliant and well done contribution by a group of fans, and as it is made in a back bedroom on a painted green screen, story lines are complex and twist, and the characters show a depth and size realistic. CGI created by the crew is staggering. While the first season may be a little shaky, the last few are well thought out and well shot. Some fans would have thought the Star Trek franchise ended with the previous cancellation of the Enterprise, but these fans do not answer. I recommend this to fans and newcomers alike, 10/10 to the hidden border crew. <br /> <br /> Do so ...
