I really thought it was not so bad. It's not a great work of art, but Dermot M was the most powerful performer by far. Patricia Arquette has overcome much of the time. He was actually playing cello, which was very impressive, and his lines were never forced. In addition, he is an incredibly beautiful man. Very sexy. Add this to talent, and everything he has done is more tolerable. He always gives everyone, even if some of the projects he's been involved with did not hit the highest point. It's not the actor's guilt in most cases. Unfortunately, he was in strange movies that did not resonate at the box office. Always with A list actors, but not always a "hit". But he "deserves every penny" from any DVD rented or bought. See Wedding Date with Debra Messing - one of his best movies. EVERYONE WELCOME! ; ) (if you have not seen it yet, do, then you will understand that quote!)
