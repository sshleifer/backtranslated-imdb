Steve Carell enters his own lead role in the 40-year-old Virgo, with only supporting roles in films such as Bewitched, Bruce Almighty, Anchorman, and his work on the daily show, I only received a little comedy Carell does it really. You can say that Will Ferrell influenced "comedic air," but Carell takes it to another level, all he does is innocent, loving and hilarious. I would not hesitate to say that Steve Carell is one of the next great comedians of our time. A 40-year-old Virgo is a two-hour laugh non-stop (or 4 hours if you see it twice as I did), a perfect supportive and big cast you see the audience charming through the whole movie. The script was perfect with so many wonderful lines that you'll want to see the movie again just to try to remember them all. The music matches the tone of the movie and you can tell the director knew what he was doing. Thanks to sex jokes, nudity and many languages, this movie is not for everyone, but if you liked Wedding Crashers, Anchorman, or any movie along these lines, you will love the 40-year-old Virgo.
