I felt it necessary to respond to the comments posted on the front page of this movie because some of it was slightly misinformative. <br /> <br /> I originally posted quotations from the original poster, but I was not sure if it was right, given that it is the index of "guest" and not a picture message (although I used to we use them back before IMDb adds the movie artworks), so I'll edit this to make it useless. <br /> Well, firstly, you may not be aware of this, but Gene Kelly first became famous for playing "Pal Joey" on Broadway in the original production. When Vincent Minnelli decided to make a Gershwin "panorama", he wanted Kelly's character to be more sophisticated than the "good two shoe" roles he had played in most of his films (except "For Me and My Gal. "Alan Jay Lerner was instructed to build a new story in Paris, based on the story of" Pal Joey. "This gave Kelly the chance to play his famous Broadway role, even though Warners went beyond MGM for the rights to "Pal Joey." In my opinion, BM "Pal Joey" is a wreck, although Sinatra was suitable for the role, but other issues sank the movie (changing scenario and poor direction) ====== ============================================= <br /> < br /> You complain that images of Kelly are well done, even quoting your education art to prove the point. But miss that art badly Kelly has been designed to be bad, and it is necessary for the story / characters. The pictures are Not so bad, the audience knows that Kelly is not ready for an exhibition, even if he knows it, although Milo has made some kind of food to the point where he almost thinks it, but it is important that the audience does not stay there saying "but he is a great artist, if he only had the chance! "You want the audience to be fully aware of his deficiencies. Then you complain that he sabotage his interest in the show, again you do not understand the structure of the story, he refuses because he does not want to feel like gigolo, and because he knows he does not he's even ready for the show. "His enthusiasm for the show is certainly not as great as Joey's" enthusiasm "to" start a nightclub, "but serves the same function in the plot. "(song) Joey gives his club night after he realizes that not worth it. the same with art show. If Kelly's paintings would actually be good, would undermine this. ======= ===================================================== /> Then you complain that Caron and Kelly have "chemistry". I think that is in the eye of the beholder. I agree, the chemistry between them is not as strong as it should, but for me it was fine. Compare it with rom anger "forced" even worse, like that between Cary Grant and Sophia Loren in "The Pride and the Passion". ================================================== == <br /> <br /> When you say that the great dance finale has nothing to do with anything else in this film, just shows that you have not dig under the surface of the film in its symbolism. Many elements in the dance sequence relate to the story and characters, and dance is plotted through images and symbolism. It's about finding love, enjoying love, then losing love (looking around and his love disappearing). Symphony movements are constructed so that a part of each dance scenes reflect a separate phase of art in Paris and also a separate phase of their relationship. If you have not seen this, it's not the movie's fault. It's certainly not a "load of nonsense." ==================================================
