Note: These comments are for people who have seen the movie. Vanilla Sky is a brilliant, complex and thrilling film exploiting existentially exactly what the line of labels says: LoveHateDreamsLifeWorkPlayFriends. Maybe the plot plot can come in the spotlight for confused film-goers if someone looks at it from a different angle. Considering the following: <br /> <br /> Now, I did not leave with care through the scene of the movie after the stage, so I will have to examine my statements further (and I welcome your thoughts) but try to see if the film does not go into its place: Where exactly the "merging" happens Now I'm not talking about the merger as explained by the LE "technician" because that sequence itself could be interpreted as a rationalization within the mind / dream / coma of David Aames, but the true connection between reality and dream. It seems to me that the reality of a car accident, the way it is filmed (no explosion, for example) is a probable point of "merging" and that any special sequence containing an existential / dream / coma / non-reality feels - on screen before or after collapse - is actually part of Aames's personal journey to self-realization within his own mind. In this sense, then we have two questions at the end (if you know more, let me know): is Aames actually disfigured and where does he awake? If you are not completely wrapped in the exact sequence of detail in the plot, or at what point your dreams are scattered all the time, this movie becomes a fascinating exploration of a man on a journey to find himself and what he means in the pop culture society today. <br /> <br />
