First ever seen: July 21, 2008 <br /> <br /> A very impressive script and a comedy act and a moment in this movie. 40 years ago, he has not lost his power. Neil Simon presents an excellent view of nature and human relationships, and how to create a genuine comedy from unusual situations. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau offer comic shows. Neil Simon was inspired by the real events of his life to write the play on which this film is based. One of Hollywood's finest comedies and acts of all time! <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, just nominated for 2 Academy Awards: "Best Screenplay Adapted" and "Best Editing Movie". Hollywood rarely gives comedy, no matter how well they are made.
