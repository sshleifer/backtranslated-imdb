It's just funny, watch it! <br /> <br /> OK they will have 10 lines so there is: This is a spoof of 50s / 70s werewolf films. A lot of satire, some political. It feels like an early Clouseau movie (probably because of Alan Arkin), but with a smaller stick. If you like Naked Guns, you will also like this (again, once less in this game). In fact, humor ranges from easy sexual induction (inevitable in a teen comedy) to a truly bizarre sociopolitical satire. Transforming the High School from the 50's to 70's is very funny. The succession with the changing presidential portraits is brilliant! Maybe he's not brilliant, but still hilarious. There are tons of (historical) cracks, starting from the paranoia of the Cold War in the 1950s and the inflation of the late 1970s. Anyway, just watch the movie if you have a chance!
