Contains spoilers "Hollow Man" is probably the worst film Paul Verhoeven, director of great movies such as "Total Recall", "Starship Troopers" and "Robocop" ever made. <br /> <br /> That's probably not his fault. For some reason, Verhoeven remained stuck with a very mediocre scenario and did the best. <br /> <br /> The first part of this movie is pretty good, with a lot of cynical joke, with special special effects and even with Skunk Anansie on the soundtrack. Unfortunately, the film collapses in the second part, degenerating into a standard slasher film or an extremely bad "Alien" clone. The end is particularly ridiculous <SPOILER> because Kevin Bacon continues to come back to life after a series of incidents that should (in the logical sense of the word) kill him. </ SPOILER>. And everything is quite superficial, indeed: the subject becomes invisible is never fully investigated. But in all, Verhoeven manages to stay well above the media with this movie. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 of the star ****
