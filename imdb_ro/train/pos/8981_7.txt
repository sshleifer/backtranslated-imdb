Dig! I would tell anyone, even if you do not like Metallica to see "a kind of monster," is a documentary documentary about one of the world's biggest bands that act as mental children during a malfunction. It's fun and fascinating. Along the same lines comes the dig! A movie about "Dandy Warhol's" and "The Brian Jonestown Massacre," two Portland bands that start a kind of music scene in their hometown just for one band to become immense and one to fall on the road in the music history books. Right from the start, the two bands are pulling in opposite directions only on their ability to make good or bad decisions. Recognized for seven years and sometimes painful to see how we see the meteoric rise of dandy to fame (thanks to the water announcement!) And the Jonestown secret fall from scene instigators to wannabes. As the bands become more disjointed, friendships are tense and, at some points, they are hitting arguments and even the scenic struggles. All of this is half-funny and half tragic and I think they are or can not be perverse. As I said from the beginning, you can watch Metallica even if you have no interest in the band. Dig! on the other hand, it is slightly different and is more enjoyable and much easier to watch if you have an interest in passing each band. Another good film and more a testament to being in a band than to encourage this as a career. Dig! It's a crazy journey on the rocks' tails and a good example of the traps and the pleasures of being or being famous.
