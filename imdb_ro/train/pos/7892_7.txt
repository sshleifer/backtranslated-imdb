FREDDY has gone from scary to fun in this sixth installment of the Nightmare series. It's been 2 years, actually 11 since this movie takes place in 2001. FREDDY murdered his last child on the street Elm except one, John Doe (Jacobb from the 5th, even if the movie cluetes who he is ), in which he uses to bring more children to Elm Street. Not only does FREDDY want his daughter back on Elm Street. When she finds out what's going on, she and the other kids decide to kill FREDDY once and for all. We will also see some of FREDDY's extraordinary foundations. Rachel Talalay, who has been attacked by the nightmare series for so long. Many people hate this movie, but I liked it. He tried to highlight what FREDDY was doing with his ... COMDEY and making the series more amusing than frightening. So this movie is really a comdey sore to speak.It is not terrible in the series, Part 2 still holds it. <br /> <br />
