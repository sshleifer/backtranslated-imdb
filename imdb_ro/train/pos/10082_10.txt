The film is really vague, unique and uplifting. The story is universal in the sense that it is a struggle between good, evil and the world. The most important thing is that his rating is wrong, misleading and a transvestite. The blockbuster was rated as if it were a X rated movie. The truth is that it is closer to G than the PG and should be seen by children who can read the clear and simple subtitles.
