This movie was great and I would like to buy it. The boy goes with his grandfather to catch a young vulture. the boy must feed and take care of the eagle until it is large enough to be sacrificed for the crop. the boy saves the eagle from being killed and runs away from the tribe. The eagle helps them nourish him by catching a duck from a small pond that the boy scares him. Later, the boy shot a deer that a bully kid claimed because his arrows were marked very similarly. Only until it checks the thickness of the red lines determines who obtained the deer. But this was unfortunate because he made the other guys even more cruel to him, and at the end he is being watched on a rock, but when you think he will fall from his pure love for the eagle, he turns it into an eagle gold, necklace as a reminder of who it was. Please, if anyone knows where to buy this movie, let me know. I have not seen him for more than 30 years, but I still remember parts of the movie.deniselacey2000@yahoo.com
