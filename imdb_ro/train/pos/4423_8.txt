GOJOE gets a little bit accustomed to it, but the end result is very satisfying. The story of a murdering samurai trying to redeem, opposed to an effeminate but dangerous samurai, deserves more than an hour. There are many in the game, from physical survival to soul salvation. The film may look a bit similar to Samurai, inspired by anime at first, but eventually enters a mature / adult territory shortly. <br /> <br /> Not to be missed. GOJOE is one of the best samurai films that come around post-Kurosawa. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10 <br /> <br /> (visit www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of the movie and reviews of other foreign movies)
