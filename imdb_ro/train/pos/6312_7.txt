Before George Clooney directed Sam Rockwell in his directorial debut "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind," they starred together in this film. George Clooney has also been involved in this film as a producer, along with Steven Soderbergh, who shows that they really believed in this project. In potential, this also seems to be a wonderful and fun project that is similar to movie remakes such as "Ocean's Eleven" and "The Italian Job", but somehow this film is only half successful or at least not as good as it could have been. The film's characters are all being played by some well-known actors, but a shame is that the characters are not really given enough space to develop. Even if their potential could have turned into fun and entertaining characters, now they are just characters that try lightly, because mostly some of the stranger sequences that are in the movie. The fact that they play does not change much, even if they prevent their characters from becoming ever boring or even annoying or something like that. Of course, thanks to the writing, the characters are not used to their full potential. I can only assume that the original Italian film "I Soliti ignoti" works much better than the film does. The film relies too much on its simple story and the predictable way of storytelling. However, the movie is simply very fun to be watched perhaps because of the same simplicity. It's a harmless little film, in which you simply do not have to worry too much about the story. In this regard, "Welcome to Collinwood" is another movie that works and serves its purpose. It's a movie you do not regret looking for after you've finished it, but it's also a movie that you can easily do without ever seeing. 7/10
