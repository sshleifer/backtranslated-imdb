The Love Trap is an independent movie, "You Need to See". When I sat down to see the movie, I came with weak expectations, but I stayed with a blessing. The story is poetic, noun and creative. The writer draws you more and more on every scene, allowing you to relate to the realistic characters that each can identify. The film allowed me to reflect on my life and what I think is love. The film showed what love is, not emotion. I was also impressed by the quality of the cinema and the soundtrack of the film. The whole presentation has exceeded my expectations. I give the film two big fingers up and I recommend it to everyone of all ages and all environments.
