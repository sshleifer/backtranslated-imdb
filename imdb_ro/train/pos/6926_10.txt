The narrative affirms the classic image of good to evil in the form of a brother's struggle against the brother. The main character, Lin Macadam, played by James Stewart, represents justice and righteousness. His brother, operating under Dutchman Henry Brown, starred by Stephen McNally, is the classic stage coach who steals the Western robot, watched by his brother for killing their father. The world in which the story unfolds is the classical Western dystopian, where the only way to prevent its inhabitants from killing each other is to take their lateral arms as soon as they enter the city and the man responsible for keeping this law and order is the classic Western lawyer Wyat Earp. <br /> <br /> There are also typical Western characters, such as the Indian killer warrior, the besieged knight and the scary mother of the hood. <br /> <br /> Another important archetype in this movie, which gives it the name of the movie, is a personalized Winchester rifle. The weapon can be regarded as an allegory for rewards for those who do honorable things. Once stolen from its legal owner, it brings tragedy to all who come in contact with her. In this sense, it resembles other such icons, such as the holy speech in Raiders of Missing Art and the colored blood letter in Salvati Ryan privately. This gives the film an element of surrealism that is usually absent from Westerners, a genre that is not known for esoteric themes and symbols. <br /> <br /> Being essentially a revenge movie, he shares this element with many other examples of gender such as Jack Arnold's name on the bullet and Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven. <br /> <br /> There is also a tacit rape theme in Winchester '73. Waco Johnny Dean, one of the characters in the film played very effectively by Dan Duryea, kidnapped a woman after her husband's murder. The volatile cowboy toys with the shy husband send him as a caricature of a cat that melts with an insect before biting his head. Eventually, Waco Johnny Dean receives what comes after coming into contact with the Winchester Warfare. <br /> <br /> The main story of Winchester '73 reminds of Jason's mythological story and his search for the golden trifle, as it was said in Apollonius's Argonautics. Both stories deal with the purchase of a sacred object that possesses a kind of intangible quality. Like Jason, Stewart's character falls from one adventure to another in search of a unique prize. Another theme in Winchester '73, which is similar to a mythical story, is brothers' struggle. Several stories about antiquity deal with this issue, such as the story of the Jewish Bible about Cain and Abel, and the vulgar story of Romulus and Remus. <br /> <br /> With regard to the theme of abduction and rape present in Anthony Mann's film, it is present in many mythological works such as Europe Rape, as Ovidius said in his Metamorphoses. <br /> <br /> Winchester '73 is a good example of the Western genre and acts as an objective correlation for many classic occult and ancient mythological themes.
