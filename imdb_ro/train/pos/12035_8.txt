I recently came across this movie on TNT five minutes ago, while on vacation in Florida ... (hey, there must be some time in the hotel, right?) I was initially surprised to see Melissa Joan Hart in any feature film length on TNT. I mean, "Drive Me Crazy" is not old, is it? But I got stuck and I was very surprised and amused. Melissa plays excellently her role as psychotic Jennifer. His support (Nick, the former boyfriend, Karen, her best friend, and the parents who controlled her life) brought a lot of credibility. The tower was a beautiful closing of this girl's story, which always seemed one step ahead of everyone. If you have a chance, check it out! <br /> <br />
