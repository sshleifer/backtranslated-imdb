I was reviewing some of the old VHS tapes I received and I came across TV show John Denver & The Muppets A Christmas Together. That made me go to my computer and look up to see if I could find a DVD version of this show to buy. I was disappointed that I could not find it on DVD yet. The show was broadcast in 1979 and was a delightful show. I have the CD and the CD, but I would love to buy a DVD version of this show. The tape is old and the image quality is pretty good, but it fades, the sound is not as good as the CD. There are also some songs that are not on CD. As a fan of John Denver and Muppets, a DVD of this show would really be a good seller. If you do not have the CD, it's a wonderful Chritmas collection of songs taken from that show. The album is also good if you can find it and you still have a disc player to play it.
