This film has a constant, haunted, sustained action (one of Chamberlain's best performances) and a story that has been revealed to us over the years. Beyond that, music fully sets the mood and assists in keeping an unpleasant, cautious and sleepy tone. Weir's story is enhanced by the use of aborigines, their stories and their tensions with the dominant white population to provide a fantastic story that is threatening. <br /> <br /> Although they have nothing to do with the story or the genre, it has kept the same feeling as Ursula Le Guin, Lathe of Heaven (1980). <br /> <br /> "The Last Wave" is a dramatic thriller with some shocking moments. Remember that "hacking and slicing" does not make a movie a horror film, it is the psychological element of fear and agitation that is in us all.
