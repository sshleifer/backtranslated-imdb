With Tony badly injured in an induced coma, two things happen: Tony imagines himself leading the life of a salesman participating in a business convention, while his family and friends go through hell trying to cope with the possible loss of the big man . The dream sequences are from an old episode of the TWILIGHT ZONE because Tony turns into a Joe Medium who is trying to handle a missing wallet and mixed identities while on a business trip. His intonation as a blazer and khaki schnook is more American and less than an Italian bully from Noo Joisey. A pleasant touch. AJ with a long hairy hippy-dipy hair (Paulie called "Van Helsing" at one time) has a nice scene with his old coma. The best time is for big boys to try to talk about life without Tony, who immediately breaks into a territorial dispute. Vito lowers a line about the fact that New-born Genesis was probably a cabinet case, which is interesting in the light of what we will learn about Vito.
