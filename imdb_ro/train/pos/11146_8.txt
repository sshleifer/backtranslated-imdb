Fascinating down about a potential male New York man forced to live in a condemned building with a wounded con. Extremely bleak examination of the modern moral and social decline, extremely well directed by John Schlesinger (who has never surpassed his work here), and gloriously acted by Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman. The package is quite general, but the "fancy" scenes - some of them being played for a chuckle - are slightly intrusive, just like the "mod" drug party. The relationship that develops between the two men is sentimental, however, filmmakers are careful not to bother, and this gives the picture an edge she can not have with a smaller director than Schlesinger. Originally, X-rated in 1969, and winner of the best Oscar; screenwriter Waldo Salt (who adapted the book of James Leo Herilhy) and Schlesinger also won statues. *** 1/2 from ****
