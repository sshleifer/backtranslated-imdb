Beyond my understanding, so many garbage in Norway has been remastered for the release of DVDs, and yet such stones do not get a chance to recover the past glory. I give this a 7, not because it's really good, but because it's one of the few SciFi films made for Norwegian television. This film is nothing but a film-historical gem that in many ways prefigures the first foreign film. And, my word, Blindpassasjer was the first! Ridley Scott or someone in the crew saw the mini-series? However, scenes are unlikely to be very similar. Well, the budget is much lower in the Norwegian film, but since it is a really good piece of work from the deserted era of the Norwegian film, which, in fact, lasted until the 1990s.
