This is a strange movie about an archaeologist who studies the culture of the ancient Hohokam Indians. She takes a real mummy from a funeral cave and brings her home to study her. Well, pretty soon it starts to behave strangely and talk to this mummy. Shortly afterwards, her son becomes possessed by the mummy spirit. Even foreign events take place as the spirit tries to destroy the woman's family. In fact, this is in fact actually in general, and will make you fall asleep in the first two moments when you try to see it. But if you keep on it, you can do it all the way. <br /> <br /> Ahh! What is the mummy's secret? Mummy's anger is angry that she was taken out of the cave? You may not be able to find out what the motivation of the spirit is, but if you like scary shots with a low budget (and 70-year-old hairstyles!), This will have a certain comforting appeal. described the story is much clearer than the boring and boring mode in which the film takes the story. Can a boring movie really be fascinating? Well ... in a way this touches that. Perhaps this is a good heartbeat, but executed in a rather strange way. I do not know. What I know is that I liked pretty little, despite the anger. "Spider Baby" fans will be interested in knowing that this film uses some of the music tracks in this movie (including an instrumental version of the theme song). With a frightening and well-done sequence that features boulders and possessed rocks that roll around and eventually attack some people in a camper. Other scenes in the film are just scary or weird; but this scene is actually quite frightening. See this! It's weird and it's worth your time. You might even want one on your shelf.
