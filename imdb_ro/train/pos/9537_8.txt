Some may feel that the rating I just gave is a little generous, but for what this movie is, I think directors have done a good job with having them at their disposal, it's also a movie a movie with a taste! <br /> <br /> My thought was the direct connection with the classical cult movie "The Thing," that is, strangers from the outside space, infesting the human host when possible! You can see how this movie brings tribute to such a film, and others of horror / gore, no matter how smart they preserve their originality, the good fights for each other and then continues to eat the fallen rival! Only killing and choosing a man when he needs a new host! Then choose another battle with another infected host! And this movie even throws a story of love, but I do not get used to saying it does not give it too much. <br /> <br /> GREAT! But, as I said about a taste you bought, so do not be surprised if you do not like the movie. It is a low budget and yes, it is thirsty blood, creatures / extraterrestrials / things that turn your limbs into rough weapons, that is, saws, drills, blades and even strange weapons at all, but decimate there the opponent. I woke up to what was shown to me, but at the same time stuck to the screen asking what was going to happen next! So if you like gore, you like extraterrestrials, you like fighting and maybe maybe a little bit of love thrown somewhere, then I have to recommend this movie as we have to see. I just want to see this sooner, then I did!
