SPOILER CONTAINERS! I saw an ad for it on a video. Then my sister discovered I had the book so I read it. I rented the movie the same day I finished the book. I thought it was very memorable like the book. The tower was brilliant. Country Fitzgerald was excellent, as Helen and Rupert Graves were hated like Arthur. Costumes, music and settings are amazingly beautiful. CAREFUL! YOU DO NOT KNOW IF YOU ARE VISIT IT <br /> <br /> On the underside are some sex scenes that have been added to and some violent. That's why the video is quoted 15. There are other things that were thrown in. After the first part, I felt precision went down. While the book is better than this, I'm glad I saw it and recommend it to the people who read the book, they are fans of the Brond drama or costume dramas (I'm all 3!), As long as you rush through sex scenes. The book is rather unpunished. Anne Brontes' books do not appear to be widely read or known as Jane Erye or Wuthering Heights, who have done many times in television and film. Another thing. When I read the book, I was surprised at how much religion it was in it, but here it was precisely that pointing to it all! <br /> <br /> 7 \ 10
