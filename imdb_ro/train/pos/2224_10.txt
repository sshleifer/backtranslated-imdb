A female monk (played by sexy Jennifer Thomas II) has the fun mission to fulfill all the fantasies of all the men who died before meeting their producer. And what way to go. Good luck that this movie is not real or that we will have a lot more people in this dying world. It really starts really slow. Low light and bad action, like most films (B). She gets better as she moves. And it ends with a bang. I would miss high on low-cost, very sexy movies of the 90s. You have to see once the kids are away or in bed.
