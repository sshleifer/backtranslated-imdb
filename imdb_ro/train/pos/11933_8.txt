I think this is a wonderful family movie. There are lots of hilarious scenes and moments of heart heating that must be had throughout the movie. The actors are wonderful and the effects are well executed all the time. Danny Glover plays George Knox, who manages the terrible baseball team "The Angels," and is great in the whole movie. Also fantastic are the young actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Milton Davis Jr., Christopher Lloyd is good as Al 'The Angel, and the effects are great in this top Disney movie. An exciting and imaginative film that everyone should enjoy.
