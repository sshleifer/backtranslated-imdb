BSG is one of my favorite television series. I was lucky enough to start seeing how the series reached the last season. It was a marathon from start to finish for me and an incredible walk! <br /> <br /> As soon as I noticed the Hulu pilot, I knew exactly what I was in the title, just after the title - Caprica! Though some things are not added when you compare both series, it is still performed nicely. There was no mention of the Battlestar Galactica Holobandels or the mention of virtual worlds, but perhaps we have not gotten far enough in series to explain why. We recommend this show to anyone who loves the universe, technology and other fantasies of our world. This show is very interesting and you will want to watch more!
