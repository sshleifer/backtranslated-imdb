Obviously, not many have seen this movie, because no one else comments. This is not a movie to be missed. After all, he won the George Peabody Award, as well as the Humanitas Prize. Paul Winfield should have won a prize for his wonderful performance in this film. Eugene Logan, who was co-writer in this television film, was also part of another film about humanity or his loss, being a technical adviser to Truman Capote's House of Glass film. This movie is now available on DVD. If anyone is interested, I will post another letter saying how it was that Eugene Logan became the technical adviser of a movie of such an astonishing person as Truman Capote. Thank you for reading this, and I hope you find a way to see these two movies.
