Spacecamp is my favorite movie. It's a great story and inspires others. The actor was great, my wife and I went to see Lea Thompson in Cabaret years later, due to his performance in the movie. It is regrettable that the Challenger Accident has delayed and hurt the movie. The 20th anniversary of the Challenger accident is coming. I knew one of the childhood Challenger astronauts on the Carnegie Mellon campus, where my dad went to school; I also know a close friend of the late pilot. I was last year's technical review for the National BSA for the Bad Boy Astronomy Merit Badge and still find Spacecamp a great movie to recommend scouts to do. I learned the merit badges related to the environment. I ran back to the late astronaut as an adult, following a technical education program that we put together when the Challenger exploded. I ended up staying with Willard Rockwell and his engineers, "invisible," going over things after the accident at Astrotech shareholders meeting, as a result, so I'm much closer to Accident and any movie resemblances. I made sure I was a good student and finished the diploma four years later, rather strange, at the recommendation of engineer Rockwell, who told him not to fly with Challenger in 1986 and later built Endeavor.
