I bought the video pretty late in my collection and probably saved a lot of money if I bought it earlier. Invariably, it replaces anything else on the nights of the "Cosmo Moon." Cher and Olympia are definitely worth their awards, but this is really a perfect performance of a superb scenario. What the? Do not you know what Cosmo's moon means?
