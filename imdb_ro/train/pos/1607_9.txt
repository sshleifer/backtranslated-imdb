As somebody else said here, every scene in this movie is gem. Most movies are fortunate to have a perfect scene, but director Everson has ever hit a home trip. The cast had just the right to take on the excellent screenplay, and, additionally, the Dick Hyman musical settings from the opera and other music made for a perfect match. It's hard to imagine how they preserved the exact mood during the long production of a movie. Comedy is subtle (mostly), and camera work mirrors any emotional inflection of the narrative. Cher is such a natural comedy, Vincent Gardenia (whom I know mostly through Frank Lorenzo's role in All in the Family until I saw him in that and then outside Broadway in the 1980s) deserves a star much higher than ever and Aiello unhappy victims are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to kudos this extraordinary distribution. Is Jewison ever writing about this movie? She likes to read it. It's hard to figure out why the average IMDb rating is so low ...
