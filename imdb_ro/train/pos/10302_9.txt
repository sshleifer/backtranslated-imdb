This movie is the best film Jim Carrey ever did. Carrey did not have the usual face in this movie. It was fun and sad. Carrey played a reporter named Bruce Nolan. Nolan blames God (Morgan Freeman) for everything that goes wrong in his life. Then God descends from heaven and gives Bruce the power. As I said before, Carrey did a great job. I also thought Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston were wonderful as actors / actresses. The plot was good because it had many points at the main point. This movie can be funny (Bruce's dogs), but also sad ("pause"). The script worked well. I'm glad they made a sequel to this movie. I rate this movie on 9/10.
