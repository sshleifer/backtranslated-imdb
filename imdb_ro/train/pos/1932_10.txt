I think I usually approach film comedies with the weak expectations that they will be invariably "weird" and that any intentional humor will be derived only to the detriment of the simplicity of the characters in a complicated context. What was exceptional about Big Bad Swim was the fact that the director managed to maintain the integrity and development of his characters in his film, while he still found laughing out-of-the-scenes humor. There was a sophistication, perhaps due partly to the DP's sharp work, which I rarely saw in an indie film and even less in a comedy. The special note here: Paget Brewster's turn as mathematics professor Amy. After seeing this performance, I do not understand why Brewster was not "discovered" by a wider audience. It brings the necessary mixture of anger and fantasy to the role that really helps this image to reach its potential. It is a wonderful work that deserves a bigger audience. I look forward to more than the director and this cast!
