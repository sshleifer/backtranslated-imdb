Ah, the '70s. A moment when you were a swinger. To be honest, today is also a good time to be a swinger, but he felt more daring then. Joe Sarno offers a pretty good soft-core movie. In fact, just as today, some actors are famous hardcore actors. Unlike today, these people were good actors and these films had a scenario and character development. It's pretty much what you'd expect from Swinger's movie. Two couples with open relationships reheat the MILF swirl of one of the women who came for a visit. No more than that. Of course, when MILF is Jennifer Welles, then it's a different story. Not so many things for 40 years look as delicious as Mrs. Welles. It's just worth the price to see Mrs. Welles looking at her in the mirror as if it were Aphrodite. She is not Stifler's mother. She's a lot more sexy. And I dug Anna, Chris Jordan. Jordan looks and sounds as much as Elaine Joyce that I thought she might be twin "separated at birth" or even Elaine herself. Anna is always eaten, but it must have an incredible metabolism. Unlike soft-core porn in 1990, 70-year-old porn has kept the realism of the hardcore movie (which 2000 soft-core brought again, instead of the 90s, preserved music and orgasms ) and is here in full force. It's not real, but it feels real. For those who enjoyed the Quebec product "Deux Femmes En Or", you will enjoy this. Another classic classic Drive-In Classics movie, the best $ 2.50 CAN per month you can spend.
