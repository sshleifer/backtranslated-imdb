Another demonstration of Kurosawa's genius, his first color film, is a surrealist look in the tragic life of residents in Tokyo neighborhoods, essentially a series of intertwined creatures that present several groups of people who isolate a dangerous existence in a city painful and dishonest,. Swinging from comedy to tragedy and back, this film shows how people are experiencing the worst kind of life each in their own way, especially retreating into themselves and living in the fantastic worlds of their own heads, emotionally to those around them, or drowning in alcohol. Combining kitchen-sink realism with the Kabuki-esque theater, Kurosawa played with the emotions of his audience, drawing tears and laughing with equality. A wonderful, dramatic experience.
