Interestingly more realistic is Brosnan's performance than James Bond's original novels in comparison to bond films. She's neurotic, paranoid, an alcoholic and a feminine boot. This is a perfect break for him, just so much to have fun with the link icon. "I'm a mess, a parody of mine," he says. It's not better than that. I just finished reading Dr. No and this is a lot of how Ian Fleming had played James Bond. Personally I never liked Brosnan as Bond because it matches the icon too closely. There was nothing for him to personalize the character with, compared to Roger Moore or Sean Connery. It's great to see Brosnan play a character both real and flamboyant on the wall. A superficial character who tries to reach an understanding on deeper emotional and psychological themes that has nothing to do with it. It's an impressive portrayal, and Greg Kinear, to ground him, is just poetic. This movie reminds me of a small dynamic set between the main characters in My Blue Heaven, but more authentic in the coping mechanisms.
