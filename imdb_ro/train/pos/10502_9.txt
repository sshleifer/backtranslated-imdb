one of the funniest mario I've ever played. the levels are creative, there are fluid controls and good graphics for his time. there are also a lot of crazy bosses and enemies to fight. Sometimes the levels become frustrating, and if you drop some of the heavy levels and continue, you have to do better to fight a boss, it can be annoying. another complaint is the angle of the room; although it works pretty well most of the time, it can be a pain in some situations. if your big time mario fan; this is for you. even if you are not a big fan of him, I would still recommend this. its a great game, and getting what you need can take some time but it is very satisfying. good to play in short periods of time. it will be almost certain to keep your interest; surely you care about me!
