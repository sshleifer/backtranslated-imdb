I do not care if you like my comment or not, but I think you're writing that the movie is not good ... you're so obsessed with Hollywood movies that you do not see how good this movie is I'm not a fan of Jay Chou but I love his play and not only his ... and maybe you think that's not a big sense in the idea and maybe you think it's not that exciting, it's more than action in more movies much more than love and passion and tears there is more than the US in the world and it is good :) very good. And it cost a lot of doing so so please do not criticize the directors cause the actors do not know how hard they work for you to be happy in this hour and half watching them thank you :)
