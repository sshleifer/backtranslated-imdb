Disney did it again. The brilliant way Timone and Pumbaa are brought back alive to tell us how they came to meet and help Simba when they needed them. I like this movie and I always follow it. It shows how Timone lived with his family and colleagues before leaving to find his dream home and adventure. Then he meets Pumbaa and things change. Together, they are looking for the house that Timon desires and fails repeatedly, which is amusing as Timone becomes more and more crazy. Then Simba returns and we see our childhood more than we did in the two previous films. The rest, you already know.
