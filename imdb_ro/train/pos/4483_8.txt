Everything should be a musical comedy. Gene Kelly (like Joe Brady) does not miss one step, and Frank Sinatra (like Clarence Doolittle) misses a note. Scenes with them together are very good, showing how much talent can add to somewhat unequal behavior. Sinatra "I fell in love too lightly" is an indication of her best and future. Kelly's "Dance Hat Mexican" with a young Mexican girl is delightful. Kelly has certainly won his nomination as the best actor. And there are a bunch of really funny lines, like: "Do you think the ship is spinning?"; "Do you think someone is singing a sailor to sleep?"; and, "We've gotten into a little problem, we've got a little kid." A very pleasant film, just the dust-shaking work of a recent World War II ending.
