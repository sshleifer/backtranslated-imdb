We just saw this episode tonight, in a recent presentation by one of our local independent channels, which now shows two episodes every day.

My father was a friend of one of the directors (in my hometown, Cincinnati) for whom young Rod Serling worked in the media there - and I remember that the father said how talented and creative he was remembered there. Generally, "Twilight Zone" is certainly one of the true classics on television and, given its production during the Cold War period, it offers not only a picture of this era in the country but also a nostalgic image of technical production, creative views and the actors of this era a few decades ago. <br /> <br /> * Sportiv "minor". * This private story presents, like other presentations in this series and elsewhere, a story in which localization is meant to provide a "surprise" that ends.

They usually contain the message (as here) about a situation determined by the judgments that were eventually pressed by superpowers during this cold war period. Today, stories like this offer a nostalgic look at this worldly view 4-5 decades ago, and still offer some food for thought. - as this episode did. While the dialogue may not have stretched the considerable talents of the leaders, it still presents a simple, important message and a 20-minute value of entertainment and interest.
