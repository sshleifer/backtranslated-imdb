This was a great movie. How these women tried to save their wives. I thought the performances of the actors were great. I had to think about the movie for a very long time. I think every student should see this movie to think about war, relationships, friendship and love. I liked the movie because she told me and showed me how strong love is. I wish I was as strong as a woman. I loved it very much because she told me something about relationships and that's what I like to see in a movie. I think you can compare the film with Der Untergang, the pianist. If you put these three movies together, you have a wonderful look at what happened during the war. We should remember something like war forever.
