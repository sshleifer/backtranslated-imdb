The comparison with Sleuth, the earlier movie, is obvious, and at my first view I thought Sleuth was better, but Deathtrap had at least for me more repeat views than Sleuth at least. > <br /> <br /> I bought Deathrap in Wal-Mart cart, imagining she had Caine and Reeve undervalued and worth the $ 6. It was one of the most beautiful DVD purchases I could have picked up. It's one of the best-kept secrets that movie lovers are always excited to discover. And it's worthwhile watching. Although Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine turned into bravado performances in Sleuth, I was twice impressed by Christopher Reeve as Clifford Anderson. Reeve, associated with his legendary Superman portrait, stole the show in what should have been an Oscar-winning performance. I've always felt that Reeve was a cast actor who did not have much chance to shine out of Superman's movies and some other erotic but funny movies like Somewhere in Time but this film shows that the potential it was really hit and made available, thank goodness. I absolutely enjoyed Michael Caine's performance. She was glib, deliciously manipulating and sadistic. And his oversight of working with Reeve and Dyan Cannon was an absolute pleasure. In fact, thanks to this film, I went into a "Michael Caine phase" and started to rent as much of his stuff as possible from a human point of view. <br /> <br /> As far as Deathtrap is concerned, enough dialogue is enough to fill the 'memorable quotes' section. (Unfortunately, much of the dialogue would inevitably spoil the extremely fun plot). It's really hard to talk about the movie without destroying important plot points that are infinitely more fun to discover on your own. Needless to say we need to see. But for me, it was the biggest and most rewarding buying of blind all the time. Repeating views is a must. <br /> <br /> And it's worth to stick with Sleuth on your shelf .. <br /> <br /> I leave you with this beautiful quote from the movie: 'I wonder if it would not be ... they well ... just a scary eye for me to enter into such a risky and interesting collaboration ... where I could not count on any sense of moral obligation ... anyway.
