Big actors, an Oscar-nominated actress, amazing landscapes, good story lines and more laughs than I can fit in my new handbag (and that's pretty big). This movie was brilliant. It happened beautifully in the more serious scenes and in the funny moments. . well, side partition. I have never heard a cinema audience so much, and the tears of the "stones at the tea shop" have gone through my tears. Well done to the British cinema industry and to Craig Ferguson, whose magic ingredients have made sure this is one of my favorite films of the year, if not all the time.
