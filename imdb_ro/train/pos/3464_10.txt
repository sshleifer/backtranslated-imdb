* WARNING * Spoilers ahead ... The writers of this story knew these people very well. The actors also portrayed them very well. The result is that by the end of the movie you feel you look at John Lennon and Paul McCartney. Expected tensions are there, especially in the first strange moments. But as the two begin to break out, the old camaraderie that has done the work of the Beatles so well begins to manifest itself. The bitterness is still there and sometimes interrupts, but until John gets the idea of ​​taking Lorne Michaels on his offer to pay the Beatles $ 3,000 to appear on Saturday Night Live, the two might be the same goddamn boys who Liverpool together as teenagers and survived to play the harsh night clubs in Hamburg to rise to Superstardom. But, in the end, this wonderful fantasy motivates us easily. We remember why the Beatles meeting was never possible before Lennon's assassination: the two driving forces of the group were over.
