For all the miserable people who have done everything from complaining about dialogue, budget, this and that ... who wants to hear that? If you missed the point of this movie beyond the beautiful, this is your loss. The other of us who love this film deeply do not care what you think. I'm a guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life, and this is in his own entity in my book. It was not supposed to be a documentary or a complete factual account of what happened that night. It is the most amazing love story ever attempted. I know he is cynical of the 90th and that the millennium has everyone in a tizzy, but come on. Someone on this comment board complained that he made too much money! What lame is that? He packed money in every civilized country on the planet and is the top film on the planet. I will resist most of this time. Okay, cynical, you have time to crawl under the rock, we're done.
