Dick Tracy was not the best for many of the comic book fans because they wanted something like Batman's blood. Dick Tracy plays the innocence of being just a comic book with villains who have a severe affection for the look and be fun. Warren Beatty directs and plays the lead role in fighting crime without even using super powers. I liked Dick Tracy since I was a baby because of the comic atmosphere of the main colors: red, blue, orange, yellow, green and black. This is the perfect movie for anyone to look with their children. Al Pacino is like Jack Nicholson in Batman and plays Big Boy Caprice with dowry. Madonna like an infant, who is the second villain in this movie, does not play the same toy she represents. Like I said, no blood, obscenities, sexual inconvenience or anything else that would offend anyone.
