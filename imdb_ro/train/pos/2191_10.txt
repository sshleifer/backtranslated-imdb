Shakespeare said we were actors set in a wonderful scene. But when this stage is Israel, the work that we interpret multiplies for ten and all the actions we make are full of a rough style. Dan Katzir manages to make a spectacular portrait of part of life in Tel Aviv, but besides, Katzir manages to penetrate the heart of the Israeli people, and this people, far from being mere prominent figures, speaks to us from the heart. Katzir's film allows Israel to escape the dark informative darkness in which they live, and this wonderful country appears to the world as a splendid bird born from its ashes. It is very wonderful for me, because the reality of the state of Israel, which Europeans only know about newsletters or newspapers, appears as a close and absolutely human reality, the reality of millions of people looking for their place, exploring the entire state, the entire culture with the only purpose of feeling part of it. Katzir builds an absolutely awesome documentary and demonstrates that when a man films with passion the deepest feelings are designed with force and these feelings cross our hearts. Thank Dan to open our eyes and give us one of the most beautiful portraits of the world's most wonderful countries.
