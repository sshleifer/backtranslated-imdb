I gave her a 10, since everyone else seemed to like it and would not. The reason I bother you is to add a personal observation to Castle's work. I have seen "Omicidal" and "The Tingler" (the intelligent color version in which everything except the blood is black and white) a few times and "House on Haunted Hill" many times. Even I'm not old enough to have seen them when the Castle was up to showman tricks, so you can appreciate them for their merits. And while most of them pass it on as a secondary rate, hovering, ham, etc., I think I'm doing it a bad service. The final sequence of "Homicide" is shocking and is working today - and the premise of "The Tingler", while silly, was very original. But "Haunted Hill House" was a TRIUMPH. Using Frank Lloyd Wright's house as an exterior, the great Vincent Price and a solid distribution, plus a good score and production figures - when I first saw him on a late night presented in the late sixties, produced a reaction of audience I have not seen you before and have not seen you since. It was the little heroine that is alone in the basement (if you have not seen the movie, do not read) and wait for the hero to hear from the other side of the wall. With the NO telegraph of what's coming, the camera is slowly withdrawing, forcing AUDIENCE to change its look to ... I say no more (my spoiler statement above covers only this movie). The point is, I think this was DELIBERED - not by accident - and when it happened, ALL AUDIENCE SCREAMED (including most of the men!) It took audiences about TEN MINUTES to calm down. Now that's a superior movie. A spectacular flamboyant that could have been, but "House," and the other two films I've mentioned are GOOD MOVIES. The castle could not have been called Hitchcock, but he was not Ed Wood. It's easy to focus on someone's curiosities and forget to examine their TALENT. I hope this documentary has acknowledged this. I look forward to seeing this.
