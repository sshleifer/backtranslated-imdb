I'm so glad I have the chance to see this rare film of jewelery. I saw her at an independent film festival so she did not expect you to come to your town soon. During the movie, I noticed that about 10 people are getting up and going. Too bad for them (here in the south people do not like to read subtitles). The film starts slowly, but it is so rich in dialogue that I never felt bored. When the action finally arrives, I found myself stuck on the screen as if I had been traveling with a roller coaster. We've also got a big shot of chapter headlines that appear before chapters, especially those that enter the characters as they appear on the screen. He reminded me of Zelda (Ocarina de Timp) when you are confronted with the level bosses. If this is the future of "video / comic" movies, then I welcome him.
