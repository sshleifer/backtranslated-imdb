"This man's marina" is, as other comments have shown, a rare and well-documented vision of the lighter ship's activities than the air (LTA). The LTA crews were proud to be proud that the convoys they had walked never lost a submarine attack ship. Filming from the different locations of the NAS provides a valuable insight into a type of aviation that has long vanished. However, the first half of the film refers to Beery, his relationship with his friends, the meeting with Tom Drake's character and his mother, and Drake's foot. Only then begins the second movie. The second film is mostly LTA in action, taking on a sub surface, boys are killed and many damage is caused. The look is pretty tough and realistic, I imagine. Then we pass to Southeast Asia. Did Marina have the LTA there? No matter, this part is really wild, with a balm used to extract some jungle flight levers. And the Japanese pull like a madman. The shades of Vietnam, except the escape, are oh, so quiet. This is a balloon we are talking about. Finally, a good drama about the Second World War, about a very unusual part of the war.
