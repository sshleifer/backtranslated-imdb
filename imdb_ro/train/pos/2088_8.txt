From the top shelf of classic sea books, this story comes from Pearl Buck. The book as well as the movie is called "Good Earth". She tells the story of Wang Lung, a simple Chinese farmer, who starts his day with a trip to the Great House where he took a slave woman called O-Lan (Luise Rainer) and made her wife . Almost from the beginning, she begins to adapt to his goodness by saving a small peach seed and planting her next to her new home. Over the next few years, O-Lan demonstrates its value by firmly distributing husband's work, troubles and wealth changes. Over the past years, he has raised his family and watched the simple weather of the household, both feast and famine. Indeed, at the lowest point of their lives, each one discovers the value of companion, loyalty, and love. With the changing times, the growing family is helped and threatened by friends and relatives, such as their uncle (Walter Connolly), who is a villain and a charlatan, but he is compassionate. Wang has his "old father" (Charley Grapewin) to advise and remind him of the fragile and unstable nature of life. Two notable actors who make impressive appearances in this film are Keye Luke, who plays Wang's elder son and Phillip Ahn playing a nationalist soldier. The film is black and white and is greatly adapted from the novel. Highly recommended for all audiences. ****
