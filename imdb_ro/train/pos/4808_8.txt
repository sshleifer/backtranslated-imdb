YOUNG VICTORIA is a stylish, costume and reproduction gem that benefits from a few fine settings, Jean-Marc Vall√©e's solid direction of the Julian Fellowes version of a young lady who was to become the longest British regent, Victoria. Much of the first part of the film, that part when Victoria is a child whose ascension to the throne is disputed by her mother (Miranda Richardson) and Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong) seems to be dragged and lost in costumes and landscape variations. But once Victoria (Emily Blunt) comes to age and is defeated by Prince Albert (Rupert Friend), the movie blooms. Blunt is a strong actress and finds that the delicate line between girlish love and royal dignity makes it a fine sheet for those in court who would try to control the "baby queen" - including her secretary, Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany). But as she grows up in the role of the queen, her eye is on the German ruler Albert, and a love relationship that lasts in everyone's memories is suited to the concept of joining Royalty with concern for the care of her subjects - to Albert. The film leads us to the birth of their first child in nine, and then ends with a few statements about the influence of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert's effect on different copyrights across Europe! It's an evening of beautiful costume drama and allows us to appreciate the growth of two young women in Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend. A solid if it does not carry epic. <br /> <br /> Grady Harp
