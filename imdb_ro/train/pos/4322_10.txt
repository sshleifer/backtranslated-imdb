Perhaps you will not take care of the social commentary or movie viewpoints (I myself was amazed at the "insignificant" angle) Kasdan seemed to promote when clearly actions taken in the film promote a certain meaning. making me confused). However, there is absolutely no denying the way the story is presented; the magnificent symbolism throughout; threading threads; visual; dialogue? is an absolute master. I have watched the movie a dozen times and I still wonder about its perfection. There is no moment, action, cut or line that is unrelated to the theme. Realistic human performances from all actors. The stage scene is fantastic. I have a pretty enough sapometer. The buzzer never came out during this movie. If you are a thinker (rather than an occasional viewer)? this movie offers. Exponential. Absolutely fascinating. (Do you have to agree with the message to appreciate the screen? Who cares if it made you hot and fuzzy or not, was it interesting?) Personally, did the movie affect me? significant. At the top 5. <br /> <br /> Note: The front page reviewer clearly speaks of a faulty African-American perception. What he did not recognize, is, was there a hand? shake. There is no handing. The "white man dead spiritually" has simply seen a man who respects and admires. And he did something about it. The fact that he was black did not have much to do (the color is simply used to draw the parallel, and for the abyss, it is no accident that the opening sequence changes from black and white to black). If you see the blacks in this movie as a "token"? you may want to reevaluate your anger. You might just see black and white, eh. Just a thought.
