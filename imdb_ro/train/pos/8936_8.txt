After Beau travail, everyone was expecting Claire Denis to make a subsequent masterpiece that never arrived. Now she has it. Denis makes a quantum leap in this film, a superb movie orgy, elliptical editing and deliberately obscure narrative events that feel strange and act even stranger. There is a nominal plot (partly derived from Jean-Luc Nancy's book of the same name) about a mature man who needs a heart transplant and who is looking for a Tahitian son whom he has long abandoned; but especially it is an exploration of the idea of ​​personal and cultural intrusions. It takes a few views to fully understand and has rhythm problems near the end, but it is even more advanced and more exciting than anything I've seen this year. Think of your risk
