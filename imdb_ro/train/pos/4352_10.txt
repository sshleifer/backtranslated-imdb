I looked through the movies in my area on yahoo and saw a movie that had not been published. I looked closer and noticed that Peter Falk and Paul Reiser were in it. After seeing Mad About You, I was not once Paul Reiser's fan. However, I am a great fan of Peter Falk. So husband and husband had a chance. We were both gathered in this story. The beautiful landscapes, the sincere act and the sense of family and moral values ​​that are seldom seen in movies and today's world. It's not that junk digging junk, but real situations in real people's life. I really have to say, Paul Reiser was great, though, I still will not be watching "Mad About You". I do not know where this movie disappeared. I heard he was released into limited liberation. She should be shared with the world. It's one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. M.
