Based on a true story, this series is a jewel in its genre. The slave who becomes queen by capturing the heart of the most powerful man in the village. In the diamond mining town of Tijuco, Brazil, the diamond command - named by the king of Portugal - is the ultimate authority. After growing up in the relative security of her home, the young and beautiful Xica da Silva finds her world threatened when she decides to sell her in a town house, refusing to recognize that a black slave girl may be his daughter. In a desperate attempt to save her, Xica steals diamonds collected by the diamond for the king, intending to use them to escape. The King's army, however, gets to collect diamonds the very next day, and when the loot is missing, the diamond's command is driven in chains, its family dispossessed and thrown in the street with only the clothes on its back. Martin, the son of diamond trade, swears revenge. However, Xica and the other slaves are sold at auction, and Xica ends in the senior sergeant's home, an old man who only bought it to lose his appetite. However, in the city of Tijuco comes the new diamond, the elegant and ruthless Joao Fernandes. Immediately struck by the beauty of Xica, he manipulates the larger sergeant to sell it. And so begins a love story, full of danger, intrigue and passion, between a noble noble and a slave girl who rises one day becoming a queen. The series is full of rich details about the era of beliefs, superstitions, politics, fashion, etc. And even manages to capture your attention for every minute. Sometimes funny, with sarcastic and dark humor, full of suspense and unexpected upsets. "Xica da Silva" is certainly a necessity. I wish I could buy the entire DVD series.
