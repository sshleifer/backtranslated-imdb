What I liked in adapting the Angel of Stone to the screen is that it is so true to the novel! Great movie! As an avid reader, it seems to me that the worst thing about film adaptations is that somehow the book is losing translation. You can say Angel Angel's team was careful not to let that happen with this movie. Ellen Burstyn was an excellent choice for Hagar's role and is certainly a movie superstar. However, I think Canadian actress (Christine Horne) chose to play Hagar in her younger years and did an incredible thing that justifies great praise. I have not seen any previous work of Horne, but I will certainly look for her after seeing her performance Angel Angel. I've heard that the Canadian release of Angel Stone will happen in the spring or summer of 2008. I can not wait to see again on the big screen!
