I notice that the DVD version seems to have missing scenes or lines between FRF posting and launch. <br /> <br /> They have to prove they can win the right to stay in the FRF other than the green team. Another scene is as during their failure to simulate, Kevin gets Joaquin to shrink. I think the VHS edition, other than the ABC, might have all the missing things. Otherwise I like to know which version of DVD has missing stuff. <br /> <br /> The DVD I watched feels edited for television.
