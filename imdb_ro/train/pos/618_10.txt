This movie is great. I was "enchanted", I should say and surprised by the way it was made unique. Distribution, sequencing, effects ... everything! Magnificent! I mean, it was a love story, yeah, but what made it remarkable from the rest was that it was said in a fun and healthy way. For me is the representation of modern fairy tale. It's like the modern peter panel ... just amazing <br /> <br /> I will definitely buy a copy of this moment when it hit the market. This movie is really a double EVERYTHING IS ... !!!! 10 stars for that!
