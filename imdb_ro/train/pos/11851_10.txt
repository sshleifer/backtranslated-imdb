At a time when Hollywood wins money, showing weaknesses, despair, crime, drugs and war, comes the film that reminds us of the concept of "Indomitable Spirit." If you feel beaten, this movie will free your mind and let you grow. We all know how hard life can be, when we have to remind ourselves that persistence and courage will lead us. That made this movie for me and I hope it will be for you.
