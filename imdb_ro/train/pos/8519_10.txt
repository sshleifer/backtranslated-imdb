Amazing ... It might have been a bad attempt to resize the Omen recreational movie, but I enjoyed it. The last man who commented is a madman, this movie was one of Dark Music, Jerry Goldsmith Himself, would have applauded this movie. Wonderful recommendations from me to watch or buy this movie. I'm collecting horror movies Movies and soundtracks, Listen to what I have to say, not to that other idiot. There is one thing that does not fascinate me, the end. According to the Prophecy, it is all inaccurate, including the final conflict, and left behind. But my conclusion being .... There are wonderful movies ... and it should be seen before the Great Depression falls on us, and before the Democrats take over the presidency. So it was signed ... Jacob Eder ... A farmer with a Mastermind.
