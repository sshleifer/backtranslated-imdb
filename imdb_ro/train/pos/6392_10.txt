This independent feature, B & W, DV, shocks, amazes and amuses with its ability to create the craziest situations and then find humor and interest in them. It's fun and ridiculous, yet as absurd as the movie, it's a heart and a reality here that keeps the movie grounded, keeps the whole piece drifting in complete madness, and that's where the real message is. This movie is about how we all will survive in a crazy world. This seems to be the heart of the movie. Because crazy and out of the wall like things, Leon, 30 years old. an old paper protagonist, always keeps trying to keep it together. He is like a child who forever tries to catch the balloon that floats away so that everything works in the best way, so that everyone can have what they want. The act in the film could have gone far beyond the top, but the exceptional tower keeps the piece coherent. Van Meter is perhaps the best in the group here with a spectacle that shines through his sick absurd tics. Just as the characters in the movie do, we look at her sudden bursts to see the real person below. <br /> <br /> Majkowski is a true genius here. He makes the ridiculous overturning and keeps them real. It's the script and its distribution that helps keep the whole thing on the waterline. It is a true testament to Majkowski's skill and all involved in the fact that this film, with its plot and characters, never makes us nervous. Majkowski took a film that could have been abrasive and repellent, and gave him some heart and humor. This is a unique movie. Not to be missed. <br /> <br />
