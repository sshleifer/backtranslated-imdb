Do not be influenced by the gods. This is a wonderful scary movie. This was a thesis project for writer / director JT Petty. She did a great job to have me at the edge of the chair. I never knew what to expect, and for a terrible horror movie, that's Nirvana! The film refers to an elderly man living in an isolated cabin in the woods. One day, while looking for a cat in the woods, is it witnessing the killing of a child, or not? He agonizes about the rest of the movie. What is most unusual about this movie is that here there is no dialogue until the last scenes. We have found that this is interesting. The writer manages to bring your senses and gives them a tireless tug. Let go of this movie, you will not be disappointed.
