When I looked for the first time, I borrowed it from our local library about a year ago and I saw it three times. I just saw it again and liked it more than I did the last time I looked at it! :) :() The movie is mainly about two dogs called Charlie and Itchy (will by Dom DeLuise and I love Dom DeLuise!). Charlie is half a gangster and a half good, which I like. Soul is his friend. Charlie is murdered by his friend (NO) and sent to heaven. When Charlie returns to life, it is the start of an amazing adventure. Five main reasons why I'm absolutely CRAZY about this movie: One: I like the characters (except for Carface). The most preferred are Charlie, Itchy and a little girl named Anne-Marie who comes a little later. Two: I like the history period in which this film is set. It is set during the ban in the United States. Three: Don Bluth animation (as usual) is superb. And the background is good. Four: There is a strange enthusiasm in this movie that keeps me at the edge of the chair. Five: The songs in this movie are great. My favorite song starts with "I need Brazil, stutter, thrill" ... So watch this great movie when you can, you will not be disappointed! :);) :()
