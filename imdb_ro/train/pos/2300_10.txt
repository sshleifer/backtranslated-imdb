This movie has so many wonderful elements for it! Reese Witherspoon's debut performance is, of course, great, but her chemistry with Jason London. The point is remarkable, bright and pure. James Newton Howard improves the quality of any movie he composes ten times. He also seems to have a talent for the lost films of youth days, make sure you catch him for the recent "Peter Pan" and haunted gothic music of the "Village". I first saw this movie at 13 or 14 years and now I'm not only crying at the end, I shed a tear or two for nostalgia. Show this movie to your girls This will become a lifetime comfort film.
