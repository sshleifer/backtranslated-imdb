This movie is a real jewel. The plot of the plot is defined in the first 3 minutes, the characters are sympathetic and clearly drawn, their motives being completely credible. Dialogue is fresh and oh so real. Situations are unique for characters and not run or disturbed. Up to the climax, that is. Then it's like the movie came out a bit of itself and became a little hooded and incredible. But I do not want to discourage people from watching this movie. The first three quarters of it are truly remarkable. I gave her a 8. There are some remarkable shows here. See this movie.
