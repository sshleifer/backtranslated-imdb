There is not much happening in this movie, but a lot of meanings. The woman believed she had everything she could alive, but that was not really true, and she found out when she met a person doing research for her next job. There should be more types of such films, I'm not as old as they think they are "mature" (im 13 on the road) and I still have the idea and the movie point. The main point is in my opinion: DO NOT KNOW YOU SHOULD NOT LEAVE A BETTER LIFE, THEN IF YOU ARE ACT ONE. Although I have to admit that I thought of seeing another movie, but after reading all the reviews and seeing the trailer, I decided this even if I did not know too much action in the movie. I recommend someone to watch this movie because it has a lot of points in the movie and is a very good ending.
