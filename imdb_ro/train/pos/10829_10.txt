I watched the movie in a preview and I really liked it. The tower is excellent, and the plot is sometimes absolutely hilarious. Another highlight of the movie is certainly the music, which hopefully will be released soon. I recommend to all who like British humor and especially to all musicians. Go and see. It's great.
