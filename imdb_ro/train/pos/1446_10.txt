Is Al Pacino ever in a bad movie? His name seems to be impressive for the top cinema. This is an equally good performance he ever gave. Pacino is an American Olivier. And this is a political thriller as good as they are. They're not good boys or bad guys. But the system has an inexorable effect on people who think I'm driving it. Not only is Pacino's performance convincing - the gullige at the funeral of the dead child is extremely strong - the film has a quick and dull realism that improves its performance without resorting to tricks. This extraordinary portrayal of city politics also manages to provide two hours of gorgeous movies watching without violence, exaggerated sex or gutter language. It's a crime. There are bad people. But they meet efficiently without crossing the line. A movie like this restores my belief in Hollywood. Do not agree too many dozens. It deserves it rich!
