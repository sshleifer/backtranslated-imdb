This has long been one of my favorite adaptations of an Austen novel. Although it's certainly not in the same category as the spectacular "Pride and Prejudice," "Emma" is a lush and fairly true television version of Austen's novel - especially considering its short length. The biggest change between the novel and the film is a good one, because the useless snobbitch that Austen presents at the end of the story is removed here and replaced by someone much more like Emma's character in the rest of the book. I thought the characters chosen to represent the roles were well selected. Kate Beckinsale crosses the fine line between pride and social snob, with a totally lost grace in the '96 of Gwyneth Paltrow. Samantha Morton's blonde lock matches her attitude and character, while the simper that accompanies her role in previous characters is replaced by Harriet that we know from the book. Mr Knightly's role is very good in my opinion; both the seriousness and the gentle compassion that the hero is painted in the novel are present here in this very neglected and sumptuous film.
