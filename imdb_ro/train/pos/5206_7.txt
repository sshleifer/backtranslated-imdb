This Evil Breed: Legend of Samhain contains very little thought or effort. It's ridiculed with ultra-fast "slasher" death and simple acts of dying. The actor was rated D, and actors show very little skill, and their stupidity in the film is too questionable. The way they represented what people behave like their age was incredibly different. The strange division of porn fits with the thought that it really does not offer too much, and any area that is respectable, but is pretty fast executed with absolute intellectual death. An example is the poor person who is destroyed from the anus and the scene takes about 5 minutes. It is extremely obvious how little the children have put up with. This movie is a good choice for someone who likes to watch terrible deaths and basically to torture.
