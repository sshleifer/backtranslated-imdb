What can I say was not told about "The Haunting"? It has everything that would make a wonderful picture. Wonderful sets, moody music and sound design to die were all in place. The script, however, sometimes riches the mind in such a strange, surrealistic way. The whole team must have forgotten to read it, perhaps because they were too busy to create cg effects and build gothic sets to see how poor the plot was. Each member of the play offers a dignified performance, though with little conviction of the material at hand. Lili Taylor has the most to do, while the others react the most. But that's about it. All I can say is that it was a pleasant hour for two hours, but you will certainly want more. A lot more.
