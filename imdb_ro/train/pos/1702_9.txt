If you have problems with dreaming, you can give this movie a low rating. But you just have to realize that this movie was not made to please everyone, just people with a sense of humor. For those people the movie is great! She plays on old science fiction films and long-time radio shows, most of the witch where B-rated. Along the lines of Spaceballs and Airplane 2, you may need to stretch your imagination a little to get the jokes, but it's worth it.
