Here's the love story I love to watch. And especially for two reasons. One, focuses on young, very young. People who are still in adolescence and are experiencing love for the first time, or at least think they are. We've all been there in our lives, and "Man on the Moon" is a wonderful reflection on our memories, adding some details and improving it further than any of us have experienced. The second reason is that it is a triangle of love. And I think, as teenagers, it is the most dramatic. And the story is so well developed that you think the characters might really be in love or are so new to love that they strongly believe they are after such a tragedy or so it will happen they will believe it in the rest of their lives . <br /> <br /> The Man on the Moon Tower is full of talented names. His name is Sam Waterston, who is truly a versatile actor, capable of playing resident lawyers as well as strict parents but caregivers and wise men in this film. There are also Tess Harper, Jason London and a young, young Reese Witherspoon. You look at the talented young actress at the age of fourteen, and you think about ten years on the way she will win the Academy Award. All the members of the band take away their outstanding performances and, with the appealing scenario dialog, they get rich to show themselves as real people in real situations. As if it really were. This type of movie I'd like to see more often. Love story or not. I'd love to see movies that make everything look real, and it's not fake or unbelievable in any way.
