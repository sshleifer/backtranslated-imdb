I just came back from a screening a few hours ago and I was very pleased with the movie when I left it. It's very intense and the closest I came to cry in a movie for some time. This is a credit to Adam Sandler, which offers a magnificent multi-level performance that probably deserves an Oscar for him if he does not come out so early this year. Don Cheadle gives the glorious ordinary performance that the right man plays in front of Adam. It's a bit of humor, but most of it is even funny compared to tearjerking moments, as Adam deals with his loss, and Don is struggling to help him. Adam plays two levels very well ... when he is mentally stable, it is fun and pleasant, but when he is less stable, he is strong and dark. I recommend you to anyone who likes intense mental dreams about difficult friendship and loss.
