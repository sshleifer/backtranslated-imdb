This is a hard-cooking Warner Brothers movie with a very young Barbara Stanwyck. An accomplished master in portraying Machiavellian's cold, a technique she'd perfected eleven years later in Billy Wilder's "Double Benefit," Stanwyck interprets Lily Powers, the worn daughter of a violent speakeasy owner in a city choking steel. She has been honest and numb for years since she was offered as a sexual favor to her father's clients. Once her dad dies in a distillery explosion, she hits a freight train to New York and literally sleeps up to the corporate scale of a bank. This would have been so absurd if Stanwyck's ignition was not working here. With her seductive methods, with her dead eyes, it's easy to understand why men become dependent on her aggressive carnalness. One of the young people he's on the road is a wholehearted John Wayne like a scientist named Jimmy McCoy. The melodrama is headed hard towards the last third of the film, with a suicide murder, a sad job in Paris to keep Lily quiet and the new president of the bank who is so dependent on Lily to divert the company's funds to keep her luxurious . One end on the head is somewhat disappointing, but not before Stanwyck hit the screen. The film has curious touches as Lily's friendship with an African-American woman called Chico and the German immigrant who teaches Lily about Nietzsche's philosophy of the importance of avoiding sentimentality.
