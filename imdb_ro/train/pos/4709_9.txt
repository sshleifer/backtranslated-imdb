Okay - I confess. This is the movie that made me love what Michael Keaton could do. He makes a beautiful parody of someone making a parody of James Cagney with a spare charm. Those who support the cast are all solid laborers and will go well and will do a good job in this comedy of the 1980s. A paradise of gangster films of the 1930s and 1940s, is constantly breaking the land with remarkable original material. (Well, yes - some of them have been copied from time to time - but when this movie was made, it was original and much of it was not copied elsewhere.) Watch Joe Piscopo, warn people not to make ______ with one of the best taglines of spoofs. Look at Roman Moronie doing things with the profanity of English that would make your teacher laugh your grammar spinster. Look at stunning view galleries such as the pet store owner Johnny Kelly, using the price weapon on his chickens and his chicken dust. Watch the world's biggest sex education education ever. Look at the most amazing statement of the Latin church made, while a guy who has never taken the store class assembles a Thompson machine gun on the sides. Track the lines you will use in occasional conversations for the next decade. Watch Maureen Stapleton makes the perfect antithesis to working mother with surprise gags that you will never see coming. If you see a gag that does not hit your funny bone, be patient - another will come in 30 seconds or less, and chances are, you will have to pause until you finish multiple times on the floor. Duck and rabbits? And they. Watch the subtle things - some of the viewing galleries can go unnoticed the first few views. There are some minor flaws - but it is probably the best of spoofs. Some come close, but none of them are so good.
