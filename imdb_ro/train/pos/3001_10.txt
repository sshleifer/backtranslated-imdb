Cracking good threads with all the actors that give great value. Michael Curtiz at the best. A lot of beautiful twists and turns and probably the best of the Philo Vance series. William Powell looks awfully relaxed and his best friend. A precursor of the Thin Man series. Recommend to everyone. Have you understood everything?
