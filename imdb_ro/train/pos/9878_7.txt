almost every review of this movie I saw was pretty bad. It's not bad enough, actually it's pretty good, though not great. The character of Judy Garland could have become annoying, but he did not allow her to do it. Somewhere along the line, I became a fan of consolation, arrogant, who surpassed Van Heflin, at least in the early 1940s. Judy's songs are wonderful, but the movie missed a great chance by not showing more about their relationship. I gave her a 7.
