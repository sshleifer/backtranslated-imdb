Rohmer returns to his historical drama in the real story of Grace Elliot, an English woman who stayed in France during the apex of the French Revolution. I've always suspected that Rohmer was a conservative, but he knew he was so reactive with red blood. If you can put aside Rohmer's monastic defense (and this is not an easy thing to do, since, for example, the French lower classes are portrayed here as hideous louts), this is actually an elegant movie, smart and polished. Lacking money for a great filmmaking of France in the eighteenth century, Rohmer has the actors to play against painted cartons. It's an artificial rage, but it works somehow. And newcomer Lucy Russell manages to make a nice character that should not be.
