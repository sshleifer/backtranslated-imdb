This is not a good movie, but I still like it. Clovis cat is golden in a jar, as well as premise of cats themselves - intrinsically opposed to bad Sleepwalkers. I think there is more to this film than people realize, it is practically very rough, but this sudden may sometimes be good. It has horn lines, the sudden end, and a comic item sent by the cops. Has anyone found the incestuous element a bit disturbing? Eventually this film is casually random and random, which is quite effective, akin to Psycho - the relationship between mother and son, changing protagonists. I think the bruise also works, it's not a movie you want to prolong, but if it's short. I'm still not sure if the director was not deep, or if he did these things with purpose, we know that Stephen King has skills, yet I have not even read his books, I've seen only a few of his films. Anyway, I liked it. If you like hard movies with 80 minutes, watch it. but did not expect you too much. It's really so bad to him.
