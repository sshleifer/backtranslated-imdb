Cuban blood is one of those sleeping movies that has a lot to say about life in a very traditional way. In fact, I saw her while sailing around Cuba on a Western Caribbean cruise. She details the life of an 11-year-old boy in a small town in Cuba in 1958 and 1959 during the revolution. There is not much time until the end of the revolution, when the socialist regime came and took the boy's father's property. Most of the movie is the boy's age and relationships that occur in a small town where everyone knows everyone else. There are some powerful scenes that everyone can refer to. A Class A movie with action and fine direction. This is a movie that tells a story without special effects or big schemes or real twists. It's a movie about people and their lives, about their mistakes and their triumphs. A good movie worth watching several times a year.
