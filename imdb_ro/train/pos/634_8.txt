I was one of about 200 people who were fortunate enough to see an early sniff of this film. Stardust follows Tristan, a young man, in a search to find a fallen star and bring her back to the woman she loves to prove her love for her. The only catch is that the star fell on the other side of the wall, a door between England and a magical kingdom known as Stormhold. This movie was just a joy to watch, has something for everyone, all the action scenes are beautiful, and the comedy is spreading through the movie that makes it funny without being a horn. If we had to compare to another movie, it should probably be The Princess Bride, a classic. All the performances are remarkable, beautiful Claire Danes makes you love her in her portrait of Yvaine the incredibly naive star and under Michelle Pfeiffer lends a star over top performance like Larnia ... but the performance of talking about Robert De Niro ... In every scene in his hands, he steals the show ... <br /> <br /> If you are in the mood for a funny fantasy love story this movie is. Boys do not turn off by describing that there is enough action comedy and not to mention a bunch of candy-eyes with Claire Danes and Michelle Pfeiffer to have fun all the time. Cinematography is dead and keeps with the sensation of the movie ... nothing about the film seems to be forced.
