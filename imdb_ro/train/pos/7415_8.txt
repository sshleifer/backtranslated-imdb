How powerful and captivating can be the production of quality film. This film tells his story with everyday scenes that manage to uncover the hidden poetry inside. It is true, as the others have said, how truly this film really shows how lost Hollywood is in its special effects, exaggerated emotionality and climatic climates, and forget the essence of a sensitive story with a simple realism. So much of what is going on these characters is suggested by the scene rather than a dialogue with a word. One aspect that I really liked the film was the contrast of the two brothers, one so expressively open in his childhood, and the other completely stoic, but both able to evoke deep emotions. The older brother had to say a little, as he used to, it was all in front of him! Beautiful cinematography, great action, excellent direction! Not to be missed!
