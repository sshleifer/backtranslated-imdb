Call me bad, but I really loved the horror movie in 2001, Valentine. It was so well done, well written, well acting, well tuned, etc! Everything about it was great! There were parts that were relatively routine (Lily's death), very funny (www.Bleed-Me-Dry.com), totally frightening and creepy (Paige's death) and just laughable (the first scene). I think all of the cast has done a good job, especially the three stars: David Boreanaz, Denise Richards (both of whom I met and I got autographs during the filming of this movie - very nice people!) And Marley Shelton. br /> <br /> I am very sick of people who call this movie "Another Scream Scream". This movie is by no means a Scream clone. In fact, this movie runs around Scream. In fact, it does SENSE! Scream was also not the only movie containing a masked murderer in it. Excuse me, but it seems that Scream was also a clone (ah ..., Friday, December 13, Halloween and many other scary movies included masked murderers). I also think the novelty of the concealed murderer is brilliant. It's so strange to see a sweet face, a cupid that makes all these things horrible. Another novelty (bleeding nose) makes room for a fantastic ending! The end gives me chills every time I see it !!!!! So even if you did not like it for the first time, look at Valentine again and give him another chance! PS- Keep an Eye on My New Website (WWW.LOVE-HURTS.ORG)! Soon...
