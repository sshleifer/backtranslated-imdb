Located in a middle-class neighborhood in the imaginary town of Willard in the 1950s, this dark comedy with light toys with such American obsessions, such as guns and violence, materialism and taking into account Jones, fear of others, slavery, and the layout of the dead. Yeah, it sounds a little hard, but believe me in it, it's almost as easy as a feather. Zombies are visibly displayed among the characters. Crucial questions will arise, such as who will become a zombie (90% of Willard people choose this final path, while only 10% prefer a traditional funeral)? Who owns how many zombies bid as robots (have become a trademark of social status)? And what is the range of possible relationships that can be resolved between the living and the re-incarnated? In a way, director Andrew Currie, who co-wrote the lively screenplay (with Robert Chomiak and Dennis Heaton), keeps this material unlikely percolating for an hour and a half, laughs well. A superior distribution helps Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker, Henry Czerny, Tim Blake Nelson, Mary Black and Sonja Bennett, who are helped by the young K'Sun Ray as Timmy, the innocent child with a good heart acting as the right testimony to all the weakness of the adults. (After I only saw it in "Memento" and "The Matrix", I had no idea that Mrs. Moss had such a nice piece of comedy). Production design and music are exquisite 50s at a tee. Maybe this is not for everyone. It will definitely be a hard-to-beat movie for my annual Bizarro Award. But intelligent comedies that remain funny from start to finish are among the heaviest achievements made in film production. For me anyway, "Fido" is a hohot! My classes: 8.5 / 10 (A-) (See on 01/30/07)
