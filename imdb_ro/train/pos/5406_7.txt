The fourth Pok√©mon movie made me cry when Celebi died. Do not dare say that Pokemon is shit! I do not like when people say that ... I liked Pokemon for 5 or 6 years, so everyone should enjoy Pokemon, including this movie and other Pokemon movies. So without any further signs, please say that Pokemon is great and should enjoy people of all ages. And why do Pokemon killers give low ratings for all or most Pokemon movies? I do not understand .... It should not do that .... There is absolutely no reason why people should just vote without proving that Pokemon sucks besides that: 1) Pokemon is just for small children. 2) Pokemon is stupid. and 3) People should not like Pokemon. I think that's why people do not like Pokemon.
