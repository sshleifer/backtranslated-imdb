"Thieves and liars" gives us a very naturalistic description of the levels of corruption that affects many Puerto Ricans and forces them to make difficult, if not impossible, choices about their lives and their loved ones. The distribution is excellent, as some are non-personal actors; an excellent choice that increases the level of reality in the movie. The photo propels the story without penetration, as it should be in this type of movie. The script captures very deeply the idiosyncrasies and attitudes of "Boricuas". Sometimes it feels like watching a documentary! Watching this movie, you feel as though you have entered secretly into the real society of Puerto Rican and stay invisible by forgetting to explode. I liked!
