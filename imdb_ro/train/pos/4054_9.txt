The first time I saw this movie was again in the 1980s as a boy. My father actually recorded it on the TV. I've probably seen more than 20 times before the relatively recent DVD release. Of course I bought and I saw the DVD and I was surprised at how much the dialogue changed. In the first version, which I still have on VHS, the film's mood due to the dialogue was actually very dark. However, the new version, with Van Der Beek and others, is much more comical. To put it in a different way, it's like looking at Akira's original version with that oak before watching the Japanese version of the literal version. I'm not crying at all, the story and the quality of the animation are not lost, but it raises the question of whether Miyazaki intended an easier or darker narrative and a theme in his movie .....
