We have to remember that the 1950s were practically an empty piece when it came to the movies. Hollywood has been in transition from patriotic war films, noir, two reels, and so on. to movies with a message. I had the Blackboard jungle, on the water bank, and so on. Some people might think it was an improvement. I do not know. Who was the mogul who said: If you want to send a message, call Western Union? He was right. These psychological thrillers are less entertaining than some kind of remote therapy. This is a pip. It's about three sisters trying to ruin their control of their father's legacy. One of them, perhaps the only one who deserves redemption, draws attention to the help of the company's pilot to help keep the rest of the family empty. He is originally in it for dollars, but ultimately falls for it. Meanwhile, the rest of the family schemas will sabotage romance. The results are predictable. You have a little in this movie. Sexual tension between sisters. A subtle masochism. Hereditary failure - if there is such a thing. We never get to meet our parents, but they must have been really hurt. The distribution is virtually unknown. One or two actors are vaguely familiar. The actor is so bad that it's hard to believe. It was released under the umbrella of the United Artists by a company called Bel-Air Productions. She was shot in and around LA especially at night and probably without permission. The end was so bizarre that I thought it was a joke. It was as if they had no money and the producer decided to wrap it in the middle of a scene. I can not explain - not even myself - but I've given this pile of rubbish 8/10. I'm familiar with the term "It's so bad that's good," but I do not think I've ever met the phenomenon. Well, maybe "Hot Rods in Hell", but this definitely suits. You might want to try this if you like movies that seem to be made in someone's basement.
