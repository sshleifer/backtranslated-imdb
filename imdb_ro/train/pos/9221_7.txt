Once again, I sail through the discount bin and get this movie for 4.88 USD. Fifty percent of the time that the movies they find in the trash are stupid (it means terrible beyond belief), but half the time turns out to be surprisingly good. This movie is much better than I expected. It seemed very interesting to me, although it was obviously made by an amateur. Direction is nothing special, but the story is interesting with some good emotions. I expected it to be more of a comedy, but I was not too disappointed. For a thriller, this movie is surprisingly good-nature. There is no bloody violence, no profanity, no nudity, no sex. Typically, these films require all four elements. The PG rating is well worth it - not as "Sixteen candles", where the word "f" is used twice and there is a short nude free excuse. I just want the romance between Corey Haim and love could have been more developed. The film tends to be hard to plot, and good potential sublots are pushed to the side. Instead of developing a chemistry between the two, we get to see a three-minute careless fit on them in their romantic efforts. They end kissing at the end, but there is so little chemistry that seems to be forced. "The dream car" is not a jewel, but it is a good and clean fun. It's quite forgetful - especially with a cast of unknowns, except for Haim - but it's much better than you expected. My score: 7 (out of 10)
