I was quite young when she went out to the US, but I recorded it from the TV and watched it again until I had everything memorized. Until today I get caught by quoting it. The show itself was hilarious and had many famous characters, from Frank Sinatra, to Sylvester Stallone, to T. Vocile, were wonderful and sounded the same as the characters they had portrayed. And the puppet was well made, though a little creepy. I was surprised to learn recently that it was written by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor of the Red Dwarf, a show that I also enjoy very much. As another person wrote in a comment earlier, I was robbed of this great show by a "friend" who borrowed it and never returned it. I hope there would have been enough demand for this show to justify the release of a DVD, but I do not think enough people have been heard. Well, maybe I'll try e-bay ...
