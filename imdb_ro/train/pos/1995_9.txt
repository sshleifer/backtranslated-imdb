I have just seen this recently, after almost forty years. He is well versed, especially the remarkable songs of Lionel Bart. ("Who Buys", with a magic counterpoint, just one of the many standouts.) I disagree with the other post that qualified G rating. The rating system, new at that time, never intended the G (General) to mean "completely conflict-free". Characterizing him as inappropriate for children, he reminded me of the description I once saw the Wizard of Oz: A girl arrives in a strange country and kills the first person she meets. She then goes on a trip with three passengers and kills again.
