I gave her a rating of 8 stars. The story may have dropped around three-quarters of the way, but performance has remained stronger. "Men of Honor" has been changed from "Navy Diver" obviously. Anyone who has served in any branch of the armed forces will likely feel that "honor" is a suitable word to use in the title.
