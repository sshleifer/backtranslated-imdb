This is a direct-video movie, so it should be self-evident that it will not rival the first king of the lion, but that was absolutely good. My children loved this, but that's once, they love everything is a cartoon. The big shock was that I also liked it, laughed funny in some parts (even fart jokes), had a lot of creative ties with the first film and even some jokes that had to be or older to understand (but without being risqu√© like in Shrek ("do you think she pays anything?")). A special note about fart jokes, I was surprised to find that none of the jokes were just the noise of the toilet (in fact, there was almost no noise / imagery, the references were actually quite subtle), they actually had a set / punchline / etc and were close to good taste. I'd like my kids to think it's more humorous than going to the bathroom, and this movie is good about it. Hmm what else? The music was so, not as creative as in the first or second film, but a lot of fun for the kids. There were no painful moments, which was a blessing to me. A little action, but not too scary (NIMH's secret gave me children's nightmares, surely a G rating was not right for that ...) Overall, I would say it's a movie wonder for kids of all ages, one that is 100% sure to watch (I'm trying not to be too sensitive but I had to jump and stop the TV during some movies that were less suitable for kids than expected) - but you're safe to You leave the room during this time. I would say, however, that you are standing anyway, you may find that you like it too :)
