Raising immediately after Moscow's demonstration of supremacy, this is Bourne's greatest adventure and final climax. Over the course of 115 minutes, the film takes Bourne from Russia to Madrid, Paris, Morocco, and finally to New York. Damon is every inch of a hardly trained killer, Robert Ludlum imagined, he's the deadliest spy in movies right now, and the emotion backed by his character that makes him so credible is exactly how Damon manages to combines these two polar oppositions of his own, breathtaking. In this third one, Bourne is on a mission to save his soul and, while pursuing it, Ultimatum offers such a high performance that you will feel sweaty and take a look at its truly powerful branch of ideas and shootouts; look for just two successful cars and a battle scene as realistic as the Bond vs. Shaw of the '63. Director Greengrass went with this appealing thriller and this is probably as exciting as cinematic thrillers; a real salary for Bourne fans and a new spy-thriller race.
