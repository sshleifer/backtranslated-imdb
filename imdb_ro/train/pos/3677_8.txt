Luckily, he saw this on a plane in Singapore recently (I thought I missed him at Cinemalaya filmfest). Paris, is t'aime is a collection of 20 shorts (about 5 minutes each) of 20 directors showing love in different pockets of contemporary Paris. One of my favorites is "Parc Monceau" by Alfonso Cuarn (Great Wait, Harry Potter and Prisoner of Azkaban), which was made in one continuous blow and portrays Nick Nolte. Coen Brothers '' Tuileries '' plays Steve Buscemi as a tourist subway was hilarious! Juliette Binoche and Willem Dafoe in "Place des Victoires" were haunting. For Maggie Gyllenhaal as American actress / druggie in the "Quartier des Enfants Rouges" to portray anticipation and anger in such a short period of time it was just brilliant. Elijah Wood as a vampire victim in the Quartier de la Madeleine was quite surreal, while Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell played a cute couple in Wes Craven's "Pre-Lachaise". Natalie Portman was beautiful, as usual, the girlfriend of the actress of a failing French boy from Faubourg Saint-Denis. But, despite the many portraits of young love, a more mature execution of Gena Rowlands in the "Quartier Latin" was equally inducement. This film is perfect for those with ADHD, because each sequence is driven and thoughtful. There are also a number of memorable quotes. One of these is that of a deceptive husband who ultimately leaves the mistress to stay with his wife dying in the last few days: "Pretending to be a loved man, he became a loved man."
