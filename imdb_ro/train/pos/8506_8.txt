. . . But it was on a UHF channel, and the reception was very unclear. I really would like to have the movie, because the reason I first saw it is that I am a bus driver, and at the time I saw this movie, I drive the bus model. Only (during his murder trial, about 15 years later) I vaguely remember that JO was one of the stars in her. I just remember he was the driver and the bus was shot and driven wild. I looked everywhere for this film without any help because I saw it in the mid-1980s. I liked the movie, I usually do not look at the thrillers, but after reading the summary in the TV guide and seeing the beginning (though fuzzy) I stayed for everything.
