In Cinema Retro # 2, it is revealed that Mark Lester's voice was actually called by a 20-year-old woman, Kathe Green. Although Leste was considered perfect for the lead role, director Carol Reed was not at all satisfied with his singing skills. The secret was revealed by a 2004 UK documentary entitled "Oliver! After They Famous". Greene was paid 400 pounds for her work and had to agree to keep her secret participation, like Mark Lester. They kept their word and revealed this fact only in the decades after the release of the film. For recording, Mark Lester withdrew from acting and is a practicing osteopath in England.
