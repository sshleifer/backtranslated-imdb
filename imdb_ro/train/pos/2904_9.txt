This film is the second immersion of Damian Szifr√≥n in films after his excellent character study in "El Fondo del Mar". With "Tiempo De Valientes," he creates extremely good characters, far from prototypes and unprecedented chemistry. We have seen Szifron's talent to present each character in a light but sufficient way to get emotionally involved with them. Controlling them is magnificent, so he restores the movie's excellent direction and a shiny polish scenario, the characters laugh and cry with a real feeling and invites the spectator to join their emotions and evolution on the screen. <br /> <br /> <br /> Spanish takes English, the Buenos Aires urban scene replaces the Hollywood sets at night, and the premise is as exciting as any other, so we have a bold movie to compete with Hollywood Machines. <br /> <But I want you to watch the movie, mainly because I never have such attractive characters, all of this. It seems the scenario fits perfectly to the actors and vice versa. I really believe that in a movie that does so, Argentina is really at the contest.
