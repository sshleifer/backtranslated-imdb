Here's a rare precious stone for those of you who have not seen or, most likely, have not even heard of it. In the 1980s, Dennis Quaid was a hot product, but in the early 1990s Dennis Quaid disappeared from the stage. In 1993, he broke back on the big screen with three films, of which he unfortunately bombed. "Wilder Napalm" is a crazy movie about two brothers, Wallace (Quaid) and Wilder (Arliss Howard), whom they love very much. are ... beginners of fire: yes, they have the power of pyrokinetics. Wilder decided not to use his power (for anything else it is not useful anyway) after a fatal incident during his youth, where he and his brother exploded an abandoned house that killed a man who was inside their least known. At present, Wilder is a firefighter and is married to Vida (Debra Winger), who is in house arrest, guess what, arson (see the movie to better understand this). Also, Wilder did not talk to Wallace in 5 years, because Wallace left his hair on fire during his bachelor party. Wallace loves the power of nature and uses it for fun. He also carries a carnival and is the clown of his head. When the carnival comes to Wilder's town, Wallace decides to reunite with his brother and see Vida, whom Wallace loves! Mr Vida's arrest has come to an end, but Wilder is preoccupied. So Wallace comes in and the fun begins. Brother vs. brother ... fighting with fire! <br /> <br /> Some big fireball throwing in this movie ... eat your heart out, Drew Barrymore! The film also has some really strange but funny elements, such as Wilder's fire unit, playing acapella songs during the fighting and after the wards. Jim Varney (known globally as "Ernest") appears as Wallace's carnival friend. "Wilder Napalm" is brilliantly shot ... and cleverly built ... very close to the wall and avant-garde. Have a look ...
