The story is fluent. There is no interruption. Flash blocks are currently worn without problems. Casting was superb. Young Ya'ara showed very much that Ya'ara would have looked at that age. Her portrayal of a blind person was convincing. Director Daniel Syrkin has done a great job in making the different actors collaborate in this story. The cinema is very good. You feel as if you were with Ya'ara and Talia going to the ocean to the edge of the cliff. The English subtitles follow the Hebrew script very carefully. It is interesting to note that although "Out of sight" is not a direct translation of "Lemarit Ayin" Both names are very appropriate for the story.
