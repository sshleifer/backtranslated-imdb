Good. This has been a favorite since the age of 14. Granted, I do not see it more than once a year, but ... This is not an older generation movie that wants a deeper sense or a brilliant message. This movie is FUN. It's pretty dated, almost passive, but Parker Posey is so brilliant that it's unbelievable. If you want to be charmed by a 90-year-old breakfast at Tiffany's, you have been playing 90-year-old concerts or I love Parker, this movie is for you. Otherwise, do not bother.
