I grew up with H.R. Pufnstuff and Jack Wild, talented and now my daughters also adore Jack Wild's fans. This movie is exactly what the movies should be: fun and fun. This film is not limited to children. A lot of dialogue is aimed at adults, and Witchiepoo's performance is something you do not want to lose. The music in this movie fits nicely with Jack Wild and Mama Cass. And like a Jack Wild fan, I would never lose my chance to see him dancing or listening to him singing. Knowing the hard life that Jack had made even more wonderful, especially when singing the opening song "If I Can." It makes me stop in love loving for him because he gave me wonderful childhood memories that I now send to my children. Let's go to the Island of Life where there is friendship and fun! And keep Jack Wild's memory alive by passing Pufnstuff to others.
