This movie is right. As an Aviation USAF Gift, I can tell you that this movie has everything. Tedium of the application process. Waiting for the word. The joy of acceptance. You're worried about doing the course. The sadness of looking at friends (probably the best of them) washes. The truth of paying the final price - the death of student planes. The glory of graduation. Always flight, flight, flight. Many are called, but few are elected. We made for payment what we would have been eager to do.
