I have seen this jewel of a movie in Cannes, where she has been part of two weeks of directors. Welcome to Collinwood is not gorgeous at all. A great fun all the time, with all the members of a powerful casting acting on their socks. It's a hard comedy sometimes about a small liar (Cosimo, played by Luis Guzman) who is caught trying to steal a car and sent to prison. While in prison, he meets a "living man" who tells him "the most beautiful bellini"? which for you and me? is a safe scheme of rapid enrichment. Apparently there is a way out of a deserted building in the city's jewelers store? which could be millions of euros. Does it sound simple? ?? well throw in all sorts of wacky characters and incidents along the way and you have the ingredients for a wild walk! ?? the word passes from a low loser to another and soon a team of them is assembled to try to win money on Cosimos 'bellini' s lead by the failed Pero boxer (superbly played by Sam Rockwell - surely a star in production) and reluctant (William H. Macy), who is forced to bring his child with him because his wife was jailed for fraud! <br /> <br /> Based on the Italian film I Soliti igniti (Big Deal on Madonna Street) that also inspired a movie similar to "Collinwood"? `Palookaville". This has struck spots in the last effort, and although his writing and direction by the Russo Brothers certainly has Coen brothers' nuances about it. Produced by Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney, who has a small but hilarious part as a safe breaker.
