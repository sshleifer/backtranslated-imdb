Yesterday, I went to the cinema myself, because here in Mexico, movies from other countries are often part of the so-called alternative cammer. But after seeing this movie, I realized that not all foreign movies are alternative. Fortunately, this is a good example. But I have to say that I liked this movie so much ... that at the end I was happy ... this film is a small spoon of hope these days. And the main lesson for me ... is that at the end of the day ... love is the main force behind us. This is a good option to see a good Spanish movie ... and I have to mention good music .. especially the main song of the movie .. Cosas que hacen que la vida valga la pena ... Excellent song! !!
