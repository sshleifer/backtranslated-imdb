What is most disturbing about this film is not that the soul-killing school as described actually happens, but the truth is that they are made by adolescents like Cal and Andre ... normal children with normal families. Using a handheld technique on a Blair Witch, Ben Coccio manages to bring to life two friends who have problems with high school, although we are not told exactly what lies behind these problems. They seem to be typical - a lot of people hate high school, so what? Some of you just do not think they'll ever make the very good massacre on Zero Day. Scene surveillance cameras in school during shooting are all the stronger for this reason. You can not believe it really happens and it really happened. Handheld camera technology also creates the illusion that it is not a scripted movie, a brilliant idea taking into account the subject.
