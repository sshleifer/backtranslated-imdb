This movie would usually classify as the worst film production ever. Ever. But, in my opinion, it is probably the funniest one. The awesome direction and script make this movie invaluable. I bought my movie as I pass through the bargain DVD to my pound shop. I and a few of my friends have often watched rather drunk. It soon appeared that it was not a normal movie. Instead, a priceless relic of what James Cahill's most recent film might be. At first we were confused and shouted that the DVD player was stopped, but fortunately in our abnormal state no one could be disturbed. Instead, I watched the movie right through. Finally, I realized that I found some dream of shedding, something that you laugh in acceptable for hours, laughing for all the wrong reasons. We soon showed all our other friends and also agreed, it was not a great movie work. This was a movie that you can really fill to laugh. This was a movie that anyone can enjoy. He was a genius.
