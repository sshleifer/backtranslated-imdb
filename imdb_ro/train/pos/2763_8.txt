People tend to complain about the number of films made about people with mental disabilities. I do not see this as a valid critique, no more than complaints of too many films about any kind of people. Jaco van Dormael does a wonderful job with script and direction. Daniel Auteuil and Pascal Duquenne work perfectly together, and Duquenne is playing virtually. The film covers a surprisingly large area of ​​events and is simply not content with going over what has been seen in "Rain Man". The end is pretty depressing, but it does not destroy the wonderful story that came before. 7.8 out of 10
