A serious comedy. Ross Hunter's cinematic version of the French play "Les Joies de la famille" (later Americanized as "A very rich woman") is full, well cast, occasionally funny ... and, unfortunately, timeless. A rich California widow, who seems to fry her money, is crossed by her two great, greedy daughters, both of whom are afraid that the Red Mother proudly prides her pride. The whole issue of a vital but elderly woman sent to a resting house against her will and later forced to prove healthy in a courtroom is an appealing material for a comedy (and for her credit, the director David Lowell Rich does not overload the image with strange gags or obvious feelings). Some of the humor is a bit broad and does not work, yet Rosalind Russell understands the gravity inherent in this scenario and never touches a false note. Sandra Dee is also good as Rosalind's niece, and James Farentino is very charming as a young lawyer. The film has so much to say about the importance of our elders and the ways in which they choose to spend their remaining time, that the seriousness of the theme "Red!" It is almost rushed to a happy ending. The image leaves you smiling - and at the same time, you wonder how many older women exist, who have never been so lucky. *** from ****
