Besides the usual stereotypes of the thirties, Eugene Pallette as the police detective, Jack La Rue as the "Italian" and, of course, James Lee as the "Chinese Cook", this film is the great mystery of a locked crime. For a movie from the 1930s, this step-by-step "peeling of the veneer of the mystery" is similar to the COLUMBO series, except for this movie, you do not have the advantage of knowing who the killer was in advance.
