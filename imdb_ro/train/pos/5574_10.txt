Peter M. Cohen has a winning satire on the mating game, twists around and turns inward. The critical division of the film into mass-media publications as "offensive" and "wandering" serves only to emphasize its intensity as a refreshing and focused dissection of people's sexual interests and passions. In the tradition of what I call satira "based on reality" following the steps "In the company of men", "Chasing Amy", "Your friends and neighbors" and "Two girls and a guy." Cohen's dialogue is hilarious and I have always been intrigued by how perfectly he captured the real pace of today's talks. Brian Van Holt, Zorie Barber and Jonathan Abrahams are three sexually obsessive predators who, along with their recently married boyfriend (played with Judah Domke's superior), are turned head down by their own term by a sex predator female Peet). Under the satirical surface is a romantic comedy much more satisfying than most sugar-coated studio products.
