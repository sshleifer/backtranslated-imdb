The Perfect Son is a story about two 30-year-old brothers, one that seems to be "perfect" and the other one, which is essentially a deception, often reaching drug rehabilitation centers. After their father's death, the two are reunited after a long absence, and the brother's usual rebellion returns. Only until the "perfect" brother makes the amazing revelation of having AIDS, the younger irresponsible younger brother makes a move to make his life in order and assumes a certain responsibility. The movie is not a good job of chronicling the "return" of the younger brother, though sometimes it may seem a little fun (drug addictions are never so easy). What makes the film more alert is the treatment of AIDS, a subject that has become a passion in cinemas over the last 5-10 years. And also, the development of an almost sweet relationship between the two brothers who face old age is very credible and well done. The two main actors were very competent, if not very charismatic. A first solid effort from the director and writer Leonard Farlinger, whose brother died of AIDS. The conclusion is well done. <br /> <br />
