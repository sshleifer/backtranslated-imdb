The only reason I did not give these 10 stars was the DVD format - no menus, extras, etc. However, if you ever had a dream to do something with your life, this movie is for you. If you believe in yourself and in your dream, do not let anyone or something stop you. This is one of the most resembling films I've ever seen. And magical. The actor is superb, the script serves purpose, and the opening sequence is fantastic. This is one of those films about the status of "cult". I recommended this movie to all my friends. Some love him, some can not finish it. Whenever I think or feel something is impossible, I'm thinking about Alan Arkin's role in this film. Sure he wants to make more movies.
