This movement is an exemplary example of the erotic state of B films: hardcore sex porn videos. That plot in this case is not as bad as these things go; involves a female lawyer who tries to show her that her boyfriend is innocent of killing his wife. The rest of the film, however, leaves something to be desired. Bad is acting, bad direction, badly sought woman, bad sets, bad cinema, bad sound and sexual evil scenes. Film producers should learn the difference between shit and erotic. They do not even have the good sense to have Gabriella Hall naked or in a scene of love. How stupid is this?
