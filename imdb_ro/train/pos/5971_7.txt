Skippy from family ties goes from clean baby to metal in this rather cheesy movie. The film seems to have been made in response to all the angry parents who claimed that metal music had harmed their children or made them commit suicide - except that a dead satanic metal star tries to come back from the grave (using Skippy help). And, while the plot is stuck and clich√©, cornflower (for example, a green fog that pulls off a girl's clothes) and the soundtrack are what makes the movie so hilarious (and great). And, of course, there is nothing like Ozzy Osbourne to sing a preacher who asks what happened to the song of love :). Definitely a movie to have some friends for a good laugh. And while you're at it, make it a double feature with Slumber Party Massacre 2 - there's a "bad rocker" (as mentioned in the video box), killer in black leather / fringes. He has to watch for the cheesecake fans.
