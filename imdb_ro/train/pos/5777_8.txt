A meteor crashes into Lake Crater, the heat from the impact that causes a prehistoric egg to the hatch. Okay, so the plot is just garbage. But despite its apparently low budget, this is seen as one of the most exciting and entertaining monster-to-loose films. There are also some good humor moments. In an age full of so-called "monsters", who are only men of laughter in a rubber suit or lizards dressed in frills and forcibly breaking into pieces (inexpensive style of exploitation), it is refreshing to discover that The plesiosaurus of this small jewel is a great Harryhausen style creature in the stop-motion style. Very hard to find but worth finding.
