AG was an excellent presentation of drama, suspense and thriller, which is so rare for American television. Sheriff Lucas gave many a willies spectator. We rooted for Caleb as he struggled to resist Sheriff Lucas's overlaps. We became worried and frightened when we learned the inconceivable link between these two characters. The manipulations she has made weekly to fear what Lucas will do next was really surprising. This show lived up to the "gothic" moniker in American entertainment has tried so rarely, less mastered. The costumes certainly made a big mistake in not supporting this show. This show puts shame at the current fullness of the "reality" programs - which are so unsatisfactory for viewing. The call for a set of DVD boxes is well-based. This show is a quality view for a hungry discerning market for quality viewing. A public who is tired of over-saturation of the reality of the mind, will get this gem of real stories. Bring the set of DVDs!
