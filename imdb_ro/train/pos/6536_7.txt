Let's face it; Nancy Drew has never been great literature. It's in the same category as the babysitter club, the magic tree house, Goosebumps, ABC Mysteries. In fact, it was one of the original stories of the formula. Nancy is perfect, cute, thoughtful, "cute", never has internal conflicts! and it never changes. Ned is almost the same. The movie was true for this style and I must say I liked it. It will never be a wonderful movie, but it has the same nostalgic taste that the books have kept. It had exactly that moment of suspense for my children (8 and 10 years). There was almost no offensive language. I liked pushing for a more conservative dress. Corky was a bit of annoyance. He was a little busy in a high school campus. I have never come to see why it was there first.
