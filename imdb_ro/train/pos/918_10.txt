If anyone is interested in getting a copy of this movie, please read the image of this description: The first CBS telecast on November 30, 2003 for TV Finding John Christmas is a sequel of the year in A Town Without Christmas with Peter Falk reiterating his role as versatile Max Max. Valerie Bertinelli plays Kathleen McAllister, a divorced nurse in the small town, whose depression ... due to the fact that the hospital she claims can be forced to close because of a $ 100,000 debt, is for a short time when she presents a newspaper published by photojournalist Noe Greeley (David Cubitt). The picture shows an act of courage by Noah's brother, Hank (William Russ), who mysteriously left 25 years ago and has not been seen since. Hank would like to sneak in the city without explanation or fanfare, but this proves impossible when Noah's newspaper makes a $ 50,000 reward to identify Hank, known only to the public as "John Christmas." And it's something very, very curious about that photo: it also shows a Santa Claus suit apparently floating in the air without a occupant. This sentimental "Santa Claus" is, of course, the angel Max, who appears again in the whole story in a variety of ways to solve problems, to give advice, to bind some plotting faces - and even to share a musical duet with Kathleen Socorro's talented daughter (Jennifer Pisana). <br /> <br /> Interested in a copy: write me here: IAMASEAL2@YAHOO.COM
