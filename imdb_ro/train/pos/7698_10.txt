But this is a great martial arts movie. Liu Chia Liang ranks second as a battle choreographer, only Sammo Hung at the best compared. This is immediately clear from its proud exposure to technique - more than the flap angle, etc. - during battles. Direction is strictly controlled to not excite the spectator only by speed and movement, but to astonish it with the precision shown. This film also benefits from Liu's participation in front of the camera. Liu's performance at the opening banquet scene is one of the highlights of kung fu film history. Liu is backed by the beautiful and talented Hui Ying Hung ("The Young Tune Auntie") and "Hsiao Hou", whose acrobatics are astounding and preferable to any amount of wire. As for the plot, this film follows the unusual theme of vengeance, but with character and moral development along the way, and a more appropriate solution. Humor in this is also the best. If you only watch a kung fu movie ever, that would be a good choice - it has everything.
