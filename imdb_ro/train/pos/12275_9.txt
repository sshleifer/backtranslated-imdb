I have never heard of the book and I did not care to read it, but the movie I will probably see many times. This movie is unforgettable, perhaps with the richest pictures I've ever seen in a movie. It was like looking at paintings several times, which I think was the idea. Lovely film, story, actors and cinema. They are full of deep emotions from any angle. Although I'm not particularly in love with love films, I liked it and I was deeply impressed by Winona Ryder's departure to her father to the end. <br /> <br /> Irons deserved a prize for his performance, and Closing has never been better. <br /> <br />
