It's very funny. You know, just how it should be a comedy. It also looks very good, as a Hollywood Spectacular should. So what do you want? As for a very good Sally field. It's much better here than anything else I've ever seen and looks so good. This movie is all you need to understand why it's a star. Those eyes! Like a silent cinema star, but better. In fact, everyone's eyes are so good. I used to pretend to be a bad TV actor with my girlfriend. I would do that thing where you look very fast from one eye to the other of your partner. They do not do so at all. That's great. His eyes are! (bad) <br /> <br /> There are so many great shows, his fun waiting for each of them to reappear. There's a whole workshop that's going on with Kevin Kline about how to overstress it very subtly. I understand? Yes it's OK. So it's Robert Downey, Jr., who has since made a sumthin of a career to play Slick, Slimy Executive. Cathy Moriarity, while she is not the most talented actress, is so charismatic and riveting, especially when she's upset. And even Whoopi Goldberg is decent, her natural time here gives a somewhat flat delivery a little Zing. OK, no, Whoopi Bashing, I heard you. And then, it's hair. Soap Dish was made at the end of Eighties BIG Hair, so ridiculous doos are like a great character in itself. They get bigger and more roady, just like you. Yeah, we have pictures. Soap Dish is better than I thought it would be, better I wanted it to be. I'm tired of Films telling me that I should be interested in the shallow, middle-centered, semi-talented Gemini, that is. Actors for TV soaps. Soap Dish looks happy just to have laugh at them. Thank you.
