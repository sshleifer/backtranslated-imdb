How to lose friends and Alienate people went out in 2008. He bombed at the US Box offices. It's an absolutely hilarious film with an extraordinary cast. Simon Pegg is a great interpretation of Sidney Young, who wrote the book "How to Lose Friends and Aliens", knowing it's not a true story, the only way I know this is that Sidney wants to go out with an actress named Sophie Maes. Maes does not exist, but besides, the movie could be real. How to lose friends and aliens is probably the funniest movie of 2008 and I think you should definitely see it. Among the best films, including Kirsten Dunst (Spider-Man, The Virgin Suicides), Danny Huston (The 23, 30 Days Night), Gillian Anderson (The X Files), Jeff Bridges (Transformers, Confessions of Teenage Queen The Big Lebowski, The Vanishing) In general, how to lose my friends and aliens is hilarious, I think Simon Pegg and Kirsten Dunst are working together well and I think you should see it. Although there is a strange nudity , including Trans-sexual, is a hilarious and wonderful comedy. One of the best Simon Pegg Plot: Sidney Young, a journalist from England, travels to New York to work on Sharp magazines. As she meets, she meets an actress named Sophie Maes and tries to sleep with her before his boss.
