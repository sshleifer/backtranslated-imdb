I liked this movie. It's rare to see a vision of Vietnam's post-partum, and this scenario of fighting the movie, bombs and incendiary fires - it did. I had no idea I would be so affected by that. What a stunning look at how foreign Veterinarians feel. It was hard to look, honestly. We all understand the fight and the type of drama Revelation Now, but this is so different. What happens when they come back and try to live a life? I can not. It made me very conscious of a large group of men flying in America. He is not able to relate, can not sleep, can not have love relationships, can not cope with "normal society". They feel completely separate. This is a huge tragedy and one that is not sufficiently addressed. Yeah, we've changed our attitude to veterans in Vietnam, we like it now, but what? It does not seem to have changed anything. It's too late? It was a great movie, but I cried a lot. I have no more criticism.
