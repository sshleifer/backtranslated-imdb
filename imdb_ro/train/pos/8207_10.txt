Sudden Impact is a double story. Harry is targeted by the crowd who wants to kill him, and Harry is very glad to come back to show and show them how to do it. This little war puts Harry in suspension that he does not care about, but leaves for a little vacation. Now the second part of the story. Someone kills a few punks and Harry is pulled into this situation where she meets Jennifer Spencer a woman with a secret that the little tourist city wants to keep quiet. The police chief is not a subtle man and warns Harry not to get involved or cause trouble. This is Harry Callahan Trouble follows. The cute guy watches him in this town and hell opens when Harry goes to war. Meanwhile, the vigilant strikes again, and the band realizes she's ready for her. Jennifer Spencer is caught and Harry comes to her rescue during the movie's climax. Sudden Impact is not the biggest Dirty Harry, but at that time it gives us a Harry who is very much an anti-hero ready to go to war just to exercise his justice. Again, not the best, not the worst, but the one with the most remembered line. Go here Make your day.
