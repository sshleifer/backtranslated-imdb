I went to see Antone Fisher without knowing what to expect and was most pleasantly surprised. Derek Luke's acting work was remarkable, and the story line was excellent. Of course, Denzel Washington did his usual job of acting and directing. It makes you realize that people with psychological problems can be helped and this movie is a perfect example for that. Do not miss this.
