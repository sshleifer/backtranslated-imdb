I saw the first movie on TV a few years ago, and I loved him sincerely. Charles Dance makes one of the most terrifying villains one can imagine. Its sophistication is such a perfect contrast to the brutal hero. I have never been a fan of Eddie Murphy, but I find my irritating portrait here, a winner: a bit of "Axel Foley through the search eye." Charlotte Lewis is to use a hackneyed expression but the only applicable, gorgeous light. Some scenes are awesome: the dream sequence, the bird, the stupid battle scenes, and the climatic confrontation. Through Murphy, the modern man suddenly fell into an Oriental Myth, an astonished and quieter version of Kurt Russell in oriental oriental fantasy. Like that movie, we have James Hong, the incomparable actor whose scenes, however short, will even raise Derek's quality. Since 1955, Hong has defined the fine in support of the actor, the "class act" of his profession. "The Golden Child" is silly; It is not perfect; but it has so many redeeming features that it is a pleasant and fun fantasy that deserves to be forgotten. Four years later I saw the "Golden Child" again; I liked it even more! It's really fun.
