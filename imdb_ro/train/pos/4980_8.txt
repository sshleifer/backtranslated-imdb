While surfing the internet for past sales prices, I have overlooked these comments. Why are they so serious? It's just a movie and it's not pornographic. I bought this short film from my parents 30 years ago and I have always been excited about it. I showed it to many of my friends and everyone liked it. I feel privileged to have this original, 8 mm black-and-white, 8 mm black-and-white film before becoming popular or well known. After reading the other comments, I agree that the movie is "shaved". Great work! I just want to be more. It seems I have to be the only person who owns one of these original, at least for sale, so I wonder how much he deserves?
