Here's another beauty in the series of beautiful movies directed by Eytan Fox. The film presents the story of star cross-lovers (one Israeli, one Palestinian) in modern Tel Aviv. The efficacy of the film comes not only from its description of trans-ethnic conflict, but also from personal and political conflicts within ethnic groups. For example, there is a moment to tell when one of the openly gay characters is visited in the hospital by his friend who brings flowers and tries to kiss him in front of his visiting family and suddenly we see a wave of discomfort inconvenient wash the camera. Obviously, the young man is not as open as it looks, and the family is not as acceptable as he wanted to be, while the friend is confused and rejected. A lot of complexity is packed at a passing moment. As we know from Yossi & Jagger, Fox is a master in efficient packaging of emotional and psychological complexity in short sequences. The film is also effective for how it presents the mutual brutalities that Israel and the Palestinians cause each other. If you are not heart, you will cry in the last third of the movie. Although the plot is melodramatic, it is so intelligently written and acted that it reminds us how satisfactory the melody can be.
