I really enjoyed this movie. Many Korean people will feel familiar with this movie because many of them have tutors when they go to school. The cinema was average. The film would have been better if the angel or camera movement were more irregular. Editing was very elegant and unusual. The actor was also very good. Kim Ha Neul has usually played an innocent, weak girl in Korean opaque soap. But this time, she plays a pretty nice tomboy. Kwon Sang Woo also plays his highly credible role. What I like most about this movie is that the characters' emotions are not too exaggerated. There are many Korean movies of romance that the characters cry the river in front of the audience and I always thought it was very eternal. There was no shit in this movie. Very funny and well done.
