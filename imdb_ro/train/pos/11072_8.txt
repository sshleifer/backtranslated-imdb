it is very simple. Jake goes to prison and spends five years with cones and chess masters. they are compassionate about the history of loss and failure and the total misery they live for because of their belief in the rule of little tricks and the control of the rules of the small crooks. they decide to give Jake the ultimate freedom: from his most intimate fears, from what he believes to be himself. for they take it on a trip in which he must leave all his fear, all pride, all hope - to redeem himself as a true master of his will. It's an intelligent film about the journey of enlightenment, about the infinite games and games that we make inside us too. 10/10, no doubt.
