The movie has a great story about genre. It contains all the usual Columbo ingredients; The way Col. Columbo approaches and connects with his suspect, the way the mystery is unleashed for him, the Columbo's dog, the cat and mouse game, which is great in this case and fortunately also a good humor relieved, which mostly involves the Columbo character. Everything is written despite the fact that it does not even have a truly original concept. Columbo hunting down a novel detective / criminal writer was made more than once in a Columbo movie. It is also an extremely well-directed film by James Frawley, who later directed five other Columbo films in the 1970s and 1980s. He gave the film style and some really wonderful and memorable sequences. It's one of the Columbo movies that is moving more slowly, despite the fact that it does not have too much running time. This style and approach does not always work well for a Columbo movie, but it does in this film, which is not, at least, due to the cinematic performance of the film. Most Columbo films have either played a well-known star or a star from the early days of the film, like his criminal movie. This movie sees Ruth Gordon. She has not played in many terrible movies throughout her career, but she is still well known by some, especially for her role in "Baby Rosemary," which also earned her an Oscar. It had a realistic and somewhat unusual style of action, which some people would not like. She earned four more Oscar nominations throughout her career before earning for "Rosemary's Baby" in 1969. She also has a great deal of interaction with Peter Falk in their sequences together. is still a young GD Spradlin. I say young, because I know him only from his latest productions in his career, despite the fact that he was already 57 years old at this Columbo production. He is still alive, but has retired from acting since 1999. A better entry than usual in the Columbo movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10
