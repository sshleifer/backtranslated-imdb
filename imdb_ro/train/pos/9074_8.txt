The show is very funny. A beautiful theme. Banks and a line are very good. With a little extra adjustment, it can become a very popular show. But the only major negative point of this show is the distribution. David Spade does a good job as Russell, Megyn Price does a good job. But who did not want to show Patrick Warburton, Oliver Hudson and Bianca Kajlich. Technically, Russell and Jeff are the main characters of the show, which makes viewers see the show. Russell is a playboy and Jeff is a kind of frustrated family man, the wiz relationship ... with an experience of all the problems a married couple is experiencing in a relationship. Patrick Warburton - does a horrible job like Jeff, he is not at all fit for the role. He is like a robot, there is simply no punch in the delivery of dialogue. <br /> <br /> Distribution is really very important for viewers to like. Evil act will surely take the show down ...
