<br /> <br /> I guess it's not the best movie ever made, but I voted it for 10 stars the same. Mainly because of my feelings at the end. Me and all the people around me were simply touched. This is something you do not often feel. We are all a little cynical and have been tired of sentimentalism, lazy manipulation, or preaching in modern movies. The film's story focuses around Jane, a young woman in the last stages of the MND, and the growing friendship between her and Richard, a man on the brink of a failure. This could have been so easily a dull and dignified piece, but it is so humorous, humane and lacking in sentiment that you win completely and against chances is a good movie. <br /> <br /> The actress of Branagh and Bonham-Carter is gorgeous, especially the latter who is always credible and powerful in her role. The chemistry between the two raises the film. <br /> <br /> The title comes from the masterpiece of Richards, a junk made of junk and its old paintings. Flying here is a symbol for both Richards and Janes, living in full life so that they can continue the other to face the end. <br /> <br /> A beautiful and funny movie that I would recommend to anyone. do not let the subject stop you.
