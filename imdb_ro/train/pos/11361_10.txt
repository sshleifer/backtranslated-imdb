Although I saw this movie years ago, the impact never left me. Stephen Rea's display of a guest is deep and moving. The feeling of being unable to stop death is palpable. Everyone in the cast is amazing from Sutherland, who is trying to host him and provide ways for the police to coordinate their efforts to the troubled citizen x. Every day when we are bombarded with stories of mass killers, I'm thinking about this movie and the tedious work people are trying to find killers.
