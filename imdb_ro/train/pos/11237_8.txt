Star Trek: Hidden Frontier is a long-lasting, full-featured movie series for the love of the series, and you have to watch for Trek fans. Production quality is extremely high for a fan film, although sometimes you can say it's a green screen. This does not, however, remove the overall experience. CGI ships are fantastic as well as space battle scenes ... On the negative side, I could say in previous episodes (and occasionally in the newest) that some actors / actresses are not comfortable in roles but again, this does not detract from the general experience of the new interpretations of Star Trek. Distribution and crew really brought something special, and as a whole, I would highly recommend this series to The Next Generation and Deep Space 9 fans.
