Those of you who know the dEUS group know singer Tom Barman. He directed this film a bit like he creates music, it's a mixture of everything. This is a comedy, though largely absurd and cynical, a drama, none of the main characters have a happy life and at least no purpose. The film begins in the morning in Obers, Belgium, with scenes of several people, some of them have nothing in common, but they will come in contact with each other during the day and night. There are a few main characters: a teacher who writes books that no one reads, a young morbid young researcher and his sister, a gallery owner, two young men permanently bound by law, a man working in a cinema and two young women. Along the movie goes a man who has to deal with the wind. All the characters have problems with their family or friends or just living with themselves. The film is set in Antwerp and shows some beautiful pictures of the city and port. The events of the day are not easy to explain, I simply advise watching the movie, simply, too much to say. But I can say this, the bartender has a great camera use and uses a lot of music (especially dance music, not even rock) to set a mood, especially because the party is full of great music. <br /> <br /> This movie is an experience in itself, it will not leave anyone wiser about life, maybe you only have to live it and you do not lose it or have false moral truths. In short, see, it is definitely worth it!
