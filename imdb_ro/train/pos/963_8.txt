Takashi Miike is one of my favorite directors and I was worried about him making a movie for kids because I would love to see him moving away from the movies I loved: Visitor Q, Gozu, Izo, Ichi the killer and the Black Trilogy of the Society. Lately, he seems to explore a new territory and I think he's succeeding. However, this was the first of his films I saw coming in that direction, so I was nervous. I bought it thick without seeing it and I was glad I did. The Great Yokai War is a perfect movie for children, and adults should also like it. The whole movie reminded me of so many movies I loved as a child: the unceasing story, the Labyrinth, the return to Oz, etc. I liked those movies, because they did not treat the kids as if they were stupid, and that does not. Dark morality is there, but it's just as bad as any movie for kids. I personally have not been disturbed by CGI and prosthetics. I feel like they fit well and do not think they will notice the kids. If you're a fan of Takashi Miike, you probably do not like that. But, I suggest I make a hit. It turns out that Miike is just as diverse and talented as I suspected he was. He also continues to make his signature Miike films outside of these, which is very reassuring. For those people who are new to Takashi Miike and want something lighthearted or dramatic like this one, I suggest other Miike films: "Zebraman" "Katukuris Happiness" "Sabu" and "Chinese Bird Men". <br /> <br /> Good job Takashi Miike! 8/10 stars.
