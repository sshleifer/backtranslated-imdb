There are too many avoided topics in cinema and eating disorders are one of them. This film looks like it is. It is not glamorised for spectators to enjoy, it is really true, which makes it even stronger. I just saw it once, and that was a few years ago, but I still remember everything about it and how it made me feel. It's a very powerful movie and is a good support for anyone suffering from a eating disorder to give them the will to stop. These should be movies - it should be there to help people and not to block the wrong things.
