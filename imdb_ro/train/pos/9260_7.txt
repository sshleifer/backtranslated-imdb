There are enough sad stories about women and their oppression through religious, political and societal means. Not to diminish movies and stories about genital mutilation and reproductive rights, as well as wage inequality and marginalization in society, all in the name of Allah or God or other ridiculous justification, but sometimes it is useful to take another approach and throw a light on the subject. The setting is the 2006 match between Iran and Bahrain to qualify for the World Cup. Passages are high and more women try to hide as men to enter the game. The women who were captured (played by Sima Mobarak-Shahi, Shayesteh Irani, Ayda Sadeqi, Golnaz Farmani and Mahnaz Zabihi) and detainees for the prosecution provided a fun and bright look at the customs of this country and, most likely, all Muslim countries . Their interaction with the Iranian soldiers who kept and carried them, both the towns and the villagers, and the father who was looking for his daughter gave some funny moments when we thought of why they had unwritten rules. This is in particular a paternal society that feels that it has to save women from the brutal behavior of her men. Rather than educating the male population, they deny the privilege and rights of women. Seeing the changes in the responsible soldiers and the reflection of the Iranian society, it is a surprise for us that this film will not get any play in Iran. But Jafar Panahi has a winner on his hands for those who can see it.
