I, like many dead Trekkers (or Trekkies, I do not care!) He has suffered for seven seasons of "Star Trek Voyager," dreaming of a better show when he finished, lamenting the end of "Deep Space Nine" Prayers from 1999, responded. "Enterprise" is fantastic. Freshview, radically different characters, new stunning images, a pop song for intro. (I was shocked!) I can not think of anything I did not like. Sign up for 10 seasons of this show. "Star Trek" is back - "Voyager", no one misses you! Continue on Trekkin! <br /> <br />
