This film calls Emily Watson of Breaking the Waves. This film about a man's obsession takes place in a resort where a chess tournament takes place. A chess master comes shortly after falling crazy in love (at first sight) with a woman played by Emily Watson. It collapses for this strange thing of a man who is obsessed with chess. This is the fright of her mother, who is more interested in seeing her with another young lady; a good gentleman. Her mother feels that this is just a fleeting fantasy for the young woman because she tends to get into strange animals and the like. What follows is more a journey through the psyche of man. She tells how his past is closely linked to his present. Emily Watson is amazing in this respect as well as the actor who plays the main character. It's certainly slow, but it's worth watching. The end was quite satisfactory. :)
