I remember seeing promotions for this show before it appeared in 1993. I was 8 years old and now, at the age of 22, it is strange that she saw this show of worship from the beginning and the end and look back at him. all of a sudden they seem so far away, what a great decade. Anyway, I've seen MonsterVision all the time, because I'm a big fan of monster and horror movies. It was like the Chiller Theater version 90. If MST3K can get the DVD why Joe Bob does not show, at least MonsterVision was more interesting and informative. Many of Joe Bob's comments and film information were just hilarious. Most of the films featured in the show were Class B or C, but they featured many A films as well as Hammer England's top notch films, as well as many of them with the majesty of Ray Harryhausen's stopping. Many of them were movies you did not see elsewhere, such as Japanese Sci-Fi movies, of course Godzilla, which is familiar to almost everyone, and independent movies such as Metal Storm and Motel Hell. With the new film preservation Decade and several independent directors, I think MonsterVision would be a good show for IFC because they already have a blow to the IFC House show. I'm sure this show will be taken again for reasons of nostalgia one day, I think she'll have to wait and see. Until then, "That's Great Television"!
