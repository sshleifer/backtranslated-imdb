I think Dark Angel is wonderful! The first season was excellent and had a good plot. With Max (Jessica Alba) as an X-5 escape, manticore creation, trying to adapt to a normal life, but still "saving the world". And being hunted by manticore throughout the season, which gives the series some additional spices. The second season though suddenly became a little strange compared to the first. The cry has vanished, and the series has lost little of its charm, especially because of the appearance of all the strange "creatures". Do not misunderstand me the second season is good, but a little to much of the "manticores". However, they managed to return to a promising new scenario in Season 2 closing episodes, where I had many hopes to see more. So, really, I want to start making new episodes. And with James Cameron behind this can not go wrong. So, as a conclusion, I would say it's a big series, yet still have hope for a third season!
