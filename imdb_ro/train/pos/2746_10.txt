Imagine taking your far-field lights off a cold night and then going to bed. There is no need to close the doors. The only sound is the wind blowing through the trees. A few hours after midnight, a car with centimeters. Later, an intruder knocks a flashlight into the darkened living room. What makes this picture so frightening is the setting: a remote farm ... at night. Based on the Truman Capote's best-selling book and a B & W comparable to the best 1940 films, "In Cold Blood" presents a terrifying story, especially in the first act, because the plot is largely at night roads. It's the nightmare thing. But this is not a dream. The events really happened in 1959. Two con-men with delusional heads kill an entire Kansas family, looking for a deposit of money that does not exist. Director Richard Brooks used real locations where real-life events occurred, even the farm ... and its inside! It makes for a memorable and haunting movie. Both main actors are very similar to the two real-life killers. Robert Blake is more than convincing as Perry Smith, short and terrible, with a hunting foot, dreaming of finding a treasure buried by Cortez. Scott Wilson is almost as good as Dick Hickock, the unclear artist with a total American smile. After their killing syndrome, the duo headed for Mexico. Things happen there, so they go back to the US, steal cars, hitchhike, and are generally miserable as they walk from place to place. But it is a crazy life, and the two bandits soon regret their actions. The last twenty minutes of the movie are fascinating, when the rain falls, the rope is tightening and all we hear is the beating of a beaten heart. Even with his mediocre act, "In Cold Blood" floors in detail riveting a real story that still hypnotize, almost half a century later. It's the set that does it. Do you think people in rural Kansas still leave open doors ... at night?
