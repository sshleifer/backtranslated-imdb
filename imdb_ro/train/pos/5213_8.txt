This is the first review I wrote for IMDb so empty with me, but I caught this movie on HBO and I was glad I looked. Richard Gere is great in this film as a passionate / detective agent who bends the rules to do his job. I think the story is great and there is never a boring scene that slows the pace of the movie. Some parts of the movie that deal with sex-addicted addicts are quite shocking, but if you've ever seen a murder movie, like Se7en, you'll be able to stomach on stage. <br /> <br /> So, if you're looking for a good detective / suspense movie, ignore the low rating that this movie has received on IMDb and you're certainly watching it.
