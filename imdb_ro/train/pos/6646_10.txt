mahtama Gandhi, the father of the nation in search of India's freedom struggle, ignored his own family and son, this film is about his son, Hiralal, who feels neglected because of the service of Mahdha Gandhi to society. The film begins in South Africa where Mahatma Gandhi works as a lawyer and is fighting the cause of India's freedom against the British. Hirarala arrives in South Africa to help his father, who is a lawyer, since Gandhi was involved in the struggle for freedom, and he wanted his wife and children to join as a service to society and, as a result, hirarlal has no chance to complete his education and fails the exams, he marries his love goulash (bhoomika Chawla) against his father's wishes. Hiralal has ambitions to travel to England and become a barrister like his father, but his father refuses to give him a scholarship offered to his family by a businessman, and instead gives it to another person saying that the scholarship does not must be limited to the family and should be open to the most deserving student living in the colony. This gets angry at the hiral, and the rupture between father and son grows, hirarlal hates his father because he neglects him and blames him because he is not taught and unemployed. Hiralal strives to meet and sit in the streets with unsuccessful business trials and huge debts, loses his wife and children. Akshaye Khanna gave a stellar performance like Hiralal gandhi .. all kudos for him, direction and scenario is fantastic, picturization is excellent. an excellent movie and you have to see it. I give it a 10/10
