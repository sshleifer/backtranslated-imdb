Holes (2003, Dir Andrew Davis) When Stanley Yelnats IV is wrongly convicted of theft, he is sent to Camp Green Lake. In this camp, Warden and his two superiors, Mr. Sir and Dr. Pendanski, ordered camp colleagues to drill holes along the hole after the hole. But why? Stanley plans to find out. I have never had any intention of watching "Holes," and I have to admit, I really watched the movie because I'm a fan of Shia LaBeouf, but even if you're not his fan, it does not matter. "Holes" is one of those Disney films that the whole family can enjoy. The story is wonderful written and incorporates a wonderful idea to include flashbacks in the past. They do not distract attention and really offer a great back story. All the distribution is great. Young people act well, and the addition of Jon Voight and Sigourney Weaver is a joy. Shia LaBeouf shows that even at age 17 he can act without any defect. This is a Disney movie, you surely enjoy the family. "I'm learning from failure." - Stanley Yelnats III (Henry Winkler)
