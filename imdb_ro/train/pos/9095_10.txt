A charming, funny movie that has a strong lifelong touch. I saw a screener of this recent film at work. It was so nice to see this film in contrast to all the horror films I see every day. So much so that I thought about writing. I'm not sure if this movie goes to theater, but I hope it happens. It's a beautiful movie to see with friends, a charm and has some fun jokes. The actor was great (especially Howard Hessman and Larry Dorf), the director was pretty good (not a movie to be over-directed). , and the banter between the characters is smart and has a beautiful rhythm. As an aspiring writer, I see those things (I'm a dork), anyway, a very nice movie I recommend.
