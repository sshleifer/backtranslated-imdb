Although Kurt Russell was and is probably the closest person to look like Elvis in show business, many things were fake in this movie. First, the producers argued that Elvis had opened his famous live shows in '69 after a 9-year-old film shoot, wearing a white suit made in 1972. They also claimed to have played "the love of burning "the wonder of you" which he recorded for the first time in 1970. He also claims to have received his first guitar for Christmas when all Elvis fans know that he has received it for his birthday. I know all the movies based on the past have something fake, but these things are so obvious to those who like Elvis.
