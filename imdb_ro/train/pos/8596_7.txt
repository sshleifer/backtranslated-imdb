I thought the Sentinel would be a mediocre film. When I finally saw it, I took a good surprise. The film is not a great thing, but it is very fun and the action scenes are very well done. This movie reminded me of TV series as 24 or Alias. It is very similar to that series and I reminded myself, at Wolfgang Petersen's thriller In the line of fire. If you expect one of the most original and one of the greatest thrillers in film history, you will be disappointed. But if you are going with few expectations, you will enjoy Sentinel. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7
