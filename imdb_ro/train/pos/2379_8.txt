H.G. Wells Classic had several incarnations. Version 05 'Speilburg and the classic version 53' But only this remains completely true for the book. Nothing is changed nothing is eliminated. <br /> <br /> Originally released as a 3-hour movie. Director Re-cut film up to 2 hours of pure excellence. He has a chapter chapter chapter chapter on novels that "Wells would be proud of" The story is the way everyone remembers. Martians invade the Earth with capsules containing an army of war machines with the Tripod. 19th Century earth people are badly prepared to reject foreign forces and fight the canons and weapons that are in the Walkers-related coils, and when mankind is no longer a global power, they are saved by the smallest organisms on earth. The film is an excellent achievement for director Timothy Hines, who has a great potential because he brought this vision to life with a small budget of 5 million. B films today have bigger budgets.
