This movie was classic. I should have said that this film was best captured by a man who learns from his mistakes. if we could all understand and learn how everyone in this movie did it. It has played an important role in showing how family is an important part of life and how pride can cause you to lose something important in life if we do not find a "BIG WORK" and swallowing is pride.
