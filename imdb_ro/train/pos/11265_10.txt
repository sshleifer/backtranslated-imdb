I never knew who Robert Wuhl was before seeing this. But after I saw it, I realized what a funny thing was. This HBO specialty characterizes it by teaching "American history" to students at New York University and the man was just phenomenal. He enjoyed almost every key historical event that took place not only in the US but elsewhere in the world. This documentary / comedy was a great satire that made me wonder if what I accept as true infallible history is indeed true. I enjoyed the way Mr. Wuhl managed to mix useful information with great comedy and made learning more exciting. I would recommend this to any person interested in history and wishes to cast doubt on his beliefs.
