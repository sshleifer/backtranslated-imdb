Home Room was a great movie if you ever had dramas in your life. It keeps you wanting to see more. I wonder what's hiding Alicia's secret. I think I watched the movie 6 times in a row and I never lost my interest. Plus, I usually do not complain about movies, but that made me cry every time. I'd like to find more movies like this. Everything in everything I thought was a great movie. The more you look at it, the more you will become part of it. The end is the part that really made me cry when she got the diploma, because she had her daughter's name. My heart felt as if it had been crushed just then. And how her new friend came to comfort her when she had not yet reached her. I liked it so much.
