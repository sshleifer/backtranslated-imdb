You'd better see this episode from the beginning, because if you start watching it later, you'll be confused about what's going on with Clark's life. However, this is twisting; Clark is stuck in an alternative reality. Lana is dedicated to him. Lex has lost most of his legs and is in a wheelchair because of a bridge accident when he failed to kill Clark as the pilot of the series. Martha is married to Lionel. The only constant is his most loyal friend, Chloe, who still believes in who he is. And, oh yes, he has no superpower. He is in a mental institution to put himself in a fantasy world where he has powers and is ridiculed to believe that way. Apart from Chloe, there is a mysterious figure who believes in Clark: a black who in alternate reality is also a resident of the institution who thinks he is on Mars. Clark must stay true to what he believes is a real reality, and he is not brainwashed by the institution's psychiatrist, who is, in fact, the fourth escape of Phantom. This episode is completely smelly and shocking. In addition, it offers a new twist of the "Smallville" episode.
