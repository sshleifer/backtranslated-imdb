I have to say that the worst part of the movie was the first half hour. I was very confused about who it was who. For example, Bill Paxson's character had long hair and wearing a jacket. Then, when all men arrived at the camp, it turned out to be a character that looked like Bill Paxson, but it was not. Did I say where is Bill Paxson? Then he was a guy with his girlfriend. He said he was 21 years old. This was supposed to be a 20-year reunion of the most memorable director of the camp (Alan Arkin). Later, the same girl was interacting and talking about her experiences in the camp. That did not make sense. It would have been a year. That being said, the movie turned out to be pretty good. Kevin Pollak was the good guy who has always been teased. A guy was a complete narcissist and he got to lose his beautiful girlfriend. Alan Arkin was interested in an old-fashioned camp director who admits that he has come out of contact with modern young people. The best part was that none of the adult shelters were successful in life. None of them had a very high career. This seemed very real life. The film was compared to The Big Chill. In some ways it was not as interesting as Big Chill, but it was more realistic. So even if the beginning is not promising, the movie has turned into a pretty good one.
