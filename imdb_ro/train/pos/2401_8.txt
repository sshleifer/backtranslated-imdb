Guy Kibbee offers the audience many laughs. Like most candidates, he knows almost nothing. Warren William, a very, under rated actor, is great in giving instructions to Kibbee; that is, they teach them to say something that does not mean anything to the public who is voting. A campaign based on no comment, "I'll take it under guidance," and "May give, but then again, maybe not," is the almost perfect way to win the election. In short, the bigger the candidate is, the greater the chance he will win. After all, the audience can identify with such a person. Regarding the film, it makes for a lot of comedy.
