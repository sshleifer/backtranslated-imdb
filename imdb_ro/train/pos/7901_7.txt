The worst film of all time? Wow, now. You can not be serious. Maybe that's what you expect for a movie for you. I live in Oregon, so I enjoyed the beautiful pictures of familiar and still amazingly beautiful Smith Rocks and other Central Oregon areas (as well as the sweet ladies of her own Ken Kesey and Ken Babbs looking down on the baby's cradle Sissy at the beginning of the film). Singles were enough to push me to give the film a better score than the "average". Or ... Maybe it's the expectations you have. After I read the AGES book and thought about me "kindness, no one could ever make a movie in this interesting, weird and strange book ... especially 20 years later, when the MORAYS - accent mark online) have changed "- I was actually quite pleasantly surprised when I first watched the movie when it came out in 1994 and I really liked it today again by watching it again. Sissy was exquisitely expressed, and I do not care what you all say, I was also pleasantly surprised by the performances of Rain Phoenix and John Hurt. I'm not a lesbian, a bi, or a trans, but I've met many people like the ones they were supposed to take - and those "real" men acted like the actors. It was a bit, scene-ey - always a little "on". Gus Van Sant is a strange native Oregon, but by garsh he did a good job to adapt this crazy book, IMHO.
