I liked this movie. It was cool enough. It has everything: cars, gunfights, battles, and even a symbolic girl. It does not excel in any of these things, except for cars. A little bit of a shot, a bit of a fight, a little shading around, and LOT of the car with a great track near the end. Sarah, you can say, is not practical, but in the opinion of our good friends here at IMDB, it's possible, so the movie is not as bad as people paint it. She has something of quality and I liked to look at her. Actually, I loved the movie. And I did not need to stop my brain from looking at it. I was not always thinking "Is this possible?" or a tramp like this. 9 in 10.
