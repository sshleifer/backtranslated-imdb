Young Mr.Lincoln is a beautiful poetic film that captures the myth of one of the most venerated figures in American history. Henry Fonda had the difficult task of illustrating a mythical figure and, at the same time, making them human enough for people to take care of. Players may be the best performers. See how it stops alone on a linsing-mob. Alice Brady is fantastic in the role of a simple woman. Several of the last part of the movie is played in a courtroom, a negative thing I can say about this movie. Most of the characters from the judge to the audience receive so many humorous folk lines that distract attention from the grave process that is at hand. But I am quite accustomed to this because humor is a Ford brand. Support parts of Ward Bond and Donald Meek are very good.
