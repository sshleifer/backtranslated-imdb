She was simple and yet so cute. I think the whole sense of sex segregation in society, which can be bitter, has been very delicate. He had a bitter humor in him. The fact that most of the actors were not professional made the film more tangible and realistic. There was also a "documentary" page on the film. The best scenes were those that all the girls, forbidden by watching, listened passionately to the soldier, who oversaw them, broadcasting the game. If you are an Iranian, renouncing family and dancing on the street after a game has won, it fills you with national pride! If you are not Iranian, you still love everything!
