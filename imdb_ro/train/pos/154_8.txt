"El Mar" directed by Catalunya director Agusti Villaron and based on Blai Bonet's novel, gives a glimpse of Spanish history, as seen by an author from Balearic, who brings the spectator back in the days of the civil war in that country. The film focuses on three friends and follows them from the start of the Mallorcan War a few years later, when two of those friends meet again when they are in a sanatorium lost to the countryside. > <br /> We first meet three boys playing happy. Not everything is what it looks like. The tragic death of one of them highlights the cruelty of the one committing the evil deed. The boys excluded a young girl, their age, from taking part in their games. When we meet adult Ramallo again, he goes to a sanitarium. Looks like he's suffering from tuberculosis. To his surprise, Manuel Tur, one of his childhood friends, is also treated, and the young man who was not welcome to participate in their games is now one of the nurses who oversee health care. It's obvious that Tur looks at Ramallo in a way that just means he's in love with the tough bully. Their relationship will have devastating consequences. Roger Casamajor does a good job of portraying old Ramallo. Bruno Bergonzino makes an impression as Tur, the vulnerable young man. Antonia Torrens interprets Sor Francisca with conviction. Angela Molina, looks like Carmen, the caretaker's wife. Simon Andreu is perfect as Alcantara. "El Mar" is a dark film that clearly shows Agusti Villarona's talents in making the novel come alive for the spectator.
