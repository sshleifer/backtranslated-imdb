The movie was not that great. The book is better. But the movie was not that bad. It was interesting to say the least. The story had enough suspense to keep in mind, though I would not say I really care about the movie itself. Janine Turner and Antonio Sabato Jr are so beautiful to keep an eye on :) They have some pretty scenes that should appeal to romance. Generally I would give the movie a 7 or 8. It was not bad, just a little bit wicked plot.
