The first word that comes to my mind after watching this movie is "beauty". Beauty is around in the actors' play (Andie is gorgeous as always), in well-conceived images and in the idea of ​​the red line of the author - Love. I think Kenny's character is the only white spot in the otherwise boring and predictable life of the three women. His interaction makes Andie's character live as fun as possible. When it disappeared, it became obvious that we can not appreciate and keep our inner creeds and sacred desires. The fact that Andie is successfully recovering from this loss is nothing bad, but it shows that life prevails in any form, even in this small British village that is shown perfectly. Another reason I love this movie is that it is so British in all respects - all those houses and "honeycombs" and accents :))). Andie again makes a great job! It is a pity that this film has received such low marks. 10 out of ten!
