Gandhi the Great: Glorification in the world is associated with people like the great Alexanader, Ashoka the Great because their majesty lied to be glorified more than man. Gandhi is called wonderful because it is not great, but to be more human, because I always think bringing humanity to us is the place where the greatness of lies is human. Gandhi was a man of humanity and one who fought for humanity ready to sacrifice in the struggle for humanity, but not his enemies. Let me move on to reviewing the movie now. About Gandhi My father: Gandhi My father is a film not about Gandhi but about his son Harilal Gandhi. He does not tell the story of a son whose father was one of the greatest men to walk on this earth, the director manages to portray the story. The film manages to tell the story of a deceived son of a father who leads a nation to greatness. The film is called a criticism of Gandhi's failure as his son's father, I would prefer to say that it is a sacrifice that Gandhi made as a father of a son to be right as a father of a nation. the essence of this film prevails not only in India, in the Gandhi country, but also in the heart of all the people in this world. Gandhi the real man. Jaihind.
