A bigger day 1938, when a huge rally that celebrates Hitler's visit to Rome, serves as a backdrop for a love story between Antoniette (Sophia Loren) married to the fascist (John Vernon) and Gabriel (Marcello Mastroianni). He is a boring housewife with several sons and is an unhappy, solitary homosexual, pulled by the radio and pursued by fascists. She stayed alone in her home when her husband had to attend the historic celebration. Then both develop a very pleasant relationship, despite their differences. The film is set on the historic encounter with Fuher Hitler and Duce Mussolini along with other authorities such as Count Ciano and King Victor Manuel III, describing the events with an outside, sometimes irritating radio voice. <br /> <br /> It's a romantic drama made with sense and sensitivity. A romantic passionless between two conflicting characters. The magnificent performances of two professionals make a wonderful movie worth seeing. Of course, Ruggero Macarri and Ettore Scola's sensitive script have always been interesting, elaborate and sentimental. Colorful and atmospheric movie film by Pascualino De Santis. Emotive musical score by Armando Trovajoly with sensitive leitmotif. The film won the Golden Globe Award in 1978 for the best foreign film. Scola's imagination stretches to illuminate the limited scenarios in which the drama develops. His films usually take place on several stages and are semi-theatrical. For example: ¨Le Bal¨ (1982) uses a French dance hall to illustrate the changes in society. 2) "Nui of Varennes" (1983) a script is the scenario where an unlikely group meets like Thomas Paine, Luis XVI and Marie Antoinette who have fled from the Revolutionary Paris 3) "The Family" (1987) all take place in the old apartment old Romanian family; and of course 4) "A Giornata Particulare" or "a special day" where Loren and Mastroianni have a wonderful relationship in their respective flats and the flat roof.
