Audiard made a very exciting movie here. It begins with the description of a nearly deaf young woman in her work universe as a secretary; she is ignored, frustrated, rejected ... Hiring an intern as an assistant seems to be a way for her to find someone in her life: but the guy went out of prison. Both people being rejected by society are gradually meeting them. The description of the characters is profound, goes into detail ... both begin to help each other; because she can read on her lips, which turns out to be very useful to him ... She will gradually evolve away from what was in the beginning. It is nicely filmed; everything is very convincing, even if it turns into a noir movie at the end. The gesture is particularly noticeable in Audiard's filming. Emmanuelle Devos should be nominated for the best awards for Actess Cesar for her masterpiece. Action at the end of the film prevents it from being simply a "etude de moeurs". It's actually surprisingly fun: 8/10.
