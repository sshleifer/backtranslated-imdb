Pakeezah has a very interesting history (which is well documented in the "Trivia" section) about how it appeared. It seems destiny has conspired to test Kamal Amrohi (the director), while at the same time, secretly, eager to see him complete his masterpiece. Pakeezah walks on metaphors, poetry and visual flaw. As a result, the intensity with which emotions come out reaches a size that can not be very real, but is very effective and leaves an impact on the viewer. Meena Kumari lives the tragedy of Nargis and Sahib Jaan she owns. Other film stars include Ghulam Mohammed (music director), Lata Mangeshkar, Naushad (background score) and Joseph Wirsching (d.o.p). Their music and cinema will leave the spell bound. <br /> <br /> Pakeezah is a classic in the world cinema. It reveals new layers every time you follow it again. Kamal Amrohi is one of the rare poets of cinema and left us a gift.
