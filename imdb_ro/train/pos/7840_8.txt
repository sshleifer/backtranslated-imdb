BORN TO BOOGIE is a true "breakthrough" - though a rock fan for almost thirty years, I first saw the movie a few days ago and I ranked him among the most important rock movies of all time; music is terrible (T. Rex's cream) and visuals are constantly interesting and unusual, leaving this viewer the desire for more directorial efforts past Ringo Starr, who did a good job here. If you like music, you'll be in T. Rextasy all along, as Marc Bolan is really the star of the play, face and center. Even the fact that some songs are repeated does not matter a little: different locations, costumes, musical arrangements and bizarre visual concepts are all used to give different textures and a lot of optimistic humor for what could have been concluded as "only "a concert film in other hands. Being rich and full of ballet as BORN TO BOOGIE, the movie is only about an hour, but what is there is absolutely satisfactory. Here's just my criticism - the video package shows something like 71 minutes and at least one online source claims the movie is 67 minutes, but it seems like it's more than 61 minutes of rock fun.
