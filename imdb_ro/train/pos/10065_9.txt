This is a superb movie, suitable for all except the very small ones, although accessibility for young people has been marked (at least by the printing we have seen) by using an unfortunate version of English subtitles! For most of the film, it's almost impossible to guess how long it's been set-there is no modern technology, not even the ubiquitous Chinese bicycle, just a lively, almost monochromatic, against which the dazzling display of the Sezuan Opera and fireworks celebrations. Even when a group of soldiers refers to their imminent departure for a theater of war, it could be anytime in the last 150 years. But then we will see for a short time a car - 30 years, early 40 - and we realize that we are watching China on the verge of huge changes and that much of the world we see is about to be swept away in the cataclysm the Second World War and the Communist Revolution. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What makes the desire of the central character to adhere to old customs and traditions is all the more painful. The film also raises issues of vital importance even today, both in China and other parts of the world: the inequality between boys and girls, men and women; trade for various purposes in small children; corruption in society; injustice; the importance of friendship. Maybe I read too much in this movie; but I do not think! I also think it is a scandal that films of this caliber are not often displayed in the UK, while clay is passed as quality material. But do not ask me.
