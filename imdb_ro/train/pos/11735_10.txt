This movie is pure Elvira and shows it to her chest ... I mean, best! The story (co-written by Cassandra Peterson, alter ego of Elvira) is inspiring and captivating and is brought to life by the spirit and charm of Elvira. The visitor gets the chance to see Elvira in a whole new light as he struggles with the prejudices of the people of Fallwell, Massachusetts (where he traveled from Los Angeles to participate in reading her aunt Morganna's will) and at the same time tries to help long-suffering teenagers who have been deprived of fun by the pariah chastity Pariah and the rest of the local council. She also has to deal with her attraction to Bob Redding, the owner of the local cinema, and another woman (Patty) who has eyes on Bob, but is not as merciful for his love as Elvira. And later in the film, she also faces the complications of being downgraded from a "major metaphysical celebrity" and the witchcraft accusations against her, which means she will be burnt. Elvira manages to be both sexy and vulnerable, streetwise and naive in this film, while cracking risque jokes and delivering off-beat lines, in double-sided ways. This movie is inspired because it sends out the message never giving up and always trying to follow your dreams. Finally Elvira's dreams are finally fulfilled, which is the best thing that could happen to this wonderful and determined woman. I have seen this movie many times and I have never been tired of it! There are no unnecessary scenes and I got captivated all along the film. A recapitulation will not make the movie real, so I can only tell you to look at yourself because it's one of the best movies ever made! Meanwhile, I wish you unpleasant dreams! "
