He's a decent little film in Michigan, about a guy who's haunted by his past, with his abusive stepfather (Gunnar Hansen), and he grew not well adjusted. In fact, he's absolutely fresh, but he's trying not to be too obvious. And he has an entourage, his own demon and an angel who follows him around him. The demon never tells a word, but really does not need to, and he is Max Schreck - creepy. Let's just say that the angel is turning his wheels a lot, because Eric is busy doing things that make him feel better to "free" the people he decides to need, especially young beautiful women. This is a decent portrait of madness, and you're a little too lonely to figure out what's going on, but generally I looked from start to finish very focused on the movie because it kept me security interest. It is a little devoid of certain areas, but I can not put my finger. A decent effort and it's worth seeing if you like the series blows.
