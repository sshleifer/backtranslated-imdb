If Mulder is looking for his dad, here is Darren McGavin, the first X Files, for a season, the producers of this show did not know they had a classic on their hands and in 1993 Chris Carter came up with what what they call tracking at Night Stalker, Files X. Both will go down, as the classic is my opinion of the two shows that takes viewers to an experience level that only comes along at a time and should to appear in X Files Years Later Darren McGavin, as Agent Arthur Dales, helping resolve the cases. By paying tribute to the man, I think so, Chris Carter has been making a TV show in the form of David Duchovny as Darren McGavin if he had not been watching the X files and the show I never knew about Harassment Night.
