After all the crap that Hollywood (and the Indies) have aroused, we finally have a movie that offers some frightening moments. There are a few moments climbing, but I'm not sure that we can now make a completely original film. There is nothing new here ... it's just fine. Make sure and pay attention, because "subtle" fights come quickly and often. This is not a movie to watch while eating pizza. There is a very good red herring in this movie and, unfortunately, a very badly played role. Cheri Christian does not make an effective Julie (wife / mother). In a way, she is not despicable at all. I know, I know ... she just went through a traumatic experience. But the viewer never knows it as is "normally", and the relationship between her and her husband is rather unpleasant (unintentionally). I think the director meant for us to have a sympathy for her, but I never did. Finally, a big finger for the final, which is so disturbing and satisfying. It may have easily been cheated with a sound effect at the beginning of the final credits, but the director resisted wisely. This is not a masterpiece by any means, but it's a good, old-fashioned movie scary ... something quite rare in our day.
