"One-Round" Jack Sander is named because he is a carnival boxer fighting with any man in the audience. If they can take a round, they win a prize - a popular way to attract customers to long-haul shows. Jack is in love with the ticket, Mabel, though his head is quickly back when Bob Corby enters the ring to try his chances with Jack. What nobody knows about the fight is that Bob is the champion, so he's able to beat Jack - even though he does something. As a result, Bob asks Jack to become his sparring partner and give up the carnival circuit. Later, Jack improves so much that he also becomes a legitimate boxer. Slowly, he does his job in the charts until he's almost ready to take Champ. Meanwhile, Champ and Mabel start running behind Jack in the back - even though Mabel has now married Jack. So when the final fight between Jack and Bob happens to be very personal and Jack is ready to kill him. Is he good enough? Will the raging rage against Bob increase or hinder his performance? Tune in and see. This film was directed by Alfred Hitchcock and at the moment this film seems strange to a director known for mystery-suspense movies in the 1920s, Hitchcock had no fixed genre of writing or writing (he did both for this movie). Actually, in many ways, this film is more appropriate to Hitchcock's silent style, because a similar plot appeared in one of the following silences, MANXMAN (also Carl Brisson as the unjust spouse). So while this seems to be like a standard boxing movie of the day, it was not a radical departure for this great director - even with its rather formidable end. Generally, while a little predictable and having Ian Hunter playing a boxing champ looks bad, the movie works well. While away from a perfect silence, it is worth seeing and packing a nice punch.
