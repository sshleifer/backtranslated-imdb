We had few issues with this movie and heard a lot of criticism, saying it was too long and overrated. True, it's over three hours, but I was amazed that it was going so fast. I do not think it's overrated, I think the IMDb rating is perfectly decent. The film looks sumptuous, with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects, and the direction of James Cameron rarely falls out of focus. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of the best performances as Jack, and Kate Winslet is awesome like Rose. David Warner, a great actor, steals every scene he's in. The story is very rich in detail and is warm in character development, evident with the love story that moves a lot when it has to be, though in the first movie it's a bit slow. The last hour is extremely riveting and I will confess that I was at the edge of the chair when the Titanic sank. I will also say that the last five minutes have moved a lot. James Horner's musical score was great, although I've never been a big fan of My Heart Will Go On. The ministeries of 1996 were good, but suffered from underdeveloped scenarios and historical inaccuracies. Generally, I give Titanic 8.5 / 10. Bethany Cox.
