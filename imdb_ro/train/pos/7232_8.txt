After the usual tracking scene, Jerry accidentally enters an invisible ink bottle, part of a set of chemistry. It quickly discovers that it is invisible ... so the predictable results are produced, that is, he uses the new hidden condition to torment Tom. Jerry often defends himself, but often has a sadistic stretch in him that tortures the cat whenever possible, even when not challenged. This makes Tom think that his eyes deceive him when the cheese disappears in front of his eyes or milk on a plate. Tom can not take that, so he tries to sleep this nightmare, but Jerry lights his paw! Man, I hope the little children did not see these cartoons in the 1940s and '50s! I've always found Jerry, my little mouse, worse than cute. Fortunately, in cartoons, in general, any damage a character suffers is lost in seconds and returns to normal. <br /> <br /> The best part of this cartoon is about two-thirds of the way through when Tom realizes what the story is about Jerry and tries different methods to detect where the mouse is (such as putting the flour on the floor to see his fingerprints).
