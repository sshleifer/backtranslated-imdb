The best martial arts movie ever made. This movie is better than anything Bruce Lee ever did. A classic with a very fun and brutal climate. Jackie Chan is the king of martial arts and the real king of kung fu. It is a great pity that while Bruce Lee was so overestimated, Jackie Chan took an eternity to become popular in Europe and America. Jackie has rules !!!!
