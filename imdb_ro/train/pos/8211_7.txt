After I've never seen Harry Dirty, I've judged this movie on a clean art. And I have to say I really enjoyed it. Of course, some of Sondre Locke's shares made me a little bit nasty - but hey, it was in the '80s. But even if you can not get through it (and I could not) or her revenge killing (which seems a little overwhelmed, P), it's worth just Dirty Harry. Or, at least, the bull dog he calls "MeatHead" with affection: P 7/10.
