this film is so complex that it can be given any description and roll with it. you have a mainly insecure, troubled and fascinating character (played by Jean-Pierre Léaud) that is caught between two (not, three) women. we listen to its social, philosophical and moral idiosyncrasies in endless monologues, we see them working their magic around the three women they love. this could be the premise for a bird movie, full of rigid, cold, uninteresting comments. but director Jean Eustache manages to keep it fresh, ironic and full of witchcraft. being such a long film, can only burst into laughter when, after two hours of polite talk, Jean-Pierre Léaud suddenly calls on the phone as he remembers a rough line of a film. such situations are purely cinematic and can not be fully restored in a commentary. nor can anyone restore the tragic and painfully beautiful monologue of Françoise Lebrun to the end of the film. 3 and 1/2 hours and it's worth every minute.
