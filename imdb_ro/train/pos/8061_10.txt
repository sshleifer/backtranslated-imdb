Victor McLaglen's performance is one of the most beautiful in the history of the film. I think we can all feel "Gypo," because we all fought with what is good and what is not and was wrong. This was one of the first artworks to have been released by a large American film studio (RKO Radio Pictures). Joseph H. August's cinematography is the best here. However, August's stunning part was largely neglected; he did not receive the Oscar nomination he was rightly worth. This is a psychological drama, with thought, philosophy, sadness, all transmitted with fewer words.
