Several TV movies should be made like this. I saw it back in '93 when it was the first time on television. Helen Hunt and Steven Weber were so wonderful, offering very tough and realistic performances. Weber was particularly good, turning into an exceptionally creepy and undervalued performance as a child molesting / murderer. This movie has increased my respect for Hunt as an actress. The director also directed the "Hoosiers", which was so formidable and interesting. But the direction of both works has the same simple and simple realism, attractive. If you like television movies that are not predictable and overactive, see if you can. The side story about Hunt and Fahey's business is also appealing, without detracting from the main story.
