Three girls (a media team, including cult-actress Barbara Bach, no less) visit a small town to cover a festival, rent a room in a house that he should have avoided as a plague. Well made shocking, suffering a bit from redundant dialogue scenes and a rather thin plot of plot (which does not really hide their secrets). A main theme, in particular, is quite disturbing (as in: the vintage shock material), and this is essentially what develops in the film. Performances and cinema are pretty much over the hair (compared to many other films in the 1970s and early 80s in the same direction), but what really makes me recommend that this movie is the extremely long scene in the underground climate. Since the introduction of the "Keller Junior" character, his performance has made my jaw opening and not closing until the end of the movie. A very pleasant surprise to see actor Sydney Lassick (who was funny wacko in "One Flew over Nest's Nest" and now completely demented in "The Unseen") takes one of the main roles.
