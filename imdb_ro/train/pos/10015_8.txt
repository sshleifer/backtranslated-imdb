Gabriel Williams, one of the best friends in the world, became a friend of a fourteen-year-old Wisconsin boy named Pete Logand (Rory Culkin) who wrote a book detailing sexual abuse from his parents. To boot, Pete has AIDS, and this forces Gabriel even further, because his partner Jess (Bobby Cannavale, good) happens to be a survivor of HIV himself. He also gets acquainted with Pete's guard, a woman named Donna (Toni Collette, brilliant!) and when Gabriel decides he wants to meet and talk to them in person and go in Wisconsin, he discovers some secrets he was not ready to find. Based on the real events that happened with Armistead Maupin (who co-wrote the script with Terry Anderson) and directed by Patrick Stetner, this movie moves much faster (90 minutes, perhaps a few more minutes) than s - could think of a genre genre. It's good to keep the action and the story tilted and clear. It is bad in the fact that it leaves different holes in the plot and does not squeeze any of the openings of the plot or the back story. I prefer not to go into wonderful details but to say that if you are not familiar with Mr.Maupin's work or his personal story, you feel a little out of the loop here. However, Williams's shows (I would like to hear more about his story personally), Collette, Cannavale, Culkin, and much of the support distribution (the waitress at Colete Donna restaurant is attending a great job with what little side she has!) are the first time and the mood set here - namely, the cool and dark exterior of Wisconsin and New York - offers a wonderful setting for this story. Maybe they have unpleasant endings, but it's still a fairly convincing story.
