Walter Matthau and George Burns work so well together. Willy's acidity with perplexed amnesic amnesics is a mixture made in the heavens. The scene when they meet again in Willy's apartment is a precious stone, and the final scene approaches the film to perfection. Walter Matthau gives a gorgeous interpretation as the semi-retired comedian comedian, but perhaps, exaggerated voice and drama, along with his general misunderstanding of what is happening, is a great characterization. George Burns' synchronization is legendary and nowhere was better than in this movie, his calm with dry desert answers is memorable. Watch the scene near the end when Al and his daughter ask him something about the Spanish caretaker and Al-priceless reaction.
