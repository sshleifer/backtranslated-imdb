This is a clever love film all along the time. The film is that Keaton is looking for his love in the Stone Age, in ancient Rome and now (the 1920s). In all three cases, he is the usual Buster vampire and is fighting against Wallace Beery for his lady's love. Of the three periods of time, I think I liked the novel best, although I admit it could have been the darkest. I really liked the lion scenes, which was obviously a type of costume, as well as the strange run of the car in the snow - but what I liked most was to see all the amazing Keaton acrobatics. However, all three time periods were old-fashioned fun and the movie, while not the best, is still an exceptional and enjoyable film. Check it out!
