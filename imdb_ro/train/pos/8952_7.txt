Gillian Holroyd (Kim Novak) is a witch. In secret, she was attracted to her rather normal neighbor, Shep Henderson (James Stewart). She casts a spell on Shep, which forces him to pull his fiance and fall for her. Things are pretty nice until Gillian discovers that he cares about this mortal man. She decides to tell her the secret. But how will Shep react when he finds out that he has been "deceived" to fall in love with Gillian? <br /> <br /> As for comedies in the 1950s, Bell Book and Candle is good, but nothing spectacular. It's a good time and you have to call almost anyone who sits with it. Just do not get into the movie waiting for the biggest thing from cut bread. The movie is cute, sometimes funny and finally touches. Kim Novak and James Stewart do all they can and have real chemistry. Novak (as others have pointed out) seems unbelievable in a way undervalued. Support Jack with Jack Lemmon, Hermione Gingold and Elsa Lanchester is often funny and steals much of the spotlight from Novak and Stewart. The biggest problem I see is that Bell Book and Candle can not quite decide what kind of movie she wants to be. Is it a comedy with a screwdriver? Is it a romantic comedy? Is it a supernatural comedy? If the director Richard Quine stayed with one approach, the movie could have been better and more memorable.
