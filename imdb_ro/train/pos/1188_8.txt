I was initially dubious about this movie (just because of the subject), but the richly drawn characters, the fabulous scenes of buffalo hunting and the dramatic conclusion make it well-watched. Initially I had trouble distinguishing between the two buffalo hunters, but as the film progresses, they are increasingly distinguished. I'm still haunted by the final scene.
