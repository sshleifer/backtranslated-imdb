Skip McCoy is a three times lost pocket, unable to hinder his instinct back on the street, chooses his Candy bag on a subway train. What she does not realize is that Candy performs a top secret microfilm, an interesting microfilm for many organizations. Director Samuel Fuller has made an exceptional drama among the underworld of the New York City. Communist spies and shady government agencies mix together to make Pickup On South Street a rippling view from the first minute to the last. Based on Dwight Taylor's story called Blaze Of Glory, Fuller excited this adaptation with a serious political agenda, which many felt at the time, but only to focus on anti-communist inclinations, make it a great disadvantage. /> <br /> Sawing a little deeper and finding characters so interesting as any of those Fuller guided, the main protagonist for one is the hero of the play, a crook and a superficial human being, his hero does not is born of love for his country, it is born of his stubborn thoughts. It is a pretty big achievement that Fuller has created one of the best anti heroes of the 1950s and I'm sure he was very grateful for Richard Widmark's performance as McCoy for all sorts of smiles and cold cold hearts for interaction with the wonderful Jean Peters Cand Candy is great, it's the heart of the movies. However, she is nominated for The Oscar Thelma Ritter, who takes her acting honors, her Moe is strong and as soft as the characters around her, but there is a tired heat that Ritter delivers her majestically. film in texture, but a movie in execution, Pickup On South Street is a true classic and fun movie, which is the best of the most exciting director. 9/10
