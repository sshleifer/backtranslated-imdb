I thought this movie was wonderfully planned to make me confused and my cousin who looked at me. to tell the truth I think young Kevin Dillon was hot.hahahaha ... but I also thought the girl was stupid to go along with the cop and what happened wrong with what she told him before his death " I was inside you. " I think that's what he's doing to do what he's done with him and how he'll tell him she's too young when he does not care how old the other girls are. Now I do not think I myself could ever trust a cop like this. But to tell the truth it was quite obvious that he was even if he wanted to become a cop. by him either way.and that it was fun when she splashed it in the eye in the store.hahahahaha.she was still bad to enter the warehouse again and so was the cop who died HELLO! are called back-up. Sometimes these movies make me angry when people act stupid and do stupid things. But that's what I think I thought about the movie.
