Before Nicholas Cage was a big star, he was a great actor. This less known movie is where Cage gives one of the best performances. "Red Rock West" was a low-budget movie, almost unknown, but it's one of my favorite movies of all time. I discovered that he was going to the corridor of the video store and wanted to see Cage and Hopper (who is also great in the movie) are coming together. Go and take this and I'm sure you will not be disappointed.
