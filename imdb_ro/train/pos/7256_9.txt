I saw the great day of death when it first came out to the cinema, I thought the movie gave a good point to the soldiers, gave a realistic account of the men in the war. The story moves in a beautiful rhythm, showing a group of men behind the enemy lines and trying to return to their own lines with an enemy prisoner. Characters are well-developed and credible. David Hemmings is a good actor and plays the lead role with conviction, like Alan Dobie (as German Helmut), I was surprised that I could not find this movie on VHS or DVD and I feel it has become the forgotten movie, which is sad because it is superior to many other war movies I've seen.
