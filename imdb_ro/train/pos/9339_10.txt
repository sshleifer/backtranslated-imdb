For those of you who do not have that reference, clubberin was 4 fists hitting a body ... Anyway, on the review. I miss WCW Saturday Night. Some of my favorite fights have taken place on this stage. I remember watching Steve Austin, Rick Rude, Brian Pillman, Jack Cactus, Dustin Rhodes, Johnny B. Badd, DDP in his days of work, Lord Steven Regal, Harlem Heat, Ricky Steamboat, STING ... enumerating all . The point is WCW had a wonderful list on the pre-Hogan days and were producing television entertainment. Dusty Rhodes about the comments of the later years gave me a completely new reason to watch when I started smoking a pot as a teenager ... I really want Vince to put him down for a show or two, the next Great American Bash? They CLUBBERIN! Here comes DAY! He was great. <br /> <br /> -DirrTy
