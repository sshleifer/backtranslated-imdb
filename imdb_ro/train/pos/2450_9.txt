I have been watching this show since I was 14 years old and since then I loved it. I like this show because it's just funny! You will enjoy this show very much because it looks something new and funny every day and my favorite part is when Benny always has the last comment about George after every punch about his giant fat head. * Laugh * I would laugh and watch with my friends at home would be like watching a funny but short film. Love George Lopez. Funny, talented, funny, spectacular. This is a fun and fun comedy series for everyone and you will surely enjoy it - I did! And if you have not seen it yet, we suggest starting to watch, because you do not want to stop watching. Even if there are no new episodes, I'm still happy to re-run. Still funny. Never lose. <br /> <br /> 9/10
