"Holly" is a problem-based movie, but it's neither manipulant nor too sentimental. In his heart, it is a film of character that would not be as successful without the portraits of Patrick (Ron Livingston), the lost soul with the gradually awakened consciousness and Holly (Thuy Nguyen), the young Vietnamese desirable, but ultimately outdated . From vibrant locations and from photographers to efficient editing, everything is open and well done. Contemporary classical score may drop at first, but it is a top composition and underlines the admirable constraint that is evident throughout. This film, which raises many problems, but offers some clear answers, eventually succeeds in sensitizing and compassioning Holly and those who share her situation. Kudos to those who managed to do it.
