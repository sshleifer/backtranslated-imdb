... would probably be the best word to describe this movie (in my opinion). besides a big heck of a fan service for fan girls (well, it was redundant ~), it was the story that broke out far. hate for Takahisa Zeze and Gackt! and I know some people will not agree with me, but there was none of the three great actors (boys who played Sho, Son and Kei) who gave the best performances (for me, anyway). it was Taro Yamamoto, the # 5 boy of the Royale Battle! <br /> <br /> Do not misunderstand me, I like Hyde, I worshiped her voice, but the problem was that some of her scenes came a little 'off', but I liked the scene in which she danced the body dead by killing the other guys. and Gackt was not that bad at all, I preferred how his character was a kind of aloof from the beginning. nothing I can say too much about my past on the lee-Hom Wang, I will not claim to know him, but he wore his own weight with the Star-cast cast. <br /> <br /> This film has paved the way for one of the best collaborations I have ever heard, Orenji No Taiyou (forgive my spelling if it's wrong). While the full song takes about nine minutes, you will not notice the length, because you will enjoy listening to Gackt and Hyde together. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is a must-see not only for the fans (huge fans base ~), but also for those who enjoy SF, futuristic, Asian-style movies.
