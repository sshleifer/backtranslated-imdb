This film had a large ensemble of adult actors along with a cast of young actors who will be in movies for a long time if there is no justice. Direction and editing were great. I can look for the book from which she was adapted, it must have been great. (I liked it.) Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight and Tim Blake Nelson were an explosion to watch! Henry Winkler and Nathan Davis were not seen enough, but they were fun when they were on the screen. The children in the camp could not have been better. (as I said, I liked it!)
