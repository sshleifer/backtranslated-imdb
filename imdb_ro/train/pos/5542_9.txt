Probably the best picture of Producers Releasing Corp ever made, this small piece of horror draws attention from the beginning to the last. Director Frank Wisbar knows, of course, a good story when he writes one more important thing, he knows how to realize his full shock potential on the screen. Not only the plot involving fascinating characters drawn, but the setting is absolutely out of this world! Almost all action takes place either at night or in the middle of a crowded, permeable cloud. This cooling atmosphere is enhanced by Wisbar's inventive direction and the fully convincing performance he has attracted from all his players. Wonderful Rosemary La Planche makes an ideal, beautiful, lively but vulnerable heroine. Robert Barrat offers his full-length portrait alongside the local mariwig film, although it is hard to believe that the character and good-natured guy who interprets his son is none other than the writer / director Blake Edwards.
