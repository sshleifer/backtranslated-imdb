I always look forward to this movie when it's on TV. I have to get the DVD. The range of different types of people is wonderful. I am told that anyone can be a dancer if he tries a lot. My favorite character must be Mr. Aoki. He is so weird, but so full of emotions. It's a perfect movie with great dance. Unfortunately, we never have the chance to see them go to Blackpool. It would be for the perfect continuation if it had. But I think it leaves your imagination to what might happen. A very simple and innocent story. He remains loyal to his wife and daughter. I did not see the remake of Hollywood. I'm not sure if I want to. I do not like Jennifer Lopez at all. I think Richard Gere fits more with the original than with Lopez. I have the feeling that the remake is not as simple and innocent.
