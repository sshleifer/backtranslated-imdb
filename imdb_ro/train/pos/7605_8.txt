Lost is a series of extremely well-made television about some lost people on an island. there are so many twists and turns that you can not really decide who your favorite character is, a minute she does when she does something, so she's louder then she's about to do something, so she's the loudest, then the suspense accumulates and exactly as you are to break the episode ends and you like noooooooooooooooooooo !!!!!! so you have to wait a whole week also see the next episode, but it is worth waiting. Suspicion, action, romance, humor has taken everything outside topless girls, but that's good, it means you can focus on the story more and the story is about what it is all about. so if you like a good story and that suspense it is a good one but 24 think it's probably better (I have a review that also you could check out.) I would lose a good 8 out of 10 mainly because it is so unpredictable, you never know what will happen next.
