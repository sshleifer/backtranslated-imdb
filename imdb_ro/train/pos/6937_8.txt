The agitated West revolves around the story of the famous early western rifle, coveted by one and all. James Stewart is the cowboy winning winner Winchester in a shootout just to lose him in a robbery. The story of the details follows Stewart to watch the rifle and a certain man through the movie. The gun changes hands over time, as if the owner is led to lose it through violence. The picture has a lot of action and suspense, as Stewart closes in his career. A pleasant distribution supports Stewart here, namely Stephen McNally, Dan Durya, Millard Mitchell, John McIntire and Jay C. Flippen. Shelley Winters seems to be here and her role is rather obscure. Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson, adolescent teenagers in recent years, have short, but good roles.
