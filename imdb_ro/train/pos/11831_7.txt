Despite the gorgeous and stunning animation, this is probably one of the most unexpected Disney movies I've seen and does not really shoot Disney movies. The spirit is a wild stallion that is repeatedly caught either by cavalry or by Indians, both trying to "break" it. The spirit ends by forming a connection with the Indian and, in short, the story. Except for the beautiful horses animation, I, not even five years old, have been very inspired or delighted with this movie. It is ironic that it is titled "Spirit", because the spirit is what this film could have used more. An extra point was given to the soundtrack, which was enjoyable with songs by Bryan Adams and Hans Zimmer. And although this movie is rated G, you will probably have to end up explaining what it means to "rip a horse" at the age of five. I did. <br /> <br />
