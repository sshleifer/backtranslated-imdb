The synopsis for this movie makes a great job in explaining what to expect. It's a very good thriller. Good shot. It's hard to believe it was Bill Paxton's directorial debut, though some pictures look exactly like a script version. <br /> <br /> However, there are a few photos that look really good and show some real imagination from Paxton. <br /> <br /> It's a solid story with a few big breaks at the end, many of them, all credible, all fun and, all the best, all hidden well enough to make real twists. <br /> <br /> The child's actors in the film also make a big one. I'm usually wary of movies with children in the main roles because too often they come as Nickelodeon rejects, but both of these children do a good job. This movie is not crazy. It's not very scary. But it is very, very creepy.
