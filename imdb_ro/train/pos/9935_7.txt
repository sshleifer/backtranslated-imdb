My name is Domino Harvery. {YOUR} DRAWING * CHOP} My name - my name is Domino Harvey. {CUT, CHOP} My name is Domino Harvey. {EDIT X. CUT. Playback} <br /> <br /> I have never seen a director who will take a long time for his style. Until now, it's obvious that most people do not appreciate Tony Scott's editing technique, dizzy and dizzy. If I have to choose between love and hate, I'd say I like it. It was fun sometimes distorted, but the end result was pretty good and it's nice to see a director with a creative edge in his style and some originality (even if he borrows a lot from MTV). This stylistic edge is manifested by the fact that Keira Knightley plays the role of a bounty hunter, Domino Harvey, and even her dialogue seems strangely strange. Otherwise, she plays badly, because I hated pretty much and did not feel a bit with her, no matter how much she suffered. We follow Domino through her life while joining my colleagues Mickey Rourke, Rizwan Abbasi and Edgar Ramirez. The crew messing FBI and suddenly has a reality show contract in the company's television production of Christopher Walken (by the way, what makes Christopher Walken in every movie, by the way?). I think it's a smart film technique, because now Tony Scott is free to use as many MTV / Reality Show movies as he likes. It becomes a label of MTV culture at this time. Then the story is narrated at an amazingly rapid pace, with a multitude of powerful and violent violence against weapons. There are some fun jokes; all are very modern and surrealistic at the same time. It's a mess, but it's a pretty good mess. It is ultimately flawed in many ways (actors trying to do too much character "cold" for one), but it works. I give it a 7/10 weak, which may seem generous in comparison with the general consensus of the shooting who ranked this film? but I feel he has some good ideas and he has done well. 7 out of 10
