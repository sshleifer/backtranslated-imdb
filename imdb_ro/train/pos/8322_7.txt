IQ is a nice romantic comedy that includes two great actors who seem to create good on the screen. The plot is a typical wrong type for the girl, the guy becomes a girl but makes a solid point that you have to love with your heart and not with your mind. Adding Albert Einstein and his genius band offers excellent comic relief. Overall, a good movie. Not great but good
