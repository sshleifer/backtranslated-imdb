The first picture of the film shows a mountain ridge in the early morning mist, and my thought was: "This is almost too beautiful." And it happens: Landscape and animal images that look like a series of romantic paintings, each of them perfect in every detail. Even the girl's room, her father's car - everything is nostalgic, romantic, beautiful. This might seem overwhelming and escapist, but it fits a story that is itself a silent beauty that is on the border between life and fairytale, between Dian Fossey and Le Petit Prince. I liked every minute. The extreme expression of the film, having a simple, slow story, just an actor and hardly any special effects, has exerted a strong magic. That's why I find it regrettable that this parody is abandoned in the last few minutes, when two additional actors are suddenly introduced (the girl as a mature woman and her son). Another shortcoming is music, which is often intrusive, Hollywood-like and sometimes inappropriate: we could not bring a pop song alongside the French mountain glory. I went to the film with my two little daughters, but I also recommend it to adults, considering that they appreciate this kind of film. Obviously, not everyone does that.
