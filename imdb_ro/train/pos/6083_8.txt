Brian Dennehy, Bill Paxton, Joe Pantalino and, above all, Jeff Fahey, in a single film. Wow is all I can say about this. These are four of the most underestimated actors in the biz and work nicely together. It is like poetry the way they play each other and the natural ability to appear as if they were the best friends over time even for filming the film. The film itself is fine and one that can be quite intense to see first, and the four stars greatly help the reviewer. I can not describe how good it was to see Bill Paxton and Jeff Fahey together on the screen, the biggest moment being to follow a remote couple and fill my voice alone, almost bringing me a tear to my eyes. <br /> A good movie, a great cast, visit. Why? Four words, Fahey, Dennehy, Paxton, Pantalino.
