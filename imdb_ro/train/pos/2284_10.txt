This is a very cold and, for the most part, a well-thought-out drama. I am very impressed with the film, not just because of the plot and gorgeous act, but that it has been made such a unique movie. Most movies involving a spy or war are full of a British speaking fluent or a strong battle, but not that. It is not about such a war, about the war between man and his position in life, an American spy in Germany, who is a supporter of an evil that no one will ever forget. When the war ends, Campell believes he will come home as a hero, but his true heroic position must remain a government secret. Returning to America, Campell meets with Nazi supporters, as well as the Nazis, offering interesting conflicts both internally and externally. Dare more than take off the role, and it fits pretty well for what it demands.
