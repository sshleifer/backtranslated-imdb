A lot is dated in this episode (like most episodes in the Twilight Zone), such as the "incredibly sexual military uniform of the woman." And some things are as incredible as the easy availability of clean water. However, consider the year in which this was done and the time, and quickly understand why this episode is as special as you look. She has a beautiful feeling of hope, something missing from many Twilight Zone, as well as an interesting female character (despite the fact she rarely speaks), something else in the Twilight area. "Two" is a wonderful example of how the Twilight Zone, in just over 20 minutes, could pack more emotions and dramas than most two-hour films today. And it's great to see two people who have become American icons so early in their career.
