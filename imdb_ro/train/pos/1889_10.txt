My family chased Arthur Bach to stumble and to rob it since the movie came out for the first time. We have the most saved lines. I looked at her two weeks ago, and yet I guessed the simple humor and life vision portrayed by Dudley Moore. Liza Minelli did a great job as a side shot - though I'm not her biggest fan. This movie makes me enjoy watching movies. My favorite scene is when Arthur visits his fianc√©'s house. His conversation with Susan's butler and dad is spit. The butler's line, "Would you like to wait in the Library," followed by Arthur's answer, "Yes, I would like the bathroom is out of the question," is my NEWMAIL notification on my computer. "Arthur is really" fun stuff "!
