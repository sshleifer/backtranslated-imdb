Watching this more than once as a child has been a pretty good experience 15 years ago, and now that I have found it again, it still has a film experience like a few others. If it's risky, it's a great show of morality and life lessons recommended for watching the family with young children. While still retaining an adult, I was fortunate enough to learn from it many times many years ago. Trying to find her today is quite difficult. . . but believe me it's worth being regardless of age. Anime fans will especially find this extraordinary entrance to Masami Hata's film. With an impressive work of art and a unique design, "Chirin No Suzu" is a worthwhile experience. While some lyrical songs are not so hot when they are recorded in English, the musical score is still exciting. But even the voice acting is much better than today launched today. Unfortunately, it came out of print in the mid 1980s from RCA Columbia Home Video, and did not receive any new format to my knowledge, at least in the US. Look hard and you will be quite pleased! It is an attraction point, intense, pleasant and important in Japanese animation.
