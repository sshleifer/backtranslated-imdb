Though I did not feel anything about Lance's character, I felt his wife could have done much better with anyone else. It could have been a much stronger film if he spent more time developing characters, maybe with Lance - I would have liked it better. However, I have to agree with DoyleLuver when they said "And to quote Glenn Quinn's character, Ben:" I am the star from here, so I'm the talented! "" If you watch the movie, watch it, even if it's in the background ... just his facial expressions, all in the eye, you know for sure what Ben is motivating, just how he feels the comments, even if it's a quick look behind a character. Great action in a fair movie.
