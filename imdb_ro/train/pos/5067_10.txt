Here on IMDb.com I read an opinion that Gray Owl is Pierce Brosnan's best ever character. I do not know if he had better or worse roles, I'm not his fan, but that was really exceptional. The other thing - the impressive filmmaker's hand. I pay respect. The sensation, the beauty and the spirit of the wilderness have been truly illustrated, I have never met such an approach in any movie before. Another thing remained in my mind after the film - this is the closest movie to the original books and the atmosphere in it. <br /> <br /> And a little more. I pay my respect for the original Gray Owl.
