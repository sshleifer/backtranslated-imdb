This was one of the best war movies I've seen, because it focuses on characters more than the current war. All distribution makes a great job, and because most are relatively unknown, it makes everything seem more credible. The image of the camera is great, so was the pace and editing. This movie will actually come to you and cause the audience to take care of the characters.
