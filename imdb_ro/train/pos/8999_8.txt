This film does not make any pretentious efforts to hide its true genre - a campy movie B. The end of the camp will end. It should have given the adjective sense of the cheese. But the two come together in this movie in ways that make you go, "Hmmmmm ... that's so stupid!" and then laugh. For example, there is a scene back in "Japan of the 16th Century," which shows a pair of samurai walking in the forefront of a temple. In the backdrop of the temple, there are more tourists looking distant in slippers and shorts. Hmmmm ... hahahah! I could not help laughing anymore. And the act goes from decent to bearable to Oh, God, but that makes it funny. You will see some decent actors and then you will find others really terrible. I have to get away, though, because I've seen Stephanie Sanchez in several tracks and it's great. Her filming time in the movie was pretty short. I've seen Bryan Yamasaki in several tracks on the islands during my visits and is also better in theater than in this movie. Anyway, it's a fun movie if you have nothing to do on Saturday night.
