Bela made 9 pictures for Monogram, but only at ACEASTA, the 4th, things started to unite. All others in the series would use this model as an essential model for production, writing and character development. From here, better or worse, the series would also address an essential theme: a scientist (usually Bela) is doing experiments in the basement or the old house (sometimes in the basement of the old house), which makes things happen blaoice. This was the first time that art director Dave Milton had the opportunity to spread his wings. He came aboard for BLACK DRAGONS before the shot, but THIS is where he gets to make the craft start clicking. Lewis made a wonderful atmosphere for almost nothing, and he was around for the rest of the monograms. Casting is the key to these, and it's a good B movie here. You will get Barclay and Harlen (also from BLACK DRAGONS) alongside Russell, who will star in the CAT PEOPLE movies in Lewtons ... and Rosetto, from SPOOKS RUN WILD ... a beautiful slice of Poverty Row talent. If you have a limited time and budget, start with it ... summarizes everything they have learned so far and offers you something to compare with others. Parcel? Bela steals the juice of the gland to keep his ugly young wife. They both like to sleep in the coffin. If you can read and smile, the rest will be easy.
