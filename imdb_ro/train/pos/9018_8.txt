Despite its limited liberation in this country and its apparent ignorance in other countries (the "R" rating in states can not be helped - sincerely, just because HBC uses the word C!) This is actually a fine work. Sentimentalism occasionally threatens to suffocate him, but is overcome by the game of the two leaders. It is easy to earn pleasure just because you play a physical or mental paralyzer (Daniel Day-Lewis, Geoffrey Rush, Dustin Hoffman, etc.), and Helena Bonham-Carter may not capture much of the physical degradation of the MND, the ruthless emotional movement compensates entirely. In fact, almost all of her performances take place through her eyes (and what eyes!). This is a clever change from an actress who quickly overthrows her Rose Rose reputation and appears as a stature. The awards must certainly follow, but unfortunately, not for this fabulous performance. Branagh, he feels, never gave the best results on the film (except the possible "Hamlet" big cast). Here, however, he exalts his other appearances, playing at the handle a self-wandering, unstable, and ultimately pleasant guy, with a subtlety that he does not always look and which has both intelligence and depth. In short, we believe him as much as we can not believe Frankenstein as a priest in The Proposition as a lawyer in The Gingerbread Man, just as Andrew in Peter's Friends. This is certainly the best performance - yet why could not produce the goods much earlier? As a movie, it looks more like a television offer and, without its stars, it probably would not get much. But it was a pleasure to see that this pair meets their socks so I look forward to them more (although not "Love's Labor's Lost" ...). 8 out of 10, but Branagh and HBC have 10 out of 10.
