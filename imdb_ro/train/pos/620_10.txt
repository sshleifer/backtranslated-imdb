The beautiful story of Stardust is written by Neil Gaiman (the writer MirrorMask) and is really a good story. I think he would appeal to any Labyrinth, Princess Bride or fan of the 10th King and yet it is totally unique and rises on himself. And I feel that adapting the film to this story has a much better end than what was presented in Neil Gaiman's original novel. I will not hurt her for you. The main character, Tristan (Tristran in the novel), is the son of a mortal slave and beast kept by a witch in the field of beer. The story begins in a city near a wall that separates the magical world from the human world. When there is a falling star, Tristan promises to recover it for a girl with whom she is infatuated. He does not know that the star has taken the form of a girl in the world of fairy tale and that there are others after her. Three elder witches who want to use their hearts to become young again and some princes of defeat. It's a very good story. It has humor and magical and beautiful scenes, surrealistic and visual. It's charming and I feel they can be watched by children and adults of all ages. It's just magic. It's a true fairy tale I've never seen in cinemas since the 1980s.
