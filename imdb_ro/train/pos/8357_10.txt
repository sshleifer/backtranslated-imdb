A wonderful, free, lively, often lyrical film that revolves around you, ever smiling, even if there are truly shocking incidents along the way. Sometimes women look at the way women are treated, and yet, in the end, they seem to get through very well and it is a lot of credit to all those interested that so many potentially disastrous scenarios work so well. This is probably the best performance of Depardieu, certainly the most natural. Jeanne Moreau remarkably plays the role that a very difficult role must play, including intense sexual intercourse with some boys at least half of his age. Miou-Miou is great all over again and again he has very difficult to play. Initially, this seems to be a misogyny down and dirty rant / romp, but as the story and the characters reveal a much younger and honest picture appears. Finally, this uncompromising and bold film calls for respect.
