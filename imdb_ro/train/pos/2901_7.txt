Tiempo de Valientes fits perfectly into the genre of the amicable action movie, but overcomes its roots due to excellent casting, an extraordinary relationship between its traps and a remarkable picture. Diego Peretti plays Dr. Silverstein, a psychiatrist in charge of the gun with detective Diaz (Luis Luque), who has been assigned to investigate the killing of two minor traps that seem to have been involved in conspiracy to smuggle weapons. Diaz has been suspended from duty, but he is the best man for this job and must have a professional psychiatric help to be rebuilt. Silverstein and Diaz are soon armed in a conspiracy involving Argentina's intelligence community and a uranium, and the film separates them to a crucial point that allows Silverstein to develop his own impressive skills. Peretti and Luque are excellent together and I remember the screen team Terence Hill and Bud Spencer, although Peretti is not as beautiful as Hill. Remarkably, even for almost two hours, Tiempo de Valientes is not losing his welcome, and indeed director-director Damian Szifron sets a potential sequel to the charming movie. All in all, a wonderful and fun comedy that does not lure the slightest common denominator or insult your intelligence.
