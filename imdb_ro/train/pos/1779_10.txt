I love this movie! 10 out of 10 hands down! It's that good curse! I'm not a fan of the movies, but I have to tell you that he opened my eyes. Amazing color and fast energy. I was lucky to see this on a visit during the Zoinks program! Boston Film Festival, and the story surrounded me from the beginning. He had a lot of adult themes and characters, and when he finished, I wanted more. Hope to make a follow up. That would be fun. My only problem with her is the interpretation of Melissa Connor as Anya. UGH! She SUCKS! I saw a wooden block that made better performance. I do not think what the director thought when he threw it. But if you ignore it, you can only help it to give this movie a great ten!
