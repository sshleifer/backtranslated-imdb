I did not see this movie, but I have to. After reading all three of Thor Heyerdahl's books (Kon Tiki, Ra and Aku Aku), I'm looking for a copy of this movie. The thesis Peruvians migrate to Polynesia is alive and good. Since this crew did not have GPS and only a 6-watt old radio (tube), their journey was heroic. tell me the location of a copy of this video. <br /> <br /> I would be interested to buy it.
