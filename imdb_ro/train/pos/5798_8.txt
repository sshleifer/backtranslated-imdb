I saw this first when they showed this around Easter in 1993/4 and I did not think too much then, I bought this stuff on DVD last summer when I started going to Michael Jackson, enjoyed his music before) and I enjoyed more now I am older. It's a good movie, but it will not be this classic movie, like The Sound Of Music, West Side Story, The Wizard of Oz etc. Michael Jackson as actor was good and so were the other cast members. There were terrible scenes such as Katie's little girl who was hit by gangster Frankie Lideo played by Joe Pesci. The scene that scared me when I was younger was when Michael turned into a robot. My favorite song on the film was Smooth Criminal I think it was better than Thriller in my opinion.
