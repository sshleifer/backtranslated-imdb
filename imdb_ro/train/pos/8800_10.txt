First of all, I do not understand why some people find this movie so anti-American. Of course, there are times when the United States are directly accused, as in the Youssef Chahine, Ken Loach and, to a certain extent, Mira Nair segments. But come on, there are no na√Øve accusations; instead, it is based on real and documented facts, and all documents issued by the CIA about Chile confirm this, for example. But by turning myself back to the movie myself, what I liked the most is the variety of arrangements we find in it. We find educated children for the respect of all those who died at the event; we find an unfortunate couple that will be changed by the tragedy of that day; we find ordinary people who have their degraded feelings in the shadow of the September 11 events and react differently to it with dignity or frustration; we even find someone in the movie for whom the fall of the towers' land for a moment of real happiness. All of these visions and others - as powerful as these or even more - make a consistent and helpful blend of the spectator to have a look at how different people spread around the world reacted to the September 11 events. Thus, what we see is a panorama that is more complex than whites and blacks, which can make some people annoyed; but this is the world we live in, and there is no room for Manichaean ideologies, no matter what the presidents or priests can tell us. Finally, I think it's a shame that there is not even a release date for this movie in the United States. It's a shame because most Americans wonder why this catastrophe happened and this movie could give them clues. This film makes it very clear - different from what some people think of this forum - that everything we do today will determine our future and that past errors will affect how we live today.
