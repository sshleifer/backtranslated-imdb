This story was probably one of the most powerful I've ever taken. John Singleton certainly went on and on when he put together this educational masterpiece. Spectacular performances of the entire cast, but Epps and Rapaport have turned into the best and most convincing of each youngster's career. However, as a college student, many of the problems that Singleton attracted were taken to the extreme. In a sense that although there are problems faced by many university campuses, they are not presented as big or outdoors, as would make this film believe. In some cases, it seemed almost ridiculous to think that something of this nature might appear. However, besides being a bit dramatic, the film was brilliant and left me amazed, unable to talk, just to think. One of the things on this picture that I will remember forever was a quote from Lawrence Fishburn's character: "Knowledge is power, without knowledge, you can not see your strength." Brilliant, brilliant.
