A desperate guy trying to hit a beautiful girl on a bus. She refuses, but when she runs after someone trying to steal her bag they meet anyway. And there it starts - a relationship that is slightly embarrassed by the fact that she is a jealous and neurotic superhero. It can not be a secret that things between them will be problematic. In short, a story that could promise to grow into a great movie. And IMO, manages to be a beautiful movie. It's not a masterpiece, but I was in tears to laugh several times - the two main characters twist around each other in a fest of crazy love that is, even with the super- hero, credible. > So. Slim story, but it worked really funny, and so worthy of cinematic time. 7 out of 10 crushed hearts
