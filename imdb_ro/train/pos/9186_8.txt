Adrien Wilde, the worried magazine magazine for men (well played with considerable intensity by Michael Callan) has terrible nightmares in which he brutally kills the models. When the wonderful ladies begin to return, Adrien worries that he might be the killer. Writer / director William Byron Hillman tells the story captivating at a steady pace, builds up a reasonable amount of tension, offers some gruesomely powerful moments of wild misogynist violence (a woman who has a plastic trash bag with a bell snake placed in it overhead rates as a clear culmination-inducing wrinkling), puts a refreshing focus on real characters to beautifully drawn and engaging life, all the extra motives in a plausible everyday world, and charts things with a beautiful tangle of feminine nudity. Determining the fine of an excellent distribution helps many problems: Joanna Pettet as the sun, the charming love interest Mindy Jordache, James Stacy as a double macho brother Amy Adrien's BJ, Seymour Cassel as a psychiatrist concerned Adrien Dr. Frank Curtis, Don Potter as Adrien his feisty gay assistant Louis, Pamela Hensley as an angry suicide detective, Cleavon Little as police chief and Misty Rowe as a sweet model, Bambi bubble. R. The polished cinematography of R. Michael Stringer occasionally makes use of the impressive aerial photography. Jack Goga's tricky score also makes a trick. Popping in pieces of cold bits are Robert Tessier as the brash bartender, Sally Kirkland as the fancy prostitute, Kathy showering as a fiery woman wrestler fighting with B.J. in the ring, and Frances Bay in one of her standard, woman's old roles. A solid and enjoyable picture.
