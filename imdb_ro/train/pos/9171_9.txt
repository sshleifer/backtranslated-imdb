I'm a lover Jane Eyre and a purist, and this version includes almost all the important details of the book, and the characters are portrayed as I imagined. Jane Eyre is a complex story of great wealth and can not be properly broadcast in a long-length format, so a mini-TV series is needed. Timphy Dalton's Rochester is probably the best ever. There has been much talk about how attractive his age is. In the book, Jane (the narrator) describes him as "35 years old" rather than young but not yet middle-aged. I think Timothy Dalton was 38 years old when he did that, so he's fine. We also have only Jane's opinion if Rochester is nice. I met him and asked him just what she thought. As an inexperienced and humble girl, I can not imagine she says she thought her beautiful. The actor who plays Rochester must show us the character of man, and this is fulfilled for perfection. I love the relationship between the two leaders, which is the crucial question about this story and the humor of their encounters. Other versions blew it, but that's good. The 2006 version with Toby Stephens (37 years old) is underway on BBC1 and is really good indeed, so I will decide if this is my favorite when it's finished. Looking back on this series again, after seeing the 2006 release, we decided that this release with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clark is the best! Charlotte Bronte's dialogue is preserved and this is essential to the power of the story. Modernization does not work - it's a Victorian story and the archaic poetic discourse fits with the characters. This version has an excellent cast - Zela Clark is small and the difference in height between her and Rochester is important; Timothy Dalton has a real presence and is an amazing actor. There are no additional scenes to be redirected from the scene, and the scenario includes all the essential scenes, but it does not leave unnecessary details, making it all the way, and getting caught. I recommend all real fans of Jane Eyre.
