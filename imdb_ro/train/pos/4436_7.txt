Tattooed Stranger was one of those rare movies BBC2 watched on Christmas / New Year 2005-2006. See also they live through the night and Brighton Strangler. In this, a man walking on a dog in the Central Park meets an abandoned car and discovers a dead woman inside. She was shot and the police are trying to identify her only with a tattoo as the main hint. Once identified, the killer is uncovered and shot in the blows at the end. Most of this movie was shot at the location in and around New York, so we get to see some areas of the city normally do not see, especially on the back streets. Mostly unknown are in distribution, with John Miles getting top billing. Tattooed Stranger deserves to look. Excellent, but quite obscure. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
