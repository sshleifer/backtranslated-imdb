The 1960s are a mini-balanced series of historical facts and a good plot. In four deliveries, we are following a North American family with 3 members. But we do not see them only. We also watch the story of several characters like a black reverend, an extremist student leader and a soldier in Vietnam. The filmography is extraordinary. In the first chapters, we see some photos of the Vietnam War between scenes. The next chapter does not start where the last one went, it starts after a while, giving us a little mystery about what happened. Generally speaking, the Mini Series of the 1960s must be seen not only for hippies, but for all those with little curiosity about this subject.
