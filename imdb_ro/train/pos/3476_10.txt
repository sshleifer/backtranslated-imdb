Let's cut it down: If you are a child boomer, you have spent some time inevitably asking that in 1976 McCartney took care to give up the life of John's Hermit and spend the day with him. You also certainly asked how things went. I heard exactly the same reports the writer of this film heard from John and Paul, and I admit that we rebuilt the meeting in almost the same way as this film. But none of my pictures could have bought me tears in the way this incredible work and action works. We found it amazingly real, perfectly plausible and 100% sugar-free. Now, can anyone explain why I have not heard about this masterpiece before being shown by CBC last night? I mean he already has three years for good! And yes, if you are a Beatles fan, this is a performance to be seen! Even the subtle paraphrase of the Beatles in the background is inspired.
