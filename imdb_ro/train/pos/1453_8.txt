Well, there are a lot of ways to ruin a political thriller. They are usually derivative or too ambitious, often presenting a total paranoid and unbelievable conspiracy. But the Town Hall does not do any of the above. The plot is crafted, the story is credible. As for the characters, I would say that this film is a solid medium. No character seems to be out of place, and Al Pacino is brilliant as always. His representation of a charismatic mayor in New York is superb and proves again that Al Pacino is part of the absolute top of American actors nowadays.
