Well, I'll be honest: it's not exactly a queue. But you can not get one driver every week. In fact, you could see distinct signatures "not without my daughter" (Sally Field, 1991) in this movie. However, because the most "inspired" films go, it was a well-inspired, well-manipulated and well-done film. Nana Patekar, as usual, tends to exaggerate her hysterics, but all the other are commendable. Especially about the Dipti Naval: she has seen her after a long time, but she has not lost any kind of grace to her. In fact, she played much better when I saw her the last time. Another Bollywood Star That Seems to Grow Better As They Grow Again? Overall, a beautiful watch.
