"Gwyneth Paltrow" (Shakespeare in Love, Duets) has nothing to do with herself, but the painting, goes with her friends on her up and down hauler, greeting people in town and trying to fit on anyone knows. I think there were no movies or television in those days, and the girls had nothing but gossip. I wish I had read more. I like Gwyneth and I think she's a beautiful woman. She is talented, and in "Emma" she has the privilege of hearing Gwyneth singing. I look forward to seeing "duets" where she is supposed to sing. She is brave to speak British English with all those Native Britons, including Emma Thompson's sister, Miss Bates Sophie Thompson (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Dancing at Lughnasa). "Ms. Elton" Juliet Stevenson was considered one of the most promising actors since 1991. Gwyneth is part of the American film, being none other than the daughter of director Bruce Paltrow (St. Elsewhere) and Tony Blythe Danner (The Fingerprint Myth) . I hope it will be for a long time. Our luck! I liked Emma and I also recommend it. It is one of the old stories that are still accurate in those days. Favorite scenes: Emma singing and playing the piano. I like a lot when singing a duet. Favorite Quotes: Mr. Knightley ": Emma, ​​you did not ask me to contribute to a riddle." Emma: "Your whole personality is an enigma, Mr. Knightley. I thought you were too qualified." Miss Bates: "He left us without words, without words, to tell you and since then we have not talked about it yet."
