These guys are just the Usual Suspects! They are a whole lot of strangers who can see to get rid of it, but I am so unhappy that there is very little chance of it. No one is better than William H Macy in portraying the man with a big heart but down on luck. This is probably the best interpretation from Fargo. Rockwell played the boxer of meat to perfection, and the rest of the gang was just as good. Luis Guzman brought comic amusement as Cosimo, and George Clooney steals his role as a cameo. The heist scene at the end was absolutely hilarious. The direction was also on the spot by the Russo brothers. It was certainly a Coen brothers feel about the movie all across and it will be interesting to see how they will develop their career. They have a long way to go to Coen, but this is a great start and I look forward to their next celluloid outing. ....... "Yo mutha is a whore"!
