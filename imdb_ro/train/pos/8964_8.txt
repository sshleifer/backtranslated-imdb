With a happy coincidence in the same year that Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak made the "Vertigo" masterpiece of Alfred Hitchcock, they made this comedy easy as well. Perhaps the two actors had to do it after they went through the weight of Hitchcock. In any case, this great company in Vertigo, once again exploring a very unexpected but powerful story. In fact, the movie can be seen as part of the "Vertigo" with the happy ending. Here again, Novak undergoes a transformation; in Vertigo, she essentially plays two women and here she turns from witches to mortals. Stewart is again tangled and, for a while, tormented by his love for her. Unlike Vertigo, the two meet in "Bell Book and Candle", a perfect antidote for Hitcock. Again, the dynamics of love and attraction are examined, but in a totally different way. The cast is extraordinary. Lemmon hilarious like Novak's and Warren Lancaster's brother Warlock offering a classic show like aunt. Ernie Kovacs, the alcoholic writer and, of course, Hermoine Gingold playing Novak's competitor are all wonderful. The Stewart scene drinking the potion is the comedy about the best thing. Anyone who saw Vertigo or even if you did not see this memorable comedy.
