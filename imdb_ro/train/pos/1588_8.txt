* What I Like about SPOILERS * Adolescent Holly Tyler (Amanda Bynes) goes to live with her older sister Valerie (Jennie Garth) to avoid moving to Japan with her father; but she does not know half of the strange things that will happen from now on, and not only herself, but her sister, her friends Gary (Wesley Jonathan) and Tina (Alison Munn), friend Henry (Michael McMillian), Vince ), the friend of Valerie Jeff (Simon Rex), the first boss (then the fireman then the husband) Vic (Dan Cortese), annoying colleague Lauren (Leslie Grossman) t have a funny body in your body, please jump over that; if you only like a sophisticated comedy, it's not for you; if you like a funny, sometimes emotional show with two hot chicks that can play in the lead (and none other than the fabulous "Mary Cherry" from Popular - Leslie Grossman - in the main song), then what the hell are you waiting for? Welcome to Casa De Tyler! What I Like For You (2002-2006): 8.
