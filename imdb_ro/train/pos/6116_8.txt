This movie is like the marmite. Or you love him or you hate him. If you enter this movie by waiting for a movie that's right with decent production, a good plot, and great characters, you'll hate it. If you go into this movie waiting for a low budget slasher, you will probably hate it. If you come into this movie waiting to see one of the most disturbing characters ever filmed in the form of Harry Russo you will like it. John Giancaspro is absolutely brilliant about the top image of the crazy ivory, criminalized by the coke. The special effects are the best at best, but really who cares? If you are the kind of person ready to watch a Schizofreniac: The Whore Mangler, you have no doubt seen tens of horror movies. With the budget for which this film was made, even if it had tried, it would probably be mediocre at best. Rather, I could laugh at something terrible than not be mediocre. To summarize, you probably hate this movie, but if you are one of the few who decide to see it anyway, it will become the best thing from cut bread. 2 I hate my marmite.
