This miracle of a movie is one of those films that have a long-term, long-term effect on you. I read a review or two from angry people who think they are either republicans or elders of children, and their extremist remarks talk about the power of movies to face the people with their darkest secrets. No such piece of art has ever combined laughter and tears in me before, and this is the miracle of the film. Bret Carr's film realism and performance must not be missed. The very nature of it has almost interactive effect, it will cause people to leave the theater either freed or interrogating their identity. Bravo on the next level of cinema.
