I'm a fan of Crash and Blade Runner, and this movie explores some of these motorway deaths and 80-year-old themes that I like to see, so I liked it. Generally, however, the essential fool of the film's protagonist is not fetched well by female lead, and her hero is almost a neanderthal, so the kitch warning.
