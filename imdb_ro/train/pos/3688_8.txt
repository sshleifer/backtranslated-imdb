A delightful film directed by some of the best directors of today's industry. The film is also casting some of the great actors of our time, not only from France, but from all sides. <br /> <br /> My favorite segments: <br /> <br /> Arrondissement 14: Carol (Margo Martindale), from Denver, comes to Paris to learn French and also to make a feeling of her life. Montmartre: Perhaps there was no better way to start this film than with this segment on the romantic Paris. br /> <br /> Loin du 16ème: a picture of Paris that we are better aware of the riots in Cités. Ana (Catalina Sandino Moreno) spends more time caring for someone else's (she's a nanny) than hers. <br /> <br /> Quartier Latin: It's so fun to see Gérard Depardieu as a "bartender" with Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara discussing their divorce. <br /> <br /> Tour Eiffel: do not tell me that we do not like mimics! <br /> <br /> Tuileries: Such a treatment to see Steve Buscemi is the tourist who makes a tall contact with a girl in the subway. Park Monceau: Nick Nolte is great. Ludivine Sagnier, too. I spent 3 days in Paris in 2004 and this movie makes me want to go back! Viewed in Barcelona (another big city) at Verdi on March 18, 2007. 84/100 (***)
