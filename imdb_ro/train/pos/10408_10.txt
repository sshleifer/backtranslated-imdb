I saw the first movie when I was a kid and I fell in love immediately. The sets are breathtaking and some of the script are damn funny: "You are the sons of a thousand fleas." It's always on TV late at night or very early in the morning I woke up at 3:00 once and it just started. Television companies have to show a little more respect and put it on the first Sunday, so that everyone can have the chance to see this wonderful work. <br /> <br />
