I saw her a few years ago. I remembered very mysterious situations and a mixture of melancholy things, such as Dorothy's fate and Bogdanovich's personal future. I'm going back to looking at my VHS copy and then analyzing it more and more. Today I'm waiting for the DVD version at any price, please! The country and light listening music are very well chosen from the first second, a bit blue but also happy. /> <br /> All the characters are wonderful to me, with funny stories, great actors and a lot of dialogues that have transformed this movie into cult and many people I met on the Internet or in clubs cinema. This can not be an accident. I think the title is a hope for life! You have to be happy and laugh as much as possible <br /> <br /> I know this may be a special commentary for the film, but I really like it, I think the movie marked me and I will never forget it.
