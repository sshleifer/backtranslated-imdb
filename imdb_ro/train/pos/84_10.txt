I used this movie in a class of religion I was learning. The golden fish swim happily in his bowl in an apartment on the upper floor. A boy and his mother are away from home. The boy received money to buy milk. On his way home, he stops at the carnival to play a game. Next to him stands a man in a black suit that looks a little frightening. The boy is painting the milk bottle. It breaks. The man in the black suit gives him money to replace the milk. This scene alternates with what happens at home. A black cat rises and enters the apartment. He (?) Discovers the fish bowl and watches it. The fish swim vigorously and move away from the bowl. So far, a bunch of adolescents in my class and I fell in love with the fish. The cat takes fish in the mouth and we all hold back. The cat puts the fish in the bowl. The double story line includes the suspect black man and the suspect black cat. Both inspire prejudices. Both are innocent. It was a great discussion in my class.
