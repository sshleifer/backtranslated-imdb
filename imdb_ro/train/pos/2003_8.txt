The main problem with the first Vampire movie is that none of the characters were sympathetic. Carpenter learned by mistake, and this time he used a cute vampire and a charismatic vampire. The female vampire One is certainly the youngest vampire from Blade's Deacon Frost. Unfortunately, while there are some good concepts, such as a slow-motion restaurant scene (why did Carpenter not use more of this?), This movie is not as good as it would be could be. I expected to see powerful vampires in action and at least a sequence of battles (for example, within a city), which lasted for a better time, and was left somewhat disappointed. While "Los Muertos" is running faster than its predecessor, it still draws a bit in some parts (though not nearly as bad as the "Vampires"). Like "Vampires", however, the climax of this film is not very intense. Most of the above may sound like "Los Muertos" is a bad movie, but it certainly is not. Generally, it is enjoyable and is among the best entries to gender. There is no unrealistic remake of Dracula (like almost any other vampire movie there), nor is it an unintelligible action show like Blade II. It could simply have used a little more enthusiasm. I really would like to see a third installment made by Carpenter, but it probably will not happen. SPOILER WARNING the end was too predictable. One should have escaped - that would have made the film unusual.
