I first saw this in the early 1990s in the UK, I liked it then, but missed my chance to record it, many years have passed, but the movie has always stayed with me and I have lost hope to see the TV again that stayed with me was the end, the part of the castle really touched me, easy to watch, has a great story, great music, the list goes on and on, OK to tell me how well, but everyone will get there their own best bits with them once they see it, give the animation is top and nice to look, show the age in a very few parts, but which has now become part of it's beauty, I'm so glad it came out on DVD because it's one of my first top movies of all time. Buy it or rent it, just watch it, the best view is only at night with drinks and food at hand, so you do not have to stop the movie.
