Very well there: "Only an elite class (upper classes) would have both internet access and the ability to communicate on an exclusive English site such as IMDb." Some might think the Internet is not a reality, but this view really puts the media and democracy at stake: You're probably right. Even if there is an internet caf√© in Venezuela, most Chavez supporters will not be able to rent a computer for half an hour to comment on IMDb . <br /> <br /> Screw the rich upper-class fascist to the right of the capitalist liberal intellectual surprise .. This is probably the first time you use the Internet;) ..
