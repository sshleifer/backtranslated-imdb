I rented this movie on DVD without knowing what to expect - and when I study the film in Canada from all places, I will definitely bring it to the classroom. The story, centered around the film team, perhaps the most unlucky film in the history of the film itself, is brilliantly written, and the very talented actors manage to deliver each game on time. If you just could not laugh during "Northern Hollywood" I suggest you see a psychiatrist right away - you may have serious problems. In addition to the wonderful script, I noticed the great chemistry among Deborah actors Kara Unger and Matthew Modine - where does she really do? Jennifer Tilly (who plays a mischievous evil actress) and Martin Landau also played an extraordinary but fun performance. The big film, even better expressed.
