First of all, nobody can understand why this movie is rated so bad. Not only is this the first horrible movie for me, who are quite hot, with a long decade of horror experience, beginning with childhood through dark travels (ghost trains). Second, the main actress Cheri Christian has a face that allows you to hope that she will be the main actress in important images of the future. Thirdly, this woman is extraordinarily beautiful that I suggest directors to withdraw all those of Cameron Diazes, Eva Mendezes, and the names of these ephemeral bulbs. Ms. Christian is not a light but a sun. However, "dark remnants" are of considerable metaphysical importance. They believe that photographs show that the creatures of the intermediate reign of reality and "imagination" that are not visible to our own eyes are not new. But I have not seen in a movie before that these creatures are visible on the photos only for certain people and only until certain moments. This means that photography is not just an iconic image of reality (through which reality turns into a sign), but becomes an alternative form of reality that can change, as can the "real" reality. As a sign, changing the image means that it influences the photographed objects, meaning the sign acts as an object. Now, in our ordinary perception world, it is customary for objects to change signs. F.ex., If someone grows a bird, his picture will show him beard, not without, as he did before. Instead, changing objects by signs would mean that the bearded photo is the first and only then the beard increases the human. This is, very simply expressed, the case that happens with the photos made by the main character in prison in this movie. This is new and we must be grateful for everything new to horror films, which usually only repeats and rearranges the effects and features already known, especially from silent times.
