I saw this movie in the first few seconds T.R. she took me on the trip - I really liked the big fingers at first, but the absurd humor and the gossio look of both sissy actors - I do not know who played her young girl - but she was great and so it was hum! !! - <br /> <br /> The other two people who came out in the cinema after half an hour, I was with a friend - and it's always a test to watch a movie that I like good with one of my friends - and , we both enjoyed a lot - hilarious laugh - sadness about "realistic police - normos". so fans of T.Robbins ... I found it well done - I thought Robbins would approve, although I have no idea if he likes the movie or not ... I would love to see the cut things - I heard that the sand gus v. had to take a lot of scenes from viewers for the first time (or producers) and yet it is an artistic movie. too short, although ... it's one of my favorites all the time - and I'm aware that most people can not resist this type of movie and I guess the people who enjoy the movies are what they think .... ...what a shame. we hope the day will come when there will be a DVD of the complete material - hoping to see more of the crispian, keanu - waiting to see your child and everyone <br /> <br /> if you have the chance to see it, twice and enjoy yourself if you have chosen to follow ... m
