Mardi Gras: Made in China offers a wonderful and complex connection between folk culture, nudity and globalization by making and throwing beads. We saw this movie at the Boston International Film Festival and we were expecting a dry introduction of globalization, but what we got was a strange visual display of shocking films from China and the United States. The eye-opening film is humorous, in-depth, seriously, non-proffesional and lets you want more as the credit. It is worth comparing with Murderball - it's simply done well. Young Chinese workers have different views and the owner is amazingly open to discipline. Carnival revealers are the most important, but only because this excellent film provides a deep context inside the Chinese factory without a narrative. Bravo for the director because he came in and finished the movie! I would never have thought of the connection between the beads, China and New Orleans; now I'm thinking about the human bond between almost every object, but also about the role of globalization, inequality and fun. More importantly, I can make these connections without feeling guilty after watching this film, unlike other films about globalization that I have seen.
