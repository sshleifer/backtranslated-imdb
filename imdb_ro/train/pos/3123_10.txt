These are the top 10 of 10 that I've given a movie. What made this movie so good for me? Constant action - there are no lazy parts, great action, intelligent writing. I also liked the shooting style in which shock and different angles made you feel as if you were part of the scene. Finally, I get to see an action movie that does not try to please all sectors of the audience (meaning there is no love story). I liked the first two Bourne movies, but I liked this movie. Warning - after watching this movie, you will be full of adrenaline and you may want to calm down before driving your car!
