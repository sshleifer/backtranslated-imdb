To properly evaluate this movie, you have to think about the genre you should be representing: the child. They had several guidelines to follow to make this movie (which means they could not escape with some of humor and / or language from the first), taking everything in this movie was fun and pleasant to follow. Sequels usually makes me nervous, but this has done pretty well for herself. Knowing that they did not have Fraiser's star power as George capitalized on humor and I think Showeman did pretty well as lead. The movie is easy to watch and sometimes matches well for a younger audience, if you want to watch a movie and hope to award the academy prize, it's not, but if you want to watch a simple, fun, energetic movie make a good choice with that.
