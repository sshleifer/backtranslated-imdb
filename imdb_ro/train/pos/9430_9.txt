I am a member of a rowing club and I can tell you the truth that Deliverance is synonymous with the quiet and quiet of the experience. As we put our boats in the water, banjoes echo at the back of the conscious mind. This film is timeless, because it wishes the philosophy of man's place in nature and the effect of technology on man's relationship with nature. We see this in bow fishing. We see this in the tent in the house. There is also the contempt of the city's man and the feeling of superiority to the rural cracker. The fact that Atlantean banker (Ned Beatty) has "bad teeth" is meant to put him on the same level as shepherds who have bad teeth. Finally, the struggle of life and death replaces the superstitions of the "civilized man" on the "Law." This canoe trip ends too early for the spectator, but unfortunately not too much for the characters.
