I Loved The Real Mc Coys (1957-1963) It's too bad Lydia Reed decided to be forgotten and not to appear. It was excellent in the show. Of course Walter Brennan was great and Tony Martinez. I loved him when he called Amos Se√±or Grampa. I bought the season I on DVD and I can not wait to buy seasons 2-6. If there were more TV shows like this, it would be better. This show appeared briefly in the summer of 1999, but then disappeared. God bless all those who left the cast and please, Llydia Reed, to make yourself known again to the audience. You are loved and respected. Real Mc Coys will live forever.
