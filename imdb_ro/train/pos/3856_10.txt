"The Fourth Man, 1984" is considered one of the best European pico thrillers in the eighties. This latest work by Dutch director Paul Verhoeven in his native country, before moving to Hollywood to become a big star with movies like Total Recall, Basic Instinct, and Starship Troopers, is about a psychopathic and disillusioned author (Jeroen Krabbe) on the seaside for recovery. There he meets a mysterious fatal female (Renee Soultendieck) and begins a fatal love relationship with her. He becomes addicted to her heart and soul and finds that his three previous husbands have died with mysterious circumstances ... "De Vierde" is greatly influenced by Hollywood's old film and psychological thrillers by Alfred Hitchcock and Orson Wells. It takes a long time to create a dark and oppressive atmosphere and a few moments of extreme graphics violence have the right impact to push the story forward. Suspicion is sometimes almost unbearable, and sometimes it reminds of the works of Italian director Dario Argento. Also, Krabbe's performance as a mentally disturbed writer who opened the doors for his international film career, "The Daylight Living," "Fugitive," is particularly distinguished. If you have the chance to watch this brilliant psychotic thriller on TV, video or DVD, do not miss!
