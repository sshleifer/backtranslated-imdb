Hired the movie as a joke. My friends and I had so much fun laughing that we went and found a copy and bought it for me. Now, when all my friends are looking for a funny movie, they give Sasquatch hunters. We have to say that there is a rule that has been made that made the movie much better. It is not allowed to talk while the movie is activated, unless the words are Sasquatch repeated in a song. I also liked the credit at the end of the movie. "Thanks for Jeep, Tom!" Who is Tom, thank you for, without Jeep, the movie might not have been done. In short, a great movie if you're looking for something to laugh at. If you want a good movie, you can look for something else, but if you do not mind a laugh at the expense of a man in a monkey suit, take a copy of it.
