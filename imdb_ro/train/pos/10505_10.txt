Yes it is. I firmly believe that the N64 and the odd controller have been designed so that this game can be done. It was amazing the first time I saw him, with his huge environments and colorful characters, and amazing now. Game control is perfect, graphics are beautiful and have the Nintendo charm that is always so intangible, but no doubt there. A must have for any N64 owner, and a reason to get a N64 for anyone else.
