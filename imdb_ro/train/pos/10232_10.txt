After seeing most of Ringo Lam's films, I can say that this is the best film so far and the most unusual movie. It's an ancient Chinese art, full of martial arts, where the location of an underground ditch, full of traps and dungeons, plays an important role as any of the characters. The action is fantastic, the story is tense and fun, and the design is very memorable. Unfortunately, Burning Paradise was not available on DVD and vhs it's almost impossible to get your gear, even if you're near the second largest city in North America (like me). If you can find it, do not go over it.
