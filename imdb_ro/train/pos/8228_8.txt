it's hard to tell you more about this movie without spoiling it. I was glad because I did not expect to see what I was seeing, but to an ordinary sex drama, so ... It's a psycho-sexual thriller where nothing seems. He presents Emmanuelle Seigner, no stranger to the genre (and nudity) her husband Polanski had led her. And a terrible interpretation (I said Creepy / yes CREEPY) from Toreton (actor of Bernard Tavernier). It seems that a Pascal Bruckner meets Roman Polanski (better than Bitter Moon) as a stray Chabrol or a thriller Clouzot (I saw someone who mentions Les Diaboliques) but closer to Les Yeux sans Visage to Georges Franju the godfather Dr. Phibes and others). Jewelry! I'm afraid they'll do it in a remake of Hollywood, as they did with Nighwatch and The Vanishing.
