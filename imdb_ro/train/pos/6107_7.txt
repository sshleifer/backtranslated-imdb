After watching the movies ... I thought, "Why the hell was this movie such a big success in the Korean Box Office?" He really thought the movie had a smart / useless script, the act was not that good and the characters were not very interesting. For a Korean movie ... I liked battle scenes. If you want to watch a movie without thinking, this is the movie for you. But I have to admit ... the movie was kind of childish ... 6/10
