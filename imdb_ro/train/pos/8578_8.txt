This film is one of America's best B films in the 1990s. If you are looking for a serious movie, look elsewhere. However, if you are looking for action, a lot of laughs and a tongue in glans on gangsters fighting gangsters, this is worth watching. Everybody calls a little scenery, but that's really about the movie and everyone is pretty funny. Donald Sutherland and John Lithgow have a great chemistry and have to make another film together.
