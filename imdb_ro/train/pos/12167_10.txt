What happens when someone has so much social anxiety that they no longer work? How can the only man reach? When we have to make worldly crawling to be part of society to be too much, what is going on? Frownland explores these questions. Clearly a surprising original debut from Bronstein. The tone is odd and claustrophobic as we enter a guy named Keith who is so embarrassed that he can not make the right proposition. We follow him as he tries to connect with people and work day by day. Most of us have known people of this kind - people who say "too bad" or "appreciate" when there is nothing to appreciate. So we know there are people out there, but why would anyone want to make a movie about them? Well, because her interesting, Bronstein and main actor, Dore Mann, do a great job. This movie is as non-commercial as a movie can get. Several friends have filmed it for years, saving money. It was shot at 16 mm and the look of the scratched movie is a nice low budget. With no distributor, this can be a tough one to find, I think it was random screening for last year or so. We hope it will be on DVD at some point. I saw her at the Silent Film Theater in LA. There were 10 people in public, including Crispin Glover, if that tells you how strange this movie is. Highly recommended.
