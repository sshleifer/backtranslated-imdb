A nice game that offers a fun and easy to play game and a fair resume capacity. Staying true to comic and offering a low learning curve gives this game something that is not seen in most today's action cartridges. Also, the narrative and animation scenes used (though long-lasting animations are replaced by slide shows with the Nintendo 64 version), make full use of the platform's possibilities.
