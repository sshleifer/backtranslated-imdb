This is one of the best bond games I've ever played because: Missions are very fun to play they have a lot of action in them They can be very difficult sometimes that makes even more fun weapons on you are using them very well. The cars in this game are really good driving missions are fun to do. This James bond game has a good story. The voice on the actors in this game is very good and it's great that piercing brosnan is in this game and the way the characters look is very good because it looks like what looks in real life that is cool. Also, the graphics in this game are pretty good. General Score ********* of **********
