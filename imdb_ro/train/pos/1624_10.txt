The old pond is more of a tribute to African-American artists in the 1930s than any denigration of the entire race (despite Stepin Fetchit's cartoon). Besides the ones I just mentioned, there are also some variants of Cab Calloway, Fats Waller, Joesphine Baker, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson and Louis Armstrong. This Happy Harmonies cartoon from Hugh Harmon and Rudolf Ising is very musical fun with perfect characters around. Everyone sounds so much like a real thing that half of me thinks might be possible. If not, they are certainly very flattering impersonators. Even the lazy, emotional characterization Fetchit becomes an exciting workout here when he is being watched by a tiger as "Hold That Tiger" plays on the score. Highly recommended for animation fans in the 1930s and jazz music.
