I saw the movie with my friend and we could not laugh! I mean there was nothing scary about this movie! It was funny all the lines Freddy said he was hilarious! I think they did not even make a new nightmare and just went to Freddy Vs. jason. Although some parts were rough (as if the head was blowing). and any ulm street film from 1-5 sucks. this was the best beside number 1. I would not recommend this movie if you want a great horror. But if you have nothing else to do to rent this and you will laugh a lot. I want to see the Texas massacre chain, I think it would be scary. Freddy's Dead Final Nightmare Class: B-
