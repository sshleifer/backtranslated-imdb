Although it's not the best Anime I've ever seen, but I liked Lady Death. I never read the comic book and I just saw that at the video store and I decided to give her a chance. <br /> <br /> The animation was fine, I felt the anime of the 80's from her, which let go of me. Why everyone else hates me. <br /> <br /> Character development was good. I like how they brought the transition from Hope to Lady Death around. for you who do not like it, obviously do not pay attention. Lucifer tells you how she is, and she used his words. Creamtor was a good mentor / soldier for her. his dark style of imbecile was perfect for this type of movie. I think everyone who did this should look at it and reconsider it. cause everything people have bashed this can be said about every favorite anime Vampire Hunter D
