Bruce Almighty is Jim Carrey's best producer at The Truman Show and it was a nice surprise after some of the latest "Hey Hollywood - it shows how well I can act!" box-office disappointments. It's great to see Jim recognizing and embracing the strengths. He will not receive an Academy Award, but the film itself will last more than many of the Academy's "award-winning films". He is at the top of his form in this latest film - it's like the return of an old friend. Carrey, Freeman, and Aniston do everything together - comfortably in their comedy roles, a pleasant comedy and, of course, the fun together, but without the comedy "mother hey - look how amusing I am." A real surprise was Steven Carrell as Carrell of the Daily Show, who has gone with some of the best and funest scenes of the movie. I laughed harder at Carell than anybody else in the last three years. I can tell you that religious walnuts in the US will be in harmony with the treatment of God, but the bottom line of the film is true of all major theological beliefs - we are masses of protoplasms that try to pass through our short lives by exercising our free will. Without marrying children, this will probably become a target for people with mistaken priorities (who know the types - men dressed in gold watches on Sunday morning and late televisions, praying to God). And again, around 0.5% of the country will take care and 80% of the media will report it. Bottom line: This pure movie of entertainment, each member of the audience laughing wondering what he is doing, and a sense of common sense at the end of the movie. A walk on any major street in America must confirm that God has an amazing sense of humor. The best comic genius to remind us this than Jim Carry. Thanks again, Jim - it's good to come back!
