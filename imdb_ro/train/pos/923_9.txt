I've never seen it on TV, but I hired the DVD through Netflix as soon as I found out that it was available. I had big expectations and I was not disappointed. It's fun and the animation is great. The level of quality I would expect only from feature films, so I'm surprised by some of the bad comments I've made. Perhaps the DVD version has improved the animation? A DVD bonus is that it was fun to see both versions of the pilot. I'm an adult, and I really appreciate it for adults. Not only children who like the cute animated characters. It is never close to "raunchy," as some have argued, but I can see where some parents would not want their children to see it. I am very disappointed that it was canceled. I would like to produce more episodes. Or maybe a movie.
