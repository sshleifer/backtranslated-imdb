I enjoyed this growing show and I still look at the first year DVD at the age of 19. What can I say? I grew up in a house like the one in the Full House. I had a father, two sisters and a dog. I think the only difference was that I did not live with my uncle and my father's best friend. I also grew up with my mother in the house. I do not know what I'd do without a full house on TV. I think Stephanie (played by Jodie Sweetin), D.J. (played by Kirk Cameron's sister Candace), and Michelle (played by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen) are my favorite characters. I can refer to each of them because I am the baby in the midst of my family like Steph, I am a sister smaller than Michelle and am a sister older than D.J. I really like how the show always has moral values, because I do not like the performances like O.C. I like the house comedy. Uncle Jesse (John Stamos), Joey (Dave Coulier) and Danny (Bob Saget) are hilarious as the uncle of the girls, the father's father and father respectively. The story says that after the girl's mother dies, Danny's best friend, Joey and his brother-in-law, Jesse is moving to help them raise their children. Three men try to raise three young girls = hilarious. Every Full House character is full of heart, fun and truly credible. Joey is an aspiring comedian with the heart and soul of a child. Jesse is a motorcycle ride, a tough uncle who is soaked by his three granddaughters, and later, Becky's wife (Laurie Laughlin of Summerville). Both children and adults will enjoy this show. Guaranteed.
