After reading some pretty negative reviews for this movie, I was not sure if I should give some money to rent it. However, it was a pleasant surprise. I did not see the original movie, but if it's better than that, I'd be in the sky. Tom Cruise offers a strong performance like David seemingly unstable, convincing me that she is more than a smile on his feet (for the third time in his career - the other examples were Magnolia and born on July 4). Penelope Cruz is lightweight but meets the requirements for her role, like Diaz. The only disappointment is Kurt Russell. In the film, however, it is not the acting that really impresses - its film. Cameron Crowe excels in the role of the director, offering a welcome change of pace to his usual schtick. The increase in the madness of the movie is perfectly executed by Crowe (the short sequence in which Cruise goes through an empty time market is incredibly efficient). The soundtrack (a distinctive feature of a Crowe film) is also sublime. <br /> <br /> You will be shocked and challenged as spectators. The plan seems a bit controversial, but the problems explored behind it are endlessly questionable. The film is not perfect, but a welcome change of pace for Cruise and Crowe and those grown on a Hollywood glitter diet should be a revelation.
