Tigerland is one of the best movies I've ever seen and, in my opinion, even surpasses the full metal jacket, a movie of a similar nature. Bozz plays exceptionally well with Farrell and is a character that remains in your mind after the movie ends. The end is brilliantly cut by schumacher - with the melodic song of harmony and the slow troops preparing to leave. What movie.
