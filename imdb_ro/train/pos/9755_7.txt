The last time I saw the movie, I was around seven, so my opinions could be jaded over time. At that time I liked the filming that went through cartoons and live action. At that time I felt sad for the blue camel and sad life. I also felt joy when, after Captain Contagious kidnapped the heroine (a princess or toy shepherd), the tables they returned. Unfortunately, the producers have never decided to transfer this movie to the VHS, so all I have are memories of twenty years. I'm sure if I saw the movie again, I think it's corny and sappy, but I really liked the movie back then.
