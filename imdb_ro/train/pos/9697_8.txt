This is a truly unimaginable family film. She has absolutely brilliant animal training and "acting" (if you can say so) also (just think of the dog in "How Grinch stole Christmas" ... was simply bad training) . Paulie's story is extremely well done, well reproduced and, in general, the characters are even elaborate. <br /> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> My overall rating: 8/10 - BIG FAMILY MOVIE and VERY WATCHING!
