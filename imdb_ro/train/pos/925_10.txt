One word: suPURRRRb! I do not think I have seen this in a long time on cable or cable television networks. Watching this show was like taking a fresh breath in the midst of TV shows full of reality shows and boring re-rounds. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I had my reserves. After all, the critics were almost unanimous in the cry of error and in the decrease of the show. But when it was half an hour (by the way, thank you, NBC, for running a show without advertisements), I left with the feeling of instant love, love at first glance, the true love you feel in his courage . Everything about this show shouted EXCELLENCE. The graphics in this show were at least as good as finding Nemo and Shrek. No little girl, considering these films, lasted for years. <br /> <br /> The movie was great. I'm partly John Goodman's voice, but the rest of the team was certainly on par with John. Special mention: the appearance of Lisa Kudrow's guest. She was at the top of the game, creating a neurotic, pudgy and in love panda with a Jewish cloth in her. (The Panda in Brooklyn? Only in this show.) The script was funny, with lots of jokes inside and adult that were sharp but not sticky. Note for all parents: NOT for children. This show has never been announced as such, and there is a reason why it is set for 9pm, not 8pm. So if you want to complain about an "unacceptable context", save your breath. Adults deserve a comedy done just for them, and Father of Pride is. <br /> <br /> Not everything was perfect. I was a little embarrassed by the characters of Siegfried and Roy. Do I feel "stereotyped" when it comes to them? Yeah, I'm gay. Yes, they are flamboyant. Yeah, I'm talking with German accents. But that's the news yesterday. Give us something new, something fresh, funny. Putting old jokes into a new show is certainly a wrong approach. I understand that the creators of this show wanted to use the "star power" these guys have. That's good for me. But please do not focus on something that everyone already knows. We hope the rest of the show will not play the same old record. <br /> <br /> In general, the show is definitely a Must-See-TV. Funny, full of witchcraft, with some unexpected twists from here and there - there was not such a good comedy from Seinfeld. I certainly expect the next episode.
