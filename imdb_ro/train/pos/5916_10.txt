I watched this movie from Ralph Bakshi (Wizards, Hey Good Lookin ') last night on www.afrovideo.org, and I did not see anything racial (I'm not stupid), I admit that the character drawings are but I do not think is a satira and a very urban recipe of the old Uncle Remus' stories, which the American black culture created right in front of the main characters and the bold head for "The Baby Baby" and "The Briar Gun." These are not stories bigot, you think, but cultural icons created by black Americans, and I being a white woman reads and loves those stories. And I found it an interesting time-out of the capsules on black culture in Harlem, New York, in the 70's. Well, to get to the noisy movie: This movie is a live-action film / animation film starts playing live with a colleague named Sampson (Barry White) and Preacherman (Charles Gordone), hurrying to help their friend Randy (Philip Michael Thomas) escape from prison, wind in a shootout with the police. As he waits for them, Randy listens improperly to papy colleague Pappy (Scatman Crothers) as he begins to tell Randy the animated story of Brother Rabbit, a young man coming to the big city who rises quickly out of obscurity for to reign all over Harlem; you know, for me Rabbit, Bear and Fox are animal versions of Randy, Sampson and the Preacher. An abstract juxtaposition of stylized animation and live action movies, is the film a graphic and condescending satire of the prevailing stereotypes in the 1970s? racial, ethnic and otherwise. So anyway, it's another good Bakshi movie; and should we move movies like this under the carpet? pretend there is never? hmmm ... I think it would be a shame; I think we should watch these movies and learn about what's happening then, how far we have come since.
