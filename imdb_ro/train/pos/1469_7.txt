I admit I created great expectations before watching, because some friends have mentioned it (and are not perverse!), As we have to see. And we have to see! Just do not expect to see anything scary. Freudian psychoanalysis is interesting in many parts of the film, but there is too much perversion and it is not missing at last. Some good things are Kieslowski's blue analyzes, most of David Lynch, some of Hitchcock and maybe another one I lost (I just remembered .. Dogville) they are too obvious or lost in the air. Apart from being repetitive, which makes it too long, the documentary is pleasant in the sense of observing some perversions fed by our unconscious, hence the commercial success of most thrillers have studied and served as the basis for this theory. I really enjoyed the energy tone of the narrative and Zizek's effort to revive Freud's theory, which was too numb in North America. Again, it's a lot over the top and I think it's not a waste of time because I think most people have a dark appreciation of death and blood.
