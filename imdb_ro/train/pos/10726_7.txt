To my surprise I enjoyed the "Spacecamp" very much, I remember seeing it 13 years ago, and recently I hired it again. I was quite impressed. Obviously, special effects in modern space movies like Armageddon and Deep Impact are far superior to those in SpaceCamp. However, this film had a story - a very stereotypical story in the eighties, where you could almost read the next line of dialogue before hearing it. But that's what I liked - I do not make movies like this, so it was a refreshing change. It was interesting to see Kelly Preston, Leaf Phoenix and Lea Thomson in the early roles with Tom Skerrit and Kate Capshaw to add substance to the easy and fluffy plot. Absolutely loved the robot called Jinx, it was very cute but unfortunately had more emotion than some of the main characters. The film was almost inspirational in its own way, and it was interesting to note that he was filmed at the NASA Spacecamp in Alabama (I think).
