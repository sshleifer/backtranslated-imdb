This is a great movie in many ways. Everyone in my family enjoyed it. The animation is excellent and it easily demonstrates that there are a lot of producers who create movies that are as brilliant as everything that comes from Disney Studio. A difference from Disney's usual fare is that this Dreamworks movie does not show a cracked lateral crack shot for comedy relief. And there are no sudden moments in which the characters fall into songs. I'm sure a scene from the beginning of the movie would not appear in a Disney image: the birth of the spirit. But it is tastefully made and not at all offensive. "Spirit" was a great breath of fresh air. Do not get me wrong. I have loved Disney for years and I will continue to do it. <br /> <br /> "Spirit" is another example of a great animated fare. As soon as it is over, my children wanted to look at her again. I had the same feeling. I recommend it very well.
