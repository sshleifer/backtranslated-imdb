A follow-up of Angels with dirty faces in name only, Angels wash their faces somehow suffer from the usual shenanigans of Dead End Kids. In fact, with the presence of Dead End Kids and Ann Sheridan, this should have been treated as a real sequel to Angry Faces with dirty faces, at least for its continuity. Talking about Ann Sheridan, she is the only bright light of this film. To paraphrase a cliche, Ann Sheridan could read from a phone book for two hours and buy my DVD! Another virtue of this film is chemistry between Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan. Unfortunately, this aspect of the movie is kept too far in the background. For a better example of the Sheridan-Reagan duo I would recommend Juke Girl or Kings Row.
