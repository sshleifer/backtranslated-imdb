This movie is beautifully designed! There are no defects. Not in the set design, lighting, sounds, plot. Script is an invitation to a complex game in which participants are on a simple mission. Paxton is the best in this role. His manners, the infections used in the tones of his voice are without any evil. Every shot done meticulously! Surprises appear one after another when the movie touches the first hour. Perhaps this is not the best picture of the year, but it is a gem that has been very polished. It is not for the simple mind.
