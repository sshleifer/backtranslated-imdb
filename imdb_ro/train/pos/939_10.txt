Okay, there's a ton of comments here, what can I add? <br /> <br /> I will try anyway. <br /> <br /> The reason this is my favorite Scrooge is because of anyone. Sets, outdoor locations, costumes are so beautiful and authentic. Music is sweet. The support tower is very well done. One of my favorites is the narrator and nephew played by Roger Rees. His undervalued sincerity is touching and his voice is the sound of Christmas for me. David Warner is also a total creature Bob Cratchit. It is a difficult life, but it remains positive and dignified. <br /> <br /> The best part of the course is George C. Scott as Ebenezer Scrooge. Some said his portrait was too bad. I could not help but agree. His exchanges from the beginning, while cold or tough, were not beyond character. He is a terrible man of disillusion, a heart that has been hardened by the vicissitudes of life and his desire for wealth. <br /> <br /> During flashbacks, it is obvious that he is not gruff. Here we see that there is hope for him. If he had disappeared altogether, his partner, Marley, would never have come for his sake, first of all. And, after all, we're not one of us hoping. I think that's an important part of what Dickens is trying to say. When Scrooge looks at his dance at his employer with Belle, you see him with a regretful smile as he tells Belle in retrospect that he will go through life "with a smile on his face". Clive Donner was smart enough as a director to allow these moments on the film. Sometimes they leave on the pub floor. And finally, his conversion is so full of joy that makes me cry tears of joy every time I see it. His apology to his nephew, Fred, so sincerely, that he moves, is the spirit not only of Christmas, but of humanity itself. The joy he brings to Fred, his wife is so obvious. And the line that receives me every time: "Lord, forgive me for the time that I have wasted." <br /> <br /> Bravi tutti!
