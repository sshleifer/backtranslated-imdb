This movie contains personalities that play so delicious, I like the finale, when nobody knows what to do with their life, but it is very wonderful when you see and understand that the priest is right, it's for two, so who are the other people who do there? The film embraces a new life, an experience, a dream with the other person and reaches those dreams. It also shows you life itself, as it is. But it gives you the choice of choosing what you want and why you really need it. I hope this comment works for you. The movie I made worked out well for me. I bought my movie;) Take care.
