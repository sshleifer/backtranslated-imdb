SUNSHINE BOYS was the 1975 hilarious adaptation of Neil Simon's screen about a retired Vaudeville team played by Walter Matthau and George Burns, who had a very bitter dissolution and were asked to reunite for a special TV or something like that . The problem is that the two people still hate each other and do not want to have to deal with others. Richard Benjamin appears as the nephew of Matthau, a theater agent who has received the monumental responsibility of making this real meeting. This warm and winning comedy is a wonderful valentine of a forgotten form of entertainment ... vaudeville and works mainly because of a better screenplay by Neil Simon and a remarkable work by Matthau, Burns and Benjamin. Burns won the best Oscar-winning actor for this, but I think Matthau is leaving with this film with his impeccable performance like Willy Clark. Matthau was nominated for Best Actor but had no chance against Nicholson for "ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST"; however, in another year, it was an Oscar-winning performance. Matthau orders the screen and there is no false mark in this awesome performance. The scene in which you hear a potato chip ad and can not get the right product name is a classic. SUNSHINE BOYS is a warm and winning comedy by Neil Simon, which shines through the unbeatable chemistry between Matthau and Burns.
