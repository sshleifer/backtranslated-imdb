I can not believe how many people I hate Hal Sparks! He was my favorite host of the show, with my hands down. I hate the gossip of celebrities and generally do not like to talk, but when Hal Sparks hosts Talk Soup, I have to watch my TV. I rarely missed an episode during the round and I was saddened when the guest hosts began to pour (although most of the guests did a good job yet). <br /> <br /> Anyway, for all those who do not like Hal Sparks, I imagine they never saw the weekend specials. There were one hour episodes of Talk Soup that contained the best clips of the week and were deleted by comedy bits. The original bits that Hal Sparks made were hilarious. One was possessed by a bad comedian demon, and in an exorcist scene, his head turned, saying the dated jokes about the airline's food. An episode was dedicated to Multiplayer fun, as a bunch of cloned Hal Sparks continues to multiply through the episode, surpassing the studio. OK, maybe they do not sound as funny as I describe them, but all I know is that besides Talk Soup, the only other two shows we've watched constantly in those years was The Simpsons and Late Night with Conan O'Brian. So if you like the comedy style of these shows then you probably like Talk Soup in the Sparks years. That being said, Henson and Tyler were both big hosts. All three hosts brought something different at the table, but in my opinion they were very comic. Of course, during the years of Tyler and the clientele, my interest in this show has begun to decline, but from time to time I catch the Soup, the spiritual successor of the show and quite sure, the new host can bring some pretty unexpected laughter from time to time. Okay, we've lost enough time talking about a TV show that's out of the air and a channel that I generally despise. Go watch something else!
