The name says just about everything. I watched this movie with my dad when he went out and after serving in Korea he had a great admiration for the man. The disappointing thing about this film is that it focuses only on a short period of human life - quite interesting that the whole life of man would have made such an epic biography that it is amazing to imagine our cost for production. <br /> <br /> Some posters depart from the faulty features of man, which are cheap photos. The theme of "Duty, Honor, Country" is not just a simple word of a high-arm officer's lip - it is the profound statement of a man's total devotion to his country. <br /> <br /> Ironically, Peck is the liberal that he has gained a better understanding of man. He does a great job, showing the general fearless, tempered by man's humanity.
