I saw this at Dans with Films, and it was great. I really felt for Jake. Talk about adding insult to injury! Not only are your parents divorcing, but after you is a monster. <br /> <br /> She was so sincere and scary - there were some moments when the audience screamed in genuine fear. He reminded me of a Japanese horror film, except that the story was actually good. And that separated the "Jake's Jake" from the usual pabulum movie - an excellent screenplay with convincing characters. Also, by mixing elements in horror film with family drama, the film gets the best results from both genres and avoids the clich√©s of the two. If you do not get into the theater, define the DVD.
