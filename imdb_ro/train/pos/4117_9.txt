"DÃ´ desu ka den" is the first colorful film of Master Akura Kurosawa, and surprisingly not samurai, ronini, warriors or battlefields. It is inside a very poor community in a Tokyo brick, where the inhabitants are homeless drunkards, beggars, drunks, abused women, losers. I do not know why Kurosawa chose this tragic theme and the environment to put colors, but really there are very sad stories, some of them breaking the heart. I personally like the emotional story of the boy and his father dreaming of their own house and built by them; the story of the retarded boy who thinks he is flying a train; the story of the man who raises five children as if they were their own sons and daughters; and the story of the young man abused by her stepfather. My vote is new. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Dodecaden? o Caminho da Vida" ("Dodeskaden? Calea vietii")
