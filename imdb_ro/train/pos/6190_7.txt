Fay Grim is the continuation of a story that began ten years earlier with Henry Fool of Hartley. I have not seen the previous movie and I do not know whether it's a good thing or not. I can only watch the current movie on its own merits. For most people, Hal Hartley's style of shooting is something you like or not. His combination of action, drama, absurdity and ironic, dry humor resonates with me, and Fay Grim is no exception. She has an air of intelligent, suddenly written parody, which I and many have had at the audience of the Melbourne International Film Festival laughing loudly. For the first half of the film it was unceasingly delivered and blurred. It's a sadness of humor in cinemas and a welcome relief for Hollywood's teenage comedies that pump them like pancakes. During the second half of the movie, humor begins to sink as morphs in an international espionage / conspiracy thriller. Whether it was Hartley's intention or out of ideas, it's not clear, but I think a bit of editing or re-writing to cut fifteen minutes of film would have maintained the original impulse of the film. <br /> <br /> Performance was generally good, especially Parker Posey and Jeff Goldblum, who had the most time on the screen. Saffron Burrows, James Urbaniak, Carl Montgomery and Elina LÃ¶wensohn have all played supporting roles. The videos were enjoyable (set in New York, Paris, Berlin and Istanbul) and music (also by Hartley) was good without being intrusive. The movie is well written and I really enjoyed it. If you like Hartley's previous work, you probably will like that.
