This is a comedy of morality, so sometimes there is a gentle touch of bitterness, but a lightness softens all sarcasm and irony until it suddenly stops the heart and changes everything. , wonderfully written and taught, is a jewel that shines perfectly, with a beautiful action of all. Jean-Louis Trintignant is refined as usual, and Romy Schneider is a pearl, perfect and brilliant, not to be missed. A great movie!
