I like this movie / short work. Jason Steele is amazing! My favorite songs are the French Song and in the opening title when the spatula soldier yells "SPOONS!" It bothers me every time. I would recommend this film to fans of Knox Klaymation and those who enjoy the other films of Jason Steele. His animation style is very original. It takes a few views to see the detailed environments. His humor is also hilarious, and it's certainly not something you've heard before. Like Max deformed Spatula, which has a sound and light system in its head that illuminates colorful lights and happy music whenever it talks about its miserable life. This is a wonderful animation to watch anytime.
