This movie may have a questionable pedigree because it was made for television, but it's one of the best movies I've ever seen. The film and its actors have won several awards. It is tight, fascinating and will absorb you completely. The story of a pursuit for an iron curtain in Russia by people who are willing to risk their career to try to save the lives of future victims would be a compelling story if it were fiction - but it is a true story. I strongly recommend it.
