Wes Craven has created the most successful crime-thriller movies of all time. After seeing his movies, you will find your new fears. People do not know, Wes Craven's thriller is the best, because I'm totally different. In this film, Lisa is terrorized by a traveler. He forces her to kill, and if she does not, Jack will kill her dad. Lisa is in immense misery, because whatever she chooses, she will kill her. The action was unreal. Rachel McAdams and Cillian Murphy have done something unbelievable. Emotions have been chosen correctly. The idea and script of this movie is too great ... Sometimes it reminds a "Scream", but certainly better than both "Screams". what can I say - this is the best crime-thriller movie in the 21st century ...
