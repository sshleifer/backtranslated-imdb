the only season was broadcast here in Australia and I thought it was absolutely brilliant! I like! all the story lines are so good! and a more realistic vision of adolescent and family life today. however, still retains strong family values ​​to stick together and to be there for each other. their problems were real, and really caught you in the show. the show mainly refers to this family called "Days" and their lives. the family consisted of Abby's Day, Jack Day, Natalie Day, Cooper Day, and Nathan Day. each episode a day out of their lives, with the coopers perspective on things alongside them. I liked the cooperation because the show was great. he was by far my favorite character. ended with so many things that I could have continued, I'm really sad that it was not another season. it was a great show I will miss.
