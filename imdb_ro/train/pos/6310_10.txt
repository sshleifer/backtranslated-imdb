Having the opportunity to watch some movies in the Slavic-Broadway village area, I could not wait to see the final copy. Watching this movie at the Cleveland Premier on Friday, I did not laugh loudly at a comedy for a long time! It's a horror. The Russo brothers did a good job. The whole cast performs the best comedy ... No slow or dry segments ... George Clooney is one of my favorite actors and he's great as the sure destroyer in this movie. I was most impressed by William H. Macy as a crook "Riley" and Michael Jeter as "Toto" keeps you in "stitches". I think they have the most funny roles in the whole movie.
