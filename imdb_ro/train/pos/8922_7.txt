The only notable thing about this film is that it was Steve McQueen's first leading role. <br /> <br /> McQueen's talent is undeveloped and gross, but honestly, in this dreadful piece of science fiction. Steve looks like the anti-set, hot car actor who loves the actor who would become a polished icon of the film industry just five years back then. Later, McQueen would say he hates this movie and "he was a blob." But everyone has to start somewhere and The Blob is cute, fresh and innocent. It would be that we all stayed like this. Complot is a fast rhythm and, although predictable, it's another fun hour. And it's really fun to see Steve McQueen before he became Kool's King (and Anita Corsaut before he became Andy Taylor's girlfriend). A close friend sent me the DVD back and is a precious addition to my movie collection Steve McQueen.
