Watch Neo and Bourne and all those half-baked made modern heroes. They just look at the age of 12 to thank the wide audience of geeks who want to be their heroes. Because they can not be Rambo or McClane or even Indiana Jones, Hollywood has allowed a bunch of forgeries that do not have a beard and yet meet adolescents wanting to see something that looks very much like an action action. "Action sets" are just painful to look at and any girl can challenge their masculinity without a doubt. This explains the recrudescence of the old on our silver screens in recent years. For better (Rocky, Rambo) or worse (Die Hard 4 - if John McClane, your arms ... did not have a beard!) I say it's a tall time a new hero has climbed and ended the reign their. This "Largo Winch" is far from perfect and perhaps too predictable at times, but at least Tomer Sisley gave a very promising performance as a hero of action. And the only time he was weakened is when MÃ©lanie Thierry shaved his beard! I'm resting my case. I did not know when I entered the theater, but that could be the movie I've been waiting for a decade. For the first time in France, Belmondo, the film can be both artistic and rooted in the B genre, without blocking its performance. Meanwhile, all we had to chew was either a bunch of garbage or something too narrow to reach a wider audience ... In other words, it was "Le Pacte des Loups" or "Dobermann" (I like Dobermann, ) ... I think "Largo Winch" has what it takes to be popular and quality film. I left the theater very satisfied and I was hungry for more.
