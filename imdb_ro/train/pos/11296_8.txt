I had a personal interest in this movie. When I was 17 and I left high school, I got a job at 20th Century Fox as a member of Union Laborers and Hod Carriers. At the end of my first day (sweeping the deck of an aircraft carrier) I was told to bring a suitcase the next morning with enough clothes, etc. for a week or two. When we arrived the next morning, a bus was waiting and about 20 of us were heading south to San Diego. We just stopped there at an army base called either Camp Callan or Camp Hahn. Once we were buried, we headed north, a few miles away, into Camp Pendleton, the large marine base. There, on the beach, we started building what was supposed to be an island island base in the Pacific. It took us about a week or ten days to complete the installation, which included a water tank, gaskets, sandbags, and dwelling quarters. All this was at a very high salary, sometimes "golden time", which was triple our regular hourly salary. Our food was also the first rate = prime rib at lunchtime, etc. - which was amazing because it was time of the war and very hard to get good meat at home. Once the job was over I was looking forward to the movie, which was about eight or ten months later. Then I eagerly await two hours of the movie before my tracks get on the screen. Then, no more than three or four minutes (maybe less) of the movie heroes were bombarded on the base and thrown in the snow. A bit disappointing, but still fun. <br /> <br /> Despite disappointment, I liked the movie and I have not seen it since. I later learned that this film was subscribed by the government, and Fox was paid on the basis of the extra cost, which can explain our extravagant salary and lifestyle there. Bob Weverka
