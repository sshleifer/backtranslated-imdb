I'm an admirer of Hal Hartley's films, especially "Henry Fool" since 1997. "Fay Grim" is a continuation of that film and has a similar style and feel. However, the plot is completely different. Fay Grim (played brilliantly by iconic Parker Posey) tries to discover his missing husbands and finds himself in the middle of conspiracy and espionage. The support gallery (most of the first film, such as Jeff Goldblum, Saffron Burrows and a much-welcomed return from the 90's indie dear Elina Lowensohn) is great and the movie has a lot of surprises. The director claims that this is part of a "Star Wars" trilogy serving as "Empire Strikes Back" in the series. If this is true, I can not wait to see the third installment! I hope I do not have to wait another 10 years for that.
