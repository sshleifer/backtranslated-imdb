The short film that begins this movie is the true movie of a guy named Gary, apparently taken at random in the parking lot of a television station where Gary works in Beaver City. Gary is a bit "different"; he is an impersonator and leads an old Chevy called Farrah (after Fawcett). Here's the director receiving a letter from Gary later on, inviting him to come back to Beaver to get a record of the local talent contest he gathered, including Gary's stunning performance like Olivia Newton Dawn. Oh my. The two shorts that follow are Gary's story, the same you just witnessed on the first, is presented by Sean Penn, and the second one by Crispin Glover titled "The Orc Child." If you are in the mood to make fun of someone this is definitely the movie to watch. I was doubled by laughter through the majority, especially Crispins' performance, which could certainly be on their own. When it was over, I had to come back to see once again the real Gary and all his shiny idiots. Although Olivia was in the spotlight, I would have liked to see one of the "fictitious" pants throw a blow to Gary's dress, Barry Manilow, who was just ridiculous.
