There are many problems with Mystery Men. First of all, there are too many different characters for everyone to be given complex or even interesting personalities. The special effects destroy the story and are not really unusual. Paul Reubens is scattered in a pathetic, juvenile role as a character who just kneads and speaks in an inappropriate accent. Now on the decent parts. William H Macy, three celestial words, and his performance as a blow is perfect. Sphinx is an amazingly funny character that is just mysterious and just reflects the mystical traditional proverbs. Ben Stiller is also very funny, showing a poor character trying to do it in the big leagues of superheroes. All the characters do, and this is an area that we found particularly ironic. That's because all the actors are actors of the Indian movie that is trying to make it in the big leagues in Hollywood. To be honest, the reason I thought I did not get to the box office is that America is not totally ironic. Generally, I liked the movie, but I feel it would work better if more effort was made to change the scenario, rather than having unnecessary scenery and effects on CGI.
