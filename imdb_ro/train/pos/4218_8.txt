I have not seen too many Columbo movies ... in fact, I think I only saw one or two, besides this. I have always liked Columbo, though, without having seen too much of it. Peter Falk is and has always been the perfect choice for the character due to his appearance, voice and charm. The perfect proof of this is that although the series began in 1968, the most recent (and probably not the last) of the films was made in 2003. This is 35 years old. And Falk was back when he did the first. The series consists of 68 movies (unless my counter is off), all made for television. Everyone knows the character, although nobody has ever seen a movie to feature in the cinema. This is a pretty big achievement if you ask me. The plot is pretty good. The only problem I have with this is that the killer and killing is revealed from the very beginning (though the same could be all Columbo movies) without leaving a mystery, but as Columbo solves it, making it somewhat boring, not too much to wait for the end of the movie). Pacing is good, hard on a scene where you're bored. The actor is very good, especially Falk and Ruth Gordon. They have a great exchange of dialogue in the film. Characters are well written and credible. Dialogue and script are unusually good for a TV movie. Generally, the movie is, yes, surprisingly good for a TV movie and is definitely worth watching by any Columbo fan and / or murder / mystery films. 8/10
