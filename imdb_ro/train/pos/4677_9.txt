I understand this movie as a debut feature and, as such, is very impressive. He has the sense and rhythm of a "true indie", but director Todd Yellin clearly has the photographic and editorial vision, command and judgment of a mature and driven professional. Photos are well framed and thought and serve to move the story forward. He and screenwriter Ivan Solomon give a story that has much more depth and more lyricism than typical "paint by number" scenarios. It's a story that needs the talent of caliber character Judd Hirsch to have a chance to work. Judd is fantastic as usual; just like Scott Cohen and beautiful Susan Floyd. The real surprise is Elliot Korte, who plays Adam Groden. Yellin managed to convince the young actor's shade in a role that could easily be devalued by stereotyping or overloading. Anyway, I found the refreshing and fun movie.
