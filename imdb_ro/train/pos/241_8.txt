I'm tired of people judging movies on their "historical precision." It's a movie people! Writers and directors should put their own rotation in the story! There are a number of movies that are not entirely accurate with the history of ... Braveheart, Wyatt Earp, Gangs of New York, Geronimo: An American legend, The Last Mohicans ... all the fantastic movies that are slightly inaccurate from the historical point of view. If you want to see some big actors doing what they do best, then I suggest you see this movie and do not worry about the accuracy of the facts. Enjoy the quality of the film, the story and one of the greatest actors of our time.
