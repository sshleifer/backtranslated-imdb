In West Hollywood, those hands of a trail were a tough pile, which, when they came to the city, were pretty tough. After all the trips on the road, it was a lonely business one day before the railways reached all parts of the US. <br /> <br /> Those who worked for Gil Favor driver, like Eric Fleming, were no different. But Fleming was a businessman, had a job and hired a top crew to do it. <br /> <br /> In the long run of Rawhide and the fact that ordinary people have stayed with him for the most part, we have come to know all the drovers at one time. Some story lines were focused around everyone, although most of them were with Fleming and Clint Eastwood, Rowdy Yates, number two with the flock. Western image of Clint Eastwood was modeled by Rawhide, it is a shame that they are not displayed more often. Probably because they were made in black and white. If it had been an NBC show, it would have been made in colors like Bonanza and would have been broadcast as often as those shows. We get to see a lot more about a man who has become a legend of movement. Ironically, Eric Fleming left the show before he closes to make movies. He did some of them and hoped the show would give him a nameable banknote. Unfortunately, he was killed in a movie location, making a film of action, drowned in a river. If he lived he would have become a name like Eastwood. Clint took the role of the track manager in the last season and then the show ended. And, of course, it has become the icon it does today, and not just in the Western genre. Rawhide was a powerful western who had some hard boys in him. In this case, no work cowboys only did a job and struggle with the elements and situations in which they were thrown each year. They do not even make any TV series like this. What a shame.
