The brilliant Elizabeth Taylor plays in this classic less known as a young girl in London who falls in love with a British ceylon tea owner (today's Sri Lankei). Upon arrival, she instantly feels out of place and is forced to adapt to the new culture as well as to become aware of the constant elephant herd furious. William Dieterle, who also directed Emile Zola's Life and Jennie's Portrait, makes a glamorous work to bring somewhat dark and almost dizzying, subtle to this story, and setting is one of the finest I've ever seen with black and a white-themed mansion and superb island scenery.
