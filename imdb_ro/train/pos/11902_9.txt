This film chronicles the life and times of William Castle. He made a series of horror movies in the 1950s and 1960s he sold with tricks. In "13 Ghosts" you need viewers to see the ghosts (they were in color, the movie was in black & white). "The Tingler" had theater chairs equipped with a buzzer that offended the audience when a monster escaped in a cinema. "Marabre" issued a life insurance policy to all members, where they were scared to death! The movies themselves were pretty bad, but the tricks made people rush to see them. In this document there are interviews with directors inspired by Castel, actors in his films and his daughter. He also enters his home life and the type of man he was (in all cases he was a great guy). The documentary is affectionate, very funny and absolutely riveted. It is very short (under 90 minutes) and there is never a tedious moment. You have to see for the fans of the Castle and the horror movie fans. My only complaint - there were very few sequences displayed in her photos. Besides, it's great.
