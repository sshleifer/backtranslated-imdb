Simon Pegg plays a brutal and often scandalous celebrity journalist who is brought from England to work for a great American magazine. Of course, his winning paths create all sorts of complications. Funny comedy based on facts, working with Kristen Dunst (who looks pretty grown up), Danny Huston and Jeff Bridges. It works first because we like Simon Pegg, despite his bad behavior. We fully understand why Kristen Dunst continues to talk to him, despite his frequent speculation. I liked the movie. Do not be all and end it all, but it was a nice way to get an evening to sit on the couch watching movies. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
