National Lampoon's Class Reunion is a classic comedy movie from the early 1980s that combines unique characters, many laughs and music from Chuck Berry. When Walter Bailor is absolutely humiliated by his colleagues at high school, he uses the opportunity to take revenge at the class meeting. One by one, he pursues classmates, including an innocent blind girl, a terrible fat guy, the beauty of high school, the king of all the props, and even the ugly lady who served all the kids during high school. This movie has a kind of scary element in it and has some short scenes of sexuality, so I would not recommend this to young children, but it's a wonderful movie for adolescents. If you are looking for a movie with a beautiful score, complex characters or special effects of the killer, you may not like the class meeting. If you want to sit for 90 minutes and have some big laughs and a lot of fun (and who does not) then this movie should be on your movies to see the list. ++
