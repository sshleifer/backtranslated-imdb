Wow! I've seen so many low-budget bad movies lately, but that's great. The very realistic representation of police life in a city on the East German coast is a strong contrast to other movies or series of crimes. I liked the main actress and the absolute rejection of any police clich√©. This movie is realistic as a documentary and fun as a drama at the same time. A perfect compromise!
