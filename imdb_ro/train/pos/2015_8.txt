It may not be one of the best movies ever made, but it is generally a very pleasant and easy piece of foam in which everyone involved seems to feel good. Highly recommended for a common sense. So Frank Sinatra's "actor" leaves much to be desired, but his singing is an extraordinary feature and the pieces fit perfectly with the romantic atmosphere of the film. Sinatra continued to make several films in which he undoubtedly shone his ability to act, but in this first Hollywood adventure, his voice, not his actor, is his main contribution to this film. I just saw her again on television and still raise my mood as much as the first time I saw her many years ago.
