If you are purist, do not waste your time - otherwise, keep your hat and enjoy adventure. I liked the version of Stewart Granger / Deborah Kerr - I've seen it a dozen times, but the movie is just as good, otherwise different. I will not detail the differences because it would spoil the film. It's also a pleasure to see Alison Doody again (I'm a huge fan of Indiana Jones), Patrick Swayze is good as Quatermain, and the support is great. I find the quality of sustained distribution of one of the hallmarks of a Hallmark production and this film was no exception. The cinema is splendid and the score is perfect. If you are looking for entertainment, you will not be disappointed.
