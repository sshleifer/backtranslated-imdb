A compelling, honest, bold and unforgettable psychological horror film that touches the painful experiences of rape pain - "Downing" is a film that has become under radar due to lack of distribution because, frankly, the movie is so brutal in his images, that, if it had been released theatrically, he might have met with strong bias. The film deserves to be discovered, not just for its dark themes, and not only for its stunning direction and authentic style - but especially for its performance. Chad Faust is absolutely amazing, bringing enough illness and enough vulnerability to make one without referring to, but to understand this fractured man with a twisted perspective on his sexuality, not just with the women he violated but and fragile insecurities deep within her own self. It is a show of support that is so complex, brave and emotional on Faust's part. And hard to forget. However, standout is Rosario Dawson, whose performance here is an absolute revelation. A real-time dramatic tics tournament and one of the most subtle but hard-how-can-be shows for some time. While Dawson is seen in some good supporting performance in some great-to-evil movies, she proves here that she has what it takes to deliver some emotional sweeping and moving, credible and themed performances. the best films of the year (and 2007 was a strong one) - if this underrated and intelligent movie hit the show, I would have called out praise for him as well as Dawson and Faust. Too bad it was too hard for a widespread appeal. Movies of this kind are worth it!
