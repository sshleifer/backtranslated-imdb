I like this show as an action adventure, love and intrigue. Well, sometimes I love you! It's so good to see a show where all the characters work together together and treat each other with respect. It's also very good to take Dick Van Dyke into a television role, as I just saw in Mary Poppins. the mix of the main characters, Mark, Amanda, Jesse and Steve is very exciting for the audience. This is a show you have to watch!
