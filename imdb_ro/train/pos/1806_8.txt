I want children's films to be made in this way; dark and deep. Character development (and Charlie is the symbol of the dynamic character), parcel development, superb animation, emotional involvement and a rational, relational and consistent theme. If not for a handful of song and dance routines, you would never have thought that this is a movie for children and that's why I give it such a high rating. This movie is an excellent movie, not to mention a movie for children. Which brings me to my second point: this must be the darkest "children" movie I have seen for some time, this coming from a 22-year-old. I would be shocked to see a child under the age of 8 who was not completely frightened along a large part of the second half and the first half of the film and ends up with one of the saddest endings which you could ever meet ("Jurassic Bark," for those of you who are "Futurama" fans), and this makes this movie so good. Just because the movie evokes the emotions we usually do not like to feel and suppose they are bad, does not make the bad movie; in fact, it means he did. Fun movies should make us laugh; good horror films should make us frightened; good sad movies have to make us sad. My idea is that good movies should move you, not just have fun; this movie moved me. Also, this movie is incredibly violent by today's standards for a children's film and contains topics that, according to today's standards, may not be suitable for some children. Parents, I'd say you look at her first. Usually, there is nothing to say about such things, but I just saw this yesterday and it was a surprise to me even.
