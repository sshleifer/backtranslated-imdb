He loves the TV show. He was first engaged when I saw him. I'd like to be there with them. It touches reality when you love someone and you think you want to spend the rest of your life, then a change of events that you meet with someone else and that person is more with whom you want to be with. You are in a situation if you have to choose one or the other. Someone will be hurt, there is no stop. Making the decision is difficult, but you want to continue to be dissatisfied when you could have been. Why continue and live a life that you thought you wanted or thought you were doing good and that you were both unhappy. This other person will not wait a life of waiting, they have a good life. Making the decision you really want will be better in the end. Doing good from what you have is a good thing a good thing. Money, cars, homes, etc .... do not make you happy, having only one person you really want to be with to share it with no.
