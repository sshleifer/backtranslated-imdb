"Bruce Almighty" looks and sounds incredibly stupid, especially from the trailer. However, I found in him a deeper message that made me more like this movie. Bruce (Jim Carrey) is angry with God and is given divine powers to be God for a week to see if he can do a better job. Morgan Freeman plays a man symbolized here as God, and although he is not the regular type of film or one of the best roles, he does excellent with what is given to him. Although brutal at times, the film has a lot of laughs, from Bruce splitting the soup by half as the Red Sea and the customers' reactions to him, as well as Freeman's seemingly naked and frightening image of God. It is sometimes too exaggerated and there is some raw humor, but overall it manages to be somewhat funny. There is a decent distribution, like Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Ann Walter and Steve Carrell, who always helps. The end of the film proves to be very romantic and tearful, and the message is clear that we have to do what God has called us to do and be the "miracle." The film is far from perfect but still enjoyable and much better than me and many people would probably have expected, especially if we see the film's deepest message. *** din ** **
