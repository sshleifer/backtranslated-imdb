I absolutely love this game to death. Since I was 9 years old (now I'm 15). It has graphics, characters, magic, weapons, additions, and we do not forget the wonderful dragoon formulas! I'm still waiting for a remake, a prequel or a sequel to this spectacular video game. <br /> <br /> Play as Dart, a young swordsman who has the potential to be quite a hero. In this adventure you meet wonderful creatures and boss fights. You also meet some friends on the road that have their own special item. Such as Fire, Darkness, Water / Ice, Thunder / Lightning, Earth, Light and Wind. There are also elements known as dragons, allowing you to turn into magical creatures of the legend. Dragons, wizards, creatures called winglies and evil creatures have to face this adventure of excitement and excitement. One of my favorite games, Legend of the Dragon!
