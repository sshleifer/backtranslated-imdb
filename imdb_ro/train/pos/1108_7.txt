Some of the acknowledged Altman's "masterpieces" seem to me more sad now. Maybe I am. Like the last reviewer, I even like this "smaller" Altman (recently presented at FMC), though I do not think he targets a broad audience. Organization policy as a "microcosm" for public campaigns. Some of these satirical "docudrama" are now given, like Dick Cavett watching Show Tonight, but we found much of the fun and wisdom dialogue (for example, "You're real, that's no threat to anyone.") The story is not "deep," but I liked it. And performances are funny, especially Cavett (as "himself"), Lauren Bacall, as an aging conservative figure, Glenda Jackson (who became a member of Parliament) as a left wing ideologue (in the opening scene reading someone dressed as a carrot on the holiness of politics) and Carol Burnett as a basket case. All in the inimitable Altman style, though perhaps not as inimitable as usual. But quite inimitable.
