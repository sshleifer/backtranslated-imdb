It was hard for me to believe all the negative comments about this movie of all the stars. I laughed through the whole picture, like my whole family. The movie was clearly defined as an old gangster comedy of time - the players were hysterical - I bet they had a good time while doing it. Of course Goldblum and Dreyfuss were wonderful - and about the Everly sisters, each of the two Falco, and the divine music all along. Rob Reiner made a limo driver, laughing Gabriel Byrne, a laughing madman. Not to mention Gregory Hines, Burt Reynolds, Sleepy Joe, and the mortuary, and the serious digger's references. Paul Anka was himself the usual entertainer with the added attraction of running scared after Byrne decided to make a duet from "My Way" welcome home to Vick's performance. I am of the opinion that this film was a tribute to Frank Sinatra and his friends; Dreyfuss imitated him well. I also think that nobody, of any age, would even think of mimicking the actions that took place in this movie - it's a joke - not a terrible "gangsta" movie. The cars and the clothing were impressive, just like the decorative "Vic's Place". Indeed, I think of "Time Dog Mad" as a musical comedy, less harmful than many cartoons, and talk shows. I would recommend the video for a family entertainment evening.
