While I do not consider myself a great fan of fairytale films, Stardust intrigued me on the fact that I saw Michelle Pfeiffer in trailers as a bastard (especially since I was about to see her as the boss Velma Von Tussle in Hairspray). Oh, boy, she's so convincingly evil here like a witch, especially with her elderly-ugly make-up at the beginning and end! Robert De Niro is also awesome as the pirate captain who is forced to hide "in the closet" to defend his "reputation"! Only actors such as Claire Danes, Rupert Everett, Ricky Gervais, Peter O'Toole and many others are working well here. While Danes and Pfeiffer are classical beauties, there are stunning facets of Sienna Miller, Olivia Grant (in the role of Girl Bernard) and Kate Magowan, especially when we meet her. New arrivals, Charlie Cox, are good as leader Tristan and he showed as much as his father Dunstan as a young man I thought he was in early scenes with Magowan (actually Ben Barnes) . Many comments compared this to The Princess Bride and while I see some similarities, the main difference was that with PB, you always knew it was just an imaginary story, as an old man's grandmother tells her. Stardust makes you think, for the most part, that what you see and hear could have happened, even with all the hilarity that is going on all the way. So on this note, I recommended Stardust.
