The movie starts with a bunch of dead people in individual cells waiting for the inevitable death-electric meeting. Then our "hero", called Tenshu, is taken to the chair, he's zapped, and then ... he's still alive. AHA! He is given a choice by some creepy military guys who look very good: either we stop until we assure you that you are actually dead, or you can walk through this door and take any destiny that might be ahead of you . "he says he gives it to option 2, and then the real story begins. He wakes up in another cell (very high technology and very high), where he finds another bunker who also managed to survive the electric battle, voice in the speakers tells them they are free to do what they want as long as it happens in that room. "What these two people do not know is that they were staying together so they could awaken an inner desire to kill In fact, the unknown scientists in the background are set aside until they decide to kill each other, it sounds strange, indeed, but there is a greater purpose for all of them. It must not be revealed and it will But do not be afraid, it's the unknown that it attracts the viewer to look more at this pseudo-action film, because it has a completely different approach to the question: how long can you stand with a b rbat is SOB and you kill to get freedom? First fund hour trying to spark your interest, strain without knowing the fact. Then it becomes a roller coaster ride with the WILD Matrix battle scenes with a touch of individuality to honor the comic book on which the film is based. The film is really very special, so especially normal cinemas will not see it under normal conditions. However, the story is fascinating, the music is fantastic, and the actors make their bits (more than others) to make the movie truly unique. If you should be so lucky that the cinema or video store has, look, and enjoy the fact that not everyone is trying to make mass movies to win huge bucks of money. <br /> <br />
