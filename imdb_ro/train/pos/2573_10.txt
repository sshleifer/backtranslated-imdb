When my 14-year-old daughter and her friends meet for the film night, there's a movie they insist on looking at him again and again: You guessed it, K-911, the third tranche of the franchise K-9 favorite television star, Jim Belushi. People, I knew it was possible to use a VHS tape, but a DVD? This has been played so often that you start jumping; no joke! But, of course, you will have it when you have such a charming, so brilliant film. Of course, we need to thank Tom Hanks and the only one for introducing us to the genre loved by Cop-Dog with Turner and Hooch; however, even that film is not measured to the absolute excellence shown in all three K-9 films. Some say Belushi has fled with this third movie in the series. Poppycock, I say. While you may suspect that a third installment - direct-to-video, at that - may not seem something worth watching, you would be wrong after watching this quality movie. but I will say that Belushi and his passionate partner give the best performance yet - one that will make you laugh! It's a shame John Belushi is not alive to see what giant moves his brother made in the acting world. I recommend that your teenage daughter introduces this movie to her BFF at the next sleeping party. Do not forget the puppy!
