This movie has always been my favorite Disney movie. Then, on 21/21/01, I saw the 30th anniversary of this DVD movie. WOW I remembered why I loved this movie. The DVD is so great, it has another 30 minutes that the original did not have. I did not know that when I started looking. The film has been growing ever since. The music they cut off should have stayed. You have not seen this movie until you saw the Full Version 131 min. Many people say music is forgotten. I remember every melody in this movie with heart, each song has its own self-charm and comes like a hole. I remember when I was younger when I had the play "Eglantine" stuck in my head for a few days. Like the "Briny Sea" (the song was created to win poppens, but it was removed from the movie) Please watch the new unceasing film 30 and vote again for this movie. 10 that it is indeed.
