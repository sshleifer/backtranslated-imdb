Peter Bogdonavich made a lot of really great movies, and THEY ALL LAUGHED is one of the best. The cast could not be better equipped to play this easy, but slightly bitten comedy. Interestingly, Bogdonavich, so easily, easy to use, offers the film a disarming emotional core. Fresh and immediately, the film starts with absolutely no explanation. There is no sound music to inspire us. Meet the characters in action and, as Bogdonavich glides on the streets of New York, the film unfolds effortlessly. Robby Muller's camera captures everything with an understated simplicity, which seems accidental, but certainly not. The cast is extraordinary. In any way, a classic.
