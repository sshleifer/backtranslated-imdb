This is the second film that Ida Lupino saw as a director after 53 years. I think this was a better movie than that. She has a girl who is about to marry and she is then sexually assaulted and she does not like everyone to look for and talk about her, so she runs away and is taken by a family. I think Leonard Maltin's review is just right to give 2 and 1/2 stars.
