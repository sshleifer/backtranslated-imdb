It seems fashionable to rip "Basic Instinct 2" to the point where a significant part of the audience (including critics) found it terrible even before being released. It seems much more fashionable to destroy Sharon Stone, who like us all, now fourteen years old and, unlike most of us, still looks great. The first comments about this movie were so vicious that I had to see. In my opinion, this sequel is not as good as the original movie, but it's not as bad as most of the comments are pretending. Michael Caton-Jones is not Paul Verhoeven, neither Henry Bean and Leora Barish are Joe Eszterhas. "Basic Instinct 2" is just an average entertainment thriller, and besides adding Jerry Goldsmith's original score, it does not look much like its predecessor. Even Stone gives the character a different dimension, creating a Catherine Trimell, a cute girlfriend that can be categorized perfectly among other monsters such as Hannibal Lecter. She is an intelligent actress who is not afraid to take risks and can play with the camp in her spare time. Unfortunately, it seems to be the main target for those who enjoy this blow. It has become too successful, too much a main icon, and like all the actors who have reached that level, her time has arrived and is now bound to be destroyed by the Hollywood audience. the distribution is remarkable, providing much better performance than the material deserves. David Morrissey is a much better actor and much more interesting than Michael Douglas: his behavior is flawless, giving a dense and complex dimension to a non-dimensional character. Because it has more time on the screen and is the film's axis, it can keep your attention from start to finish. I do not recommend "Basic Instinct 2" as a great movie; I only disagree with most of the comments on this site and my belief that other agendas than the movie itself form the opinion of most viewers.
