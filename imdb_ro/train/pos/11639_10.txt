I've seen an advanced review for this movie tonight. I liked it absolutely. The film kept me on the edge of the chair all night. Cillian Murphy is extremely creepy as the negative character. For those who saw Batman Begins, his character was more scary in this movie. He played the character very well. The most frightening "bad guy" I've seen for some time. Rachel McAdams was great. Everyone in the audience laughed, rejected and exalted at the same time, as if we were on the trail. Suspicion is kept out of the movie. The amazing part is that the end was not anti-climatic. I was not disappointed at last. I felt satisfied. The trailer does not do justice to the movie. The film is much better than the indicated trailer. Do not expect this movie to appear on the video. Go see. Although I did not have to pay to see this movie, I would love 10.75 to see it. Enjoy!
