Here's the first episode of EVRE Friends, where we introduced to Freak Control Monica Gellar (Courtney Cox), the new divorced Ross Gellar (David Schimmer), Hippy Pheobe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow), unknown actor and lady (Matt Le Blanc and Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry) is very sarcastic, so the scene begins until we introduced our last child to Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston), the sixth child, and the episode is better than most people give credit because, like any new sitcom, the first episode is not always fantastic, acting in this episode is not great, because the distribution can not be identified and truly credible art in the new characters (except Kudrow and Perry - shining) <br /> <br /> Matt Le Blanc-Man , his action was downright, because later on, he gets more confident, but I think he's trying to be fun, but most of all he's failing. David Schimmer - Why He Says Over word, can not speak in but he has become one of the funniest characters in the later seasons, but he is not confident. and I can not sympathize with him Jennifer Aniston - She seems hot and has a good job like Rachel Green but we only see the real Rachel later in the first season, Courtney Cox - It seems quite anorexic in this episode, worrying, looks altogether different now, (healthier), she acts a little, but everyone is in this 20-minute pilot! Lisa Kudrow and Matthew Perry - make these two together because their comic time and quality in quality was superb, and for Lisa this was one of her first roles and is as natural as Pheobe (Pheebs), and Matthew Perry is just Matthew Perry playing virtually! Episode quality improves later, such as Sets, they look dark and creepy in this episode and make them seem unfriendly, the action is okay, the characters gain confidence in each new scene and I'm proud that it's the pilot! I hope we see friends coming together! because they will always be there for us!
