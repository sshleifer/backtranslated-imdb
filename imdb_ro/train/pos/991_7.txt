I'm really shocked to see the number of reviews that relate to this movie. This movie was not meant to be a "deep thought" movie, which most reviewers seem to believe. In fact, it would seem that if a movie does not produce a life-changing perspective and a filthy plot, twisted, it would be a rate of 1 or 2. Do not destroy a movie because you do not like genre, people . This movie was an action / comedy movie, and that was all it was intended to be. And for action / comedy, it was very well done. In fact, I was surprised that I liked it just as much as I did, although I was never a fan of Jamie Foxx, having a much-used plot that he has. The land was not spectacular, the typical killer gets out of prison and is thrown into evil plot as he tries to clean up his deeds (see Blue Streak, Hudson Hawk, 48 Hours etc.) but he was heated by a little twist technology. Now, "bad boys" are actually "good boys," and REAL "bad" is a uber-geek. Jamie Foxx is actually playing a humorous game at the same time smart enough and serious character and did not try to exaggerate the humor of the movie. If you are looking for a deep plot, such as "The Matrix" or a drama like "Of Mouse and Men," then this movie is not for you. But if you enjoy the brutal action, the excellent filming with fast rhythms and an occasional bust of humor, this movie will not disappoint you. I would normally have rated it around 8 (at the same level as Die Hard Trilogy), but instead of giving it a 10 to try to bring the score to what it should be. <br /> <br />
