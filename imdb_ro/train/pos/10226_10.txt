I was around 7 when I first saw the movie. It was not so special then, but a few years later I saw it again and this time I made fun, a lot :) I think the best parts of the movie are: the Yeti body language and "special effects ", also. If you want to watch this movie, do not wait for a Hollywood blockbuster, even this movie was made from approx. 1000 dollars :) <br /> <br /> I have a copy of it.Movie and the video version also (But I do not think it was ever shown in the cinemas) Watch it enjoy it !!! Yeti forever !!!
