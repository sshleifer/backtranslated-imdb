Rawhide was a wonderful series of Western television. Focusing on a band of pilots that led the driver Gil Favor. Most episodes - especially from the first three seasons - were really studies of the characters of Favor and his people. guest stars came and went, but, unlike the train wagon seldom dominated episodes appeared in. tanned was a really brave Favor, the West and Gil stood as a memorable character should not be forgotten. Thanks to Eric Fleming's performance, the show has become a massive success. Of course, he was ably supported by a wonderful cast of good actors - Clint Eastwood, Sheb Wooley, Paul Brinegar, Steve Raines, James Murdoch, Rocky Shahan, Robert Cabal. All these actors have left their mark in a piece of television history. Rawhide captured the flavor of that western time that no other series has for me, anyway, managed to do that. The seasons later tended to divide the pipes and give them individual story lines. For me, sometimes this did not work - the cattle and the common unit provided the best stories. However, there are a few classic stories, and Rawhide has remained an adventure in top drawers. Black and white photography added to a bleak, realistic feeling that other Western series rarely managed to capture. Cattle thieves, Indians, Commancheroes, beautiful dangers in distress, serial killers, all appeared to give our heroes problems. The end came for the series quietly when the final season was focused less than half way. The reason - Eric Fleming left and tanned was now a bodyless head - the courageous realism was gone, Gil commanded respect and favored the emancipated authority - he was never infallible, and that made him more and more interesting. We will not see them again. Watch an episode whenever you can, I rarely disappoint.
