this independent film was one of the best movies from the high grass treasure I've ever seen there I love that there are so many things that were wonderful about the movie above all what cast and the crew I had the opportunity to meet were absolutely phenomenal. I thought Avi did a great job in his role. and Ricky Ullman was absolutely true for his role for a Disney actor, I was amazed at his talent to be able to go from teen cheese comedy to such an adult role without the talent problem in the movie was amazing, the cinema was great if you want to see an independent movie, this is really one thing you should see. I think Mr Gruver would have been so proud to have had such a submission to the festival, and his parents loved the film so much when he won the public's favorite and I saw him again. it was really a wonderful movie, it was dark and funny and sad and really emotional it was just fabulous. I am sincerely so excited about this film and I really do not want to ruin it for no one to see it and be truly amazed by the fact that I think these filmmakers really have what it takes to go to places and I hope to see more work from them in the future.
