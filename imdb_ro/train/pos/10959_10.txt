All I can say is that if you do not fall in love with Big and Little Edie after watching this movie, then you're not human! Even after seeing it for the first time, I was drawn. It is a fascinating experience that is difficult to describe, as I'm sure other fans will witness. Once you see it, you will cry to believe that these two lovely ladies are no longer with us. At least we have Gray Guards to remember! I think we all want to have the fierce independence of these two ladies. Although I always admired Jackie Onassis Kennedy, it does not stay in your heart as Big and Little Edie do. What you rarely treat such people; I just want to be!
