I could watch this movie entirely and I was deeply excited. I was not sure if it was really a comedy or a drama - they had elements of both. Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper showed great - our 60-year-old image has certainly changed from Aunt Bee! They are vibrant, beautiful, sexy! The only downside in this movie was that there was absolutely no mention of other characters in the MTM or Rhoda shows of the 1970s. I would have thought that at the time she was settled in New York City (where Rhoda was established) at least it would have been mentioned that her sister Brenda or Julie Kavner would have appeared, assuming, of course, that she was still in Big Apple. I hope ABC will make a series and bring back all the old pieces of these shows back to the guests. By the way, what happened if CBS did this meeting or a possible series? Was not the network that introduced "MTM" and "Rhoda"?
