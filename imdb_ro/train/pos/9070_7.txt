It began slowly after an excellent animated introduction, because the director had a bunch of characters and a school to develop. Once the bet is active, however, the movie takes the rhythm because it is a race against time to see if a certain number of worms can be eaten until 7pm. We had a good occasion on our way home to discuss a few things with our son: bullies, helping others, mind on matter when you do not want to do something. A special note is played by Erica (Erk): Hallie Kate Eisenberg. The director kneels it unexpectedly, and when it's on the screen, it's captivating. It's one of the faces "Hey, she looks familiar", then I remembered that she was the little girl Pepsi presented about 8 years ago. She was also in "Paulie," the parrot movie that tries to find her way home. Eisenberg made many appearances in television and movies in '99 -00, but then he was not seen too much in the next few years. She is now 14 years old and grows into a beautiful woman. Her smile really warms the screen. If she can get more good roles she could have a good career (or better?) Than Haley Joel Osment, another three-year-old actor called but hopeless without some of Osment's problems Lately. <br /> <br /> Anywhozitz, according to my 8-year-old son, who just finished reading the story, did not seem to follow the book so well, but it was fun. The end of the movie seemed to be a great configuration for some sequels (how to eat cooked servants? Escargot Kid's Style?) That might not be such a bad thing. It was nice to take your family into a movie and not to worry about language, violence or sexual scenes. Another good aspect of the film was the respect / fear generated by Mr. Burdock (stencils). Today's films tend to show figures of adult authorities as buffs. While having a private scene, he drove the school with a firm hand. It was also nice to see Andrea Martin work.
