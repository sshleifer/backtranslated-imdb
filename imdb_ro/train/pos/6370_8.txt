To my surprise, I enjoyed Disney's latest animation installment. The film was down, but in general I felt the story was strong and the characters were easy to understand. It was also nice to see a Disney animated movie that was not musical. I was pushed to the limit with Tarzan. Fortunately, they gave a rest to the music. Another nice feature about the film is that the comedy was not completely crushed (at Hercules), rather subtle, so it still made the kids laugh while they did not make adults feel angry or simply stupid . A disappointment was the animation. With all the big animation movies going off Disney studios, you'd think they're going to go and catch up. There is something to say about tradition, but imagine your possibilities with the story of Atlantis! Overall, the movie was fun and definitely deserves a trip to the multiplex. <br /> <br />
