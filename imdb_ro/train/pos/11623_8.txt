(You will know what I mean after seeing the red eye ...) In general, Red Eye was a better thriller than expected. It slowly descends and builds slowly. But once it's over, it's a stick! <br /> <br /> It's hard to define exactly what this thriller does as ... thrilling how I found it. Except that the director simply did a credible job of pulling you into the action of what otherwise a plot would have been. I tended to forget that I was watching a movie. That says a lot. Other factors, I believe, are the "rapprochement" of the victim and the evil one ... and that in time, you start to really refer to the victim. A small 8 out of 10, more than a 7.5 ... but that's good enough!
