I absolutely loved this movie! It was so good! This film is said by the parrot, Paulie's point of view. Paulie is given to the little girl as a gift. Paulie helps Marie learn to talk and they become the best friends. But when Paulie tells Marie to fly, she falls and the bird is sent. Then the adventure begins. Paulie goes so long to find his way back to Marie. This movie is so sweet, funny, touching, sad and more. When I first watched this movie, it made me cry. Bold birds, and urging them to find Marie for that moment, were so moving. I have to say that the end is so sweet and sad, but you have to watch it to find out how it works. Finally, the goalkeeper tries to help him, after hearing his story. Will she find Marie or not? Find out when watching this sweet film, warming your heart. It will touch your heart. Rating: 10
