I was about thirteen years old when the movie appeared on television. It's far superior in action than most of the movies then. Martin Sheen is excellent and although Nick Nolte has a small part, he also offers excellent support. Vic Morrow as the negative character is superb. When Sheen "tests water" in Ford 34 (COOL) along the highway, it's spectacular! grand. I am disappointed with the low vote we have received. I think younger generations have more interest than most of the junk that come in these days. Good taste avoids the masses!
