This show has a couple of cliques and a few over the top, the moments of Dawson's Creek (a 16-year-old speaker who was talking about the way back when life made sense?) But in general it seems to be a decent performance. Most characters seem very real, and the story seemed to move well in the pilot - ending with a good lesson in the end. I hope every episode does not turn into life like the first, which would be too much drama for this vehicle. Jeremy Sumpter does a great job as a teenager with a passion for baseball, I think many of us might refer to his astonishment and sometimes to a tunnel vision for the team he always wanted to part of.
