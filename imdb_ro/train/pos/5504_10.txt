I just saw that last night, it was broadcast on the "Passionate Eye" series of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. It was presented recently (September 2003) at the Toronto International Film Festival, as well as many others. It's a remarkable movie. Those who made the film have literally hit the story, being there to make a documentary about Chavez himself. Instead, they found themselves directly in the midst of the events as the blow unfolded. They had unprecedented access to events and people and, for the most part, let the story unfold as it happens. They, of course, have their own ideological perspective (they make it obvious), but they are in the background and instead try to focus their attention on events, people and on history and history that led to the coup. As a film, it is not a breakage stone in a stylistic or aesthetic sense, and I think that should be the case. What can we see to see what "embedded" journalism should be. What we see is a remarkable remark of a country struggling to reach democracy ... a charismatic leader (Chavez) who cares about his people ... a story of power and greed as a coalition of corporate / military / the media combines to lead a coup of a democratically elected leader ... and unprecedented access to a historic event as it unfolds. <br /> <br />
