on the contrary, to the person mentioned above, I felt that this movie was really funny, especially in scenes where there are plenty of mixes. I do not want to give the plot and the story away to people who have not seen it yet, but I will say that Paresh Rawal does not have an extended role, such as the past of Priyadarshan, for example Hera Pheri and Hungama. Paresh Rawal plays an amazing role in the little role that John Abraham does as well, Akshay Kumar has proved he is no less in this film as if he had from Waqt and almost all his films after Andaaz. Even though all three heroines in this movie were on their way, they did a pretty good job of acting especially Nargis, which is very good looking and hot. I would say that if you liked Hungama or Hera Pheri this movie is a watch you have to look at.
