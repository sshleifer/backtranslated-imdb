The film had many fundamental values ​​of family and love. She expressed human emotion and was an inspiring story. Writing was clear (it was very easy to understand, making it perfect for children) and it was fun and fun sometimes. There were some symbols loaded to search. The cinema was acceptable. There was no sense of experimentation that many cinematographers have done today (which, frankly, silence becomes a little warning). It was obviously filmed, but it was nice. Although editing could have been done better, I thought it was a nice movie for a family to enjoy. And the organization of information was just thrown at you, which was something I did not like, but in all it was a good movie.
