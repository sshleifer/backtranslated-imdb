After reading the Diamond book, I was a little disappointed with the series, but overall it is quite informative. Reading the other comments, it is comforting to know that "warriors of culture" are hard at work, seeing "attacks" on "Western Civilization" underneath each carpet. Is the diamond a small sermon? Sure. Like many academics, he sees his theory as the most important thing ever. He uses the phrase "weapons, germs and steel" at apparently every occasion in the series. I got it after about the first 10 minutes. Is Diamond Simple (Serial)? Sure. The part about the Spaniards in South America is particularly funny, condensing a very long and complicated history to "pox, swords and horses," wrapping the whole conquest of South America in about 15 minutes. But the point remains valid - these things have contributed (but have not fully defined) the reasons for Spain's success over established cultures. He preaches * against * Western civilization in any way? Not. Not a word. Not in my ear. All he says is that luck played an important role in determining advanced cultures faster, not that luck is the only reason. Finally, if you're looking for something to validate your own sense of superiority, then this series is not for you. But if you are interested in all factors than the influence of the success or failure of societies, this series presents a useful interpretation of historical evidence.
