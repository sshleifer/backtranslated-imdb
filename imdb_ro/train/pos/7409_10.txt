Waiting to see a "cute movie" from mainland China, I was poorly prepared. Family dynamics, community and the inevitability of change have rarely been so well explored in the film. Each character is solid and I was completely attracted to the story. The organization is much more complex than the American audience will be accustomed to. However, there is no difficulty in progression, even while reading subtitles. Jiang Wu, as a retarded brother, is a bright constant light. Leave your cynicism in your closet. She'll be there when you check it out.
