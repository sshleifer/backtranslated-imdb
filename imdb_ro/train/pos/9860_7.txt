This movie did not have hilarious parts, mostly funny units, but there were no parts that were really bad. The worst part was Sid's voice. His slogan slogan was too much for me. In about 5 minutes, I'm tired of hearing them talking. Besides the annoying lazy voice, the movie was good. There were many side jokes that, if you catch them, make the film much better. This is a good movie for kids. It's enough to keep the adults going and enough to entertain the kids. This is definitely worth renting if you have children and want to watch a movie with them.
