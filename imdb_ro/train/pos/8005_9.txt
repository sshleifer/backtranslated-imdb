I bought this game on eBay after I heard it was a game similar to Elite. The mode of play is really very similar and is very addictive. Once I played it a few times, I immediately returned to eBay and bought children for all my children so they could join in the fun too ... I played this game right through and the story makes it it feels like you're in a movie, it's brilliant. If you have trouble exploring because of the restrictive nature of the story in single player play, simply create a Freelancer server on your own PC (easy to make and included) and play on the heart's content. There is still a large number of Freelancer servers on the Internet, so multiplayer is not a problem and not everything that threatens, because you often do not mean other players unless you want. So get a copy of this game, learn it by playing the single player campaign, then set up an online presence and enjoy it. The depth of this game is amazing, with huge exploration systems and wrecks to discover, as well as all sorts of other things to discover - hidden planets, wormholes, secret bases, the list is almost endless. Fantastic play and especially how you can get it for a few moments on eBay. Take it with the fully written manual, if you can (blue box, not the Xplosiv red box), it's better loading!
