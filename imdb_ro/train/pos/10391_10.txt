It's rare for a movie to appeal to viewers of all ages - to children for a fine narrative and a wonderful, colorful, and adult production for a script, fine production, good casting / action, together with a fine Rozsa score. Two contemporary films accomplish this - "Thief of Bagdad" (1940) and "Adventures of Robin Hood" (1938). Some of the back story of this production is fascinating. This production, which began in England in the summer of 1939, moved to Hollywood and turned out to be a cover for British intelligence efforts! The producer, Alexander Korda, was later invested in 1942. Here is a unique case of the intersection between art, trade and politics! By all means, make sure a good CD of this movie for your library!
