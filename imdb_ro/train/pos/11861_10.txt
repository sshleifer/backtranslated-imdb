This movie is very fun and is never boring, even if it runs for almost 3 hours. Al Pacino, Michelle Phieffer and other distributors are great in the film and are very credible. Violence was an extreme extreme in the movie, but then it showed how bad the drug trade was at the time of the movie. The ending is amazing and probalby one of the hottest scenes ever. A great movie and you'll probably enjoy it.
