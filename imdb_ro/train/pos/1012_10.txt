Stargate SG-1 is a spin of the Stargate genre from 1994. I am so glad that they have decided to expand on the subject. The show has been receiving it since the first episode, a retired Jack O'Neill has to go through the gate once more to meet his old companion, Dr. Daniel Jackson. Through the first two episodes, we meet Samantha Carter, a very intelligent person who does not let anyone go over it, and there is Teal'c, a peaceful and compassionate warrior defying the false god and joining the team. The main bad boys are called Gouald, they are parasites that can be introduced into the brain, thus controlling and doing bad deeds. Any Gouald, who has a massive amount of power, is often considered to be "Lord of the System". The warriors behind the Gouald are called Jaffa, who house the Gouald parasite in their bodies until the gouald can be introduced into the brain of a person. By episodes, we will see mostly SG-1, the exploration team made up of Jack / Daniel / Teal'c / and Sam, pass through the wormhole that instantly transmits them to other planets (this device is called the Stargate) and they meet new cultures or bad guys. Some episodes are all over the world, which means they do not go through the stargate once in the episode, and rather deal with the pressing problems on Earth. Over the years, you begin to see a decline in SG-1 team as almost knit, and several story-building characters. This, in turn, means even more episodes in the world, which is perfectly understandable. My rating: 8.75 / 10 ---- While most of this show is good, there are some cases of story lines not always getting wrapped up and less of a focus on the travel gate in recent years. But still, science fiction top!
