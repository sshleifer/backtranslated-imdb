Clara Bow (Hula Calhoun) is the daughter of the owner of Albert Gran (Bill Calhoun), who is mainly interested in playing cards and beating friends. She is interested in riding in rural areas until engineer Clive Brook (Anthony Haldane) appears to build a dam. One of his father's friends, Arlette Marchal (Ms. Bane), competes for attention. His wife, Maude Truax (Margaret Haldane), appears for the controversial final. A lot of "pre-code" elements like bathing nude. <br /> <br /> Wonderful shooting in Hawaii.
