Since this movie was based on a true story about a woman who had two children and was not very good, it was just scary how real it really was! The actress is what gave the movie that pushes to greatness. Diane Keaton played the lead character, Patsy McCartle, who had two sons whom he adored. Her performance is what made the story of real life come to life on a television screen. It was very hard to look at some of the scenes, because they were as true as what happens when someone becomes addicted to drugs. Just watching this loving mother goes from sweet to worry at all, but it's true. I met people who went through retreat and was very similar to what happened in this movie, from what I remember. I also thought it was very risky for the director to want to film what happened to this woman. However, it's done so well. Applause the director for making this film. I recommend this to everyone who has known someone who has ever been drug addicted or just to learn what can happen to you if you become addicted to them.
