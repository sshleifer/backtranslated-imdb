I saw Lady with his red hair back when he came out and I did not remember it as something to appreciate. The truth is that, despite its base in a true story, the game on the screen is stupid and unbelievable. The real value of the image is the distribution. A constellation of some of the best players in the 1930s and 1940s makes a backdrop for Miriam Hopkins's delicate, intelligent work, always underestimated, and Claude Rains's extraordinary and spectacular spectacle, which is usually the best thing in the photo. What actor! He never won an Oscar, but he's in the good company of Chaplin, Garbo and Hitchcock. Perhaps Lady with Hair Red contains the best film work. See him and enjoy him. <br /> <br />
