it was a favorite Christmas favorite that I want them to release on vhs or dvd since I lost 33 RPM and all the tapes I've made are also long missing. Denver fan, but he was very impressed by the music, which was mostly traditional favorites with a muppet spin (esp Little St. Nick!). It has also contained some little known songs (original?). It was done in the late 1970s, this show had a timeless attitude. Hoping to find a copy soon!
