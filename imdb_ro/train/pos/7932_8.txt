When I watch a low-budget movie, I know what to expect. I expect the act not to be as good (for budgetary reasons), I expect the lighting not to be just as good (budgetary reasons). I expect the sound to be not as good (budget again). Stop judging these low budget movies as a big budget movie! I'm a director, so I understand budget constraints on a low-budget movie. Locate locations, photos, etc. The list goes on and on. I do not mean that the acting was bad. Jose Rosete, Chris Angelo, Victor Zaragoza are good. Martinez River is a natural thing. Carl Washington has not been sold yet. He must understand that each line is not important, some throw lines. I say that if a movie makes you want to see what's going on, it's a good movie. I liked this movie. I gave her a 8. I wanted to see what was going to happen next. Good work Quiroz brothers!
