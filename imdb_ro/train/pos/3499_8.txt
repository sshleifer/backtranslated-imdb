Victor Vargas's lifting is a movie that you have to see for sure. He was very feeling in his heart and he had a lot of humor that makes you suck you right in. It's as much real life as what adolescents have to go through. Victor, a teenager full of heart, but with a good heart at the end deals with love in all the right places for girls and family. Finally, Victor learns the true meaning of love, after dealing with an old grandmother and a girl he wants to use, actually using it as well. I encourage people to watch this movie because it will be like seeing a real family. How much do you feel about this movie. A heart-felt moment was when Victor's grandmother tossed a victory over something simple. Victor was really heart and could not believe he would do that. It made me feel very bad for him as if it were real. I generally give this movie a B +
