This is a splendid simplistic film that explores a theme and gives each viewer something different that he takes from him. The premise is simple: An anonymous celebrity actor (Morgan Freeman) decides to study for a future role by visiting a shop and watching people. He is particularly interested in the cashier on the track "10 Items or Less" (Paz Vega), which he finds an amiable, strong and curious presence. Both actors play each other brilliantly and bring the solid character dimension to what is a character study. It is not a conventional character study; each represents entire worlds. The life of the cashier is terrified in a tough and frustrating "real world", while the actor is so enthusiastic about his fantasy existence that he can not do simple tasks such as phone memories. He easily recognizes that he puts it in the face when he speaks to people, and the whole research point of the real people shows that he is not one of them. But not only is the actor inspired by real people for his work; we see the reverse. Several characters recognize "He" and refer to how he inspired them with his film roles. The favorite song of the Al Pasar to Barca cashier, how a girl refuses to hide behind beauty and prefers instead to pay (that is, to do honest work) for the boat, could not have been better chosen. Parallel to the Vega character, the only employee of the store with any brain or ambition, who is willing to work hard to succeed. (It's a pretty big suction for someone who looks like Paz Vega.) It's a strange movie, probably done on a shot. If you do not mind the slow pace and the "talky" approach, this movie will have fun. Characters are perfectly contrasted, and effective action makes them delightful. A beautiful watch.
