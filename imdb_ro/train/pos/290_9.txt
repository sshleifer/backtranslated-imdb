Edmund Burke said that "all bad needs are for my good to do nothing." Hollywood often gives us garbage because there are not enough families to see quality movies. This movie was the uplifting story of the loss and restoration of faith. He had no violence, no crime, and no PG assessment. The Western landscape was filmed well, and some of the visions were simply breathtaking. The actors were a little young for their parts, but otherwise credible and talented. The score of the music was too loud and, in some places, completely drowned the dialogue. I am rarely surprised by the end of the film, but I was pleasantly surprised by it. Sometimes good boys win and earn through sincere efforts. We liked the movie and the message and we recommend it to the whole family.
