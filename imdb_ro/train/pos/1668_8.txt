Artimisia was last night. At first I did not think I liked it, but seeing that I had not felt yet to sleep and that I had nothing, I continued to look and felt intrigued by the young Artimisia, a pure virgin and passionate. Her love story with older Tassi inspired recognized feelings. Even if the film is based on a very romantic and not a reality, it loves it much more than the usual biographies or dramas of the costumes. Great music, great photos, great music and lyrics. I liked it and wanted more! :-)
