I thought Mr. Dreyfuss was perfect for his role as actor and dictator. His co-star, Mr. Julia, played his role just as well. It was interesting to see how reluctant Richard Dreyfuss was, replacing the dictator against his will. But he became more confident and more comfortable with the role over time. Since everything happens for a reason in life, I think he was forced to replace the dictator because he should have stayed there for a year he did. I think he was left because he should have seen how well his life was compared to the poverty he witnessed in Parador. I think she took too many things from her own life and had to get a serious check of reality staying in that country for as long as she did. But ......... .. anyway ........... that's why I gave a 7 out of 10 movie.
