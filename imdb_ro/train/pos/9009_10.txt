This movie truly captures the feeling of freedom ....... and what deserves the freedom of your integrity ... in the most delightful, light-hearted way. It's not a serious but hilarious adventure. The story reflects life. We do not always get what we want right now, but we learn that we get what we need to understand why we did not get what we wanted ... which results in getting more than we thought to get! You will receive this once you see the movie. <br /> <br /> And this movie is really about finding love and knowing a man has found it and completely changed one's life. It's one of my preferences ... ... it's not easy to find, but it's worth hunting ......... Guarantees you to follow it several times!
