This is one of the greatest movies ever, even the biggest film ever. I forgot about the film for about 12 years. Until I saw an addition to TV for ADGTH and remembered my girlfriend's memories when I was little. And when I watched it a few nights ago, I became addicted to the movie. I usually do not like animated family movies, but this is special is the perfect family movie. The end of the film always touches my heart and it makes me very sorry, but that makes this film amazingly better than all the garbage that comes to children's films today. I mean, the movie is G and it's about 2 dogs that are involved in gambling, in the film there are many smoking, drinking, killing, death and hell. What I think makes the film from good to sea. That is, today's films do not bring the reality to the children and they did it in this film. RIP Judith Barsi & Dom DeLuise
