Throughout this movie, you might think that this movie is just for kids. Well, it's mainly aimed at them, but it's also well rounded, with the jokes shown to adults in the audience. This time, Bandwidth Muppet tries to get to Broadway, with the direct straits that prevent them from producing them, which makes them split. But Kermit will not stop, and his decision keeps things moving until after he has done the business together, he is hit by a car and sent in amnesia! <br /> <br /> It's a reference, in part, of those old vehicles from the early '40s, with musicals, in fact, as a musical subject, only here is a lot of zaniness and wonderful moments thrown into a musical, a pot of hysterically funny moments (Lou Zealand's boomerang fish, Gonzo's cascade display, the whispering campaign, among many others), but with a lot of heart. Muppet writers are not shy of conventions, but on the contrary, they embrace them to the point where it is almost refreshing to see such a story "they put on a show" where they are thick and I think the characters will be fulfilling their dream. <br /> <br /> While not as original as Muppet, it has many attractive and memorable songs, excellent locations all over Manhattan, and even some inter-species meeting (and marriage) intonations! Cameos includes Liza Minneli ("a frog"), Elliot Gould (as a policeman), Brooke Shields (proposed by a rat), Edward I. Koch, Gregory Hines and Joan Rivers. So get ready to sing, or have lots of laughs and romantic moments (romantic) with one of the best Muppet movies.
