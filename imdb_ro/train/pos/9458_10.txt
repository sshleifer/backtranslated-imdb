This is a sublime movie. It flows right at the right pace all the way. The accompanying music fits perfectly and is very pleasing to the ear. The humorous pieces are hilarious and are made even more by the tragic, largely depressing nature of the film. However, despite many comments about the inherent tragedy of the story, it was nothing but depressing for me to look. I liked it very much in a way that I have not experienced for a long time. That is, it's superb and yet without all the common pitfalls of modern movies, such as sex, violence and unnecessary special effects. <br /> <br /> "Dan in real life" has nothing to be without regular vices. It has a mature plot that does not need, and indeed it would have been destroyed by any other ornamentation. At the same time, the theme is entirely adult. It's a piece of art that encapsulates entirely and you do not want anything more than it already offers. There are some scenes that feel a little "Waltons," but they actually have perfect sense in the long run as they contract more dysfunctional moments. The rows take place for the tragic who then goes over the idyllic who turns to the darkest, etc. This landscaping landscape of emotional cinema creates a perfect balance and keeps the viewer in a state of lithium-like stability. Peaks and gutters are gentle, but more than adequate to the pleasure they bring. We highly recommend watching this movie no matter what genre you normally enjoy. Put aside any prejudices, because this must be seen!
