After working in downtown Manhattan and many times I ate at noon during the summer days in the park near the City Hall, I would see the mayor coming and going. It was great to go beyond the city hall doors and see how it looked in the lobby and throughout the building. Al Pacino (mayor John Pappas), "Gigli", "03", gave remarkable performance through the whole picture and especially when he made a speech in an African-American church for a boy who was killed. John Cusack (Vice Mayor Kevin Calhoun), "Runaway Jury," 03, was a devoted servant to the mayor and worshiped him in everything he tried to accomplish. Bridget Fonda (Marybeth Cogan) begins to fall in love with Kevin Calhoun and provides an important support role. Last but not least, Danny Aiello (Frank Anselmo), "Off Key," 01, played a mob boss who had some very difficult choices to make towards the end of the picture! Great movie with great action and a photo fantastic in New York!
