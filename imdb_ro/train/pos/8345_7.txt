Recently I saw I.Q. and even if I'm not a romantic comedy guy, I think it was just a nice and sweet film to watch. So many films, in my opinion, lack honesty. Do you know that feeling when you look at a movie and feel embarrassed for taking something out of the story and it was as if the director threw it together as if it were garbage? The story of the scientists is sweet and funny. How they stayed together and tried to help Tim Robbins' character become clever. I liked the love story between Tim and Meg, because it was simple and brought a good point when it comes to love, "nothing is what it seems." I would recommend this for a Sunday morning. <br /> <br /> 7/10
