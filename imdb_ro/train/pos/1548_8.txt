Fortunately, without knowing anything about this movie, I was quite curious to record it on TV. And then the tape ran only five minutes before it was over! But I'm glad I managed to get the most of it because it's a very good spy movie. There are regular toy submarines and little clear parcels, but also very cool and bold moments. Given the production year of 1969, some slight lesbian accents must have raised some eyebrows. Of course, now it does not surprise anyone and those scenes seem pretty nice made. And not only because of George George's actresses. The gas attack seems to hit a lot on every spectator, no wonder, and it sure hit me. Very effective. Also, the views from both sides of the opponents give the whole story a deeper depth along the usual suspense and action. This is not just a heroic war story of a victorious party, it shows what lies behind the victory for good and evil. Well, being a case of war, especially bad. For fans of Ennio Morricone, this is also a must. His work is always excellent, touching, but never over the top. And I think I have to try to capture more movies with Suzy Kendall. Talk about Fr√§ulein! Let's hope they get this on DVD soon, so I can have the whole movie in my collection and more people will get acquainted with this little-known jewel.
