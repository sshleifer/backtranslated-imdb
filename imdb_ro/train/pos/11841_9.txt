This was a great movie with a good story. My children (10, 7, 5 and 4) have just loved this movie, including myself. Music was also fantastic. No, horses do not speak, but instead the story is told by Spirit. And to hear a story told by a horse, if the sight was fun. I think the title says it all, "spirit". This movie really gives you a sense of family and home and friends. I had to say that my 4-year-old boy and the 5-year-old girl were really touched by this movie and even got into it, they laughed so loud and finally exalted the spirit. <br /> <br /> Enjoy "spirit" with your family and your spirit has been lifted with this unimaginable story. Your children will love her. I think you too.
