There have been a lot of Zorro movies made over the decades, but it's a shame that one of the best is probably one of the least-seen. Zorro's battle legion is slightly different from other Zorro movies. First, it is a series of the Republic in 12 chapters. And this time, Zorro is not played by a top studio star such as Douglas Fairbanks, Tyrone Power or Antonio Banderas, but by Reed Hadley's acting actor. While Hadley does not have such a strong presence on procedures as others, he does a good job, helped by the fact that he is not the only hero here; as the title means, he has a battle legion to call. Another big difference is that the setting is not California. The story here takes place in the center of Mexico in 1824 when a man posing as a living god provokes indigenous Indian people and a band of bandits to help him in his plan to overthrow the newly established Mexican republic. Something, Zorro and a handful of followers are planning to do everything they can to stop. Do not get me wrong, there is at least an incredibly cheesy moment for each episode, from the horn "twang" bow sound effects to acting playfully. But overall it is one of the best replica series of all time and probably the best Zorro. The terrain is stronger than most of the series and never becomes incomprehensible or meandering. action - Indiana Jones movie fans will notice MORE bits borrowed from this series.
