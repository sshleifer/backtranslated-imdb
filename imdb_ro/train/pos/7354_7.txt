I saw this movie for the first time over 25 years ago on British television and I just managed to resume it last week on a DVD copy bought on eBay. I remembered the musical sequences, the color and the charm of the fashion and clothing plates, but the intrigue is weaker than that of Anna Neagle / Michael Wilding, the Spring in Park Lane and Maytime is not so good until the passing of the years. But Michael Wilding is a joy in the movie, charming, funny, debonair, seems to have a lot of fun and to be at the top of his shape. It's worth watching for yourself. Anna Neagle appears a little matron near him and a little too old for her role, but by the late 1940s, their film partnership was well established with the cinema becoming public. Spring in Park Lane was a top hit for 1947 and a great money producer. In his autobiography, Wilding has written extensively about his great respect for Herbert Wilcox, the director and instigator of this series of London movies.
