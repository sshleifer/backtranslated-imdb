Winter Day, December 28, 1986, two bored 14 years hires a movie. "Hmmmm, Police Story, it seems exciting," "who is Jackie Chan?", "He never heard of him." Two hours later, after watching the movie, in a daze, we wanted to find out more. 16 years later (and seriously out of pocket from the JC movie collection!) The film still takes me like no one else. Okay, maybe I have a bad spot for this, because it was my first movie (Cannonball Run does not count !!) JC, but it's an excellent movie. It has all the classic elements JC, Action, Humor, Action, Heart and ACTION! Some comments say it's dated, it was made in 1985, of course it's dated! But then it must also be Jaws, Casablanca, Singin 'in Rain and The Godfather !!!!!! Without movies like Story Police where would Hollywood act today? PS set of standards, many a scene has been stolen for use in other movies. To fully appreciate it, you have to see it in wide screen, you are missing so much in the movie, otherwise (yes, it really fell from the bus that went to the corner!). If you have not already, you see this movie now! <br /> <br />
