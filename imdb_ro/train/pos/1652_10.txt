This series has written to Deighton's genre when I was younger and I like this story. However, I would not agree with the above comment. From what I've read in the past, Holm's performance did not lead Deighton to refuse to release the series, but to slaughter that all three of the cards were sent to the screen. An extraordinary example of this is rewriting the crossing of the border that put an end to Samson's career. The scene is not in the book, the character who dies in the field was never in books, and the crossing in Sinker was from East Germany to West Germany, not the Polish border. This whole story is a cloth. Changes in the Set affect the story integrity in the same way. My perspective on Holm's performance was that he portrayed Samson's disorientation during the fault of his excellent wife, and I think he behaved well in portraying the aging field agent who desperately tries to end the class division. Samson pays for his father's idealism and suffers because of his influence on his life. As Clevemore commented, if he had been educated, he probably would have run the department. I think the real loss of performance is due to physical appearance more than anything else. Holm is diminishing compared to Samson's book - a physically impressive man able to use his size to impose a presence.
