Why did he call her husband to name Appy? She has ruined a big episode and so I can only give her six. A proper grammar and pronunciation are essential to a movie. It was very Hellraiser what with all the skin, but I do not know how someone can survive without skin, the skin is a vital organ for the body's largest organ of fact and without dying. The more a horror movie, the more creepy it can be even more fun. But I admit that the stories of the great horror directors are very disappointing and very mediocre. <br /> <br /> 6/10 Come on Yankies get English up to the hair!
