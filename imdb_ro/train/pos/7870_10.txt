The film is a true show of how superior society has become insignificant and selfish. He has a lot of characters and each character represents a different category of person. No character is 100% good and moral, unlike the heroes of all Indian movies and no character is 100% bad, but all are different. The film is a perfect mix of emotions, drama and entertainment. For the first time, I liked a movie that raised some social questions. I would recommend to everyone to see the movie. Madhavi Sharma is a journalist covering those Bollywood parties that shake hip-hop for the newspaper's publication, but that's the story of her becoming a crime reporter for the newspaper. But it's not everything, then it shows how she could not survive there and helped save innocent children, how brutal her suppressed voice is. Even she is pulled from work. Then he could not find a crime reporter job and he must do it again. Not only she, but a huge number of characters are interconnected in the movie and all offer different feelings while watching the movie. I would really congratulate the director for making such a great movie. Please do not allow yourself to miss.
