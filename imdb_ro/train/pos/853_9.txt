"Matador" sees Pierce Brosnan as a burning assassin. James Bond is gone to seed, in too tight, frightening clothes, in gold chains and ugly grooves. Our assassin fighter, Julian Noble, is in Mexico, trying to regain his nerve. Stay at the same hotel is a lucky businessman, Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear), who is trying to regain his balance. Danny is desperate to make a deal and return to his wife in Denver (Hope Davis) with good news. Noble and Wright are unexpected friends. Wright convinces Noble to reveal some techniques he demonstrates in a bullfight. Noble is finally targeted by his employers and is shown in Denver. <br /> <br /> Writer and director Richard Shepard made Q & A after this delightful film at the Austin Film Festival. Shepard has lost his fortune. After losing his agent and rejecting recent scenes, he decided to write a story that no one could buy and create a character no one would want to play. That's when Pierce Brosnan called. Brosnan regains his balance in this film. (There is life after Bond!) It has a wonderful flair for the comedy of self-deprecation. Do not miss. <br /> <br /> Stay close for credits to read what directors tell about bullfighting. I look forward to several of Richard Shepard's projects.
