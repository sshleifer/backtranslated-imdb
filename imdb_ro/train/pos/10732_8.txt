I saw this movie super. He did not surprise himself when the truth took place, thus, in itself, how tumultuous was the flight to which he did not take place, but is it just such a conspiratorial theory, Right? I really enjoyed watching this movie when I was the baby. I find it interesting that if it were proved that such a flight really took place, certainly for him because he is not a faith because he denies logic and common sense. Who in healthy senses, sent to children with space shuttle in orbit. I really like to read the subject, the US and Soviet space programs. I know some missions of the spacecraft left by the CIA with the TOP SECRET clause, surely these are just my divagations, but who knows?
