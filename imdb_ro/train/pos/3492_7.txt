It's not so bad a movie that I thought it would be. He has a cast.Nice good to see Roger Moore back on the screen as well as the use of other British actors. <br /> <br /> He would like to see more about Olivia D'Abo in future projects. She can play in front of her sexy cousin Maryam D'Abo. Also, good use of unseen locations such as Luxembourg. <Br /> <br /> We hope to see more of these British and European co-productions.
