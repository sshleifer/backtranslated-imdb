This was a movie I've heard about my whole life, but she has not seen her until a few years ago. Reputation is true. I knew about Michael Myers, I had seen the mask, I saw advertisements for all the subsequent doubts that followed. But I grew up in the decade when Jason and Freddy had a moral adherence to horror and did not think too much about the Halloween franchise. The boy, as we were cheated with cheaters. Halloween is a really scary movie. Now, according to today's standards, it is not so graphic and visceral, but this film offers all the other levels most horror films do not succeed today. The atmosphere that John Carpenter creates is so frightening, and being seated in a strange, mid-west city is a testament to his skills. The illumination effects are even frightening, with "The Shape" apparently appearing and disappearing into shadows at will. The simple yet brutal music adds to the suspense. The performances of all players are well done, with Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance specific knots. Mrs. Curtis is such a bunch of Laurie Strode, because she is so pleasant and vulnerable. It is all the more scary when pursued by Michael Myers, because the director and the spectator have invested so much in it, we want to survive and escape. Donald Pleasance plays Dr. Loomis a man on a mission, and works well. He adds a sense of urgency to the situation in which the city is located, because it knows how bad it crosses the streets. In general, Halloween is not only a horror movie but also a great movie. It works on several levels and attracts the audience and never leaves it. This should be standard viewing for anyone who wants to experience a really scary film. And for even worse, try to watch him alone with the lights turned off. Do not surprise yourself if you think you see "The Shape" hiding in the shadows!
