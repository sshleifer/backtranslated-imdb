Put it pretty simple, this movie is terrifying. It simply begins to look like a study of a young rebellious girl and continues to become a beautiful horror movie. <br /> <br /> Do not expect gore or zombies. This is psychological, and just as he does in Candyman, Bernard Rose manages to convey the horror that is not believed. Every time you watch this movie, you do more about what's happening and how the two worlds of this movie interconnect. Drawings have never been more frightening.
