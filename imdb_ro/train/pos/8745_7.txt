After graduating from high school, best friends Alice and Darlene decide to make a trip to Thailand. While there, I meet a charming Australian guy named Nick. After spending some time with Nick, he asks if they want to make a weekend trip to Hong Kong with him. They agree. However, at the airport, they are trapped for drug trafficking and then sentenced for 33 years to a Thai prison for something they say they did not. I do not really know what to do, he ends up in touch with Yankee Hank, an American lawyer who lives in Thailand with his wife. The word says that if you have the money, it can help you. Things are starting well, but they can not go out yet. The movie is very good because it does not leave what's going to happen and it's interesting all the time. I could not believe it was still over. It was one of those deadlines in which you do not know the 100% truth, but you still know what happened to Nick and drug smuggling because of "possession". Claire Danele and Kate Beckinsale are doing pretty good here. Beckinsales's performance was a bit weak. Both Danes and Beckinsales are good, but they may have seemed stronger. Paul Walker even has a little unbelievable role here. ;) Anyway, I thought Brokedown Palace was a good movie and I gave it 7/10.
