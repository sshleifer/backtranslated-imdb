Reign Over Me is a movie that will surely bring a tear to everyone's eyes. It was a moving story of a guy (sandler) who lost his family in the 9-11 shopping center attacks. Later, he enters an old college colleague (cheadle), which he does not even recognize because of the post-dramatic stress that resulted from the loss of his family. The two of them recapture Cheadle's old friendship and character, Johnson, realize they have to bring Sandler's character, Fineman, some help before it's too late. This was the first movie that made me cry for a long time. It's worth watching and after seeing it, I'm sure the spectator will appreciate the family much more.
