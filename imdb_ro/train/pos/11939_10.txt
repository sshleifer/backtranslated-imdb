I have always liked this great baseball movie! She has a good cast, including two extraordinary actors and two of my favorites Danny Glover and Christopher Lloyd! Also in this film are Ben Johnson, Brenda Fricker, Big Tony Longo, Tony Danza and Matthew McConaughey! Also, Jay O. Sanders and Dermot Mulroney! The film has special special effects and works from all the actors in the movie! Baseball scenes are all realistic! Randy Edelman's music is very good and matches the movie very well! Some of the actors who reminded me of the current baseball personalities. Stoney Jackson's Ray Mitchell's character reminded Me Royce Clayton, McConaughey's character reminded me of Steve Finley and commentator Jay O. Sanders, in my opinion, like Al Hrabosky's. This is a fantastic movie for non-and baseball fans and I strongly recommend this movie!
