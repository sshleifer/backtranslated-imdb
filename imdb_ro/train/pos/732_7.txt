Well, finally, I got to "High School Rock 'n' Roll" almost 30 years after it became for the first time the sensation of midnight movie in 1979. (Latecomer that I am, I will probably see the first summer documentary this summer "Patti Smith: The Dream of Life" around 2040!) And no, the movie does not feel dated and, yes, it deserves the expectation. This is a very energetic comedy, featuring lots of great music and surprising moments. She tells the story of Riff Randell, adorably interpreted by P.J. Soles, and the fight she and her colleagues from Vince Lombardi High have welcomed against their new repressive director, Miss Togar. (Danny Peary, in his book "Cult Films," describes Mary Woronov's exegesis quite well as "evil Eva Arden.") A typical line of adolescents towards the lines of creation is multiplied here with absurd humor (those mice that explodes, that giant mouse, the monitors in Hansel and Gretel) and some truly delightful songs. Riff is, of course, the # 1 fan of the original punk band The Ramones, and this band finds a dozen of the bass's greatest songs throughout the movie, including five at a concert that is a total explosion. Indeed, Riff's view of angry dancing on "Adolescent Lobotomy" at this explosion may be the funniest of the picture. And the initial appearance of Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee and Marky in their Ramonesmobile, and later descending on a street singing "I just wanna have something to do," is quite exhilarating. The film ends with an explosive confrontation, which is, I would imagine, the wet dream of every high school kid. A funny thing. On a side note, The Ramones was one of the most powerful bands I've ever seen in concert, so I was very amused to see that the DVD for this movie comes with optional English subtitles for people with hearing impairment. How many elderly penguins have found these necessary subtitles, I wonder ...
