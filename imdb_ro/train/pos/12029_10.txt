I like the movie. Twisted Desire had Jeremy Jordan, one of my favorites and one of the most dear actors ever. Melissa Joan Hart is a good actress. I've seen most of his films, but all of Jeremy Jordan's. The thing he does not like for "Twisted Desire" is when "Nick" is arrested and "Jennifer" escapes him. Twisted Desire is your second favorite movie. My first is The Goonies. But I still love Jeremy Jordan.
