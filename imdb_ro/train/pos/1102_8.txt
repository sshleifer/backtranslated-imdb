In Manhattan, American middle class Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) lives with his wife Muriel (Myrna Loy) and two teenage daughters in a four-bedroom apartment and a single rented apartment. Jim is working in an advertising agency that earns $ 15,000 a year and feels uncomfortable in his apartment due to lack of space. When he sees an advertising ad of a huge sale house in Connecticut at an affordable price, he leads with his wife and real estate agent and decides to buy the old house without any technical advice. Best friend and lawyer Bill Cole (Melvyn Douglas) sends a knowledge engineer to inspect the house and the man says he should put the house and build another building. Jim checks the information with other engineers, and everyone condemns the place, and earlier he learns that he has bought a "hole of money" instead of a dream house. "Mr. Blandings builds his own home" is a very funny comedy, with enchanted lines and a top scenario. Cary Grant is hilarious in the role of a man who moves by the impetus of realizing with the American dream of having a huge house that finds that he made a bad choice while losing his touch in his work and feeling jealous of his boyfriend . In 1986, Tom Hanks worked in a very entertaining, visually inspired film in this delightful classic, The Money Pit. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Lar, Meu Tormento" ("Home, My Torment")
