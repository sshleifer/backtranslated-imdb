Another fun RKO musician, full of spirit, scared with Astaire and Rogers, FOLLOW THE FLEET is a charming movie. While missing the extraordinary moments of the song SWNG TIME (although the final score "Make the music and dance" is one of the best and most accurate teams of the team), it is extremely enjoyable because they could not do anything wrong together 1930 Once again, the plot is easy and forgetful, but watching Fred and Dance Ginger together is sky heaven. These two have transmitted more romance and magic to dance than many couples in the movies make in a scene of immense love. While Fred and Ginger are better, this is certainly a must.
