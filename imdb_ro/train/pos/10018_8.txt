This Night Listener is better than people say in general. She has weaknesses and seems to have a gender identity crisis, no doubt, but I think her creepy atmosphere and intriguing performances do so. Everything feels like one of those fire shots "this happened to a friend of my friend" ghost stories. A big film complaint is rhythm: but the slow and sometimes uncomfortable pace is deliberate. Everything that unfolds in this movie is kept well in the realm of possibility, and real life is just a kind of fetus over time? Not? So, there is no flashy purpose or scattered scattering of the earth, no "showdown" scene. Thanks to Heaven. You need to get into the area when watching this movie, forget your reservations and expectations of what makes a good (conventional) movie. Williams is not great, but he manages to respond easily to the story needs, plus his character should be somewhat generic ("no one"), because he is Everyman, the avatar through which we enter the story. Toni Collette's performance should be nominated for Oscar (even if she should not win her). Try. Just for quality and content, The Night Listener is surely the top twenty percent of movies coming out today.
