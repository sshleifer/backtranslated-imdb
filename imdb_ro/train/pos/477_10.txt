Hi All I am a chess enthusiast from the age of 6. I suppose I'm pretty obsessed with chess, but hopefully not as much as the central character of this movie. In this film, the character reflects a true chess player named Curt von Bardeleben who committed suicide in 1924. He is famous for a game he played against Steinitz, where a beautiful combination was played by Steinitz. Instead of giving up, he simply came out of the tournament room without ever coming back. The social inability of the central character is, unfortunately, a treat of some of the most serious Grandmasters you sometimes get in chess tournaments. Chess assumes that it is a very great sacrifice and sometimes you can reach imbalance in other areas of life. An important example is the legend of Chess Bobby Fischer. Although a genius, he was also very disturbed in many ways. In the film, there is a world championship match between an Italian Grandmaster and Luzhin. Format is a knockout, which, in fact, the governing body of the Fide world has sometimes used as a format itself - ranging from 128 players to just 2 in the final. But this was a group knockout - which also describes a realistic format, where the winners of each group play against each other. Position before postpone makes for a fascinating chess puzzle itself. Actually, I made a video on YouTube about it, so you can explore the winning combination in detail - enjoy! http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=XZPtdtPhwdM Best Wishes Tryfon
