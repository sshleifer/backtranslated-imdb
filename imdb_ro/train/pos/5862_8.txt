There is not much happening in this story - only two men use very different ways of treating memories in Vietnam. But what he lacks in the premise is much more than he does in acting and realism. It's a quiet film about friendship and shared experiences. We even have romanticism (it's not free - just another very real piece of this story). It's good to see.
