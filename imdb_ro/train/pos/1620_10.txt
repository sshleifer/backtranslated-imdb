So wonderful, so strange, so romantic that Italian. The film is so brilliant that you are floating in your refractory reality and you never want to go back to humble again. A world of kitchen sinks, patisseries and sanitary facilities, but shining with soft luminescence. If the credit goes to the scenario or in the direction? Take your choice - both are perfect. Let me go back to that New York city just beyond the glass.
