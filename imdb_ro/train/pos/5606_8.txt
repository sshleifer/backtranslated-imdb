This is a very difficult film, and it's almost impossible to figure out what's going on. At first, it seems like a pretty pedestrian film about a guy (Trelkovsky) who needs an apartment and rather invest in one when the current tenant (a woman) sucks. Then the overturns begin. Are the neighbors trying to kill him? And why did the tenant's clothes return to the apartment? One wonders, finally, whether Trelkovksy is the previous tenant. <br /> <br /> SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER One of the tricks that Polanski attracts is to lie to us. Suppose that when we see things from the point of view of a character we see things as the character and that there may be distortions of reality. We suppose when the camera shows things in its all-embracing view that we see the actuality - but Polanski has our own liar room.
