"Yes, Georgio" is a movie / comedy with heart and pleasure, containing beautiful settings and beautiful music. It's not my favorite movie, but it's a movie I liked to see many times. Some commentators have suggested that if someone wants to enjoy Pavarotti, it would be better to have an opera DVD. Although a full work might be a better representation of Pavarotti's opera talents, often a work requires costumes and has story lines that completely hide the appearance and nature of the person. "Yes, Georgio" allows Pavarotti to use his voice speaking and display a personality and character in the way a work is not. Many commentators seemed to find the unbelievable story; I disagree. The enormously talented people can be both sincere and charming, charming enough to capture intelligent and beautiful people. In addition, people who are very different from others often acquire knowledge about themselves and grow in positive ways from interacting with people who stretch them or take them in directions that they could not have chosen themselves. Both Georgio and Pamela become more open to their unexplored parts in relation to each other. Relax and let yourself get into a visual and festive film rewarded with Pavarotti at the top of his vocal skills. Puccini's final scenes from Turandot deserve the time to get there.
