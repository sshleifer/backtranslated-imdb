Terry Gilliam offers an amazing movie, which I enjoyed a lot. Bruce Willis, Madeline Stowe, Brad Pitt, and even Christopher Plummer's little face make the film brilliant! This is the only Terry Gilliam movie I've seen, and Twelve Monkeys is certainly in the top 10. I think this is one of Bruce Willis's four best movies; and Brad Pitt's best. Brad Pitt offers perfect performance. Probably one of the performances of the best actor I've ever seen. He played his role (Geoffrey) very convincingly. The role of Bruce Willis (James Cole) was also quite convincing. Both Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt acted extraordinarily well. With the brilliant story to support the great shows; and to support this, the terrific director of Terry Gilliam.
