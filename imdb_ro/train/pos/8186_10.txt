I like Satan Pith! David Tennant is such a big actor and so is Billie Piper! Who loves Will Thorp in pieces ??? It's so cute, is not it? I hated the bits in which he was possessed by the devil and where he was told to "go to hell," as Rose said so. Remember, it was very funny when he said, "Rose, do us a favor, are not we? Shut up!" Mr. Jefferson was so brave, was not he? He dies to save the others. I'm really sorry for Toby (Will Thorp) when he left for the second time because he was so scared. I was like, "Oh my god, if I were Rose, I would be so scared for him." And when he embraced him, I was like "grrrrrr, it's mine, but I thought it was very sweet." And the doctor ... well, I thought he'd tell Ida "tell Rose I love her "but it did not.
