Jeff Wincott is not just a Hunk, he can hit his head! This movie has some of the best martial arts movements that I have seen in a very long time. Okay, maybe Bridgette Nielson is not the first person I'm going to hire to play a ruthless politician, but he did a really big job! And let's not forget that Wincott has a partner in this movie, played by martial arts expert Keller Sheperd. So she is not Cynthia Rothrock, who? It's just as good, if not better! (just check the scene of his fight at the end of the movie, a word: OUCH !!). My suggestion would be to buy this movie as soon as possible, because if you have not seen it, you are really lacking a great action of martial arts.
