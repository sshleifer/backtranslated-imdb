A very good start. I was a little surprised to find cars that were not so advanced: it should have been more cruel to fit with what I saw in the original series. The cast is interesting, though Mrs. Vulkan meets a little too human. He needs Spock school, which, after all, is the model of this race. Too bad he could not have chosen Jeri Ryan. I like Mrs. Park, the Korean lady (?). The doctor has possibilities. You did not divorce the other men except the black guy. It's very nice. Bakula has to find a niche - In QL his strong point was his sense of humor and his desire to try anything. He is, of course, quite big and powerful for heroism. Heavy were OK, although I did not like makeup.
