And a movie made for television, this movie was good. acting in it and the plot was just as great. this one movie I've seen has hurt my mind, because after seeing it I was afraid Reaper was going to kill me through my computer screen. There were only a few minor things wrong with this movie, but it's very easy to look at. Antonio Sabbato Jr had an excellent role in this film with Janine Turner and Robert Wagner. this movie just has so much suspense and made me want more because I never thought that a low-budget TV movie could be so strong. After seeing this, I read the novel on which the film is based (four times) and it was too big. If you ever see this movie on the TV, I'll follow it. The effects of this movie were pretty good, I really do not know what a living calcifier would look like, but with the way the FX team made this film, I was impressed and all that shows is that all this made for the movies there with small budgets should not suck so bad. It's really good, not really, it is!
