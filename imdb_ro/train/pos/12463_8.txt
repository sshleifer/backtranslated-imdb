Nora is a single mother who wants to live the life of a young artist in the 1970s, just like her friends, a group of writers, singers and actors. Is the philosophy of "free love" not quite out of the system? and Nora did not rely on falling into love, especially with a drug addict. Hazlehurst won her first AFI Award in four years for the wonderful portrayal of Nora, who makes sure that she does the right thing for her kids, but falls in love with Javo (Friels) junkie at the same time. Garner? who would cost later in movies like "LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROFE" and "STRANGE PLANET"? is well interpreted as Nora's pre-pubertal daughter, and Caton (probably waiting for her role as host of the HOT PROPERTY style program in 2000) appears as a bearded painter. Cameron's early effort is a winner; he continued to premiere the MY BROTHER JACK miniseries among his later projects. But it is the amazing delivery by Hazlehurst that brings to life the intelligent, searcher script based on the award-winning novel by Helen Garner.
