Mother is one of those movies you know is good, maybe wonderful, but it's like eating vegetables or doing math homework for a child - too much work and a lot of pain to be invested. <br /> <br /> The story is potentially disagreeable in many ways: the death of a character in the first half an hour, the romance of December-May, the idea of ​​a man cheating his wife and then cheating his lover with his mother, collecting the poor and fairly unpleasant characters of thirty, the apparent indifference of adults towards the children of their lives. This film was made in 2002 or 2003, but it's a throwback back to a collection of British movies (usually made for television) in the late 1980s - has a moral severity that never leaves, which produces an aggression full of beats. <br /> <br /> My mother is impeccable, but that is partly the problem; if a movie that deals with so many delicate issues has some flaws - inconsistencies of the scenario, some less actors - take the magnitude, but if such a movie is so perfect, the experience of looking is brutal and painful. Even the technical qualities - enlightenment, editing, etc. - I do the audience's pain; London in this film is bright and open, filled with sharp, cutting light. If you are tough as a nail, or are one of those super-sensitive people who like to torture with gut-wrenching sad movies or novels, then you will enjoy the Mother. Any one of them, give it a wish or be ready to overthrow. And be warned: as tough as the movie is from the beginning to the end of the year, the worst is to come. Towards the end of the movie, her mother asks her daughter what she can do to sleep because she slept with her boyfriend, and her daughter says calmly that she thought about it and wanted to hit her. My mother agrees with it, both stand up and - instead of a well-received hand - the daughter squeezes her fist and kicks the boxer. Brrr !!!
