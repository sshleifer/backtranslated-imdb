This is an extraordinary movie about looking for happiness in everyday life. Pacing, camera work, emotion, the musical score that haunts, and the pure charm of this image make him to be seen. It is not easily appreciated by those aging or emotionally shot. The only defect I can see about this film is that it was not captured in a more technically perfect film format. It deserved Todd-AO, Technicolor and the best available sound format. (An intimate film can be made in seventy millimeters.) The impressive Italian villa on its inhabitants would have turned more and the wonderful moments would be even more beautiful seen and heard. Indeed, it requires attention as a sweet film on the move. I can not stop watching him every time he comes on the satellite. The transformation of characters from contained, tight and distrustful are always a joy to watch and I should even recommend it more often. Casting is perfect, mood is perfect, action is beyond reproach. It's a middle-aged movie and the choices people make. He is profound and caring, without beating the spectator with his heavy hand. Look at her in one session and let her have an effect on you. If you fail, you probably have not lived enough, or something is wrong with you.
