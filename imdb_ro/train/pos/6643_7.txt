When I heard that movie was coming out at night before Halloween, I was very excited. When I found out that it was a book written in 1978, I had to read it before watching the movie. I'm sure the movie would have been a lot different from me if I did not read the book. The writers actually did a good job of staying true in the main compilation of the book, with minor differences, of course. I think the thing that disappointed me most about the film was Boyle playing Col. I'm not a big fan of Boyle and it seems that regardless of the movie's state of mind, she always tries to use her - lips full of lips and eyes with dark makeup to make it super sexy. Indeed, I think the movie has kept the real fury of the house. My favorite sub-plot was the Sheehan family (which is so odd that the son was killed in Iraq, and Casey Sheehan, whose mother has gone on a huge anti-Iraqi tirade) is present. Clearly, the war was not Iraq, but rather Vietnam, and when the house turns into that son's movie on the helicopter, I was really dragged. On the whole, I was impressed by the film, that the book was very good.
