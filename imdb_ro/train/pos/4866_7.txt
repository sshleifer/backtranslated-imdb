First, in the defense of JOAN FONTAINE, it must be said that Ginger Rogers would have been terribly mischievous as Alyce, the young British who plays the lead role. Fontaine makes a heroic picture here, but her experience of experience is stupid and her dance is better left unsigned. Fortunately, she went to better things. But here are FRED ASTAIRE, GEORGE BURNS and GRACIE ALLEN who receive the top billing - and they are excellent. Burns & Allen's fans will be surprised at how easily they fall into the routines of Astaire's dance. Especially interesting is the fun routine, which won a choreographer choreographer Hermes Pans an Oscar. They join Astaire in what must be the most inventive aspect of the film. Unfortunately, we can not say too much about the slow pace of the story - nor about some outdated situations that require a lot of patience from the viewer. It has to be said that some of the humor descends and the usual romantic misunderstandings that occur in any Fred Astaire film of this period are treated conventionally. Only musical interludes give the story of the elevator he needs. Some nice songs by Gershwin appear once, but not everyone gets the treatment they deserve. The most beautiful supporting piece is Reginald Gardiner, at the best comic show, Conniving Servant Constance Collier and Montagu Love (Joan's father as wrong as a gardener of Astaire). whenever Burns & Allen are around to remind us how funny they were on radio and television. Both are surprisingly adept at keeping up with Astaire's work. Director George Stevens ensures that Joan Fontaine's Fred's dance number is filmed at a discreet distance, but the intelligent work of the room can not hide the fact that she is not part of her as a dance partner of Astaire, to be painful.
