I really enjoy this show. That's why I was disappointed by the fact that I recently found out that George Lopez was a racist and that he fired Masiela Lusha from the show simply because he discovered he was not a Latin emigrant but was an immigrant from Albania. I learned this from the people on the show. She was indeed one of the best parts of the show and thus found out that even among those who think they would be racist, that they can hate someone just because of the country they were born in , is indeed disappointing.
