Hollywood Time To Stay And Take Note! If the actors act snooty, all you have to do is get the animators who have worked on this wonderful wonder. Renaissance is probably the first animation that makes you forget that you are not seeing human beings. Although cast cast (Craig, McCormack, Pryce, etc.) are some of the best I ever heard, but even then the emotions portrayed by "cartoons" are disturbing. This style of animation is not very new, but the use of light and shadows makes the film a living painting. Ironically, such a technical witchcraft makes you forget that this is actually a very beautiful movie. The development of the rhythm and the plot is wonderful, and the dialogues are clear. Pleasure: The disappearance of a top employee of a mega corporation reveals a story of deception and corruption with a cold heart-to-heart hero. I can not say too much without giving everything away ... except that while the movie keeps you at the edge of the chair, the climax leaves you speechless. He must watch even for "adults" who smirk at "cartoons"
