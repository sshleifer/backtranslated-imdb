I was not sure when I heard about it. I was thinking how stupid Disney was. I was wrong. I found it very good. I mean, it's not Lion King, but it's good to see another part of a certain point. It was very funny. Also was not one of those Disney Disney sequels were the animated souls, it was like the animation of The Lion King. The only thing that aroused me was the movie of the whole theater movie. Do not give anything, but you'll know what I'm talking about. I also have fun that it was great to give most of the distribution of the original to come back. It was a very good movie everywhere.
