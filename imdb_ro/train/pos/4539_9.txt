The act is pretty cheese, but for people in this area until the 80's and now they are engineers at Detroit car, this is a great movie. I'm really working with a Japanese vendor, so this movie is even more funny. Jay Leno showed her last night on The Tonight Show! He looks pretty young here ... 17 years ago. The opening scene, with the pull on what looks like Woodward Ave was great. <br /> <br /> Leno also owns bad cars ** now, it would be great to see a remake of this with its modern Collection pattern. I'm sure Vette was a car. Watch and enjoy yourself. No Computer Shit!
