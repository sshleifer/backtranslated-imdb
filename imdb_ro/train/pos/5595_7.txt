Polanski returns to the themes of loneliness and madness he explored for an extraordinary effect in Rosemary's Repulsive and Child in Tenant. The atmosphere is the Polanski brand - dark, frightening, nervous - but there is something weird about this movie and I'm not sure if it's deliberate or not. Sven Nykvist, who was responsible for some of Bergman's finest films, is not right here. As his name was one of the things that really attracted me to this film, I was a little disappointed by how few cinematic cinemas are really impressive in the film. The only thing that lets the film down is the act. Polanski is certainly not a bad actor but seems to have bitten more than he can chew with Trelkovsky's difficult role. Some of the support distributions are great, especially Melvyn Douglas as owner and Shelley Winters as concierge, but others are lean and miscast. It is also difficult to overlook the fact that all these alleged Parisians have American accents. Quite unexpectedly, there are some fine moments of dark comedy in the movie. Anyone who saw The Fearless Vampire Killers knows that Polanski is certainly a good comedic actor. However, there are times when he slips dangerously close to being a parody of himself. Trelkovsky, the sudden (and somewhat unexplained) transformation is more likely to generate chuckles than eyebrows, which escapes what should have been a strong moment in his psycho-dramatic journey. In total, The Tenant is a pleasant and exciting experience if she is a little too commendable for her good. There are a lot of exceptional cooling moments and a consistent and inconvenient atmosphere, but this film, while very good, does not hit the mark successfully. Polanski's "good" movie is still better than most "good" movies. Definitely worth a watch, do not expect to suffocate.
