Arguebly the best role of Al Pacino. He plays the role of Tony Montana, a small hood from Cuba, transformed into a great powerful killer from Miami, and he does it with the two things he has in this world with his balls and his word and does not break "for (Robert Loggia), and quickly climbs alongside his long-time friend, Manny (Steven Bauer), and soon he has an eye for his sexy wife of the boss Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer) After Frank sees a threat from Tony for his position, trying to assassinate Tony, but without luck, Tony is upset and nothing can stop him now. the best among them is F. Murray Abraham as a jumble gangster, another known girl is Harris Yulin as a scary policeman trying to shake Tony to marry Elizabeth Mastrantonio as a young sister of Tony. by Oli This movie is one of Brian DePalma's brightest points in his long career of downs and downs, you can see that this guy is very talented. The film has a magnificent look on it. Also pay attention to two memorable scenes: The one at the fancy restaurant ("Say good night for the bad guy"). the other is the last shots in which Tony shows he still knows how to hit his ass and kills about 20 assassins who invaded them in the house. this is certainly one of the most impressive endings of a movie I've ever seen. For Al Pacino fans and crimes, we have to see. For your rest is highly recommended. 10/10
