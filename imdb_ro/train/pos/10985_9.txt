I was speechless and devastated after my first view of this - many parts of GREEN GARDENS are very funny and incredibly surreal - documentary of not, this gives Fellini or David Lynch a run for their money in strange bets. I focused on how these women (who are clinically over-eccentric) reveal their own humanity in the most surprising ways and wonder if their withdrawal from the world was determined by something beyond the humiliation of life in the blood unreal blue the universe, maybe an abuse, or maybe simply a series of defiance and rebellion that spiraling out of their control and took a life of its own life. This could be one of the biggest movies in history that comes almost exploitously without going over the edge - as did the Edies stuff, I noticed things like hollow empty bottles in the gravel bedroom, cats urinating on the bed , racoons coming out of the holes in the walls, and the final scene seemed incredibly sad - the birthday party of a child died seriously. It's definitely worth seeing and looking - you will never forget, but very disturbing.
