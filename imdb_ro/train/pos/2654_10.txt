Everyone should see this movie totally! He is scary scary but he does not resort to "just as frightening" things that are "just as frightening." It's really great. See this wonderful extraordinary movie! The director is Stanley Kubrick, easily the greatest director who ever lived. Each of his films is masterpieces, including this one. Shining is about this family going to a Colorado Rockies hotel as winter caretakers and neighboring. Well, the house is haunted. The child is psychic. The husband is easily affected by the haunted hotels, and ... well ... HILARITY FACE !!!! Not realy. It becomes this captivating thriller where things are thrown to the spectator from all different directions, and it becomes scary. Not just the classic, "Here's Johnny." It's memorable, but she can not talk for the whole movie. It's one of those things that words do not explain properly and you have to see it. So go on Netflix and take it! GEEEEEETTTTTTTT ITTTTTTTT !!!!!!!
