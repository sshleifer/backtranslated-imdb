David Duchovney creates a role that he has to say to some extent in Californication - the troubled talent. And it is a role that plays well. This thriller starts at a good speed and goes all the way. Timothy Hutton plays a villain and Angelina Jolie. The story of a dreadful doctor who finds his way into a criminal world is well scripted. Drug dependence and the desire for Jolie Jolie mix a bad cocktail. Unfortunately, the story becomes a bit weaker, and the relationship between the criminals and the FBI is embarrassed and hurried as if they were only created to develop the final scene. But, by the way, a movie worth seeing.
