I first saw this movie at the Sundance Film Festival this year, and as a teenager myself I found the film to be quite appealing. these children are out of order and very unexpected to be in a movie of this stature, but with proper dialogue and junk they made the film a complete success. I enjoyed this film more than others, but I highly recommend releasing and watching this movie. is a mixture of comments full of witchcraft and hilarious reality. capturing the essence of high school, lyceum has gone beyond the favorite list and hopefully has a chance to be released in theaters. I really thank all the children who have done the work to make this movie, helped me cry out of our laughing eyes.
