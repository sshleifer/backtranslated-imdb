Malefique has pretty much the viewer, from start to finish, with the atmosphere shaken. Almost the entire film is placed in a prison cell that rotates around four characters, of which the transgressor Marcus and his little retarded boy are much stranger. Soon, the detainees find a diary of a former prisoner behind the brick, dealing with his obsession with occult and black magic themes that led to his escape from the cell. From here everything deals with discovering the secret of the book and its spells of escaping from prison. This leads to some accidents on the way out of the cell in the unknown light. Honestly, I think the story is pretty weak and the final twist is nice, but for me the heads are pretty tightly connected. Anyway, I was delighted until the last moment, because the atmosphere of the film is unique, with minimal settings and distribution. The killing is brutal and weird ... it does not have the gore to cool your spine, and the occult themes are also very good and they reminded me of Hellraiser hell themes. Malefique has a dull, claustrofob and cold feel with greenish shades. Sometimes you ask yourself whether the real world or occult world described here is more foreign ... when the late boy loses his fingers and is left to sleep sucking Marcus' breasts, it is normal, and how strange can the gates of freedom? With its budget, the film creates a unique atmosphere and frizes the viewer in a very different way from the one that most of the gender shocks make. I just want the story to have led to a more consistent end. Some elements such as the visitor with the camera, the other obsessions of card inmates and the toy doll that looks vaguely to the end do not fit tightly into the story. Anyway, I will open my eyes for other films from director Valette, though a stop to see that he is making a remake from Hollywood about "A Lost Call" that was already used and useless in the Miike version.
