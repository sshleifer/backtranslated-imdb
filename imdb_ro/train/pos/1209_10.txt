In an era of such cartoons, I'm rather shocked to see a movie with a morality so good as to get to the IMDB background list for animated films. This film contradicts the first film. I will not deny this. However, when I was in the target age group for this movie, I did not even notice and would not matter if I did. People who did it may have used the "New Generation" to see that this is another way the caregiver could start. Maybe we're meant to decide for us how the Care Bear really started. This was my favorite film at the age of 3-6 years, and I'm not scared to bother me at all. <Br /> <br />
