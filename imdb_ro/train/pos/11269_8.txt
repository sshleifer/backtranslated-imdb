Have you ever wondered how much Hollywood could escape before the Hayes Code was officially implemented? Unfortunately, "City of Convention" is lost, so just look at "Tarzan and Matthew" to find out. For 1934, there is a remarkable amount of sexual innuendo and even exposed meat. Look at Jane's nude. While Tarzan is often thought of as b-adventure movies for young boys and no one else, this image proves that the series was initially very adult. Seventy years later, she's still as sexy as when she left. In addition to the envelope pushing taboo nature, it's a wonderful and exciting adventure story. I have always liked the jungle movies that Hollywood has thrown in the 30's and 40's, but there are few of the genres I'll call great movies. "Tarzan and Matthew" is by far the best film in this subgenre long gone. Sequences of attacks on either monkey or native safari are still creating tensions today. Animals are too cool (for example, monkeys throwing boulders). The act will not soon win important prizes, but it is certainly more than adequate for this type of image. The film is stolen again by Ghepard, the smartest monkey in the jungle. One of the most fun examples of Hollywood pre-code there.
