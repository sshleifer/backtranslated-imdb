I do not know why some guys in the US, Georgia or even in Bulgaria have the courage to express their feelings about something I do not understand at all. For those who have not watched this movie - look at it. Do not wait too long or put some frames just because it is Kosturica. Watch the film without prejudice, try to understand the whole humor from the inside - the people of Serbia actually married, while Bil Clinton bombs their villages, Gypsies from all the Balkans ALWAYS strive to wear you in whatever way, LOVE is always unexpected, pure and colorful, and the Balkans are extremely creative. For those who claim that this is a bad movie I can only see that the American Sh * t (like Meet Dave, Get Smart, etc.) is much worse than an honest, franc film, a Balkan love story, like Promite- me. The comment should be useful, and the second place should be the writer's personal vision. I think the movie is great and people forget that they have to respect the director and the story inside him. It's simple, but true. It's brutal but delicate and makes you laugh at the dead.
