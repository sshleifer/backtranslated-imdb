Spanish movies are in gold, if not in a silver age. Pi√©dras is another example of a movie that takes people and their conflicts seriously. Although feelings are strong or near life or death, they are still not truly melodramatic. This could happen. There are different stories here that connect. One is a retarded girl who does not dare to cross the street in the next block. One is about the middle-aged woman who finds the lover of her life in a foot fetishist. Another is about a drug problem girl the boyfriend leaves. There is still one about the madam of a brothel who (almost) finds true love. It is certainly worth seeing. In Spain, directors take the women seriously.
