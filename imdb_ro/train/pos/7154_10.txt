I found out about the movie "Holes," hearing people say it was not a typical Disney, that both children and adults entered the story. People, let me tell you I was not disappointed. "Holes" is based on Louis Sachar's novel and follows the adventure of Stanley Yelnats, a boy sent to a strange juvenile detention camp in the desert. He is friends with a nicknamed Zero boy and together they are heading for the adventures that change their lives. It was a very interesting, unique, different and fun story. I did not know exactly what to expect when I looked at it. It was interesting that the story come together as puzzle pieces. The boys who played juvenile delinquents were very funny and Jon Voight was just hilarious as Mr. Sir. Now that I've seen the movie, I have to read the book. Most Recommended!
