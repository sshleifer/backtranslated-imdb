I looked up Scooby and I was a fan forever. This cartoon moves away from the same old routine, which can become boring for viewers. Growth in mask routine becomes old and this cartoon is a change from that. It is not meant to replace the Scooby gang is just a break from the same scene of the old crime for both viewers and writers. I'm sure. The cartridge focuses on Scooby and Shaggy, who inherits a large amount of money and uses the money to counter the plans to conquer the world from a mad scientist and goons. Little tribute to the band and the group is being made from time to time. If you are a fan of Scooby-Doo, you can still appreciate the connection between a boy and his dog, along with the jokes that come with him. Enjoy Cartoon only and support creators / writers and producers so that it is not the last Cartoon Scooby.
