This has to be one of the best movies about the serial killers I've ever seen, and that comes from someone who absolutely loved the Silence of the Lambs. HBO hit the jackpot here. This movie is convincing from the first moment to the last. This movie has so many difficult topics to tell exactly what it is. Chronicle of ten-year search for Russian serial killer Andrea Chikatilo. Stephen Rea gives a brilliantly reserved show as the inexperienced forensic expert who is in charge of the investigation, and Donald Sutherland performs more closely as his cynical superior and the only person in the Russian government who wants to help him. Both shows are capricious subjects --- Rea starts na√Øve and does not want to make compromises, while Sutherland starts to get away and almost amused by the situation. Towards the end of the year, Rea gets tired and beaten by the system, while Sutherland feels more passionate and idealistic. In any other film, I would have said that Sutherland's performance rises above the rest, but right here is rivaled by Jeffrey DuMann, the serial killer himself. DuMann brilliantly creates a character that inspires empathy rather than hate that we think we will find --- he is a monster but he does not want to be and we have the idea that he is just as disgusted with what he does as we are . He is tortured, ashamed, but also vicious. If you can get the incredibly dark subject (and it's very disturbing) then you should see this movie.
