The third Muppet movie is perhaps the most relaxed and enjoyable, with a band that takes its modest music to brilliant (but volatile) lights on Broadway full of typically naive optimism. Of course, their first attempt fails and Kermit (the group leader and the author of the show) hits the tip; so the others go all their separate ways so that he will not have to feel responsible for them. Kermit himself makes friends with a young fashion designer who meets with his father's restaurant (the old man has a particularly tortuous nonsense line!). We get the usual cameo appearances by a variety of stars: Art Carney (as producer), James Coco (as an exaggerated dog owner), Dabney Coleman (as a tricky truver), Elliott Gould (who was also in the MUPPET movie [1979], Gregory Hines, Liza Minnelli (herself portraying herself at a classic restaurant replaced by Kermit's fake mustache, as a frequently-labeled entrepreneur to attract advertising to the Muppets show), Brooke Shields, and even the director John Landis (probably in the funniest scene of the film as a Broadway producer, in front of whom Kermit appears acting in the street and in funny and nail clothes and a wig Afro!). The other Muppets more or less go through their typical steps with this (unfortunately) less space given to Gonzo this time; while Miss Piggy is something of a taste with me, scenes in which the latter spies on what Kermit's romanticism wishes to be with the waitress? and especially her violent reaction to that? are unquestionably funny. What is disappointing is the climatic event (after a rather redundant middle section where Kermit gets amnesia and eventually promotes advertising on Madison Avenue), which, rather than the expected routines, offers nothing more original than the wedding ceremony Kermit and his eternal flame Miss Piggy!
