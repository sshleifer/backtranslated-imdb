As a biographical film, "The Red-haired Lady" (the story of how director / producer / playwright David Belasco turned Ms. Leslie Carter, a notorious company divorced into an international star) is not in a league with Warner's biopic "Yankee Doodle Dandy" (what is it?), But "Lady" is a nice movie in itself - and shares a few features in common with the classic Cagney. <br /> <br /> Like "Yankee Doodle Dandy", "Lady With Hair Red" sneaks with the old-fashioned show-business. (Among other things, both films feature delicious theater scenes, as well as the inevitable scenes behind the scenes and the theater managers' offices.) Also in the Lady as well as in the Cohan Biopic, the supported distribution consists of familiar and loved character characters of the period, all doing some sort of first-rate work that we remember. <br /> <br /> I have to add that again like "Yankee Doodle Dandy," "Lady with red hair" does not let the truth say a good story? But, like "Dandy", "Lady" succeeds - glorious! - to convey the essence of his personal life greater than the life of the giant show-business hero. Everyone knows that Cagney has cleared Cohan forever in his portrait "Yankee Doodle Dandy" - but some movie lovers realize that Claude Rains has done a similar service to David Belasco in "The Lady With Hair Red" with a panache that is almost equal to that of Cagney. Rains-as-Belasco captures perfectly the galvanic personality of the showman in all his exaggerated glory. Rains offers a tremendously enjoyable, spectacular and remarkably realistic performance, as the man Broadway once called The Wizard. To watch Claude Rains in action (looking every shot as if he had a good time!) In "The Lady With Hair Red" is to see David Belasco jumping on the film as if he can not wait to shake things on the Main Staff once more. <br /> <br />
