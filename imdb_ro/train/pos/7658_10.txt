<br /> <br /> I've seen this movie many times. At least a dozen. But, unfortunately, not recently. However, Etched in my memory never let me down is a scene in which Mickey Rooney, - "Killer Mears" knows that he is going to be executed and is approaching the moment of truth, He dancing, crying and laughing, he vacillates from hesteria to euphoria and lead the gambit of emotion ever. I have never seen such a brilliant performance of any live or dead actor, past or present. Then I was sure Mickey Rooney, yes, "Andy Hardy" was and is a great genius actor. However, I have kept it, my opinion for me for years, thinking, I certainly have to be alone in this respect. Almost 15 years after I saw this movie for the last time on TV, I tried to read the old Q & A section of the Los Angeles Times. The question was put to Lawrence Olivier and the question was: "Mr. Olivier Did you consider one of the greatest actors of all time, which you then consider to be among the biggest actors?" His answer was: "Peter Finch and Mickey Rooney." I was amazed, but I was not surprised. I immediately returned to Killer Mears and felt very good because I saw this great skill in him and now he supported the opinion of someone else I admired. Later there was "Bill" moments with Mikey Rooney. This film, "The Last Mile", should be seen by all students who act. Frankly, I do not remember much about the movie after these years, but Mr. Rooney in him will never leave me. If anyone in there remembers this movie just like me? I would be interested to hear from you. For this engraved image just in my heart I gave it a 10 on the face of its performance.
