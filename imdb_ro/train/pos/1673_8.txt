A fine Martino exit, this is a lively and pleasant giallo, with good performances from good casting and mainly the two leaders, George Hilton and Anita Strindberg. For me the jig-saw puzzle of a plot is so confusing and confusing just sit back and enjoy rather than try to anticipate. Only when everything seems to be solved, we are again taken over by a new series of overturns, pleasant breathing, to be said. Sexy, with lots of gorillas, kill this movie with London, Athens and Greece coastal areas. A super-final set on the rocks of the Aegean Sea scatters things and lots of fun has been done by everyone.
