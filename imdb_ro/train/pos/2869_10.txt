First of all, I want to say, "Thank you, Disney, because it finally released the movie" Cinderella "on DVD! Now you have all the Disney animations on DVDs (including editions Limited 1999) What will you do next You will go to Disney World !!!!! "Well, technically (I mean, look at the castle !!!!!) However, Disney remains magical in her 1950s animated film," Cinderella ", the film that put fairy-tale films on the map. We are all familiar with the story of Cinderella, her captains, her date, the glass slipper, the pumpkin that turns into a trolley just to say "Bippity-boppity-boo!" And, of course, trying to go home until midnight! <br /> <br /> What I like about this movie: It's an old story that kids love, now in a form of movie (as well as on DVD) !!!!! /> "Cinderella" - thank you, Disney !!!!! 10 stars.
