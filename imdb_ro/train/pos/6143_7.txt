He has not seen this movie since 1971 and was very amused by this extraordinary production created by Walt Disney studios and extraordinary animation creations. Angela Lansbury (Eglantine Price) played a special role in the role of a woman who took a course in the witch craft and was an apprentice who had begun to fly on a sweep and had quite a lot of difficulty in taking off. Eglantine discovered many tricks and managed to make a trip in bed in different parts of the world. However, Eglantine missed the final examinations to become a witch. Mr. Emerlius Browne (David Tomlinson) was the person who sold Eglantine this witchcraft course and tried to help her in any way possible to find her solution. Eglantine has a purpose for her madness and that means stopping the Nazis to avoid England. Great family entertainment and we need more movies like this today.
