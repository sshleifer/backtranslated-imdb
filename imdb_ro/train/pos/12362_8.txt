I will be quick to address the film's aspects here: it was a very interesting story about the destructive qualities of consuming passions; an Italian young woman who can not emotionally connect with his politically-closed political fianc√© (partly because of his apolitical attitudes and the free approach to life) finds consolation and passion in a young boyfriend he is wearing in a sexual relationship. Anxiety, anger, sensitivity, and passions around the atmosphere of the story are equal to the unusual silence that seems to swallow the two leaders. This gives the film an anxious mood that penetrates through all political conflicts that are otherwise lost to the spectator (if you do not have a profound knowledge of Italian politics in the 1980s). I found the convincing movie ... which has destroyed it to some extent is a free oral sex scene, which the actress interprets on the masculine leadership ... it is not simulated and leaves too much imagination. There are other sex scenes in the movie that I feel necessary, because they outline the madness and loneliness in which the characters live. But the oral sex scene, I feel, derails the focus on the real story. It was a smooth navigation until that moment, and once the scene of the infamous sex (which caused a lot of hoop during the day), it's like you've hit an obstacle. It is offensive and useless and I'm in the camp who think the movie would not have been hurt if the scene was removed from her. And what is regrettable is that this scene can discourage people from watching this exciting movie, which I think deserves a viewing, because there are so many things going on under the surface, emotions and turbulence that lie in the subtext. <br /> <br /> In general: Wonderful film impeded by unnecessary sexual scene.
