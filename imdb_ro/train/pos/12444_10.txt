The Best Modesty Blaise movie I've seen so far. He's like a good pilot for a TV series. I really think it's a "cult," like it's a slight touch of Quentin Tarantino's magic or something. They've taken on the character of Modesty very much, but I admit we've lost a little Willy Garwin. Even though I have read more comics and a book by Peter O'Donnell I am not disappointed with this film, the exact opposite. She was positively surprised by this story about Modesty and her childhood. I have not put my expectations so high because of the bad film of 1966. So maybe I've outdid this movie a bit. But if you like comics and other stories about Modesty Blaise, I should definitely see this! can not wait for a tracking ...
