Jacknife is a masterpiece of the '80s. It's a movie that breathes through amazing action and a very interesting touch. In Jacknife, both European and American cinema lovers can find things you can refer to. The script is very convincing and full of beautiful characters. Ed Harris offers one of the greatest performances so far. He portrays his alcoholic hero, making us gorgeous to feel our broken heart in every line in every movement. Robert De Niro again makes us think of him as one of the greatest actors of all time, in one of the simplest but also the most realistic performances in his career. Jacknife is never boring because he shows his heroes clear of any Hollywood character. After the war, no one is a hero. Everybody is a loser, and this movie is about that simple truth. No one can fix their pieces after a war, like the heroes of this film. Jacknife is about the diseases of the soul the war is creating. Simple, magnificent movie.
