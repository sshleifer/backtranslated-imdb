This is one of a few cartoons with Bugs Bunny and Marvin Martian - and a space dog called K-9 is included as well. This Looney Tunes episode is very funny, has animated animation reasonably (Marvin's animation is very well made) and the plot is well done. The end is quite strange, so be prepared for it, it is slightly boring. <br /> <br /> In this episode, Marvin Martian was sent to the earth to capture a creature of the earth and bring it back to Mars. With his trusty dog ​​K-9, Marvin sets up and soon finds pieces of another rabbit, but Bugs Bunny! He greeted them with the treats, thinking they were a trick or traitor in their outfits. Few realize they are preparing to take this rabbit on Mars ... I recommend this episode to anyone who likes Bugs Bunny, Marvin Martian and Looney Tunes in general. As for the beginning and middle of the episode, you may like it. Enjoy "Hasty Hare"! :-)
