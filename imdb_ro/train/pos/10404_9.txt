Despite having 6 different directors, this fantasy hangs together remarkably well. It was filmed in England (not far from Morocco) in studios and several beaches. At the outbreak of the war, everything was moved to America, and some scenes were filmed in the Grand Canyon. It's remarkable that I had one of the most corny lyrics in a song - "I want to be a bandit, I can not understand it." It remains a favorite of many people.
