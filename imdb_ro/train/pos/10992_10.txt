Hell, I've seen this movie at least 4 times now and I'm not bored looking at her. The pictures are so good and along with the music that is wonderful and perfectly suited this movie is great for me. CGIs are pretty bad IMHO, but all the images with black and white feelings about him and completely sterile interiors were just ... Just a perfect genius for such a movie. The whole feeling about this feeling is indescribable, the plot is so good. However, the film had minor flaws, sometimes I thought the movie was a bit too "slow", but I do not refer to the picturesque parts by the fact that I totally liked these. I was also very distracted by the completely complex story, such as when it's under the digicorps bunker, where all the data is saved and has that conversation with the guy there ... but that can only be me : D And the end could have been somewhat more accentuated, it should have done the longer and more intense piece of memory, but again without all these defects the movie would have been so good that it would never be I had to never forget. .
