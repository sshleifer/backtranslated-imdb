A hilarious comedy Neil Simon evoking laughs from start to finish. Later Walter Matthau is the ex-comedian who is convinced to join his former partner (the latest Oscar winner George Burns) for a final stage show. Benjamin Martin is a Matthau agent and nephew, and the two have as much chemistry as Matthau and Burns. I like Matthau's terrible character - he's just like him always, and yet also very different. Burns, as an old man absent, is as fun as Matthau. > <br /> Matthau: Do you want some biscuits? I have coconut, pineapple and graham. Burns: How about a simple crack? Matthau: I do not understand. I got coconut, pineapple and graham. Burns: All right. <br /> <br /> Matthau: I'm in the kitchen cabinet. <br /> <br /> Burns: Maybe later. <br /> <br /> Or about this: <br /> <br /> Matthau: When I did black, the whites knew what I was saying! <br /> <br /> You have to see in the movie to understand it! All in all, a hilarious, sweet, heart-warm, credible, heart-hearted and some of the most memorable quotes of all time. <br /> <br /> They just do not do it anymore! At a time when all the newest comedies are brutal, minor and stupid, this is heading to the core of what is truly comedy - funny characters, smart and funny dialogue and great entertainment. of the best comedies of friends of all time, right there with "Aircraft, Trains and Cars", "Lethal Weapon" and "The Hard Way". It may be hard to find this for rent or TV, but believe me, it will be worth the time! <br /> <br /> 4.5 / 5 stars. <br /> <br /> - John Ulmer
