As an adult, I really enjoyed this. I saw her with my two grandmothers, and those 3Â½ years old were fascinated and the 15 months collided with the mice. Music is fun and the animation is wonderful. This continues what Return to Neverland has failed. A good follow-up to the Cinderella story; but what happens in Drusilla? Another sequel? I hope so!
