I really enjoyed this debut by director Ring, Hideo Nakata. If you saw Ring beforehand, then you will know the style and idea of ​​this movie. She has a subtle scare that it works better than the constant (and predictable) quilts that infect most of the mass movies of this genre. If you like movies that make you chills, then you probably will like it. A good, creepy debut of Hideo Nakata. 8/10
