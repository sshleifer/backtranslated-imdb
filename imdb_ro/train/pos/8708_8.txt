I saw the subtitle as it was in Russian, but it enjoyed it. Sasha's main character was born cursed, with a deadly weapon as an extension of his body. He lived all his unhappy life because he was different and because his anger made him die of death. When Sasha finally found love in a young woman named Katya, everyone tried to take her from him in a moral fight. It was a fairly large amount of gore, but not too much for the weak stomach. Not for those who like old Hollywood movies, but for those who enjoy independent movies. I had a sense of fantastic Asian movie.
