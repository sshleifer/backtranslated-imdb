This was an excellent movie. I do not understand why so many people do not like it. It was so much about her, so many beautiful pictures and so much compassion in things that have not been said. I was very amused and left with a feeling of cheerful exuberance, just as I am when I finish most of Tom Robbins' stories. Now I have not read Robbin's special book, so not now how it fits this, but I can not imagine that this movie could have been a very bad interpretation. The film has left many to define yourself, which is the best part of any novel by Tom Robbins, dreaming of the details. <br /> <br /> For all of you who have said it was the worst movie ever, I'm sorry for a little bit of light in your hearts. Far from the worst film ever, this movie was glorious. Long live the crane.
