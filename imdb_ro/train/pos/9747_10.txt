I remember seeing this movie when it first came out in 1982 and liked it then. About four years later I had the privilege of seeing Luciano Pavarotti singing at the Metropolitan Opera in New York (in Tosca) to see that the end of this movie reminds me of that great night. What do you dislike about this movie? The music is brilliant, and Pavarotti (Fini) was at the best moments and showed great. The story is actually very funny in the parts and the "food fight" scene is still one of the funniest I've ever seen. The hot air balloon flight over the Napa Valley was beautiful and was the song she sang "If I Were Loved" (one of the few moments when Pavarotti sang in English). And hearing the duo of Santa Lucia gorgeous. Winning real people, it was a film about an opera singer called Georgio Fini, who just happened to be played by Pavarotti. Kathryn Harrold & Eddie Albert were excellent in their supporting roles. I'm very glad I still have this almost VHS tape in this movie, but I'd love to be released on DVD, especially now that Pavarotti is no longer with us because I think this includes Nessun Dorma's best interpretation sung by him still on the film today!
