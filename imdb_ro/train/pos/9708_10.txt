I have never seen this program before, although it was highly recommended by my family members. Luckily, my girlfriend lives in Hadfield (the shooting spot) and she highlighted some landmarks when I first visited this got my interest going so I bought the first series on the video and sat down at the clock. Besides recognizing some places, I found myself surprised. Once again, the BBC was responsible for producing another example of the best comedy in the world. TLOG easily classifies there with Red Dwarf, Fawlty Towers and Monty Python probably the best. <br /> <br /> It's enough to say that I'm scheduled now. The characters are gorgeous and have unusual depths, while keeping an extremely realistic edge. The look and feel of the program are perfect and reflect the sometimes gloomy feeling of the North (no disrespect for Hadfield, which found a very welcoming and warm place). I just hope to continue its originality during its round (which is based on the second series that ended the UK resumption last night is certainly). Well done BBC!
