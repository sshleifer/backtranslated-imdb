I think that's what this movie wants to say at the end of the movie! or the damn Australian? I do not know yet, but what I know is that I really liked this movie, but that could not be my favorite movie! A great story with great actors, but with a terrible end ... makes you cry and say "Oh, that's so good" ... However, who did it? What really happened? Who is that? No answer to these questions ... Mysterious movie with a good overall score ... I give it a 8/10, going on 8.5!
