I think this film adds diversity and is very precise in terms of historical reconstruction. The way the different communities that are leaving together in Thailand are very interesting ... The Portuguese, the Japanese and the various communities are administered by the king. Parcels around the courtyard are, as usual, a power struggle with much betrayal. The closet is fine. The film is also made locally in Thailand in a reasonable production. The scene with the elephant as executor is very interesting. It's fun and I think it's also useful in schools for its historical accuracy because it shows that Asian Europeans were subjects of local kings very different from Hollywood's traditional perspective.
