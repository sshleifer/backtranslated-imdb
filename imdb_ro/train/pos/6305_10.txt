Welcome to Collinwood is one of the most delightful movies I've ever seen. A superb distribution of the ensemble, tight editing and great direction. A coward film that does not get stuck in standard tricks. There is not much to say about this movie without spoiling it. The tag line says everyone - 5 guys. 1 sure. No Brains. William H Macy and Sam Rockwell lead an amazing cast. George Clooney should be congratulated on making this jewelry. <br /> <br />
