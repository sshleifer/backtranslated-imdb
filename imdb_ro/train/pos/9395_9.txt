If you like towers coming back, this is your movie. It is impossible at any time to anticipate what will happen next. Nothing is as it appears or ends as you think it will do. Characters are totally pebbled and engaged. Cage is the best. Dennis Hopper shows his sinister face again. JT Walsh is perfect in his latest show. Laura Boyle jumps. Dwight Yoakum makes a superb movie debut in a cameo. I categorize this movie as "I really have a real day, really, really stupid." There is not a slow minute in this movie. A real bedroom. This movie is undervalued and unfortunately overlooked.
