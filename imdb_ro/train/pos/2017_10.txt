After reading only two of these comments as a lifetime Bronte fan, starting with Heathcliff Olivier and lasting with many versions of Charlotte "Rochester," is more than just an eye-opening to see that it is the unsung Bronte sister who left the male-chauvinist trio inhabited period. Of course, the "miracle" in all three versions of the 19th British domesticity is that the "girls" were all "spinsters" and only their realistic brushes with "men" were their vicar's father and their wastrel? brother. That being said, finally, is Anne BrontÃ«, who has, in a single test, proved the "feminist" point, the way to follow the contemporary types, and including the "voting franchise" on the spot. However, history evinces more than a few who preceded, including the Greek Hetera and Sappho, and likes an old emperor of Yang Kuei-fei. And how about "Eve" and apples them?
