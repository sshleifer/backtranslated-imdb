This movie, which begins with an exciting opening of two hot blondes that gets it behind a vehicle without a moving driver, has a strange personality to start. The tower of the seven (although a single girl is not hung around the body, which is unfortunate because the death fee is already so small) is super hot, while our story concentrates around adolescents spending desert (a strange but effective choice to set up) that are hunted by a creepy man in gloves and black jeans driving a black truck. He's bringing in more motor-powered motorcycles so far ("The Trip", "Joy Ride", "Jeepers Creepers"), where the killer's vehicle becomes a bad antagonist. The killer himself is quite creepy and we find consolation in the extremely enjoyable heroine in Jennifer McAllister (look at the interesting symbolic contrast of the evil killer in all blacks, while our benevolent heroine sports all white clothing, be). Director Bill Crain does some really wonderful things with the camera, some tricks on the screen, and the distribution is trying to get the best results. There are plenty of gore to the small number of cadres to please the gore fans and enough T & A from a few girls to thank T & A fans. Overall, this movie is highly underestimated and widely sought out in the cinema world of Slasher, as it turned out rarely to find the movie. Highly recommended.
