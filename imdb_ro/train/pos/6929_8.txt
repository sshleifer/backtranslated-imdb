He saw this move on ENCW's last thread for the third or fourth time. I enjoyed so much that I ordered the DVD. This is really a standout and, of course, the first of the Mann-Stewart pairs. More than here, though not as strong as Seekers. A lot of obvious symbols about the man, but especially about the role of Stewart, his partner Millard Mitchell, Shelly Winters and Waco Johnny Dean-Dan Duryea. Steve Miller (not The Joker) is interesting as a beautiful hero who is interested in Lola, but too yellow. Like Stewart in The Man Who Killed Liberty Valance, he is practically reduced to putting on an apron and serving his coffee enemies. Decaf no doubt. Tony Curtis of Cavalry Bronx and Rock Hudson behave as if no Indians I had seen on the screen had any interesting comeoes. Special performances by John McIntire as a lucky book dealing with / very low version of Rick's Western version of American Coffee. Nobody wants to spend the night there. Jay C. Flippens out of a kiss from Lola (Winters) and has some beautiful scenes with Stewart before getting to Bend of the River and Far Country. Will Geer as Wyatt Earp and the Indian boss who takes Walter Brennan's teeth from him in Red River are pleasant views. This is a kind of Western that only Stewart, not Wayne and Scott could have withdrawn. Worth the shot, I repeat. :-)
