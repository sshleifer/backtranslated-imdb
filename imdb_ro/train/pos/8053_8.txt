This is one of Sammo's best comedy films. This is not a parody of getting into a dragon, the main character (Sammo) is obsessed with Bruce Lee and strangely simulates him for a man of his size. The legendary story about how his struggle continues to challenge his dear ones - then fight. Oh, fight. Good scenes with fast rhythms with great impact (the white guy playing a boxer seems to be really hurt by one of Sammo's blows). The funniest film in this movie was simply unintentional. There's a guy named Jim Kelly (one of the three experts hired to take Sammo out), but he was a Chinese guy in black with an afro wig. Come on, did not they have any real black in Hong Kong in 1978? Well, I think we've seen enough "white" alphabets, white, in the old American movies. This is one for any Sammo fan or Bruce Lee.
