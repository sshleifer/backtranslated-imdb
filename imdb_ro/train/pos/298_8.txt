New York has never looked so good! And nobody has it in this movie. While the script is a bit easier, you can not help but you like this movie or any of the characters in it. You almost want such people to exist. The appeal of the actors is what really put it (John Ritter, Colleen Camp and Dorothy Stratten's delay are especially good.) Continue and rent or buy this movie, you will be glad you did.
