I really liked this movie. I am a single father with a 17 year old daughter who is intelligent, athletic and talented. I wish my girl applied so well to solve crimes and help others! So for me, maybe it's PG level Fantasyland. I've read Nancy Drew's many books in my adolescent years long ago. Sure, this character was misinterpreted by Emma Roberts, but it did NOT resemble Nancy Drew that I remember from books. This is due to the scenario, not to the actor. Emma is an adorable teenager, playing a trustworthy, talented and proud character with good manners and good taste. She is not caught in fashionable competition around her. There are a few weaknesses in Plot, apart from the fact that it does not look like Nancy Drew in the Books and who is trying to figure out in what decade we are. (Like, what is that CAR anyway?) I read the IMDb presentation before watching the movie as we explore Rachael Leigh Cook from other movies. This is not one of her best roles, but I will continue to search for more movies. Rachael was too old to play this role, but he did a good job as the mature orphan in the center of the mystery. I am very disappointed with other reviews written here. Some expect a perfect connection with books, some expect more credible situations or the adult movie. I got what I expected! Good well-targeted fun to young teenage girls and their parents who want good children with high standards of conduct and achievement. This is a Teen PG movie, not James Bond! What would be a role model for your teenage daughter?
