ABC has done more for this show, allowing TV veterans James Garner and David Spade to join the show's show. At first, the show was watched and even predictable with John Ritter and Katey Sagal. John's loss shocked the world. Katey and the three children are really a solid professional cast. The lesson of the hour after John's death in real life struck me at home. I lost my father at the age of 17 and I felt and understood my pain and agony. ABC should be proud to keep this show and even keep this as John's final desire. This show matured and developed because of such impossible circumstances. They should be rewarded with Emmy.
