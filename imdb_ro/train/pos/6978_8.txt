Well, I have to say that I waited for it to come. I will not try to ruin him and a few people have really talked about the pilot. On the other hand, I'm not sure enough to understand detractors who claim to be BSG fans and not the pilot. What did the frack do? The background is set to be 50 years before the BSG is assisted at the Cylons, to see the life of the Adama family (we already knew something from the BSG), to get a deeper explanation of the Capricane population and its perception of the other colonies, and eventually the origins of the gods' faith about man's faith and the unique faith of the Cylons. <br /> <br /> I do not expect the same profusion of special effect or space work as in the previous series, they make the difference between the two although I know Caprica will strengthen BSG. <br /> <br /> This is promising 1h30 start, I also think this will put pressure on the scenarios to be as good as BSG. I look very much at the next, but I have no reason to doubt that we will learn much more. Watching the deleted scene of DVD also provides more material for your brain to chew. <br /> <br /> Looking forward to January 2010
