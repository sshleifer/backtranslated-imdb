Deliverance is the fascinating, haunting and sometimes disturbing story of James Dickey, transformed into a brilliant John Boorman movie. It's about four man-made businessmen and macho-behavior, who spend a weekend rowing up in the mountains. There he faces every darkest part of man and the most serious form of human misery ... poverty, buggery and even physical harassment! These four men intended to travel on the river for adventure and excitement, but their journey soon turns into an odyssey through a violent and hidden mountain country, completely alienated by all forms of civilization. All these elements make Deliverance one of the most nightmare films I've ever seen. Just about everything that happens to these people, please do not ever find yourself in a similar situation. Pure cinema, Deliverance is also a very important film. John Boorman's best film (closely followed by Zardoz and Excalibur) was - and still is - a very influential film and contains many memorable scenes that have already been featured in countless other films. Think of the spectacular musical score "Dueling banjos" and, of course, the rape scene of "unforgettable, homosexual" scandal. All actors offer (haha) perfect performance. Especially Jon Voight. You have to watch the movie!
