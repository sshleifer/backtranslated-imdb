First of all, I'm a man, a white straight man. But even with this handicap I like this movie. It's real people. Real time and a place. And, of course, New York City in the 1980s. I had many homosexual friends who grew up in New York in the eighties and the only thing about them that I have always admired was their courage to live their lives as they wanted to live. Whatever the consequences. He's brave. You have to admire that. This is a great movie, watch it and take it as it was an African-American or homosexual man in New York from the eighties. It's real life. Bottom line is real life.
