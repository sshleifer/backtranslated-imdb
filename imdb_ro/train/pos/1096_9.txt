I first saw this movie in 1980 in the movie at noon. After much later viewing (and buying the video) I'm laughing out loud. Yeah, it's a reliquary of another age - an inner comedy established in America's rich middle class - but well executed is well executed. But it is also an epoch - a feast of post-war optimism, the boom for children and the elderly age. This film is not a "guilty pleasure". Three wonderful sophisticated actors - Urban Melvyn Douglas; - Cary Grant; courageous Myrna Loy - complement each other and a memorable team of characters. My favorite scenes - "It means you have to blast" and "Miss Stellwaggen" and "This little pig". <br /> <br /> Love her.
