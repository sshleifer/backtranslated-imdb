Well done and stylish, while it still makes sense this thriller would work better for non-giallo fans to inquire about gender than Argento later entries that go overboard in all directions. For fans of these crazy Italian thrillers, they will appreciate George Hilton and the transformations that the character has and what he has done. Working with the camera is fresh, with lines of graphic violence and strange options, but suitable and a good score of music that is not surpassed. The less you know about the story, the better it is to make it work. The only thing missing to keep this from being a great Sergio Martino guided by giallo is that the story does not have that extra sexuality or psychology, or both elements to put them over the top. It is more a routine mystery, the characters are well defined, but live or die according to the plot not according to their own virtues and defects. The recent DVDs (2005) are beautiful looking and surely the way to see the movie, unless they ever receive art screenings, which seems unlikely.
