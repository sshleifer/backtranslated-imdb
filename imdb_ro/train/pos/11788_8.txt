I really think people are doing the wrong thing about it. First of all, it seems to me that this short film is very interesting and exciting. I took it for what it is. I think suspense and mystery are ingenious in their insinuation on the supervisor. Another thing that surprised my image was that it immediately involves the spectator, even if there is no clear story, just suggestions and breaks and emotions played by characters that give you the impression that there is a story of everything that is continuous. No one else could do it better than Lynch. This is the essence of linghiism at its best. Sure, I will agree with anyone that people who start seeing this with the desire to have fun without a truly imaginative work on the part of the spectator will be disappointed. And fine. Lynch is not about that. At least that side of Lynch is not. The one who helped Lost Highway / Mulholland Dr. is fully leaning here and people who expect to be entertained as if watching anything else will not only get what it is. My opinion is that the Dark Chamber has to do with the dirt with your animal core, with your instinctual self, giving you the means (the image, the sound, the situation) by which you react instinctively. It's not about pleasure of any kind, but about getting the desired reaction on your part. And that, my friend, is pure art.
