Twenty-five-year-old Antwone Fisher (Derek Luke), violent and rebellious, is sent to three appraisal sessions with Marine psychiatrist Dr. Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington) after another outbreak and aggression against a sailor higher. Retained at the beginning of treatment, he trusts Dr. Davenport and reveals his childhood, revealing painful traumas generated in his foster home. Meanwhile, she meets Cheryl Smolley (Joy Briant) and they fall in love with each other. Solving his personal problems, Antwone becomes a new man. This true family drama is a moving and positive story of a man who finds a friend and is sent back to a normal life. Denzel Washington's direction is excellent, making it sensuous, attractive and tasteful, a story about child abuse. In the hands of another director, it could be a very difficult story. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Voltando a Viver' ('Return to Live')
