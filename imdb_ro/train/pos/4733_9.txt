Once again, Jet Li brings his charismatic presence to the screen of the film Black Mask. In this film, Li interprets Tsui, an escape from a super-soldier program that tries to regain the humanity that the program has taken from him. To do this, Tsui decides to become a librarian to live a normal and quiet life, but fate asks him to clean up the problems of his past before he can continue to seek peace. Other members of the super-soldiers program escaped at the same time as Tsui, but they want to go even with the world, rather than find inner peace. Thus Tsui becomes the only thing that can prevent the former teammate from releasing information that could cost many innocent people their lives. This movie shouts on the screen at a frantic pace and does not let the audience go. Martial arts is amazing, but because it uses yarn, it may not be appreciated just as much as the American audience deserves. If you like action movies that have an interesting story and demand good acting performance because they deal with psychological and physical conflicts, then Black Mask is for you. I am glad to see that some of Jet Li's films finally get a release mainstream streams in the United States, and I look forward to seeing how the changes this release will take (things like dubbing and soundtrack) will be needed. This is one of Li's best movies, coming out to see him on May 14 when he's released in America.
