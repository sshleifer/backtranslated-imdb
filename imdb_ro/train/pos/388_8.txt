...and I like it. A lot of special effects and for a film that is not done on a mega budget, this movie really does a wonderful job of creating a fantastic masterpiece. I'm one of the guys who did not understand the story at all, but that was still a great move to look at. It's certainly up there in standards that go beyond Bored with Rings, and on equal with movies like Harry Potter. What again says a film for a movie again, made on a fraction of the budget of these international hits. One thing I really love about this movie is that the envelope of the adventure film coming from Hong Kong is spreading. The subject is exotic and original. Production quality is different from what is seen coming from HK for the fantasy action movie, and its role is great. One of the best movies to come out of Hong Kong, this is Hong Kong's fantastic Infinite Business, and I hope they will continue to work in this field until they overtake Hollywood adventure films. Very fantastic.
