There really is not much to say about this movie .... it's cruel but fun. <br /> <br /> Contour plot (from IMDB) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Two brothers from Milwaukee, Coop & Remer (Parker & Stone) invented a game of New basketball game using baseball rules. If the game becomes a huge success, they, together with the help of a billionaire, form the BASEketball Professional League if everyone gets the same salary and no team can change cities. Coop & Remer's team, Milwaukee Beers, is the only team that is in the way of major major changes the owner of Dallas Deluxe (Vaughn) wants to establish. <br /> <br /> <br /> The actor is pretty good because there are not many big stars in this movie. Though I am not a big fan of "Southpark", Parker and Stone do a pretty good job of their first real movie. <br /> <br /> There are so many funny moments in this movie can not come close to naming them all. They never really leave, and they do not try to put some terrible dramas to make it worse. <br /> <br /> And my favorite look of this movie: The Soundtrack. It's great. I especially like "Take Me On" and "Beer" by Reel Big Fish. Highly underestimated. Generally, a brutal but extremely funny movie. 10/10 <br /> <br /> James "Black Wolf" Johnston
