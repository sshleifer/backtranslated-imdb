Belushi at the most hilarious and Courtney Cox before friends has a small role. I often think Belushi is under-used in Hollywood and this film role is one of the best. For those who look at the TV show, this is a very different and pleasant character. The film itself is not rocking of the earth, nor is it the new message, but rather sweet and bold. Supporting familiar faces and unknown names is a perfect balance, although Lovitz's crying can become exhausting, and Michael Caine's charming spiritual guide has a slightly sinister, if not good, edge. Hamilton, as Belushi's wife, is unfortunately two-dimensional and wonders why he married her. In addition, Renee Russo is wasted and not very convincing at the "queen of the ball" who escaped. However, a nice way to spend two hours.
