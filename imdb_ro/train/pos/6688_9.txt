In the history of comic book movies, "Mystery Men" is one of the most underestimated. This is not an ordinary superhero movie! Watch the exploits of a well-known wannabi crew, including Mr. Furious (played by Ben Stiller), Bowler (Janeane Garofalo), Shoveller (William H. Macy), Blue Rajah (Hank Azariah) Spleen (Paul Reubens). "Mystery Men" spoof some aspects of superhero movies such as "Superman" or "Batman," such as spirits and questions about secret identities. Most superheroes are not billionaires such as Bruce Wayne, but blue collar types with menial jobs and neurotic lives. It seems that director Kinka Usher makes the heroes see something that can refer to the average of the viewer. I found "Mystery Men" to be stimulating and very funny. Even if it does not turn into a franchise, it's still a joy to look!
