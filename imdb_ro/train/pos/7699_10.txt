FORBIDDEN PLANET is one of the best examples of Hollywood SF films. His influence has been felt for over a decade. However, some elements related to how this large-scale entertainment was targeting an audience from the mid-fifties that disappeared, gave quite a bit, and sometimes slow shooting does not help. But the central idea of ​​the story that involved ancient civilization, missing Krell and "Id monsters" has not lost its appeal and continues to make this film a relevant movie "I have to see." What I like the most to say here is that the current DVD for this movie is terrible. The film did not really look so well in the home movie, and its elements need restoration. I hope it will happen soon and we will get a special edition of this classic SF.
