"Girlfight" follows a project that lives in New York City high school from a sense of futility in the amateur boxing world, where she finds self-esteem, purpose, and more. Although the movie is not about boxing, boxing is about the movie. So much so that it almost smells sweat. From a technical and artistic point of view, a good movie with a sense of honesty and reality about it, "Girlfight" is not a shot of chickens and not "Rocky". It is rather a very human drama that even viewers who do not know the speaker will be able to connect.
