Tony Hawk Underground came at a time when the series began to lose its brilliance, Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4 did not stand the expectations and left the series really in the air on what Neversoft and Activision could do with the series either different and interesting. Underground introduced the story mode, which was very cool because it made a whole new world for fans of Tony Hawk Pro Skater. Another feature that fans had a lot of arguing and who was able to get off the skateboard, which is nice because you can now climb, run and do all kinds of new things. are good, Neversoft has also improved on a problem that started with Pro Skater 3 and which was the length of the level models. The first two games for PS1, N64 and Dreamcast were great because the levels were beautiful and long and some features hidden in some. Pro Skater 3 and 4 have been shortened due to a multitude of features that have been added and really pushed the systems too tightly. In this version, they have shortened those features, there are not so many people who are wondering on the streets, in fact, almost does not exist on some levels, and the graphics and physics of skating are little toned but not very much. > <br /> This game has a cone, the story story is a bit short, of course this is the first time Neversofts does so with Tony Hawk Pro Skater, so it's understandable. However, this is said to surely end this game someday. Generally, an extra plus that was very refreshing.
