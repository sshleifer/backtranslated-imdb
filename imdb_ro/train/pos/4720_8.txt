A beautiful movie, especially if you love horses, movies during the Second World War and Austrian Plateau Hungarian. A story of courage, compassion and loyalty that transcends generations. Horsemanship is spectacular as well as the main character's horse in its own preparation. I'll buy this movie and track it again. This is a family film and I highly recommend it. A good film "Family Nite". Although there were violent scenes, it was the Nazi occupation of Hungary. The native people were very interested in the way they were in front of them even in the face of a certain death of a Nazi officer who had personal reasons to hunt Brady. A beautiful beautiful movie.
