Stephane Rideau has already been a star for his "Wild Reeds" tournament, and is one of France's greatest stars. In this film, he plays Cedric, a local boy who meets Mathieu beach (newcomer Jamie Elkaim, in an amazing, ethereal and ethereal show). Mathieu has a complex relationship with his sick mother, asking for her aunt and sister (with whom she has a competitive relationship). Soon, the two fall in love. The fractured narrative of the film - which is made up of long, back, chunks and pieces of the present, and real-time movement in the future - is a little disturbing. Director Sebastien Lifshitz does not signal the period we are in, and the story line can be difficult to track. But it turns out: the last 45 minutes of the movie are so impressive that you can not get your eyes off the screen. Over time, this movie fits in with Thing Thing, as the cinema needs to see.
