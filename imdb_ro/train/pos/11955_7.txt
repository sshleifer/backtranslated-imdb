Allow yourself to be transported to some sort of old, different stories. Scoop is classic Woody Allen. Allen's latest museums, Scarlett Johansson (who also appeared in Allen's last year's match), are surprisingly able to mitigate her excited appeal and turn into a normal-looking student , with the help of glasses and costumes, but they can not make spectators believe that their character Hugh Jackman may be attracted to it, given the royal background (do not worry, you have no spoilers here). There are no major transformations for Johansson's character here, while she constantly plays the same character despite the script that says otherwise. You would even forgive her apparent lack of logic for her character, continuing an adventure with a suspect serial killer, simply because he is his royal Jackman, Jackman, who is refreshing to see sans Wolverine duds. If anything, consistency is what Allen has for 70 years. He continues to tell stories about celluloid in the same way he always has; as if it had never been exposed to modern filming, which probably makes its simple and quiet movies attractive. They never seem to target a certain market; as if Allen makes movies only to his liking, whether the audience likes it or not.
