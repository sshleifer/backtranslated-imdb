This review is for the extensive reduction of this film. I first saw Dragon Lord when I bought it on DVD many years ago. I have always liked this movie and you can read some of the most positive reviews of it to get the idea. <br /> <br /> This being said. I've always found the story a little confused. The film is, after all, a love story. And it always seemed strange to me that a love story should end with a 20-minute battle scene. Well, in the extended version it's not like that. The old "original" version begins with an immense barrel-raid / rugby sequence, which is the new, final version of the extended version. The opening sequence is Dragon (Jackie Chan) hanging around his house and claims to be training and reciting whenever his father is around. Other sequenced have also been shifting or prolonged into extended cut, and the story makes much more sense when you follow it. Pacing is also better and generally works better. It feels more like a love story and does not let you ask yourself why it ends so drastically and dramatically as the usual version. I suggest to all those who are Hong Kong cinemas, or just (or at least so I thought it was intentional, why else would do it and rearrange some of the scenes) was made by looking at it, I felt I was watching a new movie Jackie Chan, although most of the sequences were the same.
