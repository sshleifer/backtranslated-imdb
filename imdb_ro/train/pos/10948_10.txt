The pursuit of a sitcom scenario is so misunderstood that, at the same time, its character, both inside and outside the context, the rest of the castle's inhabitants is a kind of experimentalism that sitcoms can really use. Supporting characters based the show on a sitcom reality that offers Sarah's contextual erratic contextual counterpoint, which, beyond general insensitivity, has no recurring specific features to rely on behavioral expectations, making it less of a character than a canvas to repeat each episode if not the scene. Sarah's ability to see everything from an outside perspective allows him to parody aspects of social behavior that are quite subtle to usually go unnoticed. Every time he speaks, it's like a sketch of 5 seconds. It overwhelms a lot, demonstrating the countless things a smile or a change in vocal pitch may mean, but it never misses an idea long enough to make you feel comfortable and make expectations that will be satisfied . It can be the most creative, original and experienced TV program ever.
