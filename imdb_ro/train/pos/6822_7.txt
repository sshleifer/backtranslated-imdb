"Night Opening" released in 1977, is trying to be an ambitious production. He's just doing the really stunning performance of Gena Rowlands. Her character of Myrtle theater is not necessarily a person we love in real life. She is self-absorbed, often unpleasant, and makes miserable life for those around her - in other words, unlike some actresses! Myrtle is also a woman on the brink of collapse - we are not very sure whether the demons they fight are real or imagined, although we left ourselves in secret early. Rowlands is well-lovedly directed by her talented husband, actor / director John Cassavettes, who also has a role in the film. This film is not defective - it's too long, and the last part of the movie where Myrtle goes on stage, while beer almost seems almost cruel. "Improving" in some of the dialogues - at least on stage - goes too long. Some of the supporting characters perform well, especially from Ben Gazarra, playing the unpleasant producer of Myrtle. Joan Blondell's character is never fully developed, and I've never been able to figure out why he was in the movie than to like Myrtle. See this movie only for Rowlands - it's fascinating all the time - and it's hard to take your eyes off, though you'll sometimes want it.
