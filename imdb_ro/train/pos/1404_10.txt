HOLLOW MAN is one of the best horror movies in the last decade. The sub-plot is original and the main plot is even better. The special effects are brilliant and probably the best I've ever seen in a horror movie. Kevin Bacon proves once again that he can handle any role that comes in his way. Claude Rains shocked the world with INVISIBLE MAN in 1933, now Kevin Bacon shocked us with HOLLOW MAN. One of the most thrilling horror films. The action is intense and the cold is true. You may even find yourself skipping if you watch it in the dark on a stormy night. The cast includes Elizabeth Shue, Josh Brolin, Kim Dickens, Joey Slotnick, Greg Grunberg and Mary Randle. All of them do an excellent job. <br /> <br /> --- SPOILERS --- <br /> <br /> Dr. Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) and his team have discovered the secret of making someone invisible. After testing on animals, they pass the human tests. But somebody has to be the subject. Volenteering, Caine is invisible. But when his team is unable to get back to sight, Caine is driven by his condition as he seeks vengeance ... * The final spoilers * The film has created memorable shock sequences and is meant to become a classic in the century following. Being the basis for a spoof joke in SCARY MOVIE 2, this film draws you around your neck and never lets you go. The first 45 minutes are slow, developing the characters and showing how their experiments work. The second half is interesting and appealing to most fans of action and horror. Think about DEEP BLUE SEA. Then change sharks to an invisible madman. Then change the water to fire and explosions. A recall of a killer shark movie. Interesting ... HOLLOW MAN gets 5/5.
