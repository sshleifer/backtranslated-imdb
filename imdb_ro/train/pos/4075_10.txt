Laputa: The castle in the sky is a bomb. The message is as powerful as its newer works and the more pure, fantastic and flying pirates, how could it be better? Art is totally amazing and the soundtrack, which is reused several times thereafter (I do not know for sure if it was the first time I heard it) and evokes in me the most emotional sentimental answer of any soundtrack of the film. Sheeta, the feminine brow in this movie is absolutely wonderful and the boy, Pazu is also a great role model - he lives alone! The land is Miyazaki classic. I will not give up, but the end is very good. I rank as one of the best three of Miyazaki with Nausicaa and Spirited Away. You may also want to check Howl's Moving Castle when it comes out (sometime next year, I hope) If you like Miyazaki check this out as it is readily available in the US. Rejoice, Piper A
