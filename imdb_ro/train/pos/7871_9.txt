Madhur Bhandarkar goes everything to achieve taboo issues and offers the most realistic picture of modern society. One has the impression of the director even in his earlier films such as Satta and Chandni bar. The issues referred to in the last film are explored and fully exposed here. Casting is amazing and you can see the judgments on each scene from multiple angles. For the most part, the film lets you ask a lot of facts around you. As you begin to guess things, you get the closest, because you've lost the mark in many scenes. It leaves a lasting impression in the end. The actors to be watched are Konkana Sen Sharma, Boman Irani and Atul Kulkarni among others. Dialogues are well written and you feel that you have lived around some of these people. There are still a few scenes that make you think of more depths. The songs are in the background, saving time and Lata's voice in a very important song "Kitne Ajeeb" lets you feel alone in the midst of modern society!
