This movie is one of the blackest black and white films of that time in the early 1930s before the Hoyts Code was applied. It's the story of a beautiful young woman who heads to New York and heads to the top of her business, using her body as a tool to get there. Barbara Stanwyck plays the role of young and beautiful Lily Powers who really does a pretty good job with her performance. Lily moves to New York and goes to work to sleep with all the men. Stanwyck has a remarkable performance as a strong woman who uses men as once, hardly any excitement about them playing them as if they were pawns. Lily Powers is a woman who has no love in her mind just power and money. I thought this movie is a bit different from other movies I saw because there is almost no background music heard. I think it's just because when people were first introduced to live sound and dialogue among the people in the movie. Several times the music is heard at the beginning, as shown to us as she makes her way up the chain. Filming and different scenes were fantastic! The director of this film made all the right angles and all the right tricks, making this film realistic. This movie was together a good movie. The ending of this film was not as good as it should, but it did not completely destroy it. Baby Face had his slow moving scenes alongside the movie and probably some predictable parts, such as who will sleep with the next. But this is a wonderful movie that can be watched more than once and suggested to people and friends.
