LOL!!! delir was so funny .. I was in tears. Eddie Murphys' impressions are absolute on the scene. The best impression was that of James Brown and Mr T> SO FUNNY !! Strange how was Eddie Murphy then how he is now DELIRIOUS is a must see, but if u do not like stupid language, I do not look but amazing and so happy .. i saw it 6/7 times and still I can smell every time. This is Eddie Murphy in turn and you can see where he received the humor and the ideas of movies like the nutty teacher. He also makes impressions from his family, which is very funny. <br /> <br /> If I was only there ...
