This is not the bar of the most hilarious movie I've ever seen. Beginning with the four offenders sent by their parents at the Wienberg Military Academy, there is a tone that continues continuously throughout this goofball movie and is not left for a second. It's hard to try to describe this movie; the elements of humor are so spot and brilliantly concieved that at first glance, it seems nothing more than a stupid comedy 80 teen lusts. But there is much more than that! Fresh by the minds of these people from MAD Magazine, Up the Academy serves a formula and style that I have never seen dubbed of any of the "funniest" deals to come out of Hollywood in recent years. Basically, the movie is so full of infant horns that you could guess that the writers were for two years themselves. Watch this movie if you like to act "immature". A classic. *****
