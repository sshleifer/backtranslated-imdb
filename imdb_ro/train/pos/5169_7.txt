I've seen the last five or ten minutes of this movie in 1998 or 1999 one evening when I was surfing before going to bed and even loved what I saw. Since then, I've been looking for a TV station by shooting DVD / VHS movies in stores, but I have not found a copy until they find out that some Internet shops have sold them. Then, being a world class procrastinator, I have not ordered him yet. Finally, I found a DVD copy in a Circuit City while visiting Portland, OR, a few weeks ago. Then it took me about a month after I returned home before I sat down and looked. So, what do I think about the movie? It's good. Not as good as I remembered and hoped, but still worth 9.99 dollars cost me. After seeing the whole movie for the first time, I rated it as 7/10, with the potential to become 8/10. I will have to be less sleepy then and have a better sound system to avoid reloading to catch a dialogue.
