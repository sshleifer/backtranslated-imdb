The main aspect of this film, which most people miss, is that Luhzin lives his life as a chess game. So many people have seen this movie and I do not understand it, and I do not understand why. While watching this movie, I was taken on a private journey that adorned me. I will try to explain this without spoilers, but to be warned, to talk about the things that happen in the movie. <br /> <br /> **** Possible Spoilers **** Be warned! <br /> <br /> It's a life of "big moves" toward "small movements." He chooses Natalia to be his queen and he behaves as his aunt first described to the king and queen and their movements when he introduced him to chess as a boy. Listen closely to this description. When someone asks a question, he returns to the past as if he had reviewed the past movements. (Flashbacks are beautifully lit, by the way.) Flashbacks are also quite interesting because they offer not only the child's viewpoint but also the point of view of the other character. It is amazing. Different characters become either his helpers or his enemies, pawns, bishops and knights, their actions illuminating who they are on their side. Even putting them in a scene is essential to understanding what's going on. Beautiful done. I will not comment more on what happens to Luhzin's character, but I hope that this will highlight what is actually happening at the end of the year. is constantly working on several levels, which is why I support him. It was a treat and a joy to follow. If you like this movie I would recommend a movie called Fresh. The only way these films are similar is the use of chess and the characters treated as songs. <br /> <br />
