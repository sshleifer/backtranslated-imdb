Very enjoyable action, with an intertwined story that does not actually suck. Interesting enough to be worth watching instead of jumping over the past to get to the good parts. Having Jenna Jameson and Asia Carrere helps you enjoy it. Jenna in the sweater and those glasses is just stunning! It's worth taking just to see it!
