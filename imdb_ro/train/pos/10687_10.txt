I have to confess that I was completely shocked by this film. For one, I went to see him in a whim waiting for something mediocre, but considering this, the most shocking thing was that he was in an American populist cinema. This is the British comedy at its best - dark, weird and funny in the way American films are never. I have to stop, however, to recommend this with all my heart; I went to see her with a few people, some Englishmen, some Europeans and one American, and while some of us loved them (mainly from the first two groups), some hated him and found him without value. If you think you're like that, then go. If not, no. 10/10.
