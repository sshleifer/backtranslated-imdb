May 2004, Wonderland is quite new in the UK. Brilliant film of a brutal story. If you know LA from the early 80's, you'll appreciate how well it's captured. Using the elements that make up his kinematic style is original, amplifying the experience and bringing the viewer closer to being there. Using a "Pulp Fiction" time line, disjoint, allows exploration of the uncertainty about what really happened, while the direction and performance of the cast commanded attention, especially Val Kilmer like John Holmes; an Oscar, surely if I had taught them.
