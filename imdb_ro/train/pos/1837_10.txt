Simple film, no doubt about it. The extraordinary story and superb performances, be it Amitabh, Akshay, Shefali, Priyanka, Boman or Rajpal. The film industry in the Hindu industry gets shaken by Mallika and Co, this film is absolutely free and therefore forced not to succeed in vulgarity depending on our Indian society. But the message and the concept that this film carries are absolutely superb. Anu Malik (boring copy) could have been avoided and Ismail Darbar or Himmesh Reshmmiya could have been used as a musician. I think the Shah Vip should have touched Gujarati, especially in music. Anu Malik is the worst musician and he thinks he is a popstar, but this is not the movie in which presence is required - He looks very good with the Govinda style songs. I felt serious music, some good Ghazal or sad songs that could make this movie more memorable.
