Historical drama and age story involving colorless men in the New Orleans civil war. It starts to slow down but absorbs steam after learning about the main characters and real action can begin. This is not just a story about the exploitation of black women, because they were free people. Perhaps they did not have all the rights of the whites, but they certainly had more control over their destinies than their slaves. Young people and men in this story have to choose each choice of how to live their lives, either to give in to the depravity of the system or to live with optimism and contribute to their community. I liked all the characters, but my favorites were Christophe, Anna Bella and Marcel.
