I loved a lot I love because I love my dinosaurs the biggest animals but I loved the show because it was not copied from another show and it was an original ha has a good and great story for the little children I like the dinosaurs that it is) I have a few downs too not all of it that the great cause of the dinosaurs look a little moved, so you should have but a 7 but now it's a bit late because yay 4 more lines to go is great for a fancy look though warning this might spoil part for u so if u do not want to be spoiled do not read plz close to the end is kinda weird cause all you have to do is get dang I got forgot what it was so nvm guess is not a spoiler, so i do not mind, i loved it and my opinion and i'm sorry for any lost words written if it is the case
