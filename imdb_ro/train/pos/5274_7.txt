Yes, I liked this movie when I was a kid. When I grew up, I saw this movie so many times that my father had to buy another VHS copy because the old copy was worn out. My family received a VHS copy of this movie when I bought a new VHS system. At first, my mother was not convinced that it was a suitable film for a 10-year-old, but because I bought a new VHS system, she let me look at her. As I said, this movie is every little guy's dream ?? The film contains great decoration, great muscular barbarians, beautiful topless women, big monsters and jokes that you will only get when you get older. So a few days ago I introduced the video and I watched the movie again after a long time. At first, I was bored, then I thought how much I liked this movie when I was a kid, and I kept watching. Yes, the experience was not as great as I remembered? The act is bad enough, the story is bad enough, the jokes were no longer fun, but the women were still beautiful. Yes, I grew up. Even if the movie experience has changed for me, I still think it's worth 7 stars. For the old times do you know?
