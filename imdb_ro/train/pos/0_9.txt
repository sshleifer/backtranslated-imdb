Bromwell High is a comedy cartoon. It ran along with other school life programs, such as "Teachers". The 35-year-old professor makes me think that Bromwell High's satire is much closer to reality than "teachers." Running financially to survive, the wise students, who can even see by kindly pumping their teachers, the lie of the whole situation, all of them remember the schools they know and their students. When I saw the episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn the school, I immediately remembered ......... at .......... High. A classic line: INSPECTOR: I'm here to get rid of one of your teachers. STUDENT: Welcome to Bromwell High. I expect many adults of my age to think that Bromwell High is much more loaded. What a shame it is not!
