A few years ago, I bought several $ 1 DVDs containing two movies. One of them had three Broadway girls (an alternative title for the Greeks had a word for them) and it, Happy Go Lovely. It's basically a backstage comedy happening in Scotland, and it's about a mistaken identity that involves one of the dancers moving from a millionaire's limousine. Vera-Ellen is that and-wow dancer, feet! Ceasar Romero is her producer who takes a chance after her after her first ladybug because she thinks she is meeting the millionaire whose car I just mentioned. And David Niven is that rich guy who, in search of Vera-Ellen, is confused with a reporter who should interview her but is blocked by Romero. What I just mentioned may be confusing, but (more) it makes sense if you're willing to check your brain while watching this charming screw-up comedy with wonderful musical numbers, as Mrs. Vera-Ellen did. Romero can be a bit frenetic here, but Niven gets hilarious invisible. The prince I saw was actually pretty good considering age and being in the public domain. And Vera-Ellen is doing pretty well with her lines since she's not really an actress. So, in that note, I highly recommend Go Happy to film lovers who love the old-fashioned music comedy.
