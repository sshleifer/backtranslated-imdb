... Heads, Hands, and Feet - a band of the past, just like Strange Fruit. A triple whammy out there. Those who claimed they did not like this movie are either hearts or under 40s, and have no experience with real things. Sad for them. This is a well-observed tiny image, which is a great way to go for an hour or two and probably will not disappear too much on the second presentation. Stephen Rae, Timothy Spall as the drummer of fat (in many ways, the most delightful figure of all) and Bill Nighy - a new name for me - as the neurotic vocalist and the front man turns into super-performances, and Juliet Aubrey has a wonderful to go with a sharp action like Karen, who is trying to hold the band together, as they are spectacularly self-destructing. The screens of Syd Barrett / Brian Wilson are loud and clear, Mott the Hoople in the back before one in all their swollen ridicule, and the script is never mawkish for more than a minute. Do not compare this to Spinal Tap or Rutles or Full Monty - it's unfair on all. The closest comparison is Commitments, and that's not a bad thing. And any movie that can create memories of Blodwyn Pig - a band I never remember to see, but the name lives - well, it shows that somebody in the team knew what it was about. <br /> <br /> A little excitement and thanks for memory. Oh ... and I have another - Small fingers; what about SteelEYE Span ... Spooky TOOTH ... Ten Inch NAILS anyone? (You have to see your movie or you were on the road)
