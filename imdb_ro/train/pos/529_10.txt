This is one of the earliest precious stones that Hollywood has ever produced. - A British World War II soldier, whose plane is about to collapse, has radio contact with a young American woman who helps the brave pilot, knowing he will be dead in a few minutes. For some reason, the man who should definitely be dead, departs from the wreckage, and finally learns that he should report to heaven. When a messenger is sent to ask the pilot to accompany him to heaven, the man refuses and asks for a "day in court" to support his case. Man claims that his situation has changed during the last moments of his earthly life, that he has fallen in love and that he has become a different person who deserves a chance to live. <br /> <br /> The "heavenly court" is a cinematic delight! "Colleague jury announcement" is a climax. The story, just as fantastic, seems to be interesting and will keep you shining for about 2 hours of play. The final scene is simply beautiful and will require a "Kleenex treatment" for most viewers. This movie is in my top 10 favorite top, it has the highest recommendation!
