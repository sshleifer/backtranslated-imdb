Critics are stupid. This movie is fun and smart. I really enjoyed this movie. Why everyone hates this movie so much. I want people to love this movie more than not. Ben Stiller and Jack Black are real comedians and have done a lot of work to make this film. I do not see people out there doing movies like them. So people just have to look at it and not comment it. I like this movie. It's OK through all of this. There are parts that would have been bad, but at least they did. Jerry Stiller would like this because this movie plays the same role as King of Queens. But that's better than that. I can not believe it was rated so low.
