For all the commentators on this page, I have to say that this movie is worth seeing. So it was done in 1972, so what. Fashion in the movie was exactly the same fashion of its time. People who have not studied decade culture would think this movie is a cheese ball. Compared to the modern series, "Left Behind," (which is done for our time right now), she looks moody. However, the only part of the film is fashion, which was over 30 years again in the past. BUT. The message sent to this movie is very strong and well preserved. There is just so much to say, but I refuse to say. (for fear of spoiling them) So go out and see this movie! If you do not like the message you send, then you have problems that require attention!
