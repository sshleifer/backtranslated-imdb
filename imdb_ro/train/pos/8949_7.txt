Vertigo collaborates with Stewart (in his last role as a romantic) and Novak raises this, Stewart's second film "Christmas Movie", at more than half the level of entertainment. The chemistry between the two stars makes a pretty moving experience, and further discovery can be made of the film if witchcraft is seen as a metaphor of private pain that hinders many people's relationships. All in all, a beautiful diversion with legendary stars, 7/10.
