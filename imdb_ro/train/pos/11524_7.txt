This is a strange little movie and I have to agree that there is also a strange action in it. Follows the adventures of a young man who decides to become a famous Las Vegas illusionist, and is in part to follow his dream, partly about the dreams of others and everything about the pain of the show. I thought the movie was charming and has a moment or two of real magic that makes everything worth it. Alan Arkin is great as the magician who has never been and Max's mentoring makes a fun and moving relationship. Not for everyone, probably, but if you like movies about traveling, then I think you like this.
