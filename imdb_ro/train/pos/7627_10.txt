I remember watching this movie some time ago and after seeing 3000 miles to Graceland, it all started to get worse. Why did not he still have a video or DVD? It is sacrilegious that this master of the film has never been released while other garbage has been. Actually, this is John Carpenter's film that was not released. Actually, I've never seen him on TV or watching him. Kurt Russell was the perfect choice for Elvis's role. This is certainly a role he has been born to play. John Carpenter's horror break brought this jewel that I would like the TV to play again. He is well-behaved and well interpreted in terms of singing. Most of Elvis's hits with gusto. I think it was the movie that formed the partnership with Russell and Carpenter, which made them make a series of great movies (Escape from New York, The Thing, Big trouble in little china and Escape from LA Someone has come to release this before someone does the remake or the own version of his life, which I feel will not only erase the king, but will ruin the magic that he has and if he does not get released we will be in the Heartbreak Hotel.
