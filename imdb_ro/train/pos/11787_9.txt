It's a short movie from David Lynch with just 8 minutes, but it has all the ingredients "Lynchian"! It is mysterious, dark, inconclusive, weird and weird; and before the blonde girl starts talking, it's just a little frightening! The soundtrack is exceptional to create this strange atmosphere because it is also sinister and mysterious? <br /> <br /> As for the setting itself, it does not have the "traditional" red curtains, but it has walls of painted purple walls that give it an equally eerily effect. <br /> <br /> The plot is about a girl who is locked in a dark room and she calls for help; then comes another girl who starts talking to her in a mysterious way, saying she's there just for her fault? We do not know what happened or what will happen next? ended unsettled and confusing, because a good Lynch movie has to end! <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful short, despite some amateur actors. Girls are professional actresses, but I think their action could have been better in this short.
