Although I agree that it is a good film, but not great, for many of the reasons that other posters mentioned, I still enjoy. One of the reasons is music: I would draw attention to the cool looks of Candoli - Conte and Pete - in a well-organized night club scene. These guys were two of the best jazz trumpets of their day and managed to beat Jimmy Stewart's mind by playing a hysterical trumpet duet, a trumpet in each of Stewart's ears. Candolis played so well, though I suspect that the real music for that scene was later called by the two. I do not know much about George Duning, who gets the credit for music (otherwise than he seems to have worked with the three knights on more than one occasion), but casting the Candoli brothers as jazz warlocks was a real touch.
