What a wonderful heart heats the television movie. The story tells of a five-year-old girl who has lost her father and finds it impossible to cope. Her mother is also very disturbed. Only a miracle can improve her unhappiness. What all viewers hope to materialize. Samantha Mathis is brilliant as the girl's mother, as she was like the "Jack and Sarah" nurse, which is worth watching if you like both Samantha Mathis and happy; years of tearing jerking movies! Ellen Burstyn is, as always, a delightful grandmother in this auction and a magnificent film. Jodelle Ferland (the youngest of five) is charming and most convincing actress. The film is based on a true story that makes it so exciting. "Mermaid" is a tribute to milk of human goodness, which is clearly illustrated and clearly is still around us in this difficult world in which we live. "Mermaid" gives us all hope, realizing that there are many wonderful people in the world with much love to give. James Robson Glasgow Scotland U.K.
