So, I consider myself pretty big in the anime scene, with very few shows, it just will not work. This show, however, I would recommend for anyone. most original series so far have just about everything we can ask for. A side story, to say so, about an unconditional love NOT to be admitted, a very gentle comedy and a very good combination of vocal expression (Japanese and American translation). not for the terribly funny look, it would be just another anime. More or less, as I have noticed, "I love it or I hate it", very few people I saw introduced to this series will end up with dissatisfaction with it. The original at the base, with everything you can ask an afternoon, bet the house in this series. I'm ready to assure you that you will enjoy it.
