Henry Fonda captures wonderfully what I have long thought of as Abraham Lincoln. He's a villain. Through Fonda's performance, we are condemned to believe (Abraham Lincoln was an old man). But by confronting the crowd of rings and especially during court proceedings, one can see that under the outer postures is a brilliant man who has a good knowledge of what is happening around him and how to influence the people around him. <br /> <br /> In this film, Henry Fonda shows he has a very good understanding of how to present humor. It's an aspect of him that has been lost over the years. When he says stories and jokes, he has a perfect time. There is a sequence in the process that made me laugh quite hard. He shows this gift again in The Lady Eve in 1940. End of John Ford is absolutely brilliant with Henry Fonda going to the top of a hill and far away a tremendous symbolic storm of civil war. He goes forward in history. The film is fiction, but the deal about Lincoln is extraordinary. It's definitely worth seeing again.
