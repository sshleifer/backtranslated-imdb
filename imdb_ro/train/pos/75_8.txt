Great Vincent Price has made many fantastic horror films, some of which are among the biggest stones of all time. The greatest achievements of the film were undoubtedly his films in the 1960s with films such as Roger Corman's poetic cycle (still the greatest horror cycle of all time), his "Witchfinder General" (1968) Michael Reeves, or "The Last Man on Earth" (1964), which marks the most important moments of this brilliant man's career. The films that made him famous and made him immoral horror icon, but date back to the '50s, with House of Wax (1953), which marks his rise in the top. The "Unknown Magician" of 1954 follows a plot very similar to his predecessor's success. This does not mean, however, that this film is not an original gem, not macabre and absolutely wonderful. As suggested by the lines above, Vincent Price is my favorite actor, and while I personally would not let me lose anything from which man entered, none of my colleagues could miss this gem. The prices interpret Don Galico, a master magician and inventor of undervalued magic devices, whose chief, a dishonest businessman, stole his wife (Eva Gabor) from him. When the boss removes one of Galico's ingenious inventions and gives it to his rival, Grand Rinaldi (John Emery), Galico closes and begins a murderous revenge spree ... We will not love Vincent Price when he is out for revenge ? Some of his most famous and greatest films, such as "The Abominable Phibes" (1971) or "Theater of Blood" (1973), were about absurd and delicious killer crimes, and this previous film in his horror career is another proof no one takes revenge as Vincent Price does. This film provides an excellent role in the lead role for Price, which, as always, delivers brilliant performance and guarantees fun and scandalous entertainment for every Horror fan. Another one has to see my colleagues Price.
