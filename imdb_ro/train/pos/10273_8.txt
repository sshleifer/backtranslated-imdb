I'm a big fan of movies where people are becoming conned, and House of Games is almost the pinnacle of the genres of "movies in which people become conned." In short, it's an extraordinary thriller that keeps you on the edge of the chair, offering interesting multi-level characters and never really revealing what's going on, throwing many twists and surprises to completely suppress what you've just seen. The film is the public on many occasions, and despite the fact that we know it; it's still difficult to guess where it's going and every twist comes as a surprise. As I mentioned, I'm a big fan of movies in movies, and this plot follows a female psychiatrist who receives a patient with a huge debt due to another colleague. Then she goes to the player in an attempt to help her patient, and on the road it happens in the art of reading people to pull a cone. The gaming house breathes an easy atmosphere and David Mamet is doing well in setting up his movie in the underground areas of the city. The film is also acting well, with everyone involved bringing the lives and credibility of their characters with the greatest skill. Joe Mantegna plays the role of con man in the heart of the movie and, although his performance is a little thin, he is always solid and credible as the bastard of the play. Lindsay Crouse plays with him as a psychiatrist seduced by his work and again is credible in her role. She can not be the greatest eyewitness but at least she can act. The way in which the film is plotting is the main star of the show and you will no doubt be amazed several times as to how the movie constantly manages to amaze and deceive the spectator. Sometimes it's almost like we're in the thick of action and we're condemned by the cone in the movie. Another great thing about this movie is how it shows the audience how to draw some cones, which is useful if you're interested in making twenty dollars, say. Overall, House of Games is a true first-tune ride.
