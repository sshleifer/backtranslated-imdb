This is one to follow several times. The excellent writing shows that they had to live this story or to know someone who did it because they beat him. Freebird made me come back and laugh at my poor youth. The title was a great choice. Great movie, setting, story, soundtrack and characters. It's a bumpy ride, but it would be a shame to find the dove like that. Strange on the bone, like the Trailer Park Boys in the UK If you've never seen TPB, make an idea if you like this movie. You'll thank me. I hope to see more of these characters in other movies. Continuation? It could be done. There is much more in the world that I would like to see through their eyes.
