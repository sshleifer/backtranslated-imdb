As many commentators have noted, the movie version differs little from the story version of the story. I have never seen the scenic version of the story and therefore I have a more favorable review of the film than many other commentators. Perhaps Richard Attenborough was not the best choice for the director of the film, but the film is still a fun story of many dancers trying to do great time in choreographer Michael Douglas. The film is right, in that it does not select any of the famous actors or artists who end up in the final group of attempts. In this way, our attention is directed to the movements of dancers and the stories and individual battles as they unfold during a marathon test day. Douglas is probably not the best choice for that party. It seems that some songs have been cropped in favor of a new one and the backstage stage story has been added behind the scenes of a romantic bond between the dancer and the choreographer. I have to say that in all fairness this was the weakest part of the film. The repeated inputs that Cassie made during the trials seem to mirror the almost desperate reasons he often makes when engaging in artistic professions in the absence of talent and / or luck. However, this aspect of the movie has been killed in the past and it is curious to see this tired old shoe that hits them once more. The dancing revelations began quite promisingly with the number "I can do this", but then she did a little at different points, while the dancers told their stories. Honestly, their stories differ very little from those in real life who never have a chance like this. *** 4 stars.
