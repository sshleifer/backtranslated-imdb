I wanted to see cut from the day I heard of her, which was sometime last year. Anyway, I saw them today and when the movie started, I thought it started the week rather, but it improved after 10 minutes. I thought the movie was pretty good. but I did not like the way the killer was created, I was thinking right before I was rent that he would probably suck, like urban legends: the final cut, I almost died. most of what was done in the last decade of the UL had to be improved. CUT is 100 times better than UL: final cut. The best part of the CUT is murder and death scenes. The killer hits MO F *** ING ASS. <br /> <br /> I give you 8 out of 10
