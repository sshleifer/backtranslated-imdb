This is one of those movies - such as Dave, American Dreamer and Hero Local - that have the interest of the audience again. Light films rarely win Oscars, but who casts for Soapdish deserves one. Even after someone has seen the movie and knows what's going on, it's still nice to watch the different facets of the plot develop. True, all drama is melodrama; but that suits a movie full of soap opera. My favorite line comes from Whoopi Goldberg: "Why can not I write like that?" I think it is regrettable that the censors of the television and the site insist on this unnecessary sanitation.
