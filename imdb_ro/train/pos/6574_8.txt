This could be difficult for some people to get in, being accustomed to Hollywood production styles. The director is uninspired, apparently simply a shooting of the scene, and the sound quality is bad here and there (the rush of people's clothing occasionally competes with their voices, etc.). friends and I started watching without knowing what to expect and the first scene almost put us down. It looked very dizzy and cheesy. Then we took the footprint of the content and started to enjoy ourselves. It's very funny, despite a horn. Sure, give her a chance if you appreciate a great dialogue. Also, Helena Bonham Carter is adorable, of course.
