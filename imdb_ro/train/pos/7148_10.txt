This movie is a strong recommendation. This is a boy, Stanley Yelnats (Shia LeBeouf), who is wrongly convicted of a murder and sent to Camp Green Lake, a detention center for boys. There, he is forced to dig holes 5 meters deep and 5 meters in the diamiter. As he meets, he meets the other boys in the camp (Zero, Magnet, Armpit, Squid, X-Ray and ZigZag). Everybody digs, not to "build the caracer", but to discover Kate Barlow's treasure. Throughout the movie (and the book), Stanley learns more about the past, more about himself and more about digging holes. I give this movie a 9.5, because I am very pretentious when it comes to movie books (I want the movie to follow the book EXACT). But it still happened well.
