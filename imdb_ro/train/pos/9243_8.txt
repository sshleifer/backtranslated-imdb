He does not listen to the many fiery and ridiculous comments he made on this movie ... he just put on the ninja movies that my friends are as good as they are! <br /> <br /> Yes, it's silly, yes, act and script are often absolutely atrocious, but with the gum - it's so much bloody fun! In fact, as is often the case for B movies, the terrible "act" (which is really one of the worst things I've ever had the joy to watch!) And actually "just serve to raise the level of joy ten times. Obviously, battle scenes are the main attraction in this, however, and for the most part I have the pleasure of saying, they are very well choreographed, especially the end of the showdown during which time we notice that ninja is not usually constrained by normal gravity laws ...) <br /> <br /> Trust me if you are a fan of ninja movies and you have not yet seen Sakura Killers , then you really miss what is, in my opinion, one of the real jewels in the genre's crown.
