Alain Chabat supports this film as an original idea, but the theme of reluctant lovers who eventually takes it together is as old, if not older than Shakespeare. Chabat is a "vieux garcon", happily unique and do not want any member of the opposite sex to disturb his life. She has a problem, 5 sisters and a matrix mother - G7 - who decides she should get married. Enter the enchanting, charming Charlotte Gainsbourg and what should be a simple plan. Charlotte must present Chabat's friend and then not return to the wedding day. Stop talking about marriage at G7. Of course, the best set plans have a habit of spiraling out of control. There are very strong supporting roles from Lafont as Mom and Osterman as the tight fisted brother of Gainsbourg. <br /> <br /> There are some fantastic scenes, which Charlotte must bring to charm, then revolt the family. The French Brotherhood with English.
