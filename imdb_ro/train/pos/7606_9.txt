The first series of Lost started with a bang ... literally and slowly fell in pace. This would have taken some viewers, and people who started looking halfway would be either bored or simply confused. <br /> <br /> I would recommend people to the new world of Lost to just look at the beginning and not to go through the slower episodes. Action all the time is excellent, but why have 5 series planned ... WHY? All this means there will be no answers for at least 4 years, oh well, I will continue to watch if it keeps tension and the dialogue will flow.
