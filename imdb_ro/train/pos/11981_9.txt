"HOUSE FULL", in my opinion, is an absolute classic ABC! I'm not sure if I've never seen each episode, but I still enjoyed it. One of my favorite episodes is where I get married Jesse (John Stamos) and Rebecca (Lori Loughlin). If you want to know how fun it was, you should have seen it for yourself. It was two floors, so you must have seen both sides. Another favorite episode is where Jesse, Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and Michelle (Mary Kate & Ashley Olsen) get stuck in a gas station on Michelle's birthday. You should also have seen for yourself if you want to know how and why this happened. I have many more that I like. Everybody always did a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, although it can now be seen in syndication, I recommend that you catch only if it is extinguished from the air forever.
