I looked at this show as a child and I liked it! I saw her when she came to Toonami YEARS ago .... Sheesh, she's so old! I was supposed to be 13 or 14 when it came ... But anyway, it had a big line of plot and I'm one of the girls' girls who saw (and ADORED) Sailormoon and I really enjoyed it. The animation was not the best .... It was pretty funny in some parts, in fact, and the acting voice was EXTREMELY lame at first, but it was a good watch and I woke up sucked every day. br /> <br /> The Samurai / Ronin Warriors Troika is a classic and one of my ex. Go Ryo !!!!
