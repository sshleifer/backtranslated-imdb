This wonderful, pleasant noir boasts a top casket and many memorable scenes. Great distraction is the total ignorance of authentic accents. The Spanish characters in the film are interpreted by a Frenchman (Boyer), a Belgian (Francen), a Greek (Paxinou) and a Hungarian (Lorre)! And by the end, everything on Bacall should be an English aristocrat! Despite these absurdities, the performances are very good - especially those of Paxinou and Lorre. But the scene where Boyer, Paxinou and Lorre meet and speaks in wild accents is a real hoot! And I think, seeing how they were alone, should have spoke in Spanish anyway! It seems strange that the Warner Brothers could not find spanish-speaking actors in Los Angeles! Of course, Hollywood often had a policy of "any old accent" - the other favorite is Greta Garbo (Swedish) as Mata Hari (Dutch) who falls in love with a Russian soldier played by a Mexican (Ramon Novarro). Perhaps he should have received Novarro as a "Confidential Agent" - it would have been great in the role of Boyer or at least in Francin (which would have saved a lot on the dark make-up budget).
