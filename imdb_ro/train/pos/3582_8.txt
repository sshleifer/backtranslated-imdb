Here's another 80-year movie that most people do not know exactly. This slow, scenic story (the picturesque landscapes of Montana are amazing and reminded me of Costner's recent "Open Range", which also starred Robert Duval), and the emotionally satisfying film is the perfect movie to watch late one night when you can not sleep or on a Sunday afternoon. Those who are in the right condition will be treated to a detailed and intimate look at the pain of a single family and how they will return together when the youngest son accidentally shoots and kills the eldest son in time what hunting. The performances are all top and quietly tinted. Glenn Close, Robert Duval and Wilford Brimley are perfect in their interpretation, just like all supporting actors and young actors. I especially liked how Cain (who, unfortunately, did not direct anything at this moment, except for the first "Young Guns") gives us a little noise in everyone's personal joy. We do not see how death affects the younger brother or parents, but also the middle-confused sister, the tangled uncle, his crazy wife, and the girlfriend's dead girlfriend. What we essentially get here is the rural response from the Western world to "The Common People". There are also nuances of David Lynch's "The Straight Story" in some of the lower-right stoic morals of the people described here, and also in the blows of hitting the clothes they live in. This is one of the best and most realistic "tears-jerkers" of the era and a good little breakthrough for quality film hunters there.
