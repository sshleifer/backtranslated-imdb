In my humble opinion, this film did not receive the recognition it deserves. Robert Redford lives next to me here in Provo, Utah, at Sundance. I liked most of my work and this was my favorite. I'm sorry that more people did not appreciate it. My grandmother was an avid reader and read the book years before going out on the big screen. She gave it to me to read after I saw the movie together. The film and the book hit an emotional place in my heart and I was crying a few days after I saw the movie. Sometimes love is not enough to prevent loved ones from hurting themselves. We see this in our own family relationships, yet our love and our families and their stories support generations of time. The cinema was perfect and stunning - I was amazed at its beauty and how well it brought to life the words of the author of the book, Norman Maclean: "But when I'm alone in the light of the half of the canyon, all the existence seems to be destroyed in a being with my soul and memories, and the sounds of Big Black Foot River and a four-constant rhythm and the hope that a fish will finally rise, all things merge into one and a river passes through the River was cut by the great flood in the world, and it flows over the stones in the basement of time, some of the stones are drops of endless rain, under the rocks are the words, and some of these words are theirs, I am haunted by the waters. "These words taken from book and talk at the end of the movie (by Robert Redford, who talks as Norman Maclean) are basically scriptures, in my opinion. Any possible defects in the movie are overshadowed it's the beauty and grace of storytelling and cinema. It was nice!
