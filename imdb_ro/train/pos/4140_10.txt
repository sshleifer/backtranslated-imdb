What amazing, funny and original performance. The movie that starts with the hysterical Julie Brown (Queen's Got A Gun) is perfect. Add Amy Hill (All American Girl-Grandma Kim) who plays a lesbian who always wonders with my partner and business partner (Asian-WOK-DON T RUN) We laughed harder during this show than any other that I I've ever seen (including Newhart - one of my favorite shows of all time) If you like movies like "Naked Gun" and "Airplane" - you'll love this series! Cindy Williams is going to make an ugly act with a bowling head down. It's great to see an actress like Cindy Williams can play as he does, as well as many surprises over his short rounds I can only hope it will be released in a day on DVD with many special special features.
