I entered my first comment on this movie almost five years ago. Then the ideas presented in the film seemed mostly fictitious, if indeed they could ever have appeared. No more. Now, The Running Man politics, society and media seem very close to home really. Consider the following factors, which were largely absent in 1987 (The Running Man that came out today): Looking, as Richard Dawson's character, Damon Killian characterizes, "traditional morality." CHECK <br /> <br /> Entertainment in the form of extreme reality, including pain, fear and discomfort from competitors. CHECK <br /> <br /> Rooms everywhere. CHECK <br /> <br /> Trafficked citizens for the sake of government, controlled by a centralized computer system, supplemented with barcode passports ("traveling voyages" in the film) and sanctioned under the guise of national security. CHECK <br /> <br /> An intense blending, adjacent to government incest and media. CHECK <br /> <br /> Graphics generated by the computer that is advanced enough to handle real images (such as the "digital maturation" of Ben Richards's double image). CHECK <br /> <br /> Jailing of conscientious objectors or detractors of the current administration. CHECK <br /> <br /> Signaling an economy that widening the gap between the rich and those who are not so rich; an increasing number of marginal groups, responding to the subduing stifling of the great government; civil disturbances that occur under or near the surface of almost any major public event, regardless of its origin or intent. CHECK, CHECK, CHECK <br /> <br /> Then again, maybe it's just a movie based on a novella Stephen King. But to be safe, I move to Switzerland.
