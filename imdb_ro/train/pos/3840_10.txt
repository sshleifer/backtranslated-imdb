Jerome Crabbe plays the lead role in this film. I've seen this movie 6 times and I'm not tired of it yet. This movie is similar to Flesh + Blood in some ways. Gerald Soetman is a great writer. He wrote all the Dutch films by Paul Verhoeven. Paul Verhoeven is one of the greatest directors. I've seen all the movies except Showgirls. My mother does not like that much, but I do not agree. I think all his movies are a walk to watch especially Total Recall and Basic Instinct. Jerry Goldsmith made some of his films, including Total Recall, Basic Instinct and Hollow Man. I wish Jerry Goldsmith never died. Dutch films are different but still enjoyable.
