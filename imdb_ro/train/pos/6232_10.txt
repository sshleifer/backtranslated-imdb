One of the best films of Fred Astaire and Giner Rogers. Extraordinary music by Irving Berlin. Solid support from Randolph Scott, Harriet Nelson, Lucille Ball, Betty Grable, Frank Jenks and Astrid Allwyn. Wonderful songs include "Going alone", "Let's face the music" and "My eggs in a basket." The last song is introduced by Astaire who plays a jazz piano and then a nice dance with Rogers. Rogers also sings "Find Gravy" among the singers. Harriet Nelson (then Hilliard) sings two beautiful songs and plays Rogers sister. "Get Thee Behind Me" is a song that sticks to you for days. She also sings "Where are you?" Dazed and fast rhythm, this entry into the Astaire-Rogers series is one of the best. The classic and amazing finale, "Facing Music and Dance," is one of the most famous of their numbers. Rogers bears one of the biggest dresses in the history of the movie ... a consistent number of sparkles that spins around his legs as he dances (weighted hem) and is also easy to see. Just gorgeous. This is the number that Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters re-created in Pennies from Heaven. Randolph Scott seems a strange choice as Astaire's girlfriend, but he also appeared in Roberta with Irene Dunne. Luckily he does not try to sing or dance. It seems that Grable and Ball had bigger parts in 1936, but they have some scenes and have little impact. Allwyn has a bigger role, but it's okay. Rogers has one of the best solo numbers in the series with "Let Yourself Go" ... Jazzy and thumping is a great song. /> <br /> Fun all the way, although I'm tired of "We joined the Navy" for the third time ....
