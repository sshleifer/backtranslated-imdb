The title caught my attention and then I wondered what would happen in the plot, as we have seen so many "super-people" movies in these years ... and, in fact, I really enjoyed it because there were a number of unusual fun scenes that I did not expect. Uma Thurman played as average in the role of G-Girl. Surprisingly, I could again look at my fingers on the wide screen (just like at the beginning of Kill Bill). Luke Wilson played the idiot everyday that meets the big woman, even though I could get into his situation. If you want fun, you should definitely watch the adventures of G-Girl and Matt, especially to cheer your partner. 7/10 in my collection.
