War Inc. It's a funny but funny movie. The actors are full of love, the movie is also nice, but I do not know how to describe the plot. I'll later go into the plot. This is a movie with some strange casting choices. Aside from John Cusack as a kickman, whom I saw years ago in Grosse Point naked, I liked it. <br /> <br /> Here we have Hilary Duff playing a Russian pop star named Yonica Babyya or something like that. Her character is weird. There is a scene where she picks up a scorpion on her pants. And it hits Hauser (Cusack). There is a final twist involving the two characters. Makes sense. That's the only casting choice I'm into. Because it's just weird. The whole movie is weird. But sometimes incredibly funny and never bored. Here we have some of the best actors out there. Excluding Miss Duff. It's not great. But here we have John Cusack, Marisa Tomeii, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley. Do you see what I mean? This is the story of a man named Hauser (Cusack). He is sent to a city in the Middle East to hit a man named Omar Sheriif (not the actor). While trying to handle her own personal problems, she has to help the wedding of a popstar (played by Hilary Duff). And he falls in love with a news reporter (played by Marisa Tomeii). However, there is something about popstar. Hauser is disgusted by her. There is a scene where she plays a song for him and then throws up. Twisting at the end of the film reveals somehow. The twist thing is that I saw how I see her coming. But that does not matter. This is a strange, funny and fun comedy. I like most actors. So, how could I not recommend it? War, Inc.: 3.5 / 5
