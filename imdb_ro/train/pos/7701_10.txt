It has always been one of my favorite movies and will always be. In the last few years I have become a strange Sci-Fi of 50/60, trying to collect all the best that were made then. I like a lot of things about how some of them might be as technically correct. Colors and sets make me go too much. It's a shame when I re-do some of these good old movies; they almost always tangle it, - just look at the recent repetition of the Day in which the Earth stopped, it's a complete garbage! Forbidden Planet is one of the landmark movies of all time, and now it's trying to do it again and change my mind to think about what's new! In my opinion, some things like classic fantastic movies should just be left alone to be what they are, classic examples of great attempts to tell simple stories and give people an emotion in the process. Once they added all the techno-carp we have now, the film seems to be more dog meat at the Hollywood sausage factory - nothing special. By the way, I notice that the forbidden astronaut's uniforms in the Planet were also used for the "Queen of the Cosmic Space"! That tells you that the budgets were a little lower then, did not you? Hey, less money and better movies, hmmm .... Great performances in this film from Leslie Nielsen, in a serious role, and Anne Francis, Walter Pidgeon (who has always been one of my favorite actors), Earl Holiman, and, of course, Robby robot! The special effects are fantastic, and the story is not far. This is a fantastic experience!
