I can not understand the negative comments about this movie. Yes, it's a typical story for boys, it meets a love story, but it's done with such a flair and polish that time just flies. Henstridge (talking about winning the lottery pool with gen-pool!) Is it as magnetic and appealing as ever (who says the movie's golden age is dead?) And Vartan keeps his own life. the two leaderships; the movie is the most vibrant when sharing a scene - many! It's so good that you find yourself willing to meet ... Ignore negative comments - if you feel a little blue, watch this move, you will feel much better. If you are already happy then you will be euphoric. (PS: I am 33 years old, male from Great Britain and a hopeless romantic still looking for his princess ...)
