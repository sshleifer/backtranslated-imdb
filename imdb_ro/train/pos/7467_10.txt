David Aames is a rich guy who lives in New York City. When his sleeping partner, Julie Gianni, gets very jealous after David falls for the Spanish beauty of Sofia, he takes David in the car and tells him he's the only guy he loves and wants to be, but seeing he's in love with Sofia , she decides to commit suicide with David in the car with her, raising a bridge. David survives the accident, but he remains with a disfigured face. He is then accused of killing Julie. The thing is that David does not know what is real and what is not, as he continues to have these strange dreams (most of them are actually nightmares) and flashbacks, some of them simply do not have them sense. Everything will soon return to him, though he begins to learn the truth. Well, there is a top star cast here, including Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Kurt Russell, Jason Lee and Noah Taylor, who all provide good performances in the movie. In the film, everyone has devised different things about characters, such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc., indeed. There is also a cameo in the brilliant film, Steven Spielberg. Vanilla Sky is a well made, different, exciting and original film that will let you talk a lot about it after it's over. It's not just a thriller, it's a real psychological thriller. The movie trailer is very good, but the movie is so different from what could be done. It was conducted very well and there were some very good scenes here. All in all, a nice movie that should really be paid attention. They are sure they have recently made many movies, "They're dead, if not who's dead."
