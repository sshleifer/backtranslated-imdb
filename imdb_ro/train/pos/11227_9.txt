Hidden Frontiers - It's More Than Fiction Of Fans - It's a well thought out and organized series that keeps alive and growing World Star Trek world. From a small entertainment project until now to a well-known net; Hidden fronts have a bit of something for each trek fan out of it. Late Star Trek: Next Generation / DS9 and Voyager Hidden Frontier tackle issues and issues raised in other Star Trek series with established stories using well-developed characters, plots and springs. Star Trek Hidden Frontier has taken over the stories from the social context that Gene Roddenberry has failed to bring on the screen and showed character development in long-term space missions - real things happening near spheres as well as space warfare and conflicts exciting - addicts of being know and love. Written in a "Green Screen" studio; Hidden fronts bring a foray full of ordinary people on the screen and in your hearts. The great ensemble of actors plays well together and devotes time and energy to the project. The inventive use of green screen, props, make up and costume make the fun and credibility of the Star Trek Hidden Frontier worlds. The Hidden Frontier went where few passers-by went into the world of fictional science and thrived once they got there. Hidden Frontier offers a great bonus feature of a well-thought-out website with exciting discussion forums, creative, production and action staff, and a weekly fun chat. We recommend a lot of time to upload and watch.
