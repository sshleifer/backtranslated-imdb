A wonderful movie. You are held in a death squad once you get involved in the story. A successful dentist, Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle), is broken into a career crisis balancing career with his family. He notices his former roommate Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) and wants to reach the base. He discovers that Charlie, who has lost his wife and family in the 9-11 attack on America, is no longer in touch with reality ... choosing to involve his mind with his favorite past music and video games. The former roommate re-establishes his friendship and strengthens his old ties. Johnson has his friend Angela Oakhurts (psychologist Liv Tyler) to try to bring Charlie out of his pain ... but Alan manages to make his friend come out of his deep darkness. Jada Pinkett Smith plays Johnson's wife. Writer and director Mike Binder plays Charlie's lawyer / tutor. Also in distribution: Saffron Burrows, Donald Sutherland, Adell Modell and Robert Klein. A great music singer with Bruce Springsteen, Graham Nash, Pear Jam and The Pretenders. NOTE: I have never been a fan of Sandler; but I found him impressed in this role. In some of the scenes, I thought aloud ... why it was never approached to play singer / songwriter Bob Dylan in a biopic.
