Interestingly interesting West from a director who had some colleagues in the genre. Like the other photos from Anthony Mann, The Far Country combines a storyline with a pot of pot, with a good knowledge of landscapes that influence. Both play among some of Mann's pacadas, such as honor, integrity, betrayal and, of course, death! The story is seen by hobbies partner Jeff Webster {James Stewart} and Ben Tatum {Walter Brennan} traveling to Oregon Territory with a herd of cattle. Aware of the booming gold boom, it plans to make an orderly profit by selling cattle to a town in Klondike. Arriving in Skagway, I find the self-appointed judge Mr. Gannon {John McIntire} ready to meet Justice with Webster because Webster broke the law, whether it is an honest reason along the way. In the penalty, Gannon takes the flock of their partners, but they steal them back and head over the Canadian border to Dawson - with Gannon and his followers. Here beautiful women and a gentle and wicked city will fill the destinies of all those involved. Interesting from the beginning to the end, The Far Country benefits greatly from the {anti} hero of James Stewart on hold and Mann's slick direction of the tight Borden Chase script. The movie by William H. Daniels is superlative, has not made any favor by printing the current DVDs, and the movie has some surprises and "will it get used to"? basics, spinning the spectators. Paying dividends for re-clocks for hardcore fans is still an essential vision for the first time-lapse to venture into the wonderful but dark world of Anthony Mann and James Stewart. 8/10
