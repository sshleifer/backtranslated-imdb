A few years ago I added an IMDB commentary on the "The Real McCoys" series. I said then and I repeat now that it was a charming, fun and fun show, well-behaved with wonderful features. I recently saw on DVD four episodes of old PLUS the 2000 Meeting with Richard Crenna, Kathy Nolan and Tony Martinez. As another writer mentioned, it is curious that Lydia Reed (Hassie) and Michael Winkelman (Little Luke) were not mentioned, but they are likely to be tracked through SAG or AFTRA. The show's meeting was well done and gave us a lot of unknown knowledge in the show. Some of the information I did not receive was whether Kathy Nolan or not regretted giving up the show in an unpleasant controversial dispute that left Luke a "widow" last year, which was not very good . Nolan continued to make a comedy bomb called "Broadside," about Pacific nurses in the Second World War. Take him? Broadside? No, it's not funny. Unlike TV TRASH, which is subtle, meaningful and violent on television that undermines our values, Real McCoys has fun with decent values ​​and wonderful human beings. And I thank all those involved, including the creator, Irving Pinkus, for bringing it to my family. I never missed it.
