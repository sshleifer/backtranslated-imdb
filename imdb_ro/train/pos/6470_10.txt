This is one of the best pants our "Gang". Spanky is very cute and funny, and the kids she gets at the babysit are also hilarious. Tiny Spanky is forced to watch all their little brothers. Spanky's photo, wearing his giant toy knife, when asked to worry about older elders, was shot in baby carts, being distracted by various things hanging from the fishing pole. is invaluable, just like his answer - "Hey, where do you get these stuff - I do not care about kids." The little one who says "remarkable" throughout the movie, all the beautiful gangs, and Spanky tells the kids "everything about Tarzan" is added to make it one of the best "Gangs" you'll ever see.
