I am a child at heart, I like to watch cartoons, I do! I remember watching Bugs Bunny when I was a kid, it was still my favorite. I thought about a man, it was a "new" show on TV, and my dad said, "Bugs Bunny, I remember watching him when I was younger" and I like "Dad, Bugs does not exist when were younger. " So I think he's definitely pleased with more than a generation, possibly 3. I like the show is great for kids and adults, OK, everyone. It is very funny, both my husband and I, both in our years, and love watching our performances, and we are not bothering to re-run. This show brings back a lot of memories, happy. I also like Christmas with Tweety like Tiny Tim, she's cute. I can not choose my favorite character Looney Toons, because they have changed over the years. When I was young, I was Bugs of course Porky Pig. Pepe's cool, I always love him. In fact, I have to say all my favorite ones. I give this show a 10 out of 10, because it is a great show for all ages, very funny, the voice acting is incredible, the only flaw is that unfortunately it ended 2 decades ago, but the re-runs are great!
