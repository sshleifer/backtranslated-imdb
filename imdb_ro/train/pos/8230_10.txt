Eglimate (= Crimes) is a story about the tiny crimes that everyday people commit that in a crazy scenario could lead to absolute disaster. An acting like Ketty Konstadinou and Maria Kavogianni showed a new dimension and talent and gave us incredible moments of "guilty" laughter. Each spectator seemed to recognize the evil side of their self in one of the characters or at least part of their own self that they want to have. The actors of all ages who played bigger and smaller parties gained an equally large space in the heart of the Greek audience. My personal favorites (with the exception of the first two I mentioned) are Vassilis Haralambopoulos, Athinodoros Prousalis and Stavros Nikolaidis, but so many amazing actors have been going through some episodes from time to time. Everyone in the world understands the Greek language should find a way to watch this series, even if it was more than 5 years than on television. In Greece, they repeat the series (ANT1) at every chance, such as in the summer or afternoon. We will never forget Eglimata or some casting crew!
