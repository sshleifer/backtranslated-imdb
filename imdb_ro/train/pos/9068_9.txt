I thought the children in the movie were wonderful. I'm dealing with children in the age group and I thought their behaviors were very credible. I had a problem with the private parties made by the 5-year-old. I did not think this comment was necessary and, in fact, slightly reduced my opinion about the film. <br /> <br /> I think Luke Benward is a star. I'd like to see more about him on the big screen. I liked his reactions to the situations in which he was. Often children in this age group do things without thinking about the consequences. Almost all actors have done this throughout the film. Also, I think the bullying message needs to be examined more in films with this age group. It is a major problem in today's schools. The end was quite unexpected. Billy's thoughts of winning or not winning were very surprising. How he handled the situation was excellent. Too often today's children are not willing to compromise. The actors in this film have shown that compromise is an important part of life.
