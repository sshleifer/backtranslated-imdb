Often, laugh at the amusing and funny game about sex, family and Beverly Hills milk laughs more of the zip code than it can be seen from the days of Granny and Jed Clampett. Plot the centers on two drivers who bet that one of them can pat their patron (both alone or soon to be single ladies, quite sexy - Bisset and Woronov), first. If Manuel wins, his boyfriend will pay his debts to a violent street band - if he loses, he'll have to play the man down from his friend! <br /> <br /> Lots of agitated dialogue, physically sick enough humor, etc. But a lot of comedy is just below the surface. Bartel is memorable as a very sensitive member of the family, who ends up taking his sexy adolescent granddaughter on a missionary trip to Africa for one year. <br /> <br /> Love Fun.
