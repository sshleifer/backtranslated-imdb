All dogs go to Heaven are one of the best movies I've ever seen. I saw it for the first time when I was 3. Now I'm 12 and I rent it, it makes me think about things and it brings me so many memories, these were the "days". I like music, I like when Charlie gets to heaven, I like the song "Let me be surprised." I like Charlie and his voice, Bert Reynolds can only interpret Charlie's voice so great. I like this movie, the first one is the best, because it is so original and wonderful. It even brings memories that no one can describe, not even me. If I could go back in those days. I like the characters. If this is how memories come back when I imagine how I feel when I'm 19, I hope I can look at it when I'm older. When I saw it for the first time, I never knew I was going to look back at her and feel it, I hope it will be available to look. I'm so happy that this movie was done and the amazing idea came to mind and heart. On a scale of 1-10 I would give it a perfect 10. It's an amazing film. It's so hard to explain this feeling, when I get older and if I have children, I hope I can feel this feeling.
