The best thing about this movie is that it's fun. It is full of humorous characters and exciting situations, starting with the crazy, innocent Pecker (lovingly played by Edward Furlong), who likes to photograph almost everything he sees in everyday life. Other great characters include Pecker Matt's friend ("he's a thief, but he's really a nice guy"), Pecker's sister Chrissy (who is sugar-dependent) and Pecker's Catholic grandmother, a statue of the Virgin Mary in her room. The movie easily makes a point about how everyday life has many riches to offer and manages to do this without being too hard to do. There is always a risk when making messages about the value and dignity of "common people," sliding in a kind of reverse "more holy than you" - but "Pecker" avoids these traps, allowing the public to reach the point in time allowing enough breathing space for viewers to compare this message with their own thoughts on the subject. Recommend the movie especially because it's really fun.
