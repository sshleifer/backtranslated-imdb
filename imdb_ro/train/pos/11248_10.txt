Illudere (to deceive) comes from the Latin word "ludere" (to play), so you are warned about "spy game" as a cruel and yet elaborate and intelligent activity (!) Which comes from a complex and as it seems absurd and in vain history, whatever it is; and yet I feel fascinated by the mechanism of betrayal and loyalty, the raw material of any relationship, from personal to social; after many years ago, I was ABLE to finish the book was a revelation! At first I was so bored if not for the surprising style of writing (I started to love Le Carre after that novel). The main character does not oppose at all: he made a choice to redeem his weakness by following the path of faith to friendship and love or does not he? After this novel, you can clearly understand Green's darker version, "Our Man in Havana," written by LeCarre with "The Tales of Panama"; there's no game left, either ending either in tragedy or in a grotesque comic, or both. There is no Smiley here to maintain decent human qualities in "service," or at least there is no point in presenting it in this case. The BBC has done a superb work with these series of LeCarre's novels: actors are excellent, as well as locations and sets; of course, the script here is brilliantly adapted. Be warned, though, even if someone can find it ridiculous, the taste to taste is bitter.
