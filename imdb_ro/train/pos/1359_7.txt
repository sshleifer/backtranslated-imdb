I'm working in a library and I'm looking forward to enjoying this movie when it came out five years ago. Well, I really liked Parker Posey (she's a wonderful actress) and Omar Townsend was very cute as her boyfriend (he could only act when he looked like he cared) but the movie was bad . It was not funny, cute or too much. Posey kept the film on the waterline with her energy. But she taught Dewey OVERNIGHT Decimal System and then plunged tons of books into the rhythm of music? !!!! ??? Come on! I also had a problem with the way she looked when she became a full-time librarian at the end - hair in a glass, glasses, no sense of humor - can we let this stereotype go? It's worth seeing for Posey and Townsend, but that means. The TV series was much better.
