If there's a genre I've never been fan of, it's biopic. Always misleading, filled with false information, dramatic scenes and tricks around, the biopic is almost never done well. Even in the hands of genuinely talented directors like Martin Scorsese (The Aviator) and Ron Howard (A Beautiful Mind), they often make a big drawback for the people they are trying to capture on the screen. Skepticism takes place hype with most biopics heading to the big screen, and Notorious Bettie Page was not different. Some film critics and filmmakers objected to Gretchen Mol, given the role of Betty Page, saying he was no longer a celebrity and did not have a chopstick. I never doubted that Mol managed to manage her role, but I never expected her to be as distant as her performances, as I have just seen in watching the movie. Mol delivers an Oscar-like show as an iconic little girl from the 1950s, who, after an early life of abuse (subtlety described and tasteful, which few directors would probably do) is inadvertently becoming one of the most discussed models of all time. The image covers a lot of ground during 90 minutes of operation, but despite not less than three subplots, there is still a feeling that there might be a small part missing from the story. Co-writer / co-writer Marry Harron and Guinevere Turner's fantastic script are just marked by a situation that is too sudden and not as clear as it should end. However, the two ladies must be given credit to create a near-flawless biopic, which manages to pay tribute to both his subject and the decade he generates with skill. Come to Oscar, Mol, Turner and Harron should be nominated. She will doubt it will happen, though there are certainly not three women who deserve more of them. 9/10
