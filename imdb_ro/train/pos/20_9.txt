"Stanley and Iris" show the triumph of the human spirit. For Stanley, it is the struggle to become literary and to realize its potential. For Iris, it's about finding the courage to love again after you become a widow. The beauty of the film is the dance that Robert DeNiro and Jane Fonda are doing together, starting and stopping before everyone has the skills and the courage to trust each other and move on. In this respect, it gives us a very good image of life often, being credible. Unlike other reviewers, I found that each of the characters you play is consistent across the image. The support is also carefully chosen and adds a depth of character that the main characters receive from supporting performance. All in all an excellent movie. The best thing I get is Hope.
