If you were born around the time when this movie was finished and had a liberal / open house that I had, I'm sure you will be introduced in the early 1980s to walk your parents. watching dirty movies or extremely dirty movies. You know, it's not 100% pornographic, but rather an alchemical mix of real drama and pornography, or you slip into their collection and you slip into the rectangular representation of such a movie in a big dookie machine called VHS. You had to be very quiet and ninja, but still having minor heart failure when pop pop sounds were high when you press the tablet buttons for fear of being discovered. Regardless of the situation, such films have been sent behind your mind, waiting and waiting to be reunited with such visual "art". Needless to say that this movie fits into the description above to a "T". Many people will comment on the extreme sexual nature of the film, but perhaps because of being desensitized, I'm more disturbed by subtleties. The Creator has spoken to us at deeper levels of human carnality and could be considered a real abomination, interracial relationships, bed masturbation, voyeurism, or despair for social status up to crime, pedophilia / homosexuality or repressed sexual nature of elite social females in the 18th century France? Who can say, but despite Mr Borowcysk's taste for living and raw sexuality being the "norm" for his works, I would say that really this film speaks to the viewer at a deeper level about the bestial carnality. Once we've learned this, the story has become more interesting beyond the giddiness of the shock value, and it's worth checking it out.
