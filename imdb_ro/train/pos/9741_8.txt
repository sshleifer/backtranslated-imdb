I was pleasantly surprised to find out that the way to lose friends and to relieve people was not a "treasure" at all, while the trailer had made me wait. I quickly became absorbed in the narrative and remained surrounded by everything. Stimulation of visual humor was, I thought, on the spot. (That is, I have the impression that I have witnessed Pegg's attempts to restore the lost control much "in real time", so to speak.) At other times, it was time to share the reflection of the main protagonists (Pegg and Dunst) how the events affected them, and what had led them to where they were now. All the characters have been well distributed, somewhat interesting in themselves and generally quite pleasant. (Any apparently ruthless ambition was tempered by adequate resilience.) A fun, intelligent scripted, brilliant, gorgeous film that I would strongly recommend.
