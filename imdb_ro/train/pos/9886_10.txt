This is a wonderful visual movie. The images of the Mexican desert, the old mansion, the characters in the picturesque costumes ... all amount to a true artwork. The story seems a bit free, but that's because it does not mean to be realistic. It is taken from a book called "One hundred years of loneliness," and is supposed to be an evocation of the isolated, alternate atmosphere of Latin America "so far from God and so close to the United States." The immense debt that Erendira owes to his grandmother is symbolic of the international task of American debt in Latin America, although there are many layers of significance. If you can appreciate a slow movie and rich movie, this is for you.
