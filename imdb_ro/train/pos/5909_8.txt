I remember when I was five years old and my parents thought it was an ordinary cartoon movie ... unless the bra and bullets started flying. I have to agree that this movie will make everyone and everyone upset because she is ready to discriminate against everyone and everyone ... but the truth is that it's funny as hell because it's deep. I recommend this to anyone who likes the classic cult. Try also Fritz the Cat and Nine Lives by Fritz Cat. If I'm right, Ralph Bashki did that movie too. It involves a cat that goes through hard times with family, streets, jobs, etc. When I was pretty big, we rented all these movies. Since Coonskin was an offensive title at that time, he was also labeled as Street Fighter. Ralph Bashki has also made Cool World with a very young Brad Pitt. The intense traffic was another cartoon that dealt with the street life of a young man.
