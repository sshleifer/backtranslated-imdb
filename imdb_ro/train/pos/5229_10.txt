This movie received horrible ratings from almost all those who voted here, but I'm here to say if you like movies like Dude Wheres My car and Dumb and Dumber this movie is for you. If in movies like Citizen Kane and Casablanca id we have to suggest you at a different angle. Still, I still love this movie and everything about it, even if it's kind of "kiddy," this is one of the few movies that my freindia and I have been able to track over the years and to quote times whenever possible. GROZAV FILM. This film should be AFI number one, because it's so frigginous. The only problem with this movie is that you might have trouble seeing it because it was made for a movie on a channel that does not exist anymore. So I do not know how to get this movie, I like to buy it for dvd but I cant find anywhere. I have still recorded it since it was the first time, you can come if you want and forget that I would sleep. this movie is rocky and that's basically all you need to know.
