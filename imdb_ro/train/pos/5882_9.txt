In Mexico, this movie was only broadcast on PayTV. Dietrich Bonhoeffer's life is a true example of a good German and especially a good man. The conversations between Tukur's character and the Nazi prosecutor are particularly interesting. A war of true ideas: two different Germans, with faith there believe. Bonhoeffer was a very complex person: man, freedom fighter, friend, church, and a great intellectual; Ulrich Tukur is remarkable as Bonhoeffer. I've recommended this movie a lot, especially in these difficult times for the planet. In Mexico, we do not know much about Pastor Bonhoeffer's life and heritage, this is a wonderful work to save a forgotten hero.
