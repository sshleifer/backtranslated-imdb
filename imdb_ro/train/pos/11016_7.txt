It shows good action, but nothing new. This took place in the mountains, which showed a beautiful landscape and so. A man takes a group of mercenaries, drives flying and hits. It could have been called "Rambo Goes to the Rockies". He had a very effective scene at the very first movie, which made me horrible. It's not a bad picture, it's just the same "ol".
