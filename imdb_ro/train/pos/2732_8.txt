Herbet Clutter, Bonnie and their teenage children, Kenyon and Nancy, were very satisfied and respected in their small town in Holcomb, Kansas - but in the early hours of November 14, 1959, all four were brutally killed. Rather unexpectedly, the crime made an impression on the author, Truman Capote, who rushed to the scene and followed the case to his conclusion. The result was THE COLLECTION SERIES. Controversial, shocking and extremely well written, he has become an international best seller and remains a milestone for crime writers to this day. The 1967 version of Capote's film is almost as remarkable as the book itself. Filmed in black and white in many of the real-life locations, it is of little documentary quality, frozen and detached - and the total distribution is exceptional. This is the film that Robert Blake's reputation as actor is resting, and deserving. As killer Perry Smith, Blake catches you between deep dissatisfaction and shock of unexpected sympathy; is performance from start to finish. Like Richard Hickock, Scott Wilson is no less good. Like Capote's book, the movie opens with Smith and Hickock as they travel to Kansas and bring them to Clutter's house-just to suddenly block the past murder to pinpoint the investigation that eventually led to their arrest and condemnation. The center of the film has always been the moment when we finally see what happened in Clutter's house; filmed in the Clutter house itself, is a spiny, horrible and profoundly disturbing sequence. Director and writer Richard Brooks leads the movie with a very strong sense of deliberation, erroneous only in the sense that he allows the film to become a little preacher. Considering the overall power of the film, however, this becomes a trivial annoyance. Strong things - and recommended. GFT, Amazon Reviewer
