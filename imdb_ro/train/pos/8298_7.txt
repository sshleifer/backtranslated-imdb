Better than the typical TV movie, INVITATION TO HELL is blessed with excellent casting (Urich, Lucci, Cassidy, McCarthy, pre-Murphy Brown Joe Regalbuto, Soleil Moon-Frye). Urich is full of joy as always and Lucci is particularly pretended and devilishly over the top in the mother of all fatal female roles. A kind of hybrid version of STEPFORD WIVES and THEY LIVE, the movie engages early for the apocalyptic Miltonesque vision, and horror fans will probably not have many complaints until the sappy denomination, maudlin. 7/10
