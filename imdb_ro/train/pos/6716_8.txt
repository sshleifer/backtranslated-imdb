Lately, the excellent director of Grade Z, Al Adamson, truly surpasses this science-fic glamorous, glorious, fantastic, genius comedy that leads to delectable and cute depths, with a silly celluloid stupidity and silly. In the bleak totalitarian 2047, sex was considered an illegal act by the imbecile idiot, who lives impetuously, from Big Brother, from Controller (Erwin Fuller). However, Cinderella sweet'n'sexy (radiant blonde bowl Catherine Erhardt) remains determined to change things for the better. Cinderella takes part in a great gala hand with a specific plan to seduce the beautiful Prince Tom (Dorky Vaughn Armstrong) and to teach everyone who makes love is a positive, enjoyable and fully acceptable thing. Adamson leads this ridiculous thread with his usual incompetence, staging incredibly terrible songs and dance sequences with a lack of skill and flair. The trouble with the abrupt "We Wanted Love," the number of people in the absurd animal costumes, which are strangely transformed by the forest, is a horrenda hilarious miracle; equally abominable "Mechnical Man" routine with a bunch of cavorting left-handed robots. Louis Horvarth's static cinematic works, sticky plastic thumbnails, Sparky Sugerman's discoverent disco score, generous free nudity (Sherri Coyle), humorous brainwave attempts (Roscoe law enforcement robot is extremely irritating), and terrible uniform performances (the portrait of Renee Harmon, accompanied by a bad story, by his evil stepmother Cinderella, who fights with the great prize here), further enhances the joy of being enjoyed in this cute little girl.
