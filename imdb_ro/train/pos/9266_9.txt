The best and funniest film about female football fans, just a little better than the teenage amusement saga of 1982, established in northern London (qv). By the way, I watched this on Film 4 [2008-12-21] and I break my inability to set up PVR). This is easily the second favorite film after Mike Bassett: England Manager, but this time, with added appetite, showing off as a guerrilla piece of shooting from a team that apparently continues to make movies that are forbidden in the country in which they are made (think only of the little girls are taken from the stadium exactly as it is set by the Sun: quick reactions all the time). <br /> <br /> It's rare for a movie to make me laugh aloud, but when the rural soldier escorted one of the girls to the lavvies, forcing her to wear a mask in the promise made of a poster of Ali Daea, I could not stop the others in the house with my snorts, especially when the young soldier misunderstood my grandfather's request for assistance ... Speaking of toilets, I just wanted to talk about Farsi that I could write on the walls of the toilet (yes, there were some pulleys written in the romanian scene, but they were mostly American rock bands). Also Farsi theme, do not you think Omid Djalili sounds like a jokel when he speaks Farsi? Listen to the custodian sergeant in this movie and then go "Yup". I will not deal with Iran's sexual policy and I will no longer deal with the dubious qualities; my love for this movie comes from script and editing: top notch stuff. Here's a list of my favorite favorite football movies: 1. Mike Bassett, England Manager 2. Offside 3. That Glory Glory Days 4. A shot at glory 5. The mystery of the Arsenal stadium
