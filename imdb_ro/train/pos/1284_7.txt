I watched The Babysitter as part of the BCI Eclipse 'Drive-in Cult Classics (with Crown International Pictures) on DVD. I think it's a great movie. This film takes a lot of story in a very short time. You have hippies, rock music, cycling, lesbian, sexually abusive, blackmail and murder, all in one place! <br /> <br /> The main actors make a credible job. And, I found a complicated plot plotted to be credible and interesting. However, the distribution of support, primarily motorcyclists, offers a stylish performance, especially when asked to deliver lines with more than just a few words. Perhaps they used real bicyclists instead of actors. Some characters, in particular, were extremely credible. The musical score is absolute on the spot, for moments of tempo and to move the story forward. We found music a real betrayal. I noticed in opening credits that the movie contained the music "The Food", I made them say; but he could not find anything ... In any case, George E. Carey, who wrote, produced and starred in this movie, liked the idea so much (a married man ransomed by trials and tribulations, and a little help - of course) that he wrote, produced and starred in "Weekend with the Babysitter".
