I was particularly thrilled that in this film, Othello himself had dark skin, and Desdemona did not have the straight hair almost always. And the cast played very well, and I liked the scenario after Shakespeare's original text so faithful. But I have to say that some scenes were too erotic for such a character as Desdemona. I always thought it was very modest, and that's why it's not appropriate to show her in bed with Cassio - although it only happens in Othello's imagination. At first, I was a little surprised even though a love scene between Othello and Desdemona was so open. But on the whole, I liked the movie and especially Desdemona crying in the death scene.
