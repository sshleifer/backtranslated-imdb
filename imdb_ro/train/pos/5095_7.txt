King Solomon's mines bring us Patrick Swayze (interpreting Allan Quatermain), who spent much time in Africa, but decides it is time to return to England and be the father of his son. He discovers that his wife's parents have taken custody of his son and that he has very little chance of arresting him with a lot of money for a lawsuit. Alison Deedy (interpreting Elizabeth), whose father is in Africa, is being held by an African tribe for the redemption of the map Father Elizabeth had sent. Elizabeth is looking for Quatermain to take her back to Africa to find her father. There is a good distribution of support characters that go with Quatermain and Elizabeth and of course there are enemies (Russians) who also want the map. <br /> <br /> The film draws your attention to the end. Patrick once again plays an honorable, handsome, honorable man who helps save the lady in distress. Patrick is a great dramatic actor who can easily illustrate passion, loss and despair, a silent, good man, anger, and force; In King Solomon's mind, his character actually smiles a few times. I would love to see Patrick Swayze in a relaxed, loving live story, one in which he does not have to squeeze his jaws and be so strong. Maybe a little dance would help. But this is a good movie for the entire family and it's worth watching.
