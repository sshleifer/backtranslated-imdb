I'm a home-working writer and Diagnosis Murder is my lunch breaker - good, clean, good humor and nostalgia for the Dick van Dyke show days. How innocent we were all (and how innocent is the Crime Diagnosis). I especially enjoyed the episodes with other nostalgia figures like Joe Mannix. Bad guys are always trapped, good boys continue. The stars are clearly enjoying themselves and have a ball without taking too seriously. A beef: why were so many of the female offenders or at least the females? Amanda was too dizzy. It's hard to imagine that she really does something awful like an autopsy. I hope we did not see the last Dick Van Dyke and the family on our screens, esp. at lunch!
