And I gave her a great 7 ..... Why? Because the blood was overturned. When there were so many other shows that were related to toys / games this show was unique in having overlapped stories. As others have said here, it was before his time. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, that's why the show was doomed. They released 4 DVDs with 16 episodes in the series so far. I hope they will come out more. <br /> <br /> How does this compare, watching 20 years ago when it first came out. I do not know I still like it despite some strange animation and IMHO is just a flaw. Writing was close to the top and long before the competition ........ I hope for more DVDs or even a set of all episodes in the right order ... DVDs are good, but I do not think that the stories are in their correct order, but, despite this show, they were embarrassed.
