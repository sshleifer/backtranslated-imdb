Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) meets a mystery woman (Fay Helm) in a bar and invites her to see a show with him. She agrees on the condition that they do not exchange information about each other - not even the name. Sometimes these are the best data. However, when returning to his apartment, Inspector Burgess (Thomas Gomez) and his team are waiting for him. Scott's wife was killed. His alibi is the mystery, but no one can remember to see it, and as a result, Scott is condemned to die for the murder of his wife. Kansas's secretary (Ella Raines) is not convinced of his guilt and aims to find the woman who can save him from the death penalty. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie, and the viewer is 100% behind Kansas's attempts to reach the truth. We follow her through memorable scenes, for example, her exercise by Mac Bartender (Andrew Tombes) at night and the Claustrophobia spot where the drummer (Elisei Cook, Jr.) takes her Cliff out, drinking and dancing in while he gets stuck with his friends. This is such a blatant representation of sexual desire, which is a stand-out part of the film that everyone swept intensely and rhythmically throughout the scene. Ella Raines is good at the role of women, and Thomas Gomez makes a good cop. Alan Curtis started well as a confused, innocent man, but once he is arrested his performance took a turn to the left as he became completely unpleasant in Kansas for no reason. God knows why he stuck to him. <br /> <br /> The film does not guess who the killer is, as we know about mid-movie, but that does not matter. In fact, it adds to the tension and dramatic development of the story, as we do Kansas to discover what's going on and then to get the fuck out! It's a good movie with some great scenes, but although Elisei Cook, Jr. has a memorable role, I just do not like him in something to see him in ... someone give me a neck tie. ....
