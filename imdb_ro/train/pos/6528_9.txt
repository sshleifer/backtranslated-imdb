I have seen this documentary at the Cannes Film Festival in a 200-seat cinema at the top of the main building at the Cannes Film Festival. I was absolutely in it. I like the mix of fantastic scenes made. It's an amazing design set. Scenes look like they were shot in the 1920s or 1930s. And the music is so pretty. I rate this experience 9/10. <br /> <br /> * spoilers forward * The documentary tells of the wonderful blues-men with black-and-black old black-black scenes playing the guitar and singing. It's really amazing. But this also mixes in new bands and is perhaps one thing I could dislike in this documentary. It's a very abundant use of links with modern rock bands that interpret those Blues songs in a modern way. I do not really appreciate their way of playing such wonderful Blues songs. This is the same kind of non-perfect musical taste I found when I watch Social Wim Wenders Buena Vista Social Club. The documentary was such a permanent ovation at first viewing in the small cinema, the day of this Documentary was presented to everyone and to the normal tourists on Croisette beach at the outdoor cinema. Although the sand, the quality of the projection, and the poor sound quality have probably made it a difficult experience to enjoy the thousands of people who stood in the sand that night.
