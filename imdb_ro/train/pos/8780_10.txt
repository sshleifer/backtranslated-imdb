This is one of the biggest sports movies ever made by Hollywood. What a wonderful story about one of the great sports figures of American history. What makes James J. Corbett's story more interesting is that Mr. Corbett presented the boxing style that continues to date. In this sense, James J. Corbett was truly innovated. But coming back to the film, all the shows were excellent. Alexis Smith was beautiful. Indeed, it resembles Nicole Kidman. And, although it is a piece of the epoch, the story resists the test of time; it did not go out. Ward Bond is the portrait of John L. Sullivan, one of the great portraits of a real sporting figure in film history, and boxing scenes are realistic, well-organized and highly effective. This together with a great script makes this movie a must.
