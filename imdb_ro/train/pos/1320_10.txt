In the early 1970s, Clifford Irving proposed to write Howard Hughes's latest biography, claiming he spent months preparing for the book, engaged in interviews with the reclusive millionaire. When all this proved to be false, Irving was accused of anger and spent many years behind bars (although he always acknowledged that his findings were accurate). Before 20001, a book called "Forbidden Love" (published in the US as "Lost Honor: Love and Death in Modern Times") by a previously unknown author called Norma Khouri, a woman from Jordan, who reported death by killing her best friend, Dalia, because Dalia, being from a Muslim devout background, met a Christian man. She, like Irving's biography on Hughes, was revealed as a possible hoax. Australian film maker Anna Broinowski tries to bury herself in the quagmire of Khouri's attempts to clear up the lie. During 104 minutes, the movie tries to reveal that Norma Khouri tells his truth, or is he just a compulsive liar, with his own agenda / vendetta? An interview with those who know her (including a former husband, her publisher and others) tell their story. This is a sweet, well produced documentary that manages to straighten many fingers to as many potential guilty parties as possible. It was not rated, but contains a bad language and a re-enactment of the killer crime scene, played several times (but nothing nearly as graphic and disturbing as what might be seen in the latest epic of porn torture, such as Saw: Part 84). It's not a good choice for the little ones.
