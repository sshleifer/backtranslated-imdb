This is an oriental fantasy about "Arab nights and nights," a lot of incredible adventures, fantasy witchcraft and sorcerer. The Jaffar malicious visitor (magnificent by Conrad Veidt) with powerful magical faculties is charging Prince Ahamad of Baghdad (the appealing John Justin), who loses his throne, then escapes thanks to a thief named Abu (sympathetic Sabu). I arrive at Basora where Ahamad and Princess (wonderful Jun Duprez) fall in love. But the prince and the thief are haunted by Jaffar, Ahamd is blind, and Abu becomes a dog. The story accumulates some fantastic ingredients, such as the transformation of the star, a flying mechanical horse, the magical bow, the flying carpet and, of course, the colossal genius (which goes beyond the role of Rex Ingram) giving three wishes to Sabu, the magic eye, many hands, among others. This remarkable image is one of the best fantastic movies of all time. Produced by Alexander Korda in London Fim and directed by Ludwig Berger, Michael Powell and Tim Whelan, with an amazing screenplay by Lajos Biro and Miles Malleson, dialogue with the writer and actor, the Sultan deals with mechanical games. The outbreak of World War II provoked paralyzing, then the three brothers Korda and his collaborators traveled to the United States and continued filming, especially in Grand Cannon Colorado. The splendid and clear Technicolor cinema, set-up and FX have produced three Oscars: Menzies and Vincent Korda, George Perinal's Cinema and Osmond Borradaile's Special Effects, though today they are dated and urgently needed a remastering because the colors are worn out. Moreover, a nomination for evocative and oriental musical scores by Miklos Rozsa. This live story, with huge imaginations, will please fans of fantasy and classic movie fans
