Another comment about this movie made her sound bad. Given that the pictures were so new - I think the script and the role were good. Davis was so young and fresh. She has not yet found the style we have expected. However, it is wonderful to see it this way - while learning the craft. There are so many cliques from this movie and it seems that this movie has blazed a few tracks over the next 70 years. My vote is to see it and remember how young this type of movie was. Keep and open your mind and you might be shocked at how disturbed the characters were in this picture, because you were in 1934 and how we look at a height at the beginning of the last century ... I like and hope to create your mind that it did not was influenced by other negative comments and a comment.
