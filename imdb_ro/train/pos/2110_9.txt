It was so much written about the plot of the film, the wonderful acting acting, the script, the melancholy, the bitter atmosphere, the superb direction - what can I add? Just look at one of the heaviest warmings, nice action scenes, painful ever filmed. It is Christmas Day and the character of Frank Morgan (the owner of the store - Mr. Matuschek) is recovering from his marriage and a suicide attempt. While each of his employees leaves, he invites them to a Christmas dinner. Each and every one of them politely opposes them. They all have plans for their own Christmas Eve. At this stage there is a deep sadness for this moving scene. Frank Morgan gives the performance of his career and this scene easily leads me to tears. Fortunately, we have a happy disappointment in this very special scene. The new employee, the boy at work, is the last to leave the store in a beautiful scene on the snowy street. Desperately, Mr. Matuschek approached this boy and asked how he would like to spend the evening with him, he would treat him with all the wonderful Christmas food that this boy would never have seen! alone as Mr. Matuschek and together can have a wonderful Christmas table. Every time I see this scene, it moves me. If you can get the lovely DVD, look at the great trailer, Frank Morgan introducing himself as Mr. Matuschek and the advent of the film director - talented Ernst Lubitsch. The film is joy from beginning to end.
