I just read the latest remarks about this movie and I'd like to answer. you probably are not familiar with the original rap story of N.W.A. which dates from the beginning of 1988, in 1989, the ice cube left the band to go solo, and finally in 1991, the band broke up when the dr. which led to a lot of beef starting with ice cube and dr.dre in 1991. This story was somewhat based on that. More this movie was a 90-minute laugh, they explained the bootie juice song being a political statement was hilarious. not to mention the tasty "love song" was coupling up. and when vanilla sherbert got his ass kicked, like the director of record company is also hilarious and having managers shot every time. <br /> <br /> People who did not enjoy this movie probably did not get it or they were completely idiots, my opinion
