This movie is inspired for anyone who is or was in a tough, financial or emotional jam. You will surely laugh, which is the best medicine! :) Left in a bad financial situation when her husband dies, Grace has to find a new way to make some money and is not even legal, which adds to humor. Even my boyfriend liked, so you do not think he's a cat.
