The first movie in von Trier I've ever seen was the breaking of the waves. Sure a nice movie, but certainly in the shadow of Europe. Europe tells of a German-American young man who wants to experience Germany immediately after the Second World War. He takes a job that his uncle has arranged for him as a purser on a luxury train. Because of his job, he travels to an almost totally destroyed country, meeting with the traitor killing and searching for former Nazi party members. Society suffers from corruption. His uncle constrained his conscience, focusing on the job he had and as the purser on the train. By coincidence, the main character engages in bombing and terrorism by a group called "werewolves" who put pressure on him to help them put bombs on trains. The atmosphere is breathtaking. The spectator is taken from scene to scene by a man who tries to put the viewer under hypnosis and then counts to wake you up in a new scene. Only when you think you have seen many things !!!!!!! Europe!!
