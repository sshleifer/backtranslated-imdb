This is a very good film. I've heard mixed reviews while it was in production and I was expecting it to be released! Good luck to the director and all the actors. Eva Mendez offered a song that would have liked to take her to the top. As everyone else says, the last part of the movie is riveted. Katie Cassidy did a stunning job with her character because she did not do too much work when the movie was made. She has enough career in front of her. I was amazed at her show. I totally liked the film, I questioned the values ​​in life and priorities and I have a better person for it! A wonderful message is in the movie. Release it so that everyone can enjoy!
