Here's a terrible horror movement in the 1970s, about a NYC hell gate that happens to be an old brown. There seems to be a lot of gates around Hell, but of course this unconscious model happens to decide that she needs space from her lover / fiancée, so it happens to choose one that is disguised as a beautiful apartment and at a reasonable price. She meets several strange neighbors and even takes part in an anniversary party for a cat. At the meeting with the real estate agent, because she heard strange noises from the top of the night, she finds out that she and an old priest are SUSPED to be the only tenants. Wow! Then who are these strange people? Her boyfriend (a thin attorney, played by Chris Sarandon) starts to fight and finds out that things are not what they seem, not by a long shot. This has some creepy and creepy scenes and the idea of ​​old scornful people who are "sometimes" neighbors being anything other than what they appear is quite interesting. A bit of decent gore and even a parade of fewer people than normal people makes this a decent watch and although I have seen on TV often, the unloaded version of the DVD is certainly better. It's not a little horror movement, maybe a good piece of "Burnt Offerings". 8 out of 10.
