Being out of the suburbs of Philadelphia and extremely interested in local history, this film offers a great view of Philadelphia in the 1940s. There are scenes from the city center, a train station that does not exist anymore, the 30th Street station - as well as scenes from the north-east of the city. The good old house pictures, as they were then. The movie sometimes "speaks" sometimes - causing the viewer to lose interest ... but the general story is solid and very moving. Anyone who enjoyed this movie should also try to see the film "Bright Victory", also with the local film of the Valley Forge Army Hospital in Phoenixville, PA - and scenes in downtown Phoenixville. The Army Hospital has since become a college campus. None of these movies is in any format and I can not imagine why. I have both on VHS from home registration, as shown in TCM in recent years. I strongly recommend the other boys in my area!
