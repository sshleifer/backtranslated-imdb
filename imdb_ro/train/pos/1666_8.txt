This is a film about Italian artists from the 17th century, and especially about an artist, a woman Artemisia, an unprecedented profession for women at that time, and dared to paint the male nude detailing the single muscles. <br /> <br /> Working with the camera is mainly indoors because the artists worked mainly. There are some wonderful photos. Near candlelight suggests the beautiful work of classical painters, and it is fascinating to see their painters and students, supported by a sophisticated scaffold in which the religious frescoes are detailed. It is not surprising that the artistic elements of the film (costumes, faces, makeup) are very authentic, because the Italian churches have kept all these details in frescoes over the centuries. Artemisia is encouraged by her father to study under the great Florentine artist, Tassi, who has become an expert in the art of perspective and landscape scenery (something very new), but Artemisia is no more than a new technique in painting. After putting her for her, Tassi violently violates her. Her father is angry. The following court proceedings are taking place. This romantic drama has a fairly simple story with unsatisfactory results. The remarkable feature of the film is its artistic representation and attention to detail. Scenes, such as women moving in a field, with the wind swirling their voluminous clothing, add wonderful effects. Artemisia says the paint should be satisfied by itself; her father is painting to please others. As for this movie, I pray the most, I think.
