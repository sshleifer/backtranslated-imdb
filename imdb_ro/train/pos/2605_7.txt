This is the emotional story of two families in Israel and the relationships within each family. Every family has a gay son. The stories are interconnected at the time, but this film is about all the family members, not just the two sons. The portraits of each of the family members in both families are well-drawn, and the story is constantly interesting if it is a bit disgusting.
