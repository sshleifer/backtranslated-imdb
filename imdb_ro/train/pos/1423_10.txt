You have to see this! The directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield did a really great thing, there are 10 out of 10, so I can not believe another user on this page has such a poor rate unless they only expected a movie normal, love scenes and so on. I am also convinced that such documentation is a great way to wake up to save our beautiful planet. Finally, it has nothing to do with Al Gore's documentary "An Inconvenient Truth," consisting mainly of long, painful monologues and "truths," not always accurate, as many people have already shown of science. <br /> <br /> The best thing you can do on earth is not missing Earth.
