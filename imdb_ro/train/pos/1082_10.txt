Mr. Blandings builds his House of Dreams to be the best Frank Capra / Preston Sturges movie that no man has ever done! If you like the love of bringing Baby, The Philadelpia Story, The Thin Man, I was a male warrior or a wonderful life - movies made with spirit, taste and occasional tongue in the cheek, check this out. The postwar life of the Second World War is simply and idiot portrayed. The Grant is in the absolute top of its shape playing the city mouse that ventures into the life of a country schoolboy. Loy is adorable as his pre-NOW wife. The distribution of support characters compares with "You Can not Take It With You" and contains a future start for the future Tarzan Lex Barker. Direction of art and editing are far more than they seem. The film never stops at low-value venal amber, after counting the name, from the subsequent adaptation of The Pit Money.
