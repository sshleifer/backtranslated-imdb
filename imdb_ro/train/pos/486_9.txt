"Luzhin's Defense" is a movie worthy of someone. is an intense movie, and has kept my attention all the time. John Turturro is absolutely amazing in the portrayal of an eccentric chess grandmaster, and Emily Watson is compelled to be the gentle but rebellious daughter of a very respected Russian family. The chemistry between Watson and Turturro on the screen is evident from the moment their characters meet in the story. Overall, this film is one of the best insights into a Grand Master's life, and Turturro and Watson add a non-mainstream non-mainstream movie. Most people will come out of theater thinking and will somehow feel touched by this glimpse of the least likely of the love stories.
