I have not seen any of Chan's films, but it's certainly the best I've ever seen. The story itself is nothing special, so I won you go deeper into this. What makes him special is stunts, fight, good action, warm sense of humor. The movie has a violent rhythm throughout and you are just amazed seeing it. All the cool waterfalls (of course made by Jackie himself) make you want to jump on the couch and scream. Is awesome! Even my mom was impressed by this cool movie when she saw her. I know this story to the police can be a bit hard to understand, at least here in Sweden. But I can assure you, it's worth a try.
