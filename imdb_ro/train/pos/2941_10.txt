This is the last one-man show in which Eddie Murphy is at his best. Just forget Professor Nutt and Distinguished Gents, this is the real Eddie Murphy. His imitation by Mr. T. (pretending to be homosexual), Michael Jackson and other artists are murderous. I think it's bold enough to have fun with artists who were very popular at the time. My favorite act is when he's at his annual grill with his family and plays his drunk dad and aunt Bunny falling off the stairs. This show is the best medicine when you feel down! If you follow the "Raw" sequel, do not be disappointed. It's pretty good, but it does not match Delirious.
