"Secret of the Lens" is perhaps a nice favorite of all time. The best and funniest of Kajawari Yoshiaki, who is known for splashing anime and hentai-ecchi anime weakened. I want him to do more camps like this. My favorite scenes are the CG psychedelic sequences, Lord Helumis's puddles, party riots that Bill makes (one of the funniest scenes) and whenever my favorite character, Worsle, appears. Check this out. <br /> <br /> WARNING: This is not for Serious Serious Anime fans!
