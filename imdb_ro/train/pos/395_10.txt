Visibly stunning and full of oriental philosophy, this amazing fantasy of martial arts is brought to you by director Tsui Hark, the man behind some of Hong Kong's finest films of cinema.

If thinking is not your strength, however, this can not be your movie. Maybe you should go see the latest in the Hollywood studio without a brain, but if you're looking for something more, he'll find.
