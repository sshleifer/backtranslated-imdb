Given the nature and origin of the 11 films, it is not surprising that this film is at best neutral in its stance towards America. Probably the most "anti" segment comes from Ken Loach, who certainly does not shoot the British New Party line. Although those events a year ago are shocking and painful for most Americans and most viewers who saw it live on CNN, etc. most writers and directors choose to show that the tragedy is not an American monopoly. One should be surprised that these 3,000 dead have the same weight elsewhere that the West offers thousands of Tutsi, Tamil, Bosnian, Chilean, Kurdish victims (need for us). If this was a "wake-up call" for the States, then it is equally tragic that within the next 12 months, the Israel / Palestine deadlock is farther from a solution, while George Bush Jnr. would rather retaliate than make the world safer. I believe that many taxpayers wonder where the ideals of founding Fathers went, and why America built as a bastion of freedom, justice and tolerance now sees its interest in itself, while the Third World wonders if the next drink, table or bullet comes from.
