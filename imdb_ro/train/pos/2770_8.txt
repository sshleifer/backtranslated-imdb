Watching David & Bathsheba is a much better way to get the Bible lesson that goes to Sunday school. Despite a scenario that is sometimes unintentionally funny, the movie is very fun. The studio system had its mistakes, but it did not have any expense when generous production was demanded. Peck portrays King David as a brave but tortured poet who commits what is equivalent to killing a sexy Bathsheba Susan Hayward in bed. Raymond Massey as the prophet Nathan offers his usual and ferocious performance. Look for the silent screen, Francis X. Bushman, as director Saul and a young Gwen Verdon as a dancer. Follow the Old Testament and Hollywood.
