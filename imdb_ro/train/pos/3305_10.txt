Undoubtedly, this film must be one of the greatest ........ of cinematographic history. I've seen it too many times to remember and every time it's like watching the movie for the first time. Where does it start? Meena Kumari's performance is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful of his career, followed closely by Sahib Bibi gold Ghulam and Phool aur Pathar. Every movement and shade of her performance makes any other heroin in Bollywood meaning. Her detailed interpretation of Kathak, coupled with her grace, tragic vulnerability and Urdhu's poetic delivery, is as though nothing has ever been seen on Bollywood screen. Pakeezah is perhaps the most stylized interpretation of the human condition; photography, sumptuous cinema and mise en scenes are so loaded with symbolism and meaning that the viewer is left without breath. Naushads music is unparalleled, his knowledge of the music of the courtesan guards are incredible, and the way he puts the narrative score with dark atmospheric motifs and overwhelming romantic melodies is indeed remarkable. My only advice for anyone seriously enjoying the show of total cinema has to follow this epic mediation on life and art.
