When it comes to erotic, I'm lucky to go through the first 20 minutes of the park without getting up or looking for something else to watch. This movie is different. Julie Davis (I love you does not touch me) directed two very strong actors, Kira Reed and Doug Jeffery, in this thrilling thriller. Kira is convincing as "Kim," a cute novelist of innocent romance that is caught in Doug Jeffery's seduction network, "The Man," a handsome stranger. Kira loses control of her inhibitions in acting as an actress, offering what could have been simply another T and A depth and credibility. I think it is the best performance yet. And the direction of Julie Davis is a great gift for eroticism.
