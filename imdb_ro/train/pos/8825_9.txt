This 2004 Oscar nomination is a very short Spanish film. A young woman goes to a caf√©, gets coffee and watches some musicians who are silent with their instruments. All patrons are immobile, like dummies. A guy, however, is quite jolly and pausing in a song about what is happening at 7:35 am. There is a surprising moment after another until the end that is quite surprising. People, the place, everything seems pretty ordinary. And like the musical piece "Bolero," things continue to build up to the climax. With its structure, theme, movement and spirit, it's an 8-minute masterpiece.
