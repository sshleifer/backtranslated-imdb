Peter O'Toole is a treaty that must be watched in roles where the lines he speaks are good and give him a chance to jabber in stupid stupor. The wonderful Susannah York offers a good foil for O'Toole's dramatic presence. The film alludes to incest - without a single explicit scene - but is capable of entertaining the viewer in his hoarse social commentary. Although not a major movie, it will not be remembered for its entertainment performance. Even York, signed at the end of the papers, is a tracing treatment, translated silently. Possible weakness is Thompson's direction. But the film floats because of the actors and the script. I have seen the movie twice in a 20-year period - on both occasions with the name of "brotherly love." "Country dance" is a pretty fake and inappropriate title for this movie, wherever it was released as such.
