"GEORGE LOPEZ", in my opinion, is a classic absolute ABC! I did not see every episode, but I'm still glad. There are many episodes I liked. One of them was where Amy (Sandra Bullock) entered a moving car. If you want to know why, you must have seen it alone. Before finishing this, I would like to say that everyone has always done a good performance, the production design has been spectacular, the costumes have been well designed and the writing has always been very strong. To conclude, even if new episodes can be seen today, I strongly recommend that they only catch it if it is extinguished forever.
