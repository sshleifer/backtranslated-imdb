Although I do not agree with Bob and Tammy's decision to give up the Jesse child and it's something I would never do, they try to do what's best for the baby. The way this movie is written, you see that you are wrapped up in the story and wonder what you really believe in all the different aspects. Patty Duke? Antagonistic? Almost unheard of as far as I am concerned. But, during the movie, it really convinces you that it's psychotic or, at least, that there's something wrong with her. Her character is the meaning of "emotional distress". The film seems to end quickly, leaving things somewhat unresolved. But otherwise, this movie is great. It makes you think. It's not a movie to watch when you just want to change your mind and relax and watch something cute that will make you laugh. But it is a good film to see when you want to challenge your own beliefs, see things from the perspective of others, and discover something about yourself. Caution: you can even grow while watching this movie! And it all deserves, in the end.
