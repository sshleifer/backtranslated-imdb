I entered this movie after reading that it was a drama about a man with a supernatural gift that was turned into a monster of society. Suffice it to say that I was expecting something totally different from what I received. But it was a happy surprise. My boyfriend and I both thought the film was very romantic (the fact that male lead is not bad to look for help) and that there were enough scenes, actions and even humor (that takes them up to the third part of the movie until now the other's name had the whole laugh of laughing) to entertain you and invest in the story. So in short: Not what I expected, but really a very good surprise. I will definitely buy this movie when it comes out on DVD.
