This movie is good. It's not the best of the best CG kung fu movies, but pretty good. The first thing in the first place, the story is actually good. The whole idea of ​​the gods vs. the fallen gods dealing with the super powers is quite cold. My problem is that there are too many characters! She became very confused when they changed scenes! The special effects were INCREDIBLE! The battle scenes were very fast and complex. This movie was virtually computer-generated. The actress is gorgeous, as she always expects from such players. Ekin Cheng is an excellent protagonist, loner character. Zhang Ziyi did nothing for me in this movie. I thought he would have a bigger part, but he did a fight scene and a lot of trickery. The bad guy, the whole army of the skull, and the whole cloud of blood is very scary. Music is also excellent. For me this story deserves at least a mini-series and not just a movie. It would be too much to feed you in two hours. Perhaps if there was a book or something, I would be able to keep up with all the characters and details. This film sacrifices the integrity of the story to action. I recommend the Storm Riders any day.
