It's a difficult thing to play a queen. On the one hand, the actress must be majestic and more imperious, and on the other hand she has to demonstrate vulnerability in a difficult situation as well as collecting courage and resolution to overcome chances because almost all the queens movies have the line the base of the plot. <br /> <br /> Emily Blunt is pretty radiant like Victoria, but it's not as good as I want, it's not coming for her. I can not feel that it's a romantic adaptation of Mills & Boon, compared to a darker and more dramatic film about another young queen, Elizabeth. Therefore, Blunt fails to run a range of royal emotions, at least not to the extent that it is, in fact, young Victoria. To see the old Victoria, check out Mrs. Brown. Jean-Marc Vallee is an exciting film director choice. He made the last time C.R.A.Z.Y., which was excellent and made him famous. It was a pretty different film, but I remember it looks great and that's probably the main similarity between the two films. While Vallee wrote C.R.A.Z.Y., it was by Julian Fellowes, and although I really enjoyed Gosford Park, the story for this movie was far less interesting. I soon lost my entire government policy. Perhaps he was less engaged, because there was no possible decapitation of the monarchy. Just saying.
