I met this film on a visit to Brooklyn - it's difficult to describe the plot; has a lot of awful characters, but let's just say that I will have a hard time choosing which of them made me laugh the hardest, I would not know where to start. Even peripheral roles are well written and well-acting. There are many small touches that make it unique and very enjoyable, it has some "devices" that appear and another hilarious layer is added. It is refreshing to watch; not some recycled things we've seen many times. If this movie could reach a wider audience, I'm sure it would be a real crowd of pleasure, the story is so original and hearty. There are many here to please you, funny stories, shortcomings and misunderstandings that have led to the final act and the dramatic conclusion. Cross Eyed is a very funny movie with a ton of heart; is an emotional story with a fast-paced comedy, woven throughout life. Definitely worth seeing!
