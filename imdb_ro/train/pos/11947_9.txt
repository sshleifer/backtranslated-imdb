Simply well written, directed and acted ... Best Woody of the 2000s, if not the best of the 80s! Hugh Jackman was the perfect choice for his role. Scarlett Johansson's scandal with Woody proves how well she has become an actress she has become. It's invigorating not to be in a love story on the screen with the lady. He plays a perfect magician. <br /> <br /> There have been some reviews that distort this movie. Do not let yourself stop watching the wonderful movie made. People in the crowd we saw this laughed so loud that I lost the next line on some occasions. If you like Woody Allen's films in the '70s, you'll regret the lack of it. I suggest you watch this movie with an open mind, if you do, you could go out with a smile.
