Johnny Dangerously falls completely in the category of blow or wishes with exaggerated gags and the complete lack of a script or a comprehensive story that makes any sense. But that's the point, is not it? Distribution is pleasant; Michael Keaton, an excellent comic interpreter, before taking too seriously as the years passed. Griffin Dunne, Peter Boyle, Joe Piscopo, Marilu Henner and Danny DeVito are enthusiastic and at least laughing at me. But the scene theft here is Richard Dimitri (hiding the word "Iceholes" in the history of the film) as a mobster who is best known for killing English. I have associated many childhood memories with this movie, I've looked quite often, so maybe I'm inclined to enjoy it more than many others. Johnny Dangerously is at least a completely innocent gangster film parody that even conveys some well-meaning messages about the dangers of smoking (and sex). I like it, but it's hard to recommend. <br /> 7 of 10.
