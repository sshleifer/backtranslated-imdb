In this first episode of Friends, we are present at the 6 main characters of the series: Monica Geller, Phoebe Buffay, Chandler Bing, Ross Geller, Joey Tribbiani and eventually Rachel Green. We discover that Rachel, a wealthy girl, who is Monica's girlfriend during high school, left her fiance, Barry, at the altar, because she discovered she did not love him. She also decides to live with Monica and become independent of her father, getting a new job as a waitress in Central Perk. Ross, on the other hand, found her wife lesbian and lost her Susan, her partner. (See how she moves into a new apartment during the episode) Monica, in this episode, does (and finally sleep) with Paul "the type of wine" who apologized to him for being impotent because he divorced his wife . But in reality, he just cheated on it. Ps: I'm sorry for Joey and Chandler's hair in this first season! =)
