I have copies of both classic movies where Robert Blake is a powerful actor in which most of the 1967 film Blake is more present sitting by a window in prison telling his childhood life from where he comes from why he killed the Clutter family looks very much in the classic of what really went into it does not tell us who really did the killing, but it's a wonderful eye catcher really, if you look at the 1996 movie In the cold classic blood makes much more a lot of sensation.
