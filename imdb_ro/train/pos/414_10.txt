Cecil B. deMille really knew how to create a classic, and after 7 decades, his West met like Real McCoy, delightful, fun, spectacular; in no way outdated. As a true fan of DEADWOOD TV, I'm telling you Gary Cooper's shows, while Wild Bill Hickock and Jean Arthor as Calamity Jane are much more targeted. /> <br /> We no longer have giants in Hollywood. PLAINSMAN is just one of the dozens of classics in the decade 1936-1945 who saw the decade of living a decade of life: launched, re-issued, re-issued everywhere. Filming like Spielberg, Jackson, Bruckheimer today are like children playing in a sand. None of today's films will be searched in 7 months or 70 years.
