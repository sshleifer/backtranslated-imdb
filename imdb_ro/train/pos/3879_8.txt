A typical Clausen movie, but not again typical. Clausen writes, directs and plays one of the main roles. This is really a wonderful movie about normal people who live in normal life, trying to do the best. The four primary actors were fantastic. Fritz Helmut was convincing. You think he's really sick. Sonja Richter plays a nurse who is really an actor, but she seems to be the best nurse to take care of the old man. <br /> <br /> <br /> Everyone has problems and those who do not believe nobody end up being happy. But nothing good comes easy, you have to fight to win your life and love.
