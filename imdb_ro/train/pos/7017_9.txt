You spend most of this two-hour film wondering "what's the story about the main character?" <br /> <br /> Will Smith, like a small key "Ben Thomas," will keep you guessing. The last 20-25 minutes are when you find out and it's a shock ... but you knew something dramatic would be revealed. Until then, Smith has mysteriously interpreted him, almost pursuing people. You know he has a good reason to do this, but he has never explained to us once again to keep our guess until the end. Everything, including a come back / stop again but touching the love with Rosario Dawkins ("Emily Posa") could make some frustrated viewers or want to quit this movie ..... but not because the long end segment puts all the pieces of this puzzle together. <br /> <br /> This is a two-hour film and not Will Smith's typical action movie. In fact, the most shocking thing would be to see Smith's sad, sad face across the story. He almost did not even look like he was in a series of photographs. Looks like he's lost weight and he's sick. Smith does a wonderful job portraying a man wearing a lot of sadness. Like a good movie, it will often make this film, it will leave you thinking a lot about the final credits.
