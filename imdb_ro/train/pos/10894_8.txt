I had some reservations about this movie, I imagined it would be the usual pricing ticket - a Christmas movie. Being in the midst of a heat wave at the end of June, we decided to take a shot anyway, maybe we'll see some snow. This movie turned out to be a laugh after another. Ben Affleck was credible in his character, but the true star of James Gandofini. He gave his lines with a real spirit about him and made a great "father". If you want to have a piece of pleasant hours, be sure to check this out.
