108: Tarzan and Matthew (1934) - released 4/20/1934, seen on 8/6/08. John Dillinger escapes from prison and knocks a bench in Iowa. Bonnie & Clyde kills two highways in Texas. DOUG: After being quite disappointed with "Tarzan the Ape Man," I discovered among other users and historians that the second film, "Tarzan and Matei," was the best in the series. It's true. I got a huge shot from this movie. Johnny Weismuller returns as the animated superhero, the dueling superhero animal, and Maureen O'Sullivan resumes his role as a totally fantastic lady who loves Jane (who has a two-piece team for the first and last time here ). In my review of "Ape Man," I found Jane quite well for her obsession with her clothes and her constant cry, but she was redeemed for me here. Do not make a mistake: O'Sullivan is the star of this film, and Jane is the most capable character in the entire cast. She acts as an ambassador between Holt and Tarzan, she can work perfectly in the jungle and understand the animals, and she knows how to keep the lion's pride when he has no bullets anymore. She even screamed her own jungle now. The chemistry between Johnny and Maureen is irresistible. She was fully trained. The cheetah is quite charming, taking off Martin's cigarettes. The plot is more of an excuse for Tarzan to fight the most vicious animals of the jungle, especially with lions, crocodiles and rhinoceros. The effects, though always visible, are much more dynamic and cool and complement the beautiful action. Oh, and you can not talk about this movie without talking about the naked swim scene. All I can say is, yes, it's empty. Things are very interesting. KEVIN: Wow. Right now. When it comes to pre-code action / adventure, down and dirty, nothing holds a candle at "Tarzan and Matthew". The inevitable continuation of Tarzan, the monkey man, is a violent and risque jungle episode. I doubt that in the future another Tarzan movie will not take prisoners the way it does. It would be hard to find a complete scene in this movie that would be approved by the Code or approved by animal rights for this issue. Terrible violence does not expect even the happy jungle couple to appear before pushing even the limits of today's adventure films. And after T & J enters the painting, there is a lot of early morning and afternoon beatings. See it for you if you do not believe me. I love more Maureen O'Sullivan in this movie. In the first film, Jane seemed a walking contradiction, as the writers of that time, she just did not know how to portray such a character. But here he is a great precursor of the females at the beginning of the cinema. Although she still asks Tarzan to get her out of most of her jams, she does much more than wait for her to be saved. Her personality is perfectly credible for a woman who lives (relatively) comfortably in the jungle for a year. I looked at this with my mother and I liked to show how much Jane "trained" Tarzan, as Jeff Foxworthy said. She has totally the monkey man at every beck and call. Although there are a number of optical effects dated throughout the movie, there is still a lot of tarzan's refreshing hair. battles of predation that are performed (for the most part) for real. And the men dressed in monkeys are more convincing this time. ** SPOILER ** The film culminates as the jungle erupts with a shocking orgy of animal king king that leaves Tarzan and Jane the only two people still breathing. Although the couple is heading towards the sunset and the victory, I can not imagine how this story will look like the future safari that will hear about the previous band of people who have gone to find Tarzan and Jane and have not heard again . ** END SPOILER ** One of the things that bothers me yet is Johnny Weissmuller's smooth and hairless point and stylish helmet. Besides, this is a pre-code adventure action that should not be missed. Last Movie: It Happened One Night (1934). The following film: The 20th Century (1934).
