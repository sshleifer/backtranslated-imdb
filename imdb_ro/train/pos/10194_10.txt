This would have worked much better if it had been done as "Mitchell in Malta". At least then, we would have been spared Joe Don Baker's vision, which was taking place in a place where to live a otherwise picturesque Mediterranean environment dressed in that ridiculous cowboy outfit ... let alone acting as a gunslinger from the Old West. Mitchell being Mitchell, the film would not have suffered because of the lack of free police brutality. Good. At least the comic comments made by Mike and Bots made this pay as an episode of the MST. I can not imagine they look at it on their own.
