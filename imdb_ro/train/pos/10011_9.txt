I really liked The Night Listener. It's one of the best movies of the summer. Robin Williams gives one of his best performances. In fact, the entire distribution was very good. All have played only the correct notes for their characters - not much and not too little. Sandra Oh adds a wonderful comic touch. Toni Collette is wonderful as my mother, and never goes to the top. Everyone is very credible. It's a short film, just under an hour and a half. I noticed that the general version is nine minutes shorter than the Sundance version. I wonder if some of the most disturbing images have been cut off from the movie. The director narrated a story and did it directly, which is a refreshing change from many directors of those days that seem to believe their job is to impress the audience rather than telling a story and tell him well. Do not be a perforated sucker for previews and announcements. It's not a Hitchcockian thriller. See The Night Listener for wanting to see a good story told well. If you expect Hitchcock you will be disappointed. My only complaint with the movie was the end. The director could have left a little more to the imagination of the public, but this is a tiny one.
