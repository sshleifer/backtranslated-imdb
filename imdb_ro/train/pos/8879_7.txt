*** SPOILERS *** This movie always seems very exaggerated until I remember that my college campus had a suicide of a former criminal-student-transformed-Nazi-racist-killer as well: his name was Benjamin Nathaniel Smith. Look at him in wikipedia - I added some photos to their article about him. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe, but this really happens. I'm not a big fan of Omar Epps or Ice Cube, but Larry Fishburne, Kristy Swanson, Jennifer Connelly and Mike Rappaport were good.
