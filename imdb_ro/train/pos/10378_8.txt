This movie is about an hour of good entertainment and has some really funny moments. I loved the character of Matt and also Tiny. They seemed the most exciting and funny characters, and certainly the most interesting. Matt is very good (as is not his good cousin), and the police woman and the blonde biker woman offer a welcome candy. I have to say that I have seen striking similarities between Matt and another Australian actor, Eric Bana. My favorite personal part was the brothel scene, she loved it. Overall, I liked the movie and would receive about a rating of 8. However, the punishment was disappointed. There was a lateral curvature of the foot rather than a corresponding kick. I do, of course. :)
