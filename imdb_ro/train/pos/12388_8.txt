I have read the book and I must say that this movie remains true. I think this is the beginning of psychological thrillers of the same kind of Psycho. Cristina Raines offers excellent performance in the lead role, and Burgess Meredith offers an excellent supporting actor as a neighbor next door. I have seen this movie at least twice and I think I will buy both the book and the movie for my collection. Suspicion continues to develop to the climax, the twist you will never see. If you like movies like Signs and Satul, the Sentinel will be a classic prelude. Also, what's interesting is the actors in the movie - you would not recognize them if you did not read the credits. Young Jerry Orbach is great as a commercial director, and Jeff Goldblum is great as a photographer. There is also Beverly D'Angelo, who is underestimated but wonderful.
