An ok movie about descent syndrome. A mother has twins one is very ill the other is good but has descendants. My mother does not think she can raise her, so some people give her 15 children 11 that have descendants! my mother does not like this and thinks she should be with his family (I agree too), so she takes her to court and the family breaks and grandparents lose, never really tells if the makeup of mother and daughter? I think this movie is good, but the plot is familiar, it's still good and has some unintentional laughs!
