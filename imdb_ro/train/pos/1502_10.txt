The fair, the great Robert Bloch (author of PSYCHO, for those who were not careful) wrote this terror story and was absolutely one of the most frightening movies I've ever seen as a child. (I had to go MILES just to see a movie, and it was usually dark when I left the theater, seeing a horror movie always been disturbing, but especially when it was well executed like this). the opportunity to see this a few years ago on a video tape (which should always be a last resort), I was surprised at how well it was raised. Take the terror test: Watch it alone, and then tell me it's not scary ...
