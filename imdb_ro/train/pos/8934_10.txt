Two things haunt intruder L'Intrus: Who is the intruder and is a movie or a dream you see? The end is so shocking that for a while you are losing to answer any of these questions. The intruder appears as different characters, different men in different circumstances that do not belong to the scene, so they are expelled from it with goodwill or brutality but often without emotional involvement. The main character, Louis, is a despicable man. He has harsh paths, a job, and a heart. He needs one and goes after him. He has a heart transplanted and then decides to start a new life. Can this man succeed in his search for redemption? A guy like this could cut your throat at the feet of a hat. You know that, but Claire Denis does not encourage you to judge him. Occasionally, there is a young Russian woman - a beautiful girl who seems to live somewhere between heaven and earth - who judges him. Maybe he can even punish him. But not Denis. It's the character played by Beatrice Dalle, who does not want to do business with him: she does not touch me, she says. But Denis leaves this man himself, filming him in his self-absorbed search. I do not know if the movie is heart or mind, but it's not about the traditional composition of the plot. No matter what filming, you finally get to it. You know who the "intruder" is, you know why, more or less, some scenes come back in your mind with their full meaning. But was it a movie or a dream?
