I like this movie for free! Walsh is a true master of cinematic form, his film was sometimes in my opinion overlooked. But this movie is my favorite because it truly gives you the sense of time that the film was set up. All the wonderful characters that existed, the lifestyle, the way they dressed, how they talked, well could be exaggerated, but it is good to know that there was an opportunity when two men tried to walk away with each other with insane stunts. I felt it was just a part of history that should be many people and appreciated because of this. Can I get it somewhere on DVD? I just saw it on TV. But for anyone who wants a slice of life movie about that time, this is the perfect one.
