"One of Hung's best efforts, humor has become dead, while Hung tries to imitate Lee's facial movements and expressions, and also in a way that Hung has fun at Jackie's Drunken Master Chan, when Hung takes a trio of martial arts experts at the end, it's not the best movie, but good enough for kung fu in the '70s, especially if you're a fan of Hung and / or Lee. The film has a rather hideous quality .. There is also a character in the black that some might find offensive. Sammo Hung is a rural pig herder who moves to Hong Kong to fight off some evil Sammo boys turn in Bruce Lee when he struggles! This movie is often billed as a Bruce Lee parody of "Enter the Dragon," but it's not like that ... Sammo is a rural pig shame - obsessed with Bruce Lee - who moves to Hong Kong to help his relatives to a small outdoor restaurant. In the new job, he is forced to defend gastronomy from local gangsters seeking protection money. When Sammo goes into battle mode, he begins the impersonation of Bruce Lee, who must be seen to be believed! This film is quite negligent, in many of the battle scenes, Sammo fights against people who are obviously actors rather than martial artists, and there is a character who should be black played by an Asian man in heavy makeup (and absurd). But what this movie has to do with budget and accuracy is more than it does in the atmosphere and energy. Highly recommended for good mood. "
