I really liked this movie. Action by adult actors was great, though I found my little child a bit stiff. But it did very well to be a new talent. Humor is very sublime and not in front of you like most Hollywood junk. I.E. Professor Nutty. If you have a short period of attention and are accustomed to typical Hollywood stuff, you probably do not like it because it's a bit slower. I got it on Blu-ray and I have to say that the image quality is top. Probably one of the best Blu-ray images I have ever seen. The extract was cool. They have been deleted quite a bit, but it's probably a good thing because most of the removed scenes have not added anything.
