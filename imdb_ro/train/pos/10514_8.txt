Emma is a terrible erotic film based on Jane Austens's classic novel. I did not read the book, so I did not know so much about the plot, and yet I still predicted almost the entire plot. There have also been many scenes that frustrated me because of the bad writing or the director. The film is, however, for some very fun reason and I loved it. Of course, there were all the scenes I did not like, but most of them were well acting and funny. Gwyneth Paltrow offers one of the best performances as Emma's heroine. The film is also Toni Collette (Who has good but was much better) Ewan Mecgreger (Who was the best but he is still very good here) Alan Cumming (Cui I was not really impressed and Jeremy Northam (Who performs rather from wood at first glance, but actually quite subtle, even if not necessary). There have been much better adaptations of Jane Austen's books, but this is still very fun and worth watching.
