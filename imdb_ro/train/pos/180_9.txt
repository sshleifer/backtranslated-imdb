When Gundam0079 became the cinematic trilogy we know most of us, a lot of action was pure and less than anything else. This OVA is the opposite. Although there are only half a dozen episodes, it is not full of actions but emotional things. The two main action sequences of this, I think, are sufficient to satisfy me. After seeing so many series, movies and OVA, I was completely ready for a civil-esquire movie. This movie did a great job. What makes this film stand out is that both sides of the war have good and bad people. It made Zeoni look human rather than the original films that are described as the second rise of evil Nazis. Most people who do not like the anime I've been forced to watch (lol) liked it. I would recommend a lot of people just for the anti-war story. If you are a Gundam fan and you have not seen this, you should not read this; you should watch it right now.
