In my opinion, this is one of the greatest movies ever made in America and deserves every prize it won and is the place on the AFI Top 100 list (although it is shamelessly too low on the IMDB Top 250 list, just 183 as of this writing). If you like to act at the highest level (Voight and Hoffman are a superb match), well-done characterization and inventive direction, editing and cinema, you will like this as much as I do. Schlesinger presents a vivid and always credible picture of the New York scene of the 1960s, and many victims struggle to overcome personal demons and survive amorality, poverty and despair on 42nd Street, New York. <br /> <br /> The shooting techniques used here capture the subterranean motion sensation of the New York (and the city) and are nothing less than dazzling. I saw many ideas (including rapid fire editing, manipulation of voice flashbacks, drug / travel sequences, and cartoon images slipped during a crime scene to transmit anger and terror) stolen from other filmmakers. The relationship between Joe and Ratso is treated in such a way as to be seen as an unusually strong friendship or with homosexual grounds. I think the director treated this in a subtle manner, not to praise the censorship of times, but rather to focus their energies on the importance of a strong human bond in life, whether sexual or not. MIDNIGHT COWBOY is a brave, moving movie of magnitude, influence and importance that has not lost any impact over the years, so if you have not seen it, you really lose a true American classic. I recommend this movie to everyone. <br /> <br /> Score: 10 out of 10.
