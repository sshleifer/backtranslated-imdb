This is a fantastic series in the first place. It is very well made and very interesting. Like a huge World War II candy, I learned a lot before seeing this series. One of the best things this has done is all the interviews with individuals in the past, when the war was relatively fresh in their minds, relatively speaking that it is. There is nothing against the men you see that you have received interviews in today's programs, but only that most of these people were not really involved in the higher echelons of what was happening then. One of the best parts is the narrative of Sir Laurence Oliver. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to learn about World War II, but I really think only the dead (like me) want to buy this or follow it several times. My only real complaint about this whole series is that some facts are not as accurate as we know now. Especially if information about the Soviet Union is exaggerated or simply inaccurate in places. This information is now different that we now know because of the fall of the USSR. Overall, a fascinating aspect of World War II and a true history of World War II must be professional or personal.
