I think that the creator (s) of the film concept deserves much more prizes than they have ever received. It's not an Oscar-like film, of course, but at least for me this film has left a lasting impression since I first saw it in 1984 (in the theater). <br /> <br /> I do not think it is (and I hope it is not) a spoiler, but: Imagine acting on your impulses. Making the first thought that came out of your head, saying the first words on your lips ... No constraint, no conscience, nothing to keep you from saying or doing the things that, like intelligent adults, we know that we should not say or not. If anything, this film just scratches the surface - Do not go so far could go. <br /> <br /> At a time when Hollywood seems obsessed with the remodeling of the older "classics" to try to earn money today, it would not be nice to see them remake an older modest, for the sake of taking it to the next level? A little further, or even to explore what the original crew did not, could or could not cope with 20 years ago? <br /> <br /> This is just my opinion anyway. : O)
