Paul Reiser is one of my favorite show-business people. I read both books and thought it was wonderful. Peter Faulk can deliver a punch line with the best of them. The combination of the two is magical. This is a story about a family that is really known. On a journey along the way, a father and a son connect for the first time in their lives in the midst of a family crisis. They do all the things that parents and sons have to do in life ... they only do it later in life. The situations are very funny, but they have the feeling that it could really happen to people in real life (not in the face of the peak or in the cartoon). This is the first time I see Paul Reiser and I believed in every emotion that was portrayed. Sometimes his eyes seem so sad. Gret movie and a wonderful story and a plot. It has comedy and excitement, but an uplifting message ... Olympia Dukakas does a great job :)
