Why am I so convinced that there is actually another version of this novel somewhere somewhere? I saw the movie again this year, while teaching the novel and finding the annoying movie changes - there is no aspect of the Roman boy and the end has changed. They killed him in the movie, but the whole idea is he's been haunted by events at House Eel Marsh for many years, but he remarries and eventually puts the events behind him. Mr. Bentley is a much more sympathetic character in the novel, the scene in Kipps' movie in the office is terrible, and the constant appearance of the toy soldier to signal the child's presence is really frightening but useless - Kipps is haunted by the woman seeking revenge, not the child. I'm sure I saw a movie that is better and closer to the novel and, in fact, more frightening. Did I imagine that?
