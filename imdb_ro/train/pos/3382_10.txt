Not often I had the feeling of a movie that could be visionary. But, clearly, this movie has the seed of a premonition. We should not be alarming and see the Armageddon in something, because it seems to fit our emotions of the moment. But did not I say that "1984"? If James Orwell knew that the Internet became a reality not long after 1984; In fact, it was in 1994; perhaps he would have reconsidered writing the story as he did. Hindsight rewarded. Does not matter. What matters is that we often think that we are superior to the environment, but we really become emotional about an "apple of love" when necessity knocks on our door. A snapshot of our elderly. No matter what time line it will prove to be for us, I actually know that I have not yet seen the beginning of it. <br /> <br />
