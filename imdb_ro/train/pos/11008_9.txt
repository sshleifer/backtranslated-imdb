You will notice through the stars I gave this film GREAT that "... before seeing the first time" is implicit. I have never heard of this movie and it has happened beyond that just because this week (and last) was a very slow rental experience (not too much income). I'm not sure how this movie passed me - I love Lucy Liu and Jeremy Northam is also great. Still, she did. This movie is a great example of what to do if you do not have a big budget. It only had the right amount of plot and dialogue to make it very interesting and to keep the viewer in the dark; sufficient. The whole movie is you (the spectator) who tries to realize that the batches twist and turn. I would have given this 10/10 movie, but some of the photos were pretty fake. I do not think too much about this movie, but I do not think it deserves a perfect score. Lucy Liu is beautiful and mysterious (as always). I think she's pretty underrated as a serious talent. Make her beauty terrified (which is difficult), she really takes her roles seriously and does not rest on her look to lead her through sophisticated emotion scenes. And it may seem cold and even lifeless if necessary. At first, Jeremy Northam does a very strange rat very well, willing to go through any labyrinth to prove himself. However, as it changes in the movie, it is like the night and the day. I know some fans of Clive Owen, Jude Law or other people who want to become the next James Bond will not hate me for that, but Northam could / should / should fit this bill. It is suave and cultivated. He has a Bond voice and a voice. I think he can also be cold if the situation demands it, and rather down-to-earth, too. The great film and, of course, this movie-buff recommends it to be seen at least once if you like corporate spy movies.
