The arrival of a world renowned conductor of unexpected events and feelings in the small village. Some people are threatened by the way they deal with the church choir and the way people change gradually. This movie is full of heart and makes you leave the cinema with both a smile on your lips and tears in your eyes. It's about bringing the best people and Kay Pollak has written an excellent script based on the ideas he has become so famous. The actors are remarkable, Michael Nyqvist we know earlier, but Frida Hallgren was a new and charming acquaintance for me. It has a very vivid face that leaves no one untouched. Per Moberg is playing Gabriella's husband almost too well, and it's awful to see. You just want him to be castted to play a nice guy one day so we can see if he owns that character as well. This is a movie that will not leave you untouched. If you have not already seen it, do it today!
