Very funny movie. Eddie Murphy's funny classic movie of the '80s. I saw when I was a kid and I have a good memory. Murphy's classic irony does not fail, the movie is fun, well done. Murphy in the 1980s made numerous action movies that represented a joke about everything that is dangerous. The result can only be appreciated by some, but the 1986 film has changed so far. The atmosphere for a movie of that time is good, and the special effects are good for a movie of the period. A nice movie to see and enjoy the appreciation of the taste of the irony Murphy, an actor who has recently disappeared. The final part is anthologies, the auspicious actor playing the role of the Tibetan monk. That's it.
