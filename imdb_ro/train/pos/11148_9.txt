"Midnight Cowboy" was rated X with the original back in 1969. There are some scenes in which you can understand this, just a little. The movie about Joe Buck (Jon Voight) coming from Texas to New York City to become a hustler is sometimes a little disturbing. Dressed like a cowboy, he tries to live like a wizard, making money through the act of love. It does not work the way it planned. After a guy named Rico "Ratso" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) first pulled a trick and stole some money, they became friends. I live in an empty and very dirty flat. Then Ratso gets sick and Joe has to try to make some money. The movie was probably rated X for the main subject, but we see some strange things on the way. Editing in this movie is great. We see Joe and Ratso's dream sequences interrupted by the real world in a beautiful and sometimes fun way. Dustin Hoffman, Jon Voight and the actors who support him, perform great performances. Especially Hoffman offers some famous lines. The score is made by John Barry and sounds great. All this makes this movie a great movie that has won the best Oscar for a good reason.
