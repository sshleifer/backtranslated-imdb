Shakespeare have a way to overcome time. Language somehow decreases the time barrier. but maybe it's the actors who really do it. After disappointment with Romeo and Juliet (version with Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio), he hesitates to take another modern interpretation of Shakespeare. To my surprise, Othello was great! <br /> <br /> Iago's character was played so well by colleague Kenneth! even if Iago is really bad and despised, the character has been played so well that he does what the sees intends to be charater, a pleasure for the public to hate him. I have to say that Fishburne's performance here was very good, too. I recommend this to students from Shakespeare and lazy students (who refuse to read the book).
