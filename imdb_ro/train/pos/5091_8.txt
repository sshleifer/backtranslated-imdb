He followed both sides twice. He enjoyed the story and liked to see an older Patrick Swayze as a hero. He was very credible like hunter Alan Quartermaine and certainly faced Richard Chamberlain's performance. I admit I'd rather see someone else like "Lady in Distress". Alison Doody should keep up with modern and not antique pieces. It did not look like a woman in the 1800's. The rest of the cast was wonderful and followed the plot lines very well. I'm glad to see that the actors of this generation are not afraid to try different characters and they are not afraid to be seen as aging. Age is inevitable, but let us not hide from it. A man aged 50+ can be more sexy (and, Patrick is really sexy), then a green young man no matter how beautiful. Hoorah for character lines to go with a big smile.
