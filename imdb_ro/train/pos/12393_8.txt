For those who were interested in knowing how humanity came into the big encyclopaedias that make me pray for the pomegranate, there is the duo of the "renaissance socks II". I'm not sure why they are divided into two parts, especially because they are credited as DVDs (and are these pants seen on any format other than the DVD?) But they are informative even if they have a few goals. What really makes this first part highlight, from the second and the rest of the animations, is the parallels that it shows between the robot's uprising and civil rights. The graphic objectives for slavery, fascism, concentration camps and common graves are mixed with verbal references to Million Man March and the God's complex of humanity. In fact, "God" is never really referred to by these shorts, replaced by "man's image." As for the collection of shorts, the "Second Revival: Part I" collection is by far the most effective in bringing emotion. It is a sad and disturbing perspective on mankind's potential to become "the architect of its destruction". Some may be deactivated by some of the concepts of this short short directly from the previously founded scientific literature, but again, this is basically what most of the Matrix series did and was a driving force behind its success. > <br /> --PolarisDiB
