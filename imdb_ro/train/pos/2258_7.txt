I think Sarafina is an extraordinary effort by Whoopi Goldberg. Apart from her, there are no other stars in the movie and her role is smaller than the title character, Sarafina. Since working in a high school with urban children, I think this is an important film showing the South African apartheid history. Sarafina is a film about education and the relationship of a teacher with her student, Sarafina. I bought the video for almost nothing from a videostore. I watched her and I quickly redirected my musical numbers. But I strongly recommend this film to educators and their students to understand them. Now, while I do not know the other actors and actresses in the film, I assume they are very popular in South Africa and I am glad to have filmed with a cast and crew from South Africa, except for Goldberg, in a small role , but if someone makes people see this movie, Whoopi gets to appeal worldwide.
