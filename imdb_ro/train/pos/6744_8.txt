A malicious policeman kills a murder suspect and then covers the crime but has to deal with guilty conscience while trying to solve a crime. Andrews and Tierney meet with director Preminger in a noir movie that is as effective as "Laura," their previous collaboration. Andrews is perfectly expressed as a serious cop, a good guy caught in unfortunate circumstances. The actor is all right, including Malden as a hard police captain and Tully as Tierney's protector's father. Hecht's script, a great and prolific scriptwriter, is tense and suspenseful, and Preminger creates a wonderful atmosphere.
