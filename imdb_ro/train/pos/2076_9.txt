Good Earth is a great movie! Everyone needs to see ... It's a tear-prick and warmth of the heart. It's about value-building - training on perseverance, humiliation and family love ... The story can be linked to our lives today, especially as poverty is at the brink. The way we respond to such a problem is very important and if a person is not strong enough to face such problems, he can be left without defense and useless. I am very pleased with the fact that the characters have justified their roles even on the young actors ... Their emotions captivated the audience. The movie might have been made in black and white, but the story is so exciting that you do not want it to end. That makes it really great! It should be a re-make for this very beautiful movie.
