How to lose friends and alienate people is a decent comedy with a little romantic approach. In fact, it's a story of Sidney Young (Simon Pegg) who breaks out in journalistic and magazine writing, interpreted in an amusing way. Simon Pegg made an appearance OK, a little worse than the usual one. The movie is not hilarious or funny all the way or something like this, but it has its moments, and those moments are really hazy. Recommend this fun and worth watching the American with comedy in English the cream of all those who just want to sit, relax and enjoy the film for what it is. If you are about to watch this movie with a critical approach then you should pass if you do not want to be disappointed and begin to destroy it.
