Greetings again in the dark. It will be compared to "The Bride Princess", and although it does not measure up to that classic, it is extremely fun and well done in itself. The story line is a bit strange, and all the wall work is never explained, but the execution is good, even with a strong suspense. Charlie Cox plays Tristan, who falls for a bad girl (Sienna Miller) and agrees to bring him a fallen star ... which happens to be played by the amazing Claire Danes. There is not much suspense about what happens to these two, but the tense side comes with the evil witch played by Michelle Pfeiffer and Prince Peter O'Toole's prince, who seeks to recover the ruby ​​necklace that our "star" wears . A lot of bad to follow well. On the way, a meeting with the weirdest pirate you will see (including any of Carribbean). Robert Deniro interprets Captain Shakespeare - hard inside, and we'll talk about the female part. Another meeting involves brilliant Ricky Gervais as a fast-moving merchant who is good for a few laughs. It's not about your typical pursuit of age or fantasy, but the director Matthew Vaughn ("Layer Cake") deserves an audience. Unfortunately, the bad marketing campaign will prevent them from making a ban. I think he will find great success on the video.
