This documentary makes you travel around the globe. Contains rare and amazing sequelae in the wilderness. It shows how varied and how fragile our planet can be. The future of the polar bear is highlighted at the beginning and end of it. In the end, his grim future is closely linked to the consequences of global warming. This documentary is, however, a simplistic approach to such a serious environmental problem. However, the child can be easily seen because it remains mainly descriptive. Scientists may be disappointed because it's not a remake of Al Gore's documentary "A Uncomfortable Truth", but honest ... what description !!! A question may arise then: is it not worth the beauty of the world? Because this documentary demonstrates that in 2007 there is such beauty despite the different pollution. If we live in cities, we tend to forget that we are an integral part of this nature. All the things considered in this documentary remind us that we have a common treasure called "THE EARTH".
