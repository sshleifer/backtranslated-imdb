And I'll tell you why: anyone who decided to edit this movie to make it fit for television was very bad. Everything related to drugs is eliminated and covered! How do they do, could you ask? Well, they do not do it very well, that's for sure. However, instead of the marijuana that Cheech and Chong should have in their possession, they are said to have diamonds! Still, the characters are heading into a mist of marijuana smoke, extinguishing others along their way without any explanation!
