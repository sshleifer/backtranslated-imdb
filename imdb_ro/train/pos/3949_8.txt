Like many people on this site, I saw this movie once, when it was first televised in 1971. Some scenes remain in my memory and a general feeling of restlessness is how I remember being affected by it. I would have been fascinated to see him again if he had ever been available for the video at home. Possible Spoiler: I wonder if anyone else would agree that the basic plot and character set could have been derived from the British Film of the 1960s, originally called The City of the Dead, renowned the Horror Hotel for the American launch? There are some similarities with a British movie later The Wicker Man. A detail remains with me years after I saw the movie. It's a small but significant moment, close to the beginning of the movie. As I recall, a minister and his wife stopped to help some people along the way, about 1870, somewhere in the West. Relative friend Ray Milland presents himself and his daughter, Yvette Mimieux, a beautiful young mute. While the preacher helps Ray Milland with the wagon, a rattlesnake tilts in vision and rotates menacingly, unnoticed by any of the characters except Yvette Mimieux. She does not look scared at all, but she looks at the snake with silent concentration until she disappears. With this odd moment, we already realize that there is something unusual about these seemingly normal people, although the possible danger to the minister and his wife remains vague and uncertain for a long time. remains with me alive after all these years, along with many others. The film has a haunting quality about him that will not let go, and it is not surprising that people remember so alive. Someone should make this available for home video!
