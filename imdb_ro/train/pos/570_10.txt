Incendiously, I watched this movie for the first time, 13 years after its release. It's a story that any father or brother can bind to ... a brother is a little 'wild', the other brother is typically a larger child. Craig Sheffer is a little too frustrated as the biggest brother, but Pitt is amazing and Skerritt is perfectly expressed as a father. The fishing scenes that were filmed in Montana are breathtaking ... I did not have the idea that rowing could be so attractive. The film follows the book carefully, with only a few changes to make it more suitable for a movie format. Unlike most movie stories, it measures. It's a perfect movie for anyone who wants a quiet night with a strong and somewhat emotional film.
