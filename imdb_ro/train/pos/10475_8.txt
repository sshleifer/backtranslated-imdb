A friend of mine recommended this film, citing my vocal and inflectional similarities with Des Howl, the main character of the film. I think to a degree I can see this and maybe a little more, I'm not really sure if this portrait is or is not pleasant. This is a rather unique piece of work, the only movie to which it might have more than a similarity of looks would be True Romance, not for the content or the style of filming or for the pace of dialogue (whale music is just a lot more, relaxed). But instead they both represent modern love stories. <br /> <br /> In general, I am a great fan of Canadian films about music and musicians (for example, I strongly recommend Hard Core Logo) and especially this movie. Has an innocent charm, Des is not always the most enjoyable guy, but there is something about him that attracts a sense of empathy.
