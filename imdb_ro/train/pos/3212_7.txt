I watched this movie for the second time to try to figure out why it was not as successful (commercial or artistic) as it should have and found a considerable artistic merit - which might have been in the the latter to distort them. /> <br /> First of all, this movie is trying serious science-fiction, a social commentary, more than action-adventure. There is an action on this, but that's not the case. If you focus on this, you will end up with (as others have noticed) a bad clone "Aliens". But again, that's not what it is. The film is really about turning Todd (Kurt Russell) from man to car nearby and back to man (especially back *). But because he is not trying to give you a typical Hollywood style response, Kurt Russell needs to make this transformation without talking and largely without broad expressions. And she even does a great job - she may need two views to appreciate it. The "surrounding social logic" is erroneous and has never been adequately explained if Todd's ability to stand on his own against an army of supposed superior troupers comes from his experience on the battlefield or his newborn, but the movie still makes a wonderful showcase for Russell's talent (easy to underestimate).
