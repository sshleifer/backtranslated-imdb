the movie is wonderful, like any other international project that includes strong impressions. three of them (Israel, Bosnia and Egypt) should have been cut off. especially the Bosnian clip, which is pathetic beyond all reason and does not contain any single thought or original element on it. anything else is truly great, unrecognized for most Americans, known to the rest of the world. unfortunately, the clips talk about the misery of people around the world. and, as we have seen, there are so many who will not be damned about it ... top 5: 1. loach 2. penn 3. inarritu 4. lalouche 5. Imamura
