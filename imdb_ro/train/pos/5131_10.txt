Jammin 'the Blues is a short Oscar nomination from 1944, which is actually 10 minutes of improvised jazz played in a long jam. Marie Bryant sings the "Sunny Side of the Street" at one point to show off the movie, then jignabugs with Archie Savage to make this fun session "the most fun" at its exciting end. Director Gojn Mili was a photographer and this experience shows in some of the double exposure images of some of the musicians making this one of the most innovative angles of the 1940s. According to some notes, I read that one of the musicians was white and had to be filmed in silhouette, reflecting the social attitudes of time. What a shame. However, this unusual time movie is available on YouTube, so if you like jazz, we suggest you look for it there.
