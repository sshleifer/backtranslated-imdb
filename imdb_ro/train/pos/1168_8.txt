Tony Arzenta, a Sicilian murderer or professional killer, decides to leave the business, and his former employers disagree. From a content point of view, this very action-packed movie does not have one; in terms of fun, it's fun, it's very melodramatic, violent, pretty brutal, car searches are notable. "Arzenta" is an amazing, but very nice, much better movie than the Hollywood trash that gets the same label. It comes from Delon's pretty flirtation with Italian cinema B in the '70s. He carefully uses Delon's tough character, belonging to the gang of evil thugs he made in his youth. <br /> <br /> I was very glad that Delon made this film, that he had a role in a good Eurocrime movie. The score is very fine, with a good introductory melody making you feel like the taste the Italians have had for the film as a synthetic work, where musical art has an important role. In Tony Arzenta / Big Guns / No Way Out Erika very appealing Blanc (31 years in '73) appears as an unnamed bitch. Meanwhile, Arzenta's girlfriend, Sandra, is played by Carla Gravina (a starlet who practically left the movies after '75). "Arzenta" is interesting to film an ambitious visual conception, some specific expressionist angles. The film was directed by the prolific Duccio Tessari, who also made Zorro (comedy Delon). It is not to be mentioned that these two films, Tony Arzenta (1973) and Zorro, are very inappropriate. The first is a violent action film melodrama - the second is a light comedy, closer to a spoof, although it is remarkably coherent and talented. Duccio Tessari directed movies like Kiss Kiss ... Bang Bang (1966), Satan's Sons, Bloody Blood, Viva La Muerte ... Tua! , Tough Guys (1974), Safari Express (1976), etc.
