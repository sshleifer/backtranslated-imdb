Note for the previous reviewer: This film is the "science-fiction adaptation of Iliad" according to the screenwriter. So if the references are painful or not, do not apologize, it's the basis of the film. I admit they stole ... although it is adapted is P.C. term. <br /> <br /> Very good, but too short. It probably did not come out, as the author, the director or the studio wanted, but quite fun. The fact that the studio itself exploded during production only helps to add to its inheritance. A big budget remake would not be as fun and the script would probably not be a justice. But it's fun to dream about the potential there. There is a seemingly available DVD version with some extras, but I do not think it would play on NTSC players. I am not an expert and therefore still trying to figure it out. For the moment, I live with VHS incarnation.
