I won this accidental title with Grindhouse Vol 1 a collection of pure Euro-garbage films. But this movie has a stamp of approval and would deserve a better transfer than what is there. Stupidnus is not ... satisfactory is! Watching this movie, I could not ask myself ... how is it that Sergio Martino did not make this movie? She has her signature everywhere and is punctuated by Edwedge Fenech (not as well known as it should be, but she got a beautiful cameo in Hostel II). Double-crosses and triple-crosss highlight and cement this film from start to finish with Lee Van Cleef oozing cooler under pressure from the first second. Had this guy gone to Italy to finally reach his potential or the studio system let this guy go through it? In addition to Lee's most famous films, filmmakers should try this by size and see how Sergio Leone would have reduced his epic ladder to "Once Upon a Time in America" ​​for half of his life (and a quarter of the budget) this is what it would have been like. So refreshing, should be taken during the day at home and get it for a matinée couch
