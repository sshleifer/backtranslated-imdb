Picture Mirese paint a realistic and moving portrait of what must have been like the Japanese men brought to Hawaii at the beginning of the nineteenth century to work in cane fields. Most came to return to their homeland, but few managed to do it. Equally impressive is the fate of Japanese women, some fifteen or sixteen years of age, who were sent as promised brides to men whom they knew only through pictures that were often out of date or out of age or were of another man younger . They also worked very long in the field, while struggling with homework and maintaining their dignity. Hatta's portrayal of the courage and perseverance of a bride who struggles to survive in a strange country and finally is inspirational and uplifting - a story of moral and cultural survival. There is greatness and greatness of motion of character and landscape in the Bride of Imagery that captures the appealing beauty, as well as the violent hardness of the colonial Hawaii. This is a film that is rewarded emotionally, intellectually and artistically.
