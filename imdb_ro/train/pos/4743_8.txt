This is a very weird movie in many ways. First of all, many of the action sequences are not that amusing. The first gunfight that appeared in the film was just bad. It's not stupid, stupid or funny, but stupid. That does not mean there are not any great action scenes, but the simplest does not come up with the other films I've seen. The opposite is that this film has CHARACTERS, not just people. All the main characters are interesting (except for the bad guy who is flat as a pool table) and most are pretty well-behaved. All the protagonists of this movie are just fun to watch. The dialogue is quite spiritual and does not seem to lose much in translation. This movie is worth seeing, but I hope the uninvited American audience does not think this is the best HK to offer.
