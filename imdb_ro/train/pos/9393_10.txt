Some movies you just know you'll love from the first few seconds. This is one of those movies. Following her roots back to "Double Benefit," and "The Messenger Always Rings Twice" in the 1940s - this was an extraordinary example of the modern Noir movie in the 1990s. Nick Cage plays the lead character "looking for luck", who is embroiled in a plot to kill his spouse - and his luck goes from bad to worse and even worse as he tries and tries to get rid of people, the city, threatened by Red Rock West. A lot of twists and turns, great performances by Cage, Hopper and Walsh, a hypnotic musical background of guitar and seamless direction make it a real joy. Favorite line: When Cage looked at the empty gas manometer in the car, he shook his head and said, "F *** in the story of my life."
