The distribution really makes this a pleasant surprise and a reduction over the human-vs-woman-argue-all-time-but-wind language in love-type love / comedy story from Hollywood. <br /> <br /> I usually do not go for those types of movies and this tiring story, but it was refreshing, fun to watch and oozes with charm. Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play each other well and make a very beautiful couple. Distributor support is remarkable - from Felix Bressart, always pleasant, to the bastard Joseph Schildkraut. <br /> <br /> Frank Morgan also plays one of the most exciting characters I've ever seen in his career. He takes the film and turns it into a totally different mood for a while when something dramatic happens to him. This "twist" is another reason why this film rises above others of this kind. Again, when a movie has a good mix of categories, it usually succeeds. This is a very good example. In this film, it is romantic, comedy and drama and is well done. I'll take this over re-doing "You've got the Mail," on any day. No comparison.
