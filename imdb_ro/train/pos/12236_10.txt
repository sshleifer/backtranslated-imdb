I saw this film in 1959, when I was 11 years old in a theater with my family. How long I thought it was very funny. . . even if I was too young to understand 90% of what makes this wonderful movie such a delight! I saw it again in the morning on Turner South. As I watched her, I was absolutely confused by laughter! The "mating game" is a unique classic from a distant age. If you are too young to have experienced the delightful period in history that produced this movie, I am very sorry for you. You can not watch such films and understand how I can (even today) deliver a so beautiful slice of heaven to "old timers" like me. After I said, all I can do is respectfully, asks younger people to refrain from commenting on movies such as "Mating Games". Movies like this were made for the generation that preceded the current group of your people. And as such, these films speak in a very different language from what anyone understands. In other words? if you do not understand the issues the film is addressing, please do not be ashamed of commenting on what? sincere? Makes no sense.
