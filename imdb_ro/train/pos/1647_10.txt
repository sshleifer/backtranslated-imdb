Excellent. Serious and real presentation of pioneer farm life on Western plains, with an emphasis on the role and place of the woman. A motion picture, made with love, based on real people and their real experiences. Low budget, independent film; never made any money. Definitely not the romantic, unrealistic version of Hollywood's pioneer life.
