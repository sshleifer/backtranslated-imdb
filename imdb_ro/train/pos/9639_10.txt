A very close and sharp description of the moving, bubbling and dynamic world, especially of an 18-year-old, who makes the first experiences in his homosexual love for another boy during a vacation with part of his family. /> I liked this film because of its extremely clear and surrogate story, however "Sound-close-ups" and quiet moments that were full of intense disposition. <br /> <br />
