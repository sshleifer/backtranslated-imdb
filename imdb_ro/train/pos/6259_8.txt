I'm actually indignant about the comment I read saying that this movie was "boring" and the beautiful landscape was destroyed by black and white filming. It was made in 1925 !!!! I think it's absolutely incredible it's time! <br /> <br /> The journey that these people had to go through is remarkable. It took them a week just to cross a river. Women carried their children to heavy wooden swings on their backs, climbing on a solid stone sheet, sometimes barefoot in the snow. I'd like to see anyone do this now! <br /> <br /> I thought it was a great movie with really stunning photos and an incredible story.
