A wonderful story, based on a true story about a black young man and all the difficulties along the way. Since this is Denzel Washington's first film he will direct, I must admit I was a bit skeptical, but who would not ...? But again, he is a great actor with years of experience and the end result turned out to be excellent. The story is splendid in a wonderful way, making you have had difficulties in childhood and youth, you see yourself in those situations. So he hit you a lot, he told you that you were not the only one going through hell. In all, an exciting story about a young man trying to do it in this world. (The story is based on the life of Antwone Fisher, born on August 3, 1959, Cleveland, Ohio, USA, who was also the writer of this film) strongly recommended. 8/10
