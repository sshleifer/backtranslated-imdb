It could have been better if it had been directed by someone with more experience. Shumlin did not do a bad job, but it's not a great work of art. It's a beautiful movie though. I loved her, as local channels showed them. Graham Greene is one of my favorite writers of the last century. Some bad movies have been made from his novels and stories. (Many love "The Fallen Idol", but I'm not among them. I think I saw "Brighton Rock" many years ago and I liked it, but I just think about the lie of the novel). Charles Boyer is not true that he meets as a Spanish. But he seems to have the perfect temperament for this character - tired, cautious, neat. Lauren Bacall is appealing as a British girl who falls for him. But the support players are the best: Katina Paxinou is excellent. Her performance is a small Grand Guignol, but she attributes it to the director. Peter Lorre, whom we meet for the first time when giving Boyer a lesson in a universal Esperanto language, is excellent - as always. And Wanda Hendrix could break the hardest heart. He meets like an early teenager. The character wants to be helpful. She's doing her best. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie very well. Not without reservation. The reservation is, first of all, that it is a bit stiff. But the story and the acting can not be improved.
