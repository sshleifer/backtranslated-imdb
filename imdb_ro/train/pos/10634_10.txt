To prevent homosexual friend Albert (Perry King) from being deported back to Belgium, Stella (Meg Foster) decides to marry him. The only problem with this is that Stella herself is a lesbian. The two have separate lives when one evening after Albert's birthday, he sleeps in bed and then in love. Later in the film, after falling in love, Stella suspects that Albert has deceived and shows up one night late after the closure. What he finds will leave the spectator stunned. This is a wonderful, very original movie. Perry King and Meg Foster are so good in their roles that it's amazing that they have not been better known for their work here. Very controversial when it was released in 1978, the movie "R" is now "PG" in this time more liberal. <br /> <br /> Recently released on DVD, the disc contains a "Making Of" segment on special features that tells the film is based on a real story, so viewers say the movie is not "real" are wrong. Everyone is an individual and different person falling in love for various reasons - these are the issues explored in this wonderful movie for all those who have ever loved!
