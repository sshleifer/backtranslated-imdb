For fans of Hammer-style horror films in the 1970s, this film should be a treatment. The only thing I did not like was the fact that Peter Cushing was wasted in the worst episode. Generally, however, this is a solid, scary film. If this is not Amicus's best movie, it's certainly one of them. The best episode, rightly saved for the last one, is the one that portrays Jon Pertwee as a horror film actor - it's really great. As good as Pertwee was in this role, it's hard to believe he did not do more of these types of movies. Generally, this is a fun movie that scared my baby and still struggled to this day.
