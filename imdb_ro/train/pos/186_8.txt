There are some great things about this movie. Marion Davies could act, given the right property; she's great in comedy roles. William Haines could act and you can see why he was one of the most popular top people in the screen. (Until a potential scandal forced the business). The story is a little weird, but so manipulated so you do not notice it. Vidor's King is one of the main reasons for this. The manufacturer? Genius of the boy, Irving Thalberg. It's about filming, and you can see the process as it was in 1928, cameras, sets, directors, and emoting actors. You will see (in short) some of the great stars of the day; even Charlie Chaplin makes a turn like himself, looking for an autograph. You also catch noises by Eleanor Boardman, Elinor Glyn, Claire Windsor, King Vidor, and many others who are just old names and pictures. Please, even if you are not a fan of silence, take the time to capture this movie when you can. It's a wonderful journey over time.
