My kids just stopped at this movie last night and, as things started to play, it really did my interest. I had to go to the bowling league, so I made it record for me on the dvr to see the rest later. Well, I just finished looking at her and the front of my shirt should be soaked after the weeping buckets. It was an excellent film, even if I felt the pain and pain these girls faced. And never, in a million years, I would not have guessed why Alissia left this beautiful girl to an antisocial goth. Probably this was the reason I felt the same pain Alissia felt. And I would not have been looking for this movie, but I'm sure I'm glad I saw it. Very moving, very moving. Great for lovers of good drama or tears.
