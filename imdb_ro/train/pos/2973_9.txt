Here's a movie that's really funny every time you cover it. How can not it be that this film plays South Park creators and is directed by David Zucker? When I first saw this movie, I did not realize immediately that Coop and Doug were really Matt and Trey, but their talents in acting and writing came out impressive. I was pleasantly surprised to find that they were really Matt and Trey later. Humor is sometimes brutal, sometimes stupid, sometimes shiny, sometimes subtle, sometimes loud and sometimes bad, but overall it is a cute film that is undoubtedly under evaluation. In fact, her crazy. Very crazy.
