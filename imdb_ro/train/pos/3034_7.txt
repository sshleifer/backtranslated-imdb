An undervalued addition of the Graham Greene cinematographic canon - its perceived defects can now be seen as virtues. Director Shumlin, a theater director, shapes his action with an oppressive rigidity appropriate to the material, and seemingly uneven compositions suggest undeniably anxiety. Both a dark thriller and a story of moral regeneration (for the female character! In a thriller of 40!), The film has a real hero who turns crazy and killer (and eventually paedophiliac), brings brilliantly the remote ideologies of the War Civil Spanish destroys dangerous reality, has horrible crime, an amazing vision of class and capitalism, intelligent theatrical metaphors, a rare approximation of God to Greene, and an end that is just happy if you do not know anything about history.
