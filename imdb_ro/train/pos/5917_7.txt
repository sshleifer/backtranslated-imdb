Streetfight (aka Coonskin) is a very unique movie, directed by animation pioneer Ralph Bakshi. It's a strange thing about cinema and it's worth seeing. It's live action mixed with animation, apparently influenced by Disney's legendary piece of the South, almost as if it were a response to that movie. Philip Michael Thomas, later to become Don Johnson's deputy on Miami Vice, and Scatman Crothers, the most famous for his role in Kubrick's The Shining, are prison escapes. Charles Gordone and Barry White (yes, that Barry White) are Thomas's friends and intend to help him get rid of the prison. They are stuck in a police jam, and Crothers tells Thomas a story about a black rabbit, a bear and a fox moving from the south to Harlem to find a more peaceful existence. The story is animated and offers many wonderful things to see. Like most of Bakshi's films, most will be upset and disliked by the animation. True animation lovers will forgive their clunk and will fall in love with their inventiveness. The film is very violent, very sexual, and is mostly about racing battles. For a long time, I thought I was looking at something extremely important, but after a while, especially after I finished looking at it, it looked like a black hit along the Superfly lines. He's very negligent and does not say anything. In addition, is not Bakshi white? Whatever the answer to this, Coonskin / Streetfight still deserves to be seen for animation enthusiasts as well as for movie fans. 7/10.
