This movie was absolutely wonderful. Pre-partition time and culture were recreated beautifully. Urmila still gave a brilliant performance. What I really admire about this film is that it does not resort to Pakistan's crackdown on films such as Gadar and LOC. With the background as a background, the film does not focus on political issues or focuses on violence or what is good or bad. The film always focuses on the tragic story of Urmila's life. Her fragile relationship with Manoj Bajpai was excellently illustrated. The film, in fact, shows how the peoples, both Hindus and Muslims, suffered from this partition. The theme that there is only one religion is really widespread in this film.
