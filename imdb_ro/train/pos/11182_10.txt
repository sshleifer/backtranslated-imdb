I'm a big fan for most of the films that were based on Stephen King's books - this is one of the most frightening and memorable. We just finished reviewing it for the tenth time and I still find heart-wrenching as well as frightening. The scene where Gage is on a safe course of monster truck collision is one that stands out. And "no fair" by the little Miko Hughes near the end is a touch of brilliance. <br /> <br />
