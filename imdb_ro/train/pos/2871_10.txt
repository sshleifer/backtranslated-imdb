Cometariu? Like my commentary? We are talking about all the masterpieces of time, for all seasons and generations. This is just the type of movies I still have the patience to watch. In this way, as in other Disney movies, it is a kind of magic. All the characters are somehow "live" and "real", so it's easy to understand the message even if you do not understand the language (as if I did not understand when I first watched the movie because I was six years old) . Perhaps my English is not that good, but I learned what I know most of this kind of movies, and this is a bigger dimension of this type of movie, which is now rare. But there is great shame. In my country it is now impossible to watch this movie or any other Disney movie! We do not have copyright so our kids are disabled to enjoy and learn from such films. So we will watch this movie again "Once in a Dream" or ...?
