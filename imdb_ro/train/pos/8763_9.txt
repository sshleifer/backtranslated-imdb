This movie is a cool, true truth. We often think "oh no, that will not happen to me". But maybe. Drug smuggling is a big ban, and often people are unknowingly (or betray) doing things for smugglers. The story of these two girls is the story of many young people who like it, I just want an exotic holiday - which has turned into a nightmare. People need to know that such events are not unlikely or exaggerated - this is a major issue in today's society. I would recommend this movie to mature viewers because of the understanding needed to really appreciate this film. It's very emotional and brutal. Well worth the look and it sure remains in your memory.
