Similar to "On the City," this musical about shore sailors does not fit into the classic later in terms of the rhythm and quality of the songs, but has its own charm. Kelly has three fabulous dance routines: one with Jerry cartoon mouse "Tom and Jerry" fame, one with a little girl, and a fancy sequence where he is a Spanish lover determined to reach the lady on a large balcony. Sinatra, playing Kelly's shy and unrelenting friend, and Grayson, the woman who serves as love for both men, makes the most of the song. Iturbi offers some fine piano play. Nearly two and a half hours, it's a bit too long for a light musical but it does not shoot.
