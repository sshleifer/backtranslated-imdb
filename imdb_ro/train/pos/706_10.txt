I have to say that I wanted to see this movie for a long time and I was not disappointed. Dominic Monaghan's act is simply fantastic. As a sleepless part of myself, I can relate to the way the story develops. I have never experienced this, but some awake moments overlap over sleep and can be scary. It was a great movie worth every penny. I hope one day I can work with Tess, it would be an honor and beyond. I can recommend it to everyone. Maybe not small children, because they can be scared. But if you are an insomnia like me, you will understand the world, the mysteries and the fear. You will love him. <br /> <br />
