This is a great movie, I played the game a while ago. He had extra zing ... for that. I loved Vanessa Williams as Rosey, and Jason Alexander has a good voice. Was awesome. The settings were also very good. Except it's 2 hours and 50 minutes, it's pretty long. Generally they give 8 stars. They added a few parts, but it was still cold.
