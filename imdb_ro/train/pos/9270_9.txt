I must point out before reading this review that it is by no means a statement against the Iranian people ... if you really want to read something in it, than hopefully you will see that I am against politicians in general ... but if you are looking to be offended ... I can not help you! Not in Iran, because this movie is forbidden there (see IMDb trivia for this movie). What a shame, because the movie is great. It would not have been for "Grbavica," this film would have won at the Berlin International Film Festival. The right was (was the runner-up or the second place if you want). Why? Because it's a movie about oppression. It's not even a complete problem for women. It's about the government that is trying to keep the people down. An analogy so clear that the government felt the need to ban the film. But by banning it nothing resolves and / or can cause this movie to disappear! Another reviewer had a brief summary line: "Comedy about a tragedy," which sums up pretty well!
