Before Cujo, Lucky was the devil's dog. In 1978, Halloween night premiered the movie "Devil Dog, The Hound of Hell". A story of a family who has received a new puppy (from a farmer who happens to be in the neighborhood of selling fruits and vegetables) because their dog captain was killed. Everybody loves the new dog, but there is something strange about him. <br /> <br /> It is not long before Father Mike Barry (Richard Crenna, First Blood) begins to notice. Betty's wife (Yvette Mimieux, where are the boys, Jackson County Jail, Snowbeast) is different and his children Charlie and Bonnie (Ike Eisenman, Mount Witch and Fantastic Vourage and Kim Richards, Mount Witch, Nanny and Professor Hello Larry, Tuff- Turf) have also changed. Does the dog have anything to do with her? He is determined to find out and do all he can to save his family. This movie is great because Ike and Kim play a darker part than what I saw in those mountain movies. This is one of the 70 horror films made for television, which was actually scary for a horror movie made for television. Music was terrifying and even the end I do not tell you that made you think. This film also sees Ken Kercheval (Cliff Barnes of Dallas) and R.G. Armstrong (who could not stay away from the devil's films recall "Race with the Devil"?) It's worth watching.
