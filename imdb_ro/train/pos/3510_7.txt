The real fans of the film will love this authentic film. I do not agree with the trolls that qualify this movie as a star of a star and call it unrealistic. Although I do not have the background or not come from the protagonists' environment, I spent many years working in the lower-income neighborhoods and laborers, and I felt that the act was very real and representative of how teenagers behave. I do not know what is the basis for others' comments that the movie is "unrealistic." The dialogue is great. The low amount of budget production did not disturb me a little. I felt that natural illumination improved the character of the movie. The accent was entirely on the line of story and character development, not on Hollywood support or melodrama. <br /> <br /> We have completely bought the motivations and reactions of the character. The act was credible and impressive for new and non-actors. If your idea of ​​good film is Transformers or Fast & Furious, then skip it. If you enjoy dramas driven by characters, then you see. <br /> <br /> (As for negative commentators being "trolls": click their name and you'll see that most of them have no other comments or just negative comments.)
