Nick Cage is Randall Raines, a retired thief who is forced to retire when he is forced to save his brother Kip's life (Giovanni Ribisi) when he cheats his job by fulfilling his brother to steal 50 cars a night. He has to gather his old crew so he can trust him to help him get him out and take his frog out of the Dutch. But the cops are on him, so he can get it out? This was one of the best candidates for a movie to do again because the original was far from a classic. And if you do not come into it waiting a long time and turn the creative part of the brain so that you can ignore the plot hole and take the film for what it is. You will end up enjoying the walk. Look at a double invoice with "Fast and angry" for a high-speed pickup night, just do not take the car for a spin just after. <br /> <br /> My Grade: B - Extras DVD: 7 minutes Jerry Bruckheimer Interview; Bruckheimer Bio / Filmography; Overload: Highlighting reel; Big Chase; "0 to 60" feature; The "Rides Wild" feature; Stars on the move; Cult "Heart painted" musical video; Trailer Theatrical and Trailers for "Shanghai Noon", "Mission on Mars" and "Coyote Ugly"
