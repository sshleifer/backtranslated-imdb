This is a very tough film, hard to hit, even brutally about a deadly break that goes badly. Black and white photography keeps it far from being dated. Mickey Rooney is excellent as the twisted, but oddly pleasing lead. One of the first films to describe the psychological devastation of death. It's also quite painful.
