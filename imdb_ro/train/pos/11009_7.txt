There was an elegant approach to this film from director Vincenzo Natali, with interesting camera angles and effective visual effects. She was also refreshing to see Jeremy Northam and Lucy Liu gave her major roles and expanded their range as interpreters. This film also included one of the most imaginative scenes of "escaping" in recent years. The efforts of the director and the actors combined into an effective thriller. Although the plot of the film was complicated, the story evolved very clearly as the layers of body greed and body weight were revealed. In 1949, George Orwell suggested in his famous novel, "1984," that the future will be driven by the totalitarian state, which will control the mind and diminish the freedom of man. It was interesting that this futuristic film was not the state, but rather the corporate world that controlled and devalued the human worker.
