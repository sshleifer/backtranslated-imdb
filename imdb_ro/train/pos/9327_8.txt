I write this after seeing The Fear Perfect at the Gay and Lesbian Film Festival Mardi Gras in 2002 in Sydney, Australia. When their father dies, two alienated brothers meet at the funeral, and after discovering that one of the brothers dies of AIDS, he enters a reconciliation journey of warming the heart. The two lead a magnificent job of creating the gradual warmth and respect that builds together as the film progresses. However, I have a film about the movie - while the brother who is dying is acting sick, it does not matter. A person from 0 T4 cells would look pretty bad - not even a job was done to make the actor look bad he was hired. A little flu, but one that makes it less realistic. Despite the fact that a small boy, The Perfect Son is a wonderful movie and you should have the chance to see it. I hope to have released the DVD in the near future!
