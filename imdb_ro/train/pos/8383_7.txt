Robot Jox is trying hard, but it is basically a series of battle scenes tied together - robot against the robot, man against man, man against the woman. The premise had potential, but it seems that the scenario was not really given to most of the projects it needed. Still, it was pretty good for a science fiction action film. Part of this is because the script was written by Joe Haldeman. For those who are not familiar with the name, Haldeman wrote the science fiction novel "The Forever War". It is considered one of the best fighting fighting warriors, right there with Robert Heinlein's "Starship Troopers" and John Steakley's "Armor". And this film is really more like a giant army movie than giant robots. It is closer to what fans would have wanted instead of the "Troop Starship" transvestitions of Paul Verhoeven, which had only a passing resemblance to the novel on which it was based. based on Homer's "Iliad". Some names are all they have in common. Achilles, having his robot's foot trapped, had no parallel in the Iliad, which does not include Achilles' death. Neither the old Achilles was a noble warrior. He was the most powerful but also vengeful and small. Even the jock robot killed in the first scene does not fit. He was called Hercules, while the Greek Iliad had Heracles. The effects were good enough for time and budget. True, it was not comparable to "Terminator 2" a year later, but the movie cost ten times more. The stop motion was almost as good as the robot pedestrians in "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi." Better than a lot of animation Ray Harryhausen, which is highly appreciated, but quite dated. You do not expect much from this and you will probably not be disappointed. It's better than a lot of other low-budget movies and even some big-budget blockbuster wannabes that have better effects, but worse scriptures.
