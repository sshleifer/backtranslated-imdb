at first I had the reaction that many people left after seeing this: photos taken by people with fats resting in the sun, etc. they were somehow cheap photos. Okay, so he's meeting with diane arbus. . . regardless. . . but not long before I realized that this was not done in a dehumanized manner as the images unfolded. I felt that the issue was entirely public: we are conditioned by Hollywood and also that looking at people over a certain age to behave in a sexual way is something unusual, something that should not be shown. if that was the whole movie, it would be very much. however, the story of the woman with her abusive boyfriend and drunk friend actually consumes a ton of bricks: very eloquent stories, incredible performances and the belief that the scene has been improvised. the blonde guy is a genius actor. in the end I want to contradict those who say this movie is about how pathetic these people are. the old man who is in the hand with the woman who finally dances for him is completely an OK character that breaks the mold so that you do not simplify the movie by going over it. yes, his dog is killed. this is not a red picture of the world, but it is not. . . completely hopeless. anyway, I was really grateful for making a movie so beautiful. I would not say that each of the threads was as powerful as the strongest, but I say that this movie basically kicks the ass and recommends a lot. . .
