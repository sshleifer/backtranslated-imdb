The list of significant players that appear presents an astonishing understanding of the thinking at that time.

In one of the subsequent episodes, we see Traungl junge, the secretary of Hitler, who was with him in the bunker and was for her as he dictated the last will and testament - she left the bunker after Hitler's suicide and escaped through the Russian lines.

The best documentary series ever made? undoubtedly
