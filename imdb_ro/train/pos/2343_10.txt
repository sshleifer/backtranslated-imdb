Thank god that ABC chose this instead of Fox. The best description (for those who know) is really Wonderfalls meets Dead Like Me in the best possible way. I'm not sure if an experience of death and fate early in life makes me a fan of Brian Fuller, but I'm certainly glad of his productions. Also, I have the pleasure of owning a niche that does not require J Depp or HB Carter to be a wonderful imaginative playground. Here we find the joys and tribulations of childhood and adults that collapse in each and, in fact, make sense and make us want to live as long as we live!
