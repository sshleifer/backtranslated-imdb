I saw this movie as a child on Creature Feature when I lived in New York. It was a pretty creepy movie, though not as good as Horror Hotel. I just bought this movie on DVD, and it is different from what I remember because there are several scenes on the DVD I bought in which the actors speak in French and / or Italian and no subtitles are offered. Then the other actors respond in English to what was said. Pretty weird. Also, on DVD, the names of some actors are written differently than IMDb. Besides, this film is different because Elsie's character takes his clothes and gives him a nude shot in a scene and in another scene, Julia tries to force Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) to do it with her pushing her on the bed and kissing her while Steele resists. This scene existed in the TV version, but it was very edited. I wonder if there are other images that could be embedded in a remarkable ultramodern edition? It seems that some of these old low-budget classics have been divided into bits and sold in all types of edited versions. Where are the boxes and all unused materials? <br /> <br /> Aside from the first boring twenty minutes before Allen is delivered to the Castle, the rest of the movie is pretty good. There are not many special effects (but Herbert's face after Julia's clubs is a good one). The creepy atmosphere and strange, exotic and seductive appearance of Barbara Steele make the film much better than it should be. I can honestly say that if Barbara Steele was not in this movie, it would be a big zero. She makes the movie a ten!
