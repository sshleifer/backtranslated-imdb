This is an amazing film and all actors and actresses and very good! Even though some actors and actresses were not very popular in show business, they seemed to have acted from the age of one year old! It was funny, brutal and just a very good movie. In most parts I did not know what would happen next! I was like I think this will happen, I expect to believe that will happen. All age groups will love this movie! In some parts I could not stop laughing, it was so funny, but in some parts I was totally exaggerated and could not believe what I was seeing! I will definitely watch this movie again! It's one of those movies where you can not get bored. Every time you see it is so suspenseful. I definitely recommend to watch this movie!
