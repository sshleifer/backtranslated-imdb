I removed some of my old music from my garage and this is one of my favorites. It was written by Jay Alan Lerner and directed by Vincent Minelli. He has won two Academy Award nominations for the best 1951 film and Best Screenplay. The story of an American painter in Paris who is trying to make it big. Nina Foch is a sophisticated lady of means and she is very interested in helping him, but soon she learns she loves the guy. Meanwhile, Gene Kelly falls for a beautiful woman, Leslie Caron. The main dance partner, and I have to say that I'm fantastic together on the floor and otherwise. French singer Georges Guietary also plays. So if you like good dances and fun dances filled with the agitated fingers of the Oscar Levant piano, George Gershwyn's songs will live forever in this colorful gem. 8/10
