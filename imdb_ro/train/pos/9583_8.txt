I waited a while to post a review of this documentary, because when I saw it for more than 10 years ago, I wanted to think carefully about what I wanted to write. We found from a documentary point of view that this is a good documentary. He did what he wanted to do, she showed me something I had no idea about, and I was interested in this world she explored. I did not know anything about the world of the Dear and to find out about them and the "Balls" were just spectacular to me. These people were just as talented with what they do and how they do it for the competition. The old guys, the complaints (I even got annoyed when someone told the judge that the coat that the Queen of the Drag was wearing was not a man's coat!), The Gelos, is still there as in any other competition. Like any other competition like this. What I felt was a point. You had the queen later of love talking about how Balls "used" to be compared to dearest dear queens who changed Balls and made several categories of competition - and even those who thought they knew the future of the Balls will change even more when they are ready to go on the track. It was interesting to find out that some of the contestants lived on the street two minutes before the ball, but they came to compete, it was so important to them! Then there were sad stories, stories about who "house" and "house mate" brought the best and brightest of the competition. It was interesting. Now, after 10 years of watching this movie, I have lived through Madonna's so-called madness. I have seen some familiar faces in this documentary that came to Madonna during her "Vogue" phase and rightly so. If not for those individuals, Madonna would not have had a "Vogue" phase, I know that now. Appropriations should be granted if the loan is a DUE. It makes me wonder if anyone in the American mass would watch this documentary, they will learn that they are not as "mainstream" as they think.
