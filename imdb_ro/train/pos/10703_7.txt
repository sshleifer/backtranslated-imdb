This movie is definitely a strange story of love. Although this film can not be too much to cry, Nicole Kidman plays the film on its own, the rest of the play might be forgotten though Ben Chaplin does a good job of Hertfordshire Life with photos of St Albans & Hemel Hempstead city center representing the true essence of the area. What begins to look like an ordinary episode of the British popular series "Heartbeat" soon turns into a gangster action shoot. Nothing really happens to be memorable in this simple little movie and thus ends up as a rather decent weekend entertainment. A good thing to watch, and if you like the hero John are lonely thirty something, you can find something to identify with in his character.
