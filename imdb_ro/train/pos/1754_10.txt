This movie starts hilariously at the 15-second mark and continues throughout the film. I do not remember a scene where I did not come back to look at the people who laughed with me. he is the perfect actor for this roll because of how he looks and how he dressed. The comedy parties were wonderful to see from not very large or popular actors. As you can see that people make this movie, it is currently rated at 7.9 on IMDb. I think it should be 250. So let's say that, I did not see this fun of an American pie or original holiday movie. See if you want to laugh. I give this movie 2 of the highest fingers we've ever given since we found out about IMDb, a great movie site.
