This is a great "little" movie. I say "small" because he does not have hundreds of firearms or a dozen explosions, as in a John Woo movie. Great performances by Roy Scheider and the three bad guys. John Frankenheimer seems to have more luck with small productions these days. The movie is very easy to see, the story is more a yarn than a washing machine - instead of everything that happens around and around, it seems that things get worse as the plot thickens. Terrific, very positive. I have never read Elmore Leonard's book, but it can not be much different from the movie because it feels like watching a movie by Elmore Leonard.
