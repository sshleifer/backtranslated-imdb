This is not a great movie, but I admire writers and directors for trying something different. The main theme of the film is fate and small things, seemingly insignificant, that can greatly change the future. In some respects, this reminds me of the SLIDING DOORS film, though, instead of focusing on a random event, things seem to happen repeatedly and each contributes to building a nice conclusion. In addition, a strange bald guy seems to understand all this and he talks about it during a short scene - as if he were an omnipotential man, but there is no explanation about him in the movie (like the two guys fighting one another in the watch tower film in the HUDSUCKER PROUD). The jacket of the DVD shows only Audrey Tautou. This is exploited by her success in AMELIE, though she is just one of the many actors in the film and no longer plays the lead role. The rhythm is brisk, acting well and the conclusion is not bad at all. The only reason why I did not write it up is that some characters were a little interesting and I think the movie could have been tightened with fewer subplots.
