This is a very strange film by director / animator Richard Williams. Everyone who knows of William's work knows that it's a little out (if not ingenious), but he takes the cake. He has two unfortunate ragdolls that have to save the new French doll of their owner from a pirate lust and are at the mercy of several bizarre characters along the way. The power in this film lies primarily in its aesthetic quality; the strange designs of the character, his powerful animation and the strong contrast between sweet and frightening. Williams's brilliant animation portrayed Raggedy Ann and Andy as real, cuddly puppets, rather than simple versions of doll cartoons, which made it more credible (at least in a visual sense) . The animation shines on the way of bringing Camel-wrinkled knees, whose body goes with two different personalities who control each end, watching the movie with Sir Leonard Looney and, of course, with Greedy. <br /> <br /> The greedy animation, alone, is probably the most refined psychedelic animation I've ever seen. There is something about this animation that only makes your jaw drop - and every second is something new. To live in what was considered the "Taffy Pit," "Greedy" is a massive man who lives and mercilessly eats sweets. He plays a song I can not help but feel sexually underground, then tries to kill Raggedy Ann for her candy heart. The only complaint I have about this movie is that there are too many songs. She continues to face the rhythm of the film because there are sixteen of them. There are about six good songs (which should have been the only ones), including "I look and see what?", "No toy girl", "Blue" (though they did not have to make him play twice) , "I'm not really here", "Because I love you" and maybe "I'm home". The others seem to be useless and sincerely they are not too amazing to listen. This is a strange movie with strange subtleties, but if that's what you're looking for, you will not find it better.
