After not seeing all the movies released in 2002, I can not say that this is the best movie of the year. I can say it's the best movie I've seen all year round. <br /> <br /> Most American black movies are either obsessed with American concern with "racial relations," or falling into the ghetto clich√©s inside the city, with every imaginable steropos that throws ebony slang. Antwone Fisher stands proudly alone in this regard: the race is irrelevant, with the exception of a single battle that may or may not have been caused by a racial weakness. Antwone Fisher's story is one that should resonate with any empathic person. He is underestimated and thoughtful, portrayed by Derek Luke. Denzel Washington, obviously using his power to make his film, collapses mostly in the background and allows the film to be the story of Antwone Fisher. <br /> <br /> At a time when BET and popular culture generally want to maintain the ghettoization of a large number of Americans (and also Canadians, you know), this is a film that talks about humankind in all of us. I just hope the non-black audience will watch this movie for that humanity rather than avoid it because I feel there are no characters or actors in the movie that can be identified. This would be a sad comment on racial relations in North America and itself. <br /> <br />
