Good movie like I said, but you definitely have to see it worth a watch. These are two boys, Mac and Sam, who are good friends and work as fashion photographers, and the laughing time begins when Mac (Akshay Kumar) begins to meet with 3 hosts while leaving his wife suspicious . Sam gets wealth and almost forgets his friend, but not completely. But Mac thinks so and so begins to meet with the host in the air. there is a massage garage every step of the movie, rock songs, but some things are missing. Comedy is not branded and deserves a prize. Very nice, but not so excellent. Some people laughed until their stomach aches were painful but did not deserve much laughter. But, of course, everyone's opinion is different. So if you want to watch the movie, you are welcome to do this.
