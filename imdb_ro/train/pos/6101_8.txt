So do not ruin it for you, I'll be very short. There are some extraordinary lines of action and amusement from the attractive distribution. A young graduate of the Harvard School of Environment (Brian White) learns he does not know as much as he thinks about people. She goes to a small Florida hospital for an internship, because a girlfriend (Mya) let him work as a television producer. His senior resident (Wood Harris), greatly helped by his "creative collaborator" (Zoe Saldana), brings him to speed. It helps them protect their career and show them the broader possibilities that come from being a compassionate doctor instead of a player who just wants to make money (as it seems to be true for many of my premedicated friends).
