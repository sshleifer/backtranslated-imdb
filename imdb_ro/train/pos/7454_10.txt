** Warning - this post may contain spoilers ** We only received a Gamecube in September 2005 and the first two games I bought were James Bond's games, decent Under Under agent and boring Goldeneye Rogue Agent. The next game I was planning was Everything or Nothing, because my friend told me that it is better than the two games I have already had. I have to say he was right. <br /> <br /> I bought this for a tenner in HMV, and when I got home I hit him in my cube and played it for hours. It was much better than my other two games, and it was a much better and more interesting story. The charts were some of the best I've seen (but now that XBOX 360 has come out, Farcry Instincts Predator has some of the best graphics known to man). The story was smart; the crazy man (Willem Dafoe, named Nikolai Diavolo) and the beautiful grandmother (Heidi Klum, called Katya Nadanova) are trying to destroy the world with small nanobots, who at the start of the game, James Bond, have to destroy a train. The bad one is that one of them is hidden in Katya's tits. Then you have to counteract their plans and save the world. The great thing about this game is that there are actually actors expressing characters such as Cleese expressing Q. There are 27 levels, some of them short and some of them quite long and difficult. <br /> <br /> Gameplay - 10/10 Graphics - 9/10 Sound - 9/10 Replay Value - 7/10 Multiplayer - 8/10 <br /> <br /> Give this game a total of 90%
