Sarah Silverman is a dangerous bitch! She's beautiful, sexy, funny and talented, dark and demonic. I read the other "comment" on this show, as well as stuff on the message board and people do not understand it. Nothing that appears on TV is not an accident. Too much money, time and work are put into the production of a T.V. to make mistakes. This show is bad because Sarah wanted to be bad. This show is juvenile, because Sarah wanted to be juvenile. I thought the jokes were great, and the thematic show as well as the other musical numbers are wonderful bizarre. It's like Pee-Wee's Playhouse, because he slept deep, twenty-one, of adhesives, Pornstars Future of America in the Vale. The distribution is great. Scenarios and actions are good. I hope this show will succeed, because Comedy Central did not let David hold on to the show. Who plays Sarah's sister? It was not included in the distribution list on the show's home page. I would love to see her stand-up. Does anyone know about her future presentation data or DVDs that could float around here?
