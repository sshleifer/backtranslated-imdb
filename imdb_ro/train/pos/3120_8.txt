Paul Greengrass has definitely saved the best Bourne for the last one! I have heard that many people complain about the film, and some even compared the room style with the Blair Witch project. All I have to say is ... do you fuck me? Come on, it was not that bad at all. I think it helps the action scenes feel more realistic, which I would prefer a very stylized cascade choreography. As for the rest of the movie, I did not even notice that. You can say that Damon was really enriched with the role of Jason Bourne. Sometimes it may be a bad thing, but in this case it is a very good thing. He really gets Jason Bourne in this installment. Damon also has a strong cast in the role of Joan Allen, Ezra Kramer and Julia Stiles. David Strathairn was an extraordinary addition to the distribution, adding more to the CIA secret organization. Even if the movie is full of big car chases and nonstop actions, they have managed to remain a fair amount of development of their characters with everything that's going on. This movie is far above the other two Bourne movies and is certainly one of the best movies in the 2007 summer season!
