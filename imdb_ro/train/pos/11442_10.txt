<br /> <br /> So, because I'm not a poet, I have no real way to convey the beauty and simplicity of this documentary. Goldsworthy's effortless movement, while forming the beauty of nature in his own work, is exciting. Watch him get stuck together in a tape hanging from a tree in a close for a few minutes, while talking about his work, and then receiving the payments when the camera cuts the shot. Be amazed at the ease with which it operates and then make useless when a light breeze beats all the canvas. Goldsworthy's genius knows no limits, for his inspiration is nature itself. It is the essential change of nature in which its work, though complete in its sphere, is made whole.
