He's very cunning for all 60 years to watch the movie. Humor is pretty gentle, but it grew much more than I expected. Distribution is of prime importance and seems to have a wonderful time. Ustinov wanders through the film, mumbling some pretty funny things under his breath, and it is very little important; I will buy the movie as soon as it appears on DVD. The part is that Ustinov, as a man of service, was released from prison, showing his computer and throwing money from an American company with an office in London. Maggie Smith is his secretary for a while, and her gaze was fired from many different jobs is part of the fun. Bob Newhart is his usual character, and Karl Malden has fun as a dashing and crazy executive director who runs the London office. The end is fun and cynical.
