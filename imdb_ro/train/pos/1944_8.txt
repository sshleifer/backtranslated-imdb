This is an excellent movie about adults in the adult swimming class, issues, relationships and interactions between them. It should have been a wider distribution because it is much better than similar movies from major studios at the same time. The swimming instructor is an almost Olympic lesson, reduced to adult learning, and often the target to meet from his students. He tries, more or less, to prevent them with different results. Student characters are the main sources in the US; teachers, policemen, students and retirees who have not learned to swim for any reason. The film covers relationships between them, including friends, relatives and romantic conquests as they pass through the classroom. Several sublots offer fun feeds, including a divorce teacher, some high school students who do a documentary, and a girl who is just in the class to meet boys. This is a good date movie, or just one to watch when you are in a mood for a romantic drama with reality tones.
