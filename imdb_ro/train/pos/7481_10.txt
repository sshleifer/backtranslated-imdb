I could not agree with the quotation "this is one of the best movies ever made". If you think Vanilla Sky is simply a "re-make", you could not be worse. There is a tremendous depth in this movie: visual, musical, and emotional, visually, because the movie is soft and delicate at times (early scenes with Sofia) and in other strong and intense moments (Times Square, post-climax scenes). <br /> <br /> Music and tie tones in this movie so perfectly. Without music, the story is only half said. Nancy Wilson created an emotional and yet eclectic film for the movie, which could not be better suited for such a dream theme (although it was never launched, I managed to get my hand on the original score for about $ 60. you may find yourself a copy yourself). other Crowe musical selections, such as The Beach Boys, Josh Rouse, Spiritual, Sigur Ros of Monkees, etcetera etcetera, are also perfectly suited for the movie (Crowe has an ear for music). <br /> <br /> More importantly, the emotional themes in this movie (for example, love, sadness, regret) are very strong, and ten times the visual and musical experience, as well as the ingenious dialogue, are amplified; I admit, the lift scene brings tears in my eye and time again. <br /> <br /> The best part of this movie however (as if it could get any better) is that it's so intelligently designed so that every when you see the movie you will catch something new - so watch closely and be ready to think! Sure, a theme becomes obvious after the first or second watch, but there is always more to the story than you think. <br /> <br /> This is easy for Cameron Crowe's best work, and quite a brilliant work. Much of my inspiration for film and music comes only from this work. He honestly touched my life, because true art has a tendency to do. I am always surprised that there are many people who can not appreciate this film for what it is (I think I understand true art is an art in itself). Bottom Line: Vanilla Sky is in a league of its own.
