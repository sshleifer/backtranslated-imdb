Watching Rin is one of the best anti-Nazi propaganda films during the Second World War. Paul Lukas deserves his Oscar, of course. Bette Davis shines brilliantly as a great actress and beauty. I would recommend this film to those interested in that era and, of course, the fabulous films of Ms. Bette Davis.
