Who knew it could be so funny? Christopher Meloni and Janel Moloney are more known for their remarkable work in some of the hottest dramas of television. ("The Law and Order: SVU" and "The West Wing") Put them together on the big screen and what you get is an interesting romantic comedy with lots of laughter. Actors develop the ongoing story relationship with impressive skill, leaving the audience bound to fall in love with Barry Singer (Meloni), despite being a stunt comedian who also happens to be a racist and racist villain. I will root them, even if he takes all the uncertainties with the opposite sex and follows Thea (Moloney) halfway through the country, hoping to win the heart. They have so little in common ... but when Barry opens his heart, you wonder why Thea continues to run away. Souler Opposite is a wonderful movie with incredible casting and a talented writer. Well it's worth the time. <br /> <br />
