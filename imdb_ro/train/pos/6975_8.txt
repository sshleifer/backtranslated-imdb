If I just saw the pilot of this show, I would have rated it at 10. I was immediately caught up in this wonderful world. Subsequent episodes have not reached the promise, but I will continue to pursue and hope to improve. Production values ​​are incredible and action is of prime importance. It does not bother me that she does not seem to be perfectly aligned with BSG because I'm so intrigued by the premise and confronted with it, there are two different shows. I am delighted that both Esai Morales and one of my former, Eric Stoltz, are returning to my life (if only weekly), as we have both lost. This is a show that requires a little thought from its audience and is always a good thing. You have to wrap your head around certain aspects of the show; things are not always as they seem and certainly are gray, both literally and figuratively, in plotting lines, characters and, of course, the different virtual worlds. We all know how it ends, but the journey is expected to be a walk.
