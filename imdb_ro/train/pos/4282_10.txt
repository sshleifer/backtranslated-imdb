Extraordinary characters developed in many fun, moody, absurd and serb mentality situations. The film is a great comedy, pleasant, interesting, unpredictable. The best point in a movie: characters, then humor, story and dialogue. Humor has an "inner development," rare in Serbian movies. So it is a consequence of the characterization, it is well motivated, spontaneous and convincing. It is also sharp, intelligent and lucid. Most of the films, unfortunately, have built humor (create a joke and put it in the mouth of a character) or ordinary comedy, burlesque, farce. Some of the "immortality of art" are incorporated into this film. Few masterpieces, hard to reach.
