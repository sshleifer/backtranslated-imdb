In front of her, a movie about women wanting to see a football match would not make much appeal to someone who has a low interest in football, like me, but it's not about football, but about discrimination and women's enthusiasm for sport that I love . The film opens on the day of the World Cup qualifying match between Iran and Bahrain, a girl trying to enter the Azadi stadium in Tehran by dressing as a boy, apparently will receive it until a soldier tries to look for her. Once caught, it is taken to a small enclosure outside the stadium, where there is a handful of women who have already been trapped, guarded by a small group of conscripts, the leader being rather back home, animals. I have never learned the character's name, but we know them as people like the girls who advocate with the guards to let them look, although they are in a wall space, and when they refuse to try to make them supply at least one comment. <br /> <br /> In addition to making an important point about the rigid segregation of sex in much of Iran, the film contains many funny moments like "disguising" one of the girls is made to wear when going to the toilet and the girl who disguised himself as a soldier and was caught only because he chose to look at the match from a place reserved for a high officer. The girls' enthusiasm for the game is such that, to the end, the spectator is likely to be on the edge, hoping that Iran will win and thus reach the German finals. The soldiers are not present as fundamentalists, they are just recruits who are there because it must be and explaining to girls why the woman can not follow men's sport does not seem convinced of their own arguments. It is a shame that this film can not be seen in Iran itself, but it is good for the wider world to see it and thus to see that ordinary Iranians are not a bunch of desperate fanatics to make war in the West, but ordinary people with the same passions and preoccupations as people everywhere. The cast has done a great job in making their characters look like real people, rather than simple cartoons.
