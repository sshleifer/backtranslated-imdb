Unborn is a very, very different movie. James Karen & Brooke Adams are in the movie and have done pretty well. this movie builds solid and keeps you up to date. Although I think you have to be a horror fan to watch this because of scenes and plot. There is a short sex scene without nudity that could have been left out and for some people this scene could disappoint someone like me who is in the movie and think things ruin a good movie, but when it comes to that. There's a scene where Adams's character crazy and kills a cat, but you can tell it's not real. Music is very different, but very good. Unborn in my opinion is a really creepy movie that is extremely unpredictable and it is quite strange! I recommend all horror fans to this movie!
