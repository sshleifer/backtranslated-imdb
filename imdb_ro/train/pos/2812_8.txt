"Silverlake Life" is a documentary and it was simple and simple. In fact, it was more like a home movie, and if you want dramatic illumination, you see something else. And he's not a tearjerker at all. But I want to say this in positive ways. This shows that two men who love each other and how they are affected by AIDS affect the quality of their daily lives. It is almost difficult for me to say whether it was a quality film or not, because he was so naked that I had to look for other ways to respond. It's an admirable movie, actually one of the most admirable and sincere documents I've ever seen. These two people have incredible integrity as their lives are reduced to the most basic parts. It makes the Silo wood produce look hip and heart. These people have made this film for themselves, which is one of the best reasons to create something. The scene in which Tom plays "You are my sun" to mark it and say good-bye is the real thing.
