Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) is unfairly accused of killing his unfaithful wife. On the night he was killed, he came out with a mystery woman who refused to give her her name. After being charged with murder, the police visited all the places she had done with her, but people just remember that she was alone. He was sentenced to death, and his secretary (Ella Raines) intends to find her because she loves him. It was made as a B movie from Universal (look at the actors - and a star - Franchot Tone - in decline). The budget was small and the piece was mostly unknown, but what came out is one of the best movie hunters of the 1940s. It is beautifully directed by Curt Siodmak and has a fantastic script that came from an excellent book by William Irish (a name for Cornell Woolrich). It moves fast and looks fantastic. And it's an infamous jam session with Raines and Elisha Cook Jr., just out of the screen with incredible sexual energy (I'm surprised the censors did not cut him). defects that prevent this from being perfect. Tone offers terrible performance. It looks terrible and it's just horrible. Curtis is also rigid and slim like Henderson. You're wondering why Raines loves him - he's so unhealthy. But Raines is good enough in the lead role. She's beautiful and lively. Also, the last scene where the killer is after her never sounds true. It is not a physical threat and its reactions seem to be overstated. I still give a 9th movie. A really great movie - defects aside.
