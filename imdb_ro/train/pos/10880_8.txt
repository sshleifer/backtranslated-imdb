He falls somewhere in the middle. A fun somewhere. Pleasant, well built somewhere. You do not have to say "do not take it seriously" or "so bad good" or "it was not scary." None of these comments is relevant. <br /> <br /> Cut is the atmosphere. It is that atmosphere that is actually very unique and a really original aspect of the film, which is what the film does for me personally.
