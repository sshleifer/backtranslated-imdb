Anyone who loves Rheostatics music will enjoy this movie. I have some minor complaints, especially about rhythm rhythm and the distribution of some actors (not Maury) who are not really convinced of their roles, but I do not have time to write a detailed review. I just want to alert someone who has seen this movie or intends to watch this movie as it was shown by CBC television in Canada: the version of CBC is the Reader's Digest version of WHALE MUSIC --- you do not watch it . It cuts whole scenes and subplots (if you can do that) in the movie. CBC, which features most of the untouched films, took half the courage from BOUUT MUSIC. I do not know why. It's horrible what they did for the movie. Rent the video or watch it in a theater, but DO NOT watch it on a CBC TV.
