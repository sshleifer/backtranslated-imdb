Kasparov's or Fischer's best games can be a mess for a total beginner. This is a great movie. There is no special agency involved in the plot. That's the clue! This is a PRIVAT plot, built as a private enterprise. This is a self-destructive and self-organized plot. As a conclusion, the script described the perfectly professional park: private, self-organized, self-destructive, without trace to the end. Anyone can be behind the plot: a smart "director" with some money. All can be done by delegation. The "Director" should be just a trigger. If the normal spectator can not see the essence of the plot in the explicit sequences of the film, a true plot is less likely to be discovered. All the performances of the actors are well done, with a special mention for Gene Hackman and Mickey Rooney.
