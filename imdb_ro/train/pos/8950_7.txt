For those unknown to Jimmy Stewart, this is one of his "smaller" films later in his career. And though it's not a great movie compared to many of his other pictures, it's not bad and it's a decent time passer - but no more. Kim Novak is a witch in New York City and for an inexplicable reason, decides to make a spell on the poor Jimmy to make him fall in love with her. Over time, Mrs. Novak is getting cold and getting out of the way, too, trying to fall in love with Stewart - and apparently in the witch's rule book, this is NO, NO! <br /> <br /> The film is strange in its sensibilities of witches. They are neither the kind of slaughter of the child nor the almighty variety. Most of their magic is quite limited and unnecessary (like Jack Lemmon using his powers to stop street lamps). And very strange witches seem boemani found in hip bars, where you can find people wearing berets and jazz miserable. Given what I'm thinking about jazz, I really have to be a witch in the world of this movie! Anyway, the movie is pretty romantic and easy to comedic, but it's not something that rushes me to look. The actor is pretty good, but the script does not offer enough payouts to make this film an exceptional film - in fact, I almost scored the 6th movie - it was very close.
