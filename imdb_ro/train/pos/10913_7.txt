William Powell is a doctor who deals with a murder and a former wife in "The Ex-Mrs. Bradford", also with Jean Arthur, Eric Blore and James Gleason. Apparently Powell did chemistry with almost every woman he was equipped with. Although he and Myrna Loy were the perfect pair of the screen, the actor also made several "Thin Man" films, one with Ginger Rogers and one with Arthur, both for a very good effect. he never gets tired of seeing Powell as a professional full of spell, a delight and "The Ex-Mrs. Bradford" is no exception. The former lady. B had Mr. B with a citation for the back pension and then moved back to help him solve a mystery he swallowed. And it's not the first time he did that! It appears almost as if there had been a movie "Bradford" before this movie or that it was intended to be the first of a series of films - Mr. B complains that his ex-writer mystery brings him constantly in cases. This time, a rider who rides his favorite horse in growth raises mysteriously the horse and dies just before the finish line. The solution to the case is somewhat extraordinary, but it's near the point. The point is the banter between the couple and the ex-lady's interference. B. Jean Arthur is pretty glamorous in her role and very funny. However, with an actress who comes as brain as Arthur does, humor seems more intentional than featherbrained. I suspect that the writer had something else in mind - let's say, Carole Lombard's harsh part. When Arthur hears that the police arrived, she says, "It's probably my food, I've waited for the police to get a hand in it." It's more of a Powell problem than a serious statement. It still works well and shows how a good actress can be part of. It is definitely worth looking, as were always William Powell and Jean Arthur.
