The three main characters are very well portrayed, especially Anisio of rock musician who turned into the first actor Paulo Miklos. He is extremely convincing as the inferior class of the trespasser / invader. The film looks very good at the snowball effect of getting involved in increasingly shady business, the contrast and the similarities between the lower and upper classes. As everyone moves away with greed and ambition. 9-9.5 out of 10.
