This film is a perfect portrayal of the Nutcracker; the dance is great, the landscape in the background was excellent, and I loved that flower standing. Oh, and costumes ... I especially loved Marzipan, tutu was adorable. The special effects were very well done (for example, the tree, the bed, etc.) and I enjoyed the rats very much. I like how it did not make them scary, but cute and hugely. Except for the King, I suppose. If you are a full masculine person, you will not enjoy it, but this is a great movie that is good for all ages - not just all testosterone levels. But I have a few complaints. First, why did they make her Fairy's Fairy partner in these terrible socks? It would have been hard to change if he was emptied! And secondly ... why did EARTH have to do PINK from Culkin's point of view?
