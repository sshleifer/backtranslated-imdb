as a sequel, this is not a bad movie.I really liked it better than the first one.I found it more entertaining.it seemed to have been documentary style shot.at the first this bothered me, I thought it looked just too low budget.but grew on me, and made the film look more authentic. This film has more dry one liners than the original, which is a good thing in my opinion. i think they sometimes have walked a little over the top with some of the scenes and characters. It almost becomes a parody in itself, which can be the point. This film has at least a little suspense, which the first one did not have, in my opinion. It has some of the same great music from the original, which is great. The actor was quite decent again, although as I said, some of them seemed to be over. I also felt that the movie lost a lot of impulse towards the end and there are a few minutes that seem very slow and just do not seem to flow, just like the rest of the movie. Still, I think it was a pretty sequel The y evaluation for "Return to the cabin by the lake" is 7/10 *
