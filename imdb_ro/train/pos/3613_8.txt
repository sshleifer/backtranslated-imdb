When "Girlfight" appeared, reviews commended him, but I did not get to see this. I finally saw it when it was released on the video, and understand the shining comments. The film opens in a high school, in the middle of a ghetto. We get in quickly to student Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez). She has a bad expression on her face, and any idea of ​​Diana that we might get from this expression will soon become corroborated when she struggles. As Diana faces problems in this regard, we meet her father, an aggressive guy in her own way; we clearly can not blame Diana for her attitude. But then the movie really starts, as a new thought germinates in Diana's mind: boxing as a way to escape this gloomy existence. Her older brother has already entered the box, but her father will most likely not approve. Only Diana herself can decide what to do. Just the first few minutes I realized that I was in a very brilliant film and not Hollywood, but John Sayles's brief appearance in a supporting role said this. Just before you get to any boxing scene, you feel like you're facing the front, seeing the ugly life Diana is experiencing. And when they finally get to the main story of the movie, they will not come back. Everything, I definitely recommend this movie. I will admit that using boxing as a means of showing someone trying to do something has been a sort of cliché in cinema for many years ("Rocky", "Million Dollar Baby"), but I think they did it good work here. In fact, this brought the genre to apex. Very good. Too bad Michelle Rodriguez has been scattered in Hollywood movies after that.
