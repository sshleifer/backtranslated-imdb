SPOILERS This is an exciting film about grifters. But who is someone here? When the hunter turns prey? This dark and dark film moved slowly and seductively. Shoot you and shoot you on the proverbial garden path just to play as you think you're safe. It has a riveting scenario with good action (at least from the drivers). I did not notice the background music, but it was never haggard, so it must have been done well. I was very surprised that I liked this movie, because I usually do not go to that kind of thing, but that brought me in and I kept it hanging all the way.
