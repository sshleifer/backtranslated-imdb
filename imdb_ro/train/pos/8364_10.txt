Robot Jox does not suffer from story or bad effects. I mean, it was 1990 if you know what I'm talking about. RoboCop 2 has still used the animation to stop, because most of the movies did in the '80s. If you look at the biggest success movies during this time, most have done what they could with the special effects photos that were available to them at the time. It was only after Terminator 2: Judgment Day was released the following year that there was a breakthrough in technology, and those who began to tell began to use this reason. But you'll have pleasant memories of Transformers, Gundam Wing, even Power Rangers, if you watch this movie. The enemy robot is very threatening. It makes you unwilling to face the man without a good plan of support. And there are some wonderful moments in this movie. A traitor / spy is working in their midst. Whoever you think is on your side, supporting yourself all the way, could be the person you did not expect to be. And it's very upsetting to believe that, do not you agree?
