I argue that the one who is ultimately responsible for creating / approving the trailer for this film has completely failed. I do not know he wanted to see this preview-based movie, and everyone who saw him (which I know) loved him absolutely ... The advertising campaign is disastrous / disastrous / wrong. at # 4 behind ... # 1-Rush Hour, which I have not seen, average IMDb score of 7.4. <br /> <br /> # 2-Bourn Ultimatum, which I saw a great movie, but the third week off, the IMDb average score of 8.7 (I deserve to say). 3-Simpsons Movie, which I saw, good movie, but week 4, the average IMDb score of 8.1 (a bit bigger in my opinion). # 4-Stardust, average IMDb score of 8.4 (less than Bourn, but this was 3 weeks). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Whether it was bad programming or bad advertising I think the powers behind this movie have lasted long! This should have been published as an amazing film that happens to be a fantasy / fairy tale and has not been published as another fairy tale? Too bad: (Anyway ... Now that I very badly blazed on-and-on ... Lovely movie, go see!
