... or was Honest Iago smirking, in fact, at the end of the year, as he died? He loved the way that Bard's iambic pentameter ran from Fishburne's tongue with excellent clarity and excitement. <br /> <br /> And as Branagh made Honest Iago they seem to celebrate their own evil ... This is a wonderful movie. I have often thought Shakespeare is not inherently friendly with the movie: Use words to create images in our minds, which creates a perennial battle with the camera that only knows how to think and feel. Every effort to shoot Shakespeare must really be celebrated. It's not easy to do.
