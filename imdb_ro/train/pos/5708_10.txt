This is so exciting! After seeing her "La Roue" this afternoon, a short, light-hearted short film, I think this is a real treat! This is absolutely delightful and one of the most charming pictures I've ever seen this year. It's more amazing, since it's an early show, and it puts some awesome pictures of the 30's to shame thanks to the innovative use of sound in cinema. It is simply full of music and an adorable mood that is really optimistic, and in the bottom line it made me happy! Obviously, it would not be so difficult to get back the lottery ticket men look for, but the rhythm is so exhilarating and the movie is so spectacularly fun that I did not even think about it. The comedy is often hilarious and I think it's even superior to the Marx brothers, probably the greatest comedy power of time. This is quite perfect.
