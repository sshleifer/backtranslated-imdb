Fire and Ice is an animated film set in a fantasy world. The movie is about a village that is destroyed by a giant glacier, which is the evil guard house called Nekron. The only survivor of the village is a young man named Larn, who intends to take revenge on those killed by the glacier. The Ice Glacier moves through the country of fire, and the princess of the country called Teegra is abducted by evil creatures. Larn decides to find her and also tries to find and kill Nekron. Fire and Ice are directed by Ralph Bakshi, one of my favorite animators. He has brought us animated masterpieces like Fritz The Cat's movie version and some of the films he has written, like the great Heavy Traffic movie. I did not like fire and ice as much as Ralph Bakshi's other work, but I found the film to be nice. She had some pretty animations and the story was fun. The only basic complaints I have are that I want the movie to have more story because the story she uses is very thin and there is not much. I also want the movie to be a bit longer because it's under 80 minutes during running. Still, it's about adventure action fun movies that, unlike Fritz Cat or Heavy Traffic, is suitable for children aged 8 and over. I just want to have a more developed story and it went more than she did.
