Perhaps the most brilliant and made of all Indian films - Pakeezah does not fit into any of the traps associated with the Bollywood movie (that is, rejection, farce, enormous imitation and unsuccessful imitation of Western film themes / genres). Pakeezah is indigenous sub-continent and authentic, almost lady Butterfly-like in plot. Characters are well-developed, targeted, though sometimes not perceived by today's perceptual and persuasive standards. The means spoken by Urdu in the time of Pakeezah were overwhelmingly overwhelming and the way the dialogue conveys the subtleties of the age! The actors (especially the "appearance" and the dynamics among the characters) are a pleasure to look at, though the nuances can be lost to contemporary viewers or those who are not familiar with the habits and customs of Muslim India. , with an exciting script is a beautiful musical score, enriched by the protagonist who displays the eminent command of Indian classical dance (kathak). As with the most romantic tragedies, the heroine has to die, but she does not take her leave from the audience without the spectator feeling partisan in a truly memorable cinematic experience. Pakeezah is certainly the highlight of the Indian cinema and is unlikely to be parallel.
