I caught a small concert on public television and I knew I had to have it. Boys give all Royal Albert people a great, often thrilling performance, complete in every respect. Simply - not synthesis, lasers and stroboscopes smoky in smoke, no grand entrance (and an unstoppable, serious and appreciative audience who left their glass missiles at home). Be a Cream fan (or if you've heard of them); if you're a blues fan; if you're a rock 'n' roll fan; you will not be disappointed when viewing and listening to this DVD. You will also never lose this DVD because you will not lend it to anyone. (This DVD justifies selfishness! Tell them to get their own!) It's too good and too replayable; you will want to keep it at your fingertips.
