Maria Braun is an extraordinary woman who is fully and very credible despite the fact that she was so tired to be limited to implausibility. She will do everything to do her marriage work, including shameful opportunism and sexual manipulation. And so, under the exterior, it reveals a rather sweet system of values. The film suffers from a sudden and unexpected ending, which then feels totally inappropriate, familiar with completing the creative creative writing exercise with "and then I wake up." It's also ended with the book at the other end with the most eccentric title sequence I've ever seen, but do not let none of them escape you.
