This Hong Kong film shot boot boxes in more melodies than the "Young & The Restless" week. This is rather a return to the original "Emmanuelle" trilogy (especially "Goodbye Emmanuelle") than a D'Amato sleazefest. Chai Lee (Emy Wong) suffers a stunning transformation from nurse to hot streetwalker. Old Star Star Star Rape / politician Illona Staller, who later goes under the name of Ciccolina (and has sex with an HIV positive John Holmes) plays Emy's contest. Exotic locations and some decent soft base scenes around this out. Recommended for fans of the original "Emmanuelle", of which I am one!
