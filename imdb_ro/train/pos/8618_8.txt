Pop tests: You are part of the modern armed forces in peace time during routine maneuvers and you are thrown back in time with a chance to change history. What are you doing? Well, if you're a Hollywood studio, you change Japanese GIs to GI. Samurai (aka Timeslip) to the crew of an American air carrier, they have been discussing stopping the Pearl Harbor attack for 90 minutes and then going home and hoping no one remembers that Japan did it first and with more balls in 1979 this movie Sonny Chiba. But unlike its Hollywood counterpart The Final Countdown, it sees its premise by: throwing back 400 years in the Japanese feudal wars, its peace soldiers, resolving that the best hope of returning is to provoke history by trying to change it by joining a warrior to conquer the country? with lots of tanks of helicopters and helicopters against the samurai action, including a very impressive 25-minute battle sequence, which has a distribution of thousands that cause serious damage to each other. And yes, there are decapitations. Of course, things do not go as planned, and even the superior firepower does not rise as well as the hope of thousands of soldiers. Even before that, the soldiers get stuck with each other in those who want to go home, those who want to go to war, and those who want to plunder and rob the hell. Impressively directed and surprisingly well thought out, soft stones and country and western songs are sometimes a distraction, especially when they contain English verses sung by Japanese singers who, audibly, can not pronounce words speaking the tongue, but it is a defect in a surprisingly good sci-fi action. <br /> <br /> The British Optimum DVD is a good 138-degree free transfer.
