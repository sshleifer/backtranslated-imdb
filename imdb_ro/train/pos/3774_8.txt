Following Bill's brilliant Bill and Ted's excellent adventure, Bill and Ted are threatened from the future, while evil Chuck De Nomolos sends two evil robots, disguised as Bill and Ted get into the ground to kill people Bill and Ted to change the future. In a great combination of comedies, Winter and Reeves excel to offer delicious humor to the audience in this sequel of entertainment. Although lacking the clarity of the first, Bogus Journey still has the most important phrases and dialogues from the lead pair, not to mention a hilarious interpretation of William Sadler, who brings a humorous face to the figure of the deep, the sombre sickle. Look for the sequences of games, the best moment in the whole movie, but one of the best techniques used to justify the genre. Although still humorous, this film has a more dramatic film towards him, the stakes are more serious and risky situations. <br /> <br /> This gives the film a great dimension and another loved feature. The creators also stretch the limits of the fanciful genre and the use of realism, with hell and sky being strongly symbolic and present in the plot. The genre of fantasy is again on the spot with the amazing use of the car that travels over time, though again somewhat confused in some points with the use of the calendar and the objects and situations that are placed before it is now, as can be seen in the last couple of scenes. The first time I hated this sequel, but the second time was a real joy because I appreciated the jokes and the story more and although the jokes and the plot are not as strong as its predecessor, Bogus Journey has good reason, jokes and a plot quite firmly to make a good family movie.
