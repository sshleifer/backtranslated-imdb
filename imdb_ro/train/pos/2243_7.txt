I thought the whole movie played handsome with fresh pictures and interesting cinemas all along it. The actors were on the back of their characters in an almost perfect time and looked great. The music was lush and well thought out. He even had a decent twist of an end. So, what's with everyone who votes? The story was not completely fresh (felt like a "Running Man" remnant with the whole idea of ​​television), but the attitude towards Christianity and Judaism about the way the audience chooses the Messiah was certainly true. It made sense to follow this man who was put in front of a modern crowd and put him on a pedestal because of his opportunity. It is possible for Christians or other religious people to take this because the movie has the word "God," but that shows what the filmmakers were trying to do is to learn a possibility for people who probably never saw the world like this, especially in the modern world , where Christianity has been increasingly accepted and forgotten by some. I gave a 7/10 star here on IMDb. I thought every single ounce of the movie was fun and original for the most part. Check out if you are not too offended to see a fun movie in Madrid, Spain, about the possibilities of the future Messiah to come to a television near you.
