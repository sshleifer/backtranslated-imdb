It's not robbing journalists Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell from "The Girl Friday" or cunning detective William Powell and Mrs. Myrna Loy from Thin Man, but Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson are surprisingly charming as Sleop amateurs. Their screwdriving is more postmodern than post-Depression, Allen's writing filled with ironic self-deprecation and vehement fury of New York. The shadows of the old sentiment appear seldom, such as when he, like Sid, the magician Splendini, responds to his background: "I was born in Hebrew belief, but when I grew up I converted to narcissism." Johansson, fresh from the Allen match as a bad girl, becomes a relatively good student, sometimes full of journalism, trapped in a murderous murder mystery for London: a serial killer. The plot is a recap of its recent thriller from London, Match Point, to the upper class sins and "American tragedy" / place in the "sunrise" accident. In fact, Allen reorganizes the Murder Manhattan Murder and Rose Rose in Cairo to name just a few examples. I do not care if he works again; I would like the new material to be at least equal to the originals and, unfortunately, is just a reflection of its younger majesty. Allen as a director and actor can not hide her love for the actress, as she could not for Diane Keaton, and therefore takes a comedy in the middle of a suitable canon in Allen's canon, not great but funny, sometimes satirical, Extremely satirical: About Sid (Allen) suspected criminal, "I would be very surprised if he killed one person." This is allen's time humor. While there are no glamorous literary allegations like most of his film, he scoops Scoop with music from Grieg, Ceaikovski and Strauss to tell us that Woodman has not lost his class.
