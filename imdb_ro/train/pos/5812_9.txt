Moonwalker is probably not the movie to watch if you're not a Michael Jackson fan. I'm a big fan and I enjoyed most of the movie, the end was not fantastic, but the first 50 minutes were - if you're a fan. I personally think the first 50 minutes are re-watchable many times over. Dance in every video clip is amazing, fantastic music to listen to and fun dialogue. It includes many of the best videos from Bad and fragments from previous videos. It also includes some live concert recordings. If you're a big fan of Michael Jackson, if you're not a fan / do not like Michael Jackson, you're good. <br /> <br /> 9/10
