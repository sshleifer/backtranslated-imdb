Matador is a humorous and dark melodrama that rises far above mediocrity due to two very engaged and serious performances by Pierce Brosnan, who has never been better than here, and Greg Kinnear playing Jack Nicholson's homosexual neighbor in As Good as it gets. A big plus goes to writing. Intelligent dialogue and sometimes very ugly is delivered with the taste of Brosnan and slow building friendship between these two different people is completely convincing all the way. The story has some unexpected turns and keeps the viewer constantly guessing where to go. The artist's beautiful artistic facilities, such as good music usage, smart publishing and somewhat unorthodox cinema, have sometimes set a beautiful tone for the film and for a long time you do not know how to label the movie. But that's also because of a very well-written script that keeps the viewer (anyway) on the edge of the chair.
