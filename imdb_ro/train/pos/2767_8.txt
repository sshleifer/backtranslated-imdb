Gregory Peck offers brilliant performance in this movie. The last 15 minutes (or there) are wonderful, and Peck is an absolute joy to look at. The same can not be said for the rest of the film. It's not terrible, and I'm sure it was done with good intentions, but the only real reason (if I'm honest) to see him is Peck. For the rest, it is better to read the Old Testament.
