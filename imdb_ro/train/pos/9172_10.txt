I studied Charlotte Bronte's novel in high school and gave me an amazing impression. Here was a beautiful novel about a young woman's struggle to find love and acceptance in the dark times of Victorian England. This young woman was Jane Eyre, a poor and simple character with a strong mind and his own will. Her story, which Bronte spoke to through Jane's eyes, was both sad and inspirational. <br /> <br /> In our study, I watched the adaptation of the 1983 story and let me go. The mini-series not only made the effort to stay true to Bronte's original text and the essence of the story, but the actors who portrayed the characters were just great. Both Zela Clarke (Jane Eyre) and Timothy Dalton (Jane's boyfriend, Rochester) captured the essence of their characters. I can not imagine anyone else in their roles. (Other versions of Rochester in other versions, such as the 2006 version, do not have the passion, energy and tenderness to accurately describe Rochester, saying that Timothy Dalton is on top because he has all of these features in his portrait from Rochester Clarke does not just look like Jane Eyre, but captures her brilliant nature, but firm and passionate, keeps her emotions, like Jane's book, at the right moments of the story, but allows her fire to come out in Jane's passions. which Clarke and Dalton interpret in their scenes are also credible and fair about Jane's and Rochester's devoted relationship.) Supporting actors also fit perfectly with their roles, and the sets match the gothic nature of the story. <br /> <br /> We strongly recommend this version of the classic Bronte story. If you have not read the book before, you can watch this production as a true introduction to this beautiful story.
