This movie has some of the greatest comedy and memorable quotes ever assembled in a single movie! The land is somewhat lacking, but charming chips are enough to make the difference. This is an uninterrupted movie for all ages, which is sure you like it. As a form of cinematic art is very fun; and with important stars such as Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas ... how could you go wrong? <br /> <br /> The comedy dialogue and time as it has long been underestimated and is very difficult to imitate. A good example of this is seen in the 1986 knock-off of this film: The Money Pit, with Tom Hanks and Shelley Long. Despite the talent and physical comedy of these stars, the film has fired and received poor reviews and comments from viewers. Achieving true comic dialogue is an art.
