This is quite a pleasant surprise. The cute story of heroin quest, a very surprising metamorphosis of the four-eye eyewash to be spinster in a female DD-cup queen. <br /> <br /> Visual view of inflamed eyes, not just for two quite amazing actresses, but also for (the majority of) the costumes and makeup of the actors. A little useless of cheapness came in immense imitation of the castle. Back to Positions: The film is spiced with some unusually precise camera shots that you would not expect in a soft core. I liked that scene with the ice, an absolutely classical potential. A slight minus only for (very) few strange scenarios, in which poor action by minor casts suspended suspension of mistrust. <br /> <br /> 9/10 including additional credit for the serious salivary effect.
