This video is so funny, it does everything else Eddie Murphy seems very disappointing (even Beverly Hills Cop and The Nutty Professor, just going to show you how good it really is). To be honest, I do not think I ever laughed at anything as much as this, including Naked Gun and Bargearse rarely seen. This show is amazing, although it has to be said that it is certainly filled with the word starting with F, which is four letter long (plus the extended version starting with M), but do not bother me. See it, the funniest thing I've ever seen and perhaps the most funny you've ever had.
