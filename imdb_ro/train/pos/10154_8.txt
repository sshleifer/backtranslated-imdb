This is Michael Vartan's first movie I saw - I did not see Alias ​​- and I was curious to see if the guy could act. She is sure she can and is nice in this movie. Natasha Henstridge is of course gorgeous, but she is usually in more physical and action roles, so I found her very good and loving in this different "sweet" role of a teacher. Some of the negative comments I've read are true, the movie is full of clichés and the story does not sound at all true. Also, even if every character in the movie notices how well they look together, I do not think there's a chemistry screen out there. However, I enjoyed this film. The places are nice, the characters are nice and beautiful, and the actors that support them are pretty good. If you expect to see a great love story, it's not that. But if you want to see a nice, innocent movie with a heart-full character, it's really good.
