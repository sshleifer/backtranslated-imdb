This is the best version (so far) that you will see even the most true work of Bronte. Dalton is a bit hard to imagine as Rochester, which Jane Eyre said "not nice". But his act goes beyond that, and Zelah Clark, as it is, is also a Jane Eyre complete and credible. This production is a long, but worthwhile watch. Almost the direct quotes in the book are in the script, and if you want the first "literal" literal letter, that's how you see it. I own each copy of this movie and read and re-read the original. The movie may look a little dated, but it will never be that.
