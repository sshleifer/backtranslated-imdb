I thought this movie was really good because in the cinemas in India all you see is skin, music and bad action ... in this movie you can see a certain tradition, ethnicity and at least good decency ... although some parts were a bit dramatic, guess what? that's what Indian cinema means! after watching this movie, at least you do not get headaches from all the overwhelmed music or violence, it's the truth, it teaches love and, of course, it cares for the person you love throughout your life ... I think it was a movie amazing ... Children can undoubtedly follow it, and adults will enjoy the simplicity that was deeply profound of India ... until all these rap, miniskirts, and skin hits will become part of it.
