I've seen a lot of science fiction from the 70s; some terribly bad, and others thought they were provocative and truly terrifying. Soylent Green falls into the last category. Yes, sometimes it's a bit camouflaged, and yes, the furniture is good for a chicot or two, but some of the movie looks terribly prescient. Here we have a movie, 9 years before Blade Runner, who dares to imagine the future as dark, frightening and nihilistic. Both Charlton Heston and Edward G. Robinson are much better than the Ten Commandments, and Robinson's assisted suicide scene is predicted by Kevorkian and him. Some of the attitudes are dated (can you imagine a director who moves away from the concept of "women as furniture" in the 1990s?) But it's rare to find a movie in my Decade that you can actually think about. This is one that I would like to see on the big screen, because even in a wide-screen presentation I do not think the coverage of this film will be due. Check it out.
