From what the critics and the audience pointed out, GIRL COMPANY must be a big clinker of fat. Still, because I love Nicole Kidman, I decided to rent her last night. It turned out to be worthy to be watched. Sure, it's not the basic American comedy, and there's no need for a genius to realize it's a very British film, but that's why I liked it. There was a change from all the other movies around, a fresh breath of air. Sure, there were some plot holes, but it generally worked. First of all, Kidman was fabulous again in a very different role, not very glamorous, yet quite sexy. He continues to prove he is one of the top talents in Hollywood. Not only is her Russian accent when she speaks English effectively, but there are times when she has long talks in Russian and if you do not know she is Nicole Kidman, you would never have asked her authenticity. Harrison Ford should have taken note of "K-19". Generally, a small movie that works despite the horrible lips.
