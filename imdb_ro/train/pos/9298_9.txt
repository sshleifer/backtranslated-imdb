Simply, one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It is a parody of the life of crime, a parody of everything that represents the 1930s Chicago. - There is no real need to underestimate this film because the rating is under 5. It is an opinion about a meal and the table is hypnotized. Whoever decides to look at him - regrets, Who decides not to look at him - will regret more.
