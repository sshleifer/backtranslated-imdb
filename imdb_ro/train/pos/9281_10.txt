I do not know how and where Iranian directors inspire to come up with such a plot. In fact, it's a very simple plot that many directors might come up with - but maybe I can not design it on a movie like Jafar Panahi. The film is like two worlds spinning at the same time, one connected to the other - the football match and the sex fight that happens behind the walls of the stadium. It makes you feel as if you were in the movie and you "one of the characters, and while watching the movie, as if you would like to see a football match. You will feel exactly the same enthusiasm and feelings as those the female actors in the movie. It starts in the way that you wanted to see the end, you will want to find the verdict, you will die to see what will happen to the girls, I like the intermittent conversations between the smoker and one of the military trainees. It is like Mars Venus VS, it really shows the difference in the thinking of men and women and the fight of women to get equal rights and opportunities, especially in a very patriarchal society such as Iran. This is Jafar Panahi's second film on (first being Crimson Gold) and I look forward to looking at something more. I've already linked to Iranian movies and this is a must-see!
