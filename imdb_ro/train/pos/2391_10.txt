My husband and I love DoodleBops as much as our 8 month old baby. I bought DVDs and CDs so we can watch and listen to them. They are fun, energetic and very entertaining. They encourage children to be active, divided and cared for. They always have a positive message along with fun entertainment. Every time our son hears the theme song, he turns his head quickly to the TV and starts to go up and down in excitement. Dee Dee is a wonderful singer, has a great voice. Moe is a great dancer. I would recommend DoodleBops to anyone with children. Our favorite song is The Bird Song. You just can not smile and you want to dance when you hear it.
