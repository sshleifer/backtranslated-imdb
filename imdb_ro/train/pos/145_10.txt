The pursuit of "kingdom" is bloodier and even more twisted. I only saw half (I was exhausted and I could not stay up to 5 1/2 hours), but I liked what I saw. Ghosts, blood, murder, poisoning, moving children, voodoo ... that's it! If you have a strong stomach and strange movies like this is for you <br /> <br /> You also do not have to see part 1 to understand this ... you will figure it out! <Br /> <br /> Does anyone know if Kingdom 1 and 2 are available on DVD? Staying in these marathon movies in a theater is tiring. Unfortunately, it probably will not be a "Kingdom 3" - Ernst-Hugo Jaregard (Sig) died a year after filming. But you never know!
