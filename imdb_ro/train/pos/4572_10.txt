Like someone who has lived with cerebral palsey for over forty years, it seems to me that this film is inspired. If someone with such a severe case of CP, like Christie Brown, can do so much, then there is no reason not to be able to make my own dreams. Daniel Day-Lewis and Brenda Fricker offer great performances. <br /> <br />
