Nicolas Mallet is a failure. A nudge in a bank, everyone was walking over it. Then his friend, a book writer books nobody likes, has a plan to change his life. Our hero tells his boss to give up. He intends to spend the rest of his life making a lot of money and sleeping with many women. And he manages to do just that. If it were not the amount of death (crime / suicide / natural causes) in the film, it would be a hoax. There are many stories about marriage, politics, journalism and ... life. Jean-Louis Trintignant is an unpleasant amateur. Romy Schneider is the most appealing. Definitely worth a look.
