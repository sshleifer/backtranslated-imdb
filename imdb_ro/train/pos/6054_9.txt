I saw a preview of Freebird at Man TT as we heard about it in some motorcycles. Although I have done mostly for racing, the courtesy of seeing Phil Daniels in a motorcycle movie (yes, I love Quadrophenia like everyone else) has proven enough to get away from beer and parties. Finally! I did it! we British have actually made a wonderful motorcycle movie (and it's not about Torque), it's there with the best British comedies. Mark my words, this is the best interpretation of Phil Daniels screen, and as far as Geoff Bell is concerned, there is a new British legend that makes him feel his name. I love Gary Stretch in Shane Meadows' fantastic Dead Mans Shoes and here gives him a quiet interpretation that he can proudly bring with his growing reputation for reputation. This is a movie not just for us Bikers, but I think for everyone (even my girlfriend loved it). I hope he will receive the same shining response on the continent, as he reached the Isle of Man. I will not go into the details of some of the classic scenes that this movie has (watch at the store) because it would destroy the fun, but I would say, go see, enjoy and have one of the best nights in the cinema that you've had it for a while. I really think it could be a classic cult. As they said at TT ... C'mon Freebird!
