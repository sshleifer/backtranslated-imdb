Yeah, a horror thriller ... ... with Shelley and Debbie! Hi. This is a funny and full of fun and a part of the Guignol cycle of the 1960s that escaped in the 1970s. Launched as a double feature with FUTZZ's comedy by Burt Reynolds, this crazy fright is so gentle that it's really fun. Like a mix of DAY OF THE LOCUST, THE OTHER, and BABY JANE, I suggest a future spectator to understand the idea that this is almost meant to be tilted and stay with someone with whom you can scream and give it all through it. In fact, drink while watching him ... ... on cheap champagne. Again, with 30-year film ideas, they are also about delusion; fighting the time for a better tiring life and twisted by the emotional madness that fits into the crime. But this is simply crazy. I also reminded a lot of De Niro's BLOODY MAMA - Winters shlock fest that makes this movie look gloriously positive.
