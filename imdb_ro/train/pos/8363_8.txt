This is one of the best movies Edgar Wallace of the German series - it provides all the basics for a very pleasant film of Wallace murder back in the 1960s: Although its majesty, Mr. Kinski, is missing, you still have young Joachim 'Blacky "Fuchsberger, playing once again as a typically" feminine "typically smart, has the young Eddi Arendt in the best (and as typical) role as ever - the British cool sophisticated driver - and you (not too young man) Lowitz as a melancholic analyst, but very "dry", ironic (and therefore extremely fun) police. Moreover, you will have a bad and bad guy behind a frog mask here's the title of the movie!), You get a scary soundtrack, classic b-movie action scenes, partially filmed the wildest perspectives (please remember home time!), screaming queens, and over and over ... All these ingredients shake well in a sweet tasting cocktail of pure German campaign Edgar Wallace - highly recommended!
