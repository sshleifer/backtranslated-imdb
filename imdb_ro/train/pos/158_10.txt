I have seen this movie several times and there is always someone complaining about the "obvious construction" of the land afterwards. But then - it's part of Petzold's play: it's playing along with the rules of the genre. It's very nice that the extremely unlikely story of how the two girls meet (Timoteo / Hummer) is again mirrored in another story, and less likely, that girls compensate for a casting. This movie is a journey between facts and fiction, it is more about potentials, things that could have happened in the past or could happen in the future, rather than real things. It is a kind of reverie - quite apt, there are many reasons, Freud might have been interested in the analysis of his dreams, like all the "doppelganger" conspiracies. <br /> <br /> I also think that "Gespenster" might be interesting to look at in comparison with the current Asian cinema of amazing art: Petzold's daily urban architecture also feels uncharted in an unusual manner , weird. This movie is not obvious. To describe it as the story of two girls who meet and eventually become friends and lovers, or as the story of an orphan mother who seeks Europe for her lost daughter, clearly does not say much about the nature of "Gespenster" .
