I really like this movie, I saw it again last week after 3 years or so. This movie is perfect, a great acting, a wonderful story, an excellent direction / a room / music work. It's a gift to show him someone you love. too bad jaco van dormael did not make more movies after that. Top 5 papers. Really! <br /> <br /> Today is 3 years and 3 days later, then the comment above. has never been posted because it was not more than 10 lines. Anyway, I saw yesterday "le huitieme jour". This is undoubtedly in my top movie 3. along with "Cinema Paradiso", which is also a masterpiece. The soundtrack is also very good. I am very curious about the new movie "jaco von dormael". I hope it will complete the top 3 movie. If you see this movie, rent it. Or even better. buy it. Because you will want to see it again.
