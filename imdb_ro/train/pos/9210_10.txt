I think this is one of the best movies I've ever seen, I'm an older man and I love the most famous. I like the movies in part, at least on the facts, If I'm not mistaken, it's such a movie. I also like revenge movies, This is what I qualify there and in my opinion. Some of my favorite pieces of the movie were the opening scene with the whip and shooting scene of the barn. I felt the coral scene was a bit overwhelmed, but it did not affect how I feel about the full movie. I've seen what I think is a sequel to this movie in a smoking episode. I also liked that. We recommend giving you time to watch this movie, I will track it again. I also felt that the love parts of this movie were well played. I thought it was so inappropriate for Randy Travis to play a bastard, but I always enjoy his acting.
