I saw this as a child in the late eighties and I must say that Galaxy Express is one of those films that stick to your imagination for a long time. If you have never understood anime appeal, discovering this movie could be a golden ticket to Otaku. The story is as delicate and poetic as Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. Cell animation, though somewhat traditional, has a living style that exploits explosively Leiji Matsumoto's talent for character design and visual stories. This is one of the children's unique movies, such as Star Wars, The Dark Crystal and The Wizard of Oz, which completely transcends the status of "family entertainment" and is a classic of cinema in its terms. We highly recommend this movie.
