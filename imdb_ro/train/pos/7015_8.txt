Ben Thomas (Smith) plays an IRS agent who basically offers the store to surprise everyone. What kind of IRS agent is this? Most of us have heard all the line by an IRS agent, "Hello, I'm from the IRS. I'm here to help you." Our smile is spreading into a chic that says, "Yes, good." As you get further and further into this story, you can not imagine this guy. He goes easy on those who are audited. What is his reason? Is it from another planet, an angel, a rich guy who wants to do good? He helps so much that he wants us to be our auditor if we are going to be audited, of course. Hey, IRS, listen? (jokes, just joking) The pace of the movie is perfect and so much that the clues have been ignored that would have told me what really happened. Intense, he repeated, focused on Ben and stayed there. The whole movie works only because of Ben when we try to get him out and I have not seen any clue (what are the clues, Willis?). Not reading the tape before watching DVD was the best way to go here. By the end of the movie I finally put it together. Well, it was obvious until then. And, yes, it's upside down, but it's still a great story, especially because of Will Smith. <br /> <br /> Will Smith should have been nominated for Best Actor Award. The rest of the song was very good. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's over the top and in spite of excellent acting and when you finally get all the answers, you have to realize that the message of the movie is wrong. What is the message? Believe me, you will not need too many clues to figure out. I did not. <br /> <br /> Violence: No. Gender: Yes, but there is nothing to be excited about. Gentle. Nudity: No. Language: No.
