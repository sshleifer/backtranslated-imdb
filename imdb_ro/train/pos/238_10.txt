I can only imagine a better movie than this one. Hey, before you all go "Chick Flick" on me. I'm a very strong and masculine man, Macho, who thinks this was one of the best movies in the last 20 years. <br /> <br /> The actor was great and the story was great. This is a wonderful medicine for heart and soul. The action could not have been better, nor could the film have been better distributed. <br /> <br /> I met her for a moment when Mercedes Ruehl and Holly Hunter, Joan Plowright, Dame Edith Evans, Sissy Spacek, Judi Dench are among the greatest actresses ever to appear on the film. And, of course, Cloris Leachman (and in this film), in my opinion, may in fact overcome everyone in her talent and the various roles she has emerged over the years. In any case, this was an amazing interpretation. This movie was like a book you can not leave, and when you get to the last page you want more ... more. I can not for my life understand why this movie here on IMDb only a rate of 3.9 <br /> <br /> This rating here is absolutely amazing for me. Or maybe not. Maybe I really understand very well, and that makes me very sad. It makes me so sad that films such as "American Beauty," "Las Vegas," the ratings "Sexy Beast" and "Fight Club" have risen from popularity when, in fact, at least in the opinion of the spectators had to receive an "R" rating ... R is for "Waste". Okay, I realize there are many different stories in this world for a lot of different audiences, but it's a sad comment when this wonderful, powerful ... extraordinary movie, directed, acted, and written seems to look. <br /> <br /> It is obviously also at the Academy Awards .... How tricky. And how predictable. My synthesis is that if you want to see a strong, happy, sad and beautiful story? watch this movie, preferably ...
