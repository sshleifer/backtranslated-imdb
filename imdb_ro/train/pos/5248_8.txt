Well, like many other movies, they were born out of an SNL sketch. But Tim Meadows does a pretty fantastic job of making a unique dimensional character of 3 minutes in a moderate comedic character. He consistently retires from the one-line threat, Billy Dee Williams is in it, although Lando's days have faded away and everything is shot pretty well. True, it's not a great art, but if you went into Wayne's world looking for Gone With The Wind, you did something wrong. Pleasant for what it is .......
