I have never seen such an incredible movie actor activity as I did when I saw Daniel Day-Lewis playing Christy Brown on my left foot. In fact, outside the scene, his role has never ended. He played Christy Brown or at least he was disabled like him by filming the film and needed surgery because of the damage he had done in the back. For me, which is remarkable and with all the pain she has put to act in that role, I think it is quite true to say that it has put the best Oscar performance in history. He was so great in this difficult part that I think nobody could have done it better or with more impact than he did. Although I can not say that it is the greatest film of all time, I can say that how it played this impossible role and then continued to act until it did not even act is undoubtedly the biggest leg on I've ever seen an actor do. Probably a man for that.
