I had no place to go. I was on a flight to Vancouver. I would have missed this movie if I had not chosen Air Canada. Viewed on a small screen behind the front seat, I found this fascinating and fascinating. I did a few places and I had to jump back, but I had to look at the end. Now I am looking forward to the launch of the DVD in Europe, though if I will be as transfixed when I can get out of the door, it is still to be discovered! The photographic composition is amazing and the film offers so much understanding and "fills" the story the photos are saying. Recommended (if you have time in your hands).
