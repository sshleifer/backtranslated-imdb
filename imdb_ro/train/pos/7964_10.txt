I'm surprised how much I like this movie, despite the fact I do not like dogs. Fox, Field and Ameche are doing a great job with Chance, Sassy and Shadow, and the action by the animals themselves is really amazing. I've seen this movie 72 times already (I know that sounds scary, but it's true!), And every time the scenes finally arrive. I strongly recommend it to people of all ages and especially to animal lovers. It's really my favorite movie over time!
