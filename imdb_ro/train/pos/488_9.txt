Part of the pleasure we got from this film was the fact that I knew nothing more than playing John Turturro and Emily Watson (two good reasons to watch) was a part of the era and involved chess. Everything that evolved before me was completely unexpected. That's why I will not give too much. Suffice it to say that Turturro is awesome as an eccentric, obsessive and profoundly vulnerable chess genius, and Em fits with him for the step as a strong woman who is attracted to him. It's about love and obsession, rather than the game of awe-on-board, and after it gradually pulls me in the first half-hour, it has become quite convincing. And I advise anyone to guess at the end.
