I saw this movie at the Santa Barbara Film Festival and there was no dry eye in the house. It is incredible to see not only what a great person is Darius, but how admirable the rest of the team is and at such a young age. They also made me think how disgusting MTV was and how they showed an opportunity to get involved and inspire in a positive way, they refused. He shows you whether he cares about young people and their viewers at all. It's a wonderful and delightful story of the heart ... take the tissues, but it's great to see how young and inspiring young people today can be.
