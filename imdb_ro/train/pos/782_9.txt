This is a very moving picture about the best friends with at least forty friends in a small town in England. Someone finds a passionate love and a new start with a smaller piano instructor, when the strokes of tragedy and hearts are changed forever. Definitely a movie to have a box of tissues with you! A powerful piece of work. This is definitely one of my favorite movies of all time. SPOILER !!! SPOILER VERIFICATION !! SPOILER! * <br /> <br /> The main character is taken by his young piano instructor, beautiful and passionate love flowers. The two jealous "friends" play an immortal joke that quickly leads to tragedy. He loses his love and friends in one shot. Eventually an unexpected surprise pulls them together (in my opinion, her forgiveness is not justified)
