If any show of the last ten years deserves a 10th, this precious stone is rare. It allows us to escape back to a time when things were simpler and more fun. Full of heart and laugh, this show makes you laugh through the three decades of difference. The furniture was ugly, the clothes were colored, and the drugs were even tolerated. The hair was percussion, the music was accompanied by roller-skate and, in Merle Haggard's words, "a commune was a bad place to be." Take a long journey back in the history of America. He falls in love with the characters and the good essence of the small town where people were better. This classic is on TV as much as the "Full House". Do not miss yourself and always remember to "shake your stuff!"
