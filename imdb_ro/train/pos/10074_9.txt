quoted by Nicolas Martin (nicmart) in Houston, TX: "The film well, but DVD" reformatted for television ", April 8, 2002 - This is a charming and emotional film, on the other hand the DVD that I bought has been "reformatted fit with the TV" by Columbia Tristar garbage. There is no excuse for not offering the film in the widespread format, except that Hollywood treats all the films, such as disposable garbage that is so common to produce. <br /> <br /> What a pity (criminal!) is really a shame, but there is another version.
