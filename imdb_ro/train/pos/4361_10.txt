This was probably one of the best-made films of the 1940s - Warner Bros. at the height of their style. Sol Polito's photo is undoubtedly his best achievement - superb compositions and delicate shadow enlightenment. Max Steiner contributes with one of his most complex and beautiful scores - the example of his classical motivational method. Music adds emotion and enthusiasm to the plot and is refined and memorable. It is interesting to note that the same production team that made this film went right to make "Voyager" later that year - a wonderful movie that won honors and awards and descended as a favorite favorite because it starring as Bette Davis. In my opinion, "The Gay Sisters" is a much better film - better done in all departments, and more exciting, complex and enjoyable. An unusual film that worries those who take it for what it is rather than to design their own creative creative sensitivity or the advanced and demanding standards of hyper-critical perfection. Everything must be judged in its own time reference and for what it is trying to accomplish in its own terms. Most of the complaints I've read in these reviews are so childish and totally lacking. If you are hungry for a perfect mignon fillet, do not go to the bakery counter and start to weep and complain about the fluffy pastry. The art of film criticism is truly lost on a large segment of the population. We're sorry about people - maybe if this movie had a score from Rolling Stones and a hundred complicated search subpopulations and souls, you'd be all happy. I'll take an old movie without modern intellectual pretensions on a day of the week!
