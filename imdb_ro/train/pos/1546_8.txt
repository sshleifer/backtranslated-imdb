I saw this movie once in or close to its release year 36 years ago (1969). Although I can only remember bits now, I want to see it again. The parts I rightly remember or cheat include mustard gas in trenches and Suzie Kendall as a German spy, offering some kind of sexual favors behind a closed truck to get military information from him. The music score was particularly memorable and excited by the Gone With The Wind and I would love to hear it again. There must be a commercial or copyright reason for which this movie is not available. Anyone know why? I doubt it has to do with lack of quality or interest.
