This movie is definitely on the list of the top 10 favorites. Voices for animals are wonderful. Sally Field and Michael J. Fox are both brilliant as the sassy felines and the inexperienced young pooch, but the true standout is Don Ameche as an old, faithful gold retriever. This movie is a great family movie because it can be appreciated and loved by both children and adults. Humor and suspense, and guaranteed to make every loved animal cry! (tears of happiness!)
