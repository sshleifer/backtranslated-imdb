One of the most disturbing and tragic periods in American history has begun. Members of the Summer of Love culture at the end of the seventies and early 80s were ultimately old instruments for love beads and night parties and evolved back into mainstream life, no matter what that meant. For those who could not develop their youthful and sometimes irrational exuberance, their culture was Wonderland culture. A love for drugs and a sense of rights associated with a lack of authority, values ​​and "institution" is the world that the film captures. <br /> <br /> The Sixties were a moment of revolution and violent change that destroyed the American House. Once the battles are over, we all have to deal with the consequences of the massacre. Characters in the wondrous house are icons of the helpless in the seventies; biker part, hippie party, parish, all outside. No ideology to express, just a feeling of dissatisfaction with everything and loyalty to nothing. Ron, Billy and David feel like Drug Robin bags. They speak of love and behave violently; they take of the rich and sell to the afflicted; they steal from everybody. Holmes and the company are the result of a strange encounter of anti-matter such as sex, drugs and rock & roll when lab technicians get bored and moving. <br /> <br /> The film is skillfully guided and paced and captures the frenetic world of drug drugs in their element. The fact that Holmes is a porn star is almost irrelevant. This story was told in Boogie Nights. This is a story of a transient and forgotten era.
