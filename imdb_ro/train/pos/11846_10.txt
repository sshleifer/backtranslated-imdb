I really enjoyed this movie. Animation was well done and romance was nice. I liked most of Bryan Adams's songs, and the Hans Zimmer score was great. What a lot of people do not realize is how well they relate to the theme of Heart of Darkness / Apocalypse Now (what happens when the so-called "civilization" invades someone elles at home, what it means to be "civilized "etc.). The opening landscape and music were very agitated. The film is a lament in America that once was beautiful.
