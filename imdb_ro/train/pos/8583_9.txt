The Korean War was called the Forgotten War of America. There were so many unanswered questions buried along with the 50,000 people who died there. Occasionally, we are treated in a piece or film that deals with the ghostly, frozen cemetery. This is probably one of the best. It's called "Sergeant Ryker". The story is about an American soldier called Sgt. Paul Ryker (Lee Marvin), who is selected for a top secret mission by his commanding officer. His task is to defeat the North Koreans and to offer their services against the United Nations forces. So successful is his coverage, he proves to be invaluable for the enemy and has given the rank of major. However, he is then captured by the Americans, judged as a traitor and spy. Stating that he had been ordered to fail, he learned sadly that his commanding officer had been killed and had no evidence or proof of his innocence. He is condemned and condemned to stand. However, his belief is questioned by Capt. Young (Bradford Dillman), his prosecutor. Convincing commander General Amos Baily (Lloyd Nolan) of his doubts, he is given a new trial and, if found guilty, will be executed. Drama in the meeting room is of prime importance, as is the distribution that includes Peter Graves, Murray Hamilton, and Norman Fell as Sgt. Max Winkler. Korea was a far-off place, but the possibility of condemning a Communist and hanging it hit very close to home in the 1950s. Due to his superior scripture and strong message, this drama has become a classical meeting room. Excellent viewing and recommended for everyone. ****
