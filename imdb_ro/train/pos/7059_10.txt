I was shocked and surprised by the negative comments I saw on the web, I thought Cinderella 2 (and 3) is a very nice and funny continuation for everyone - children and adults ... like me, I am 22 years old. <br /> <br /> I also find her a very informative film, showing lessons about being true to you and your heart. I thought he had a great animation and the voice distribution was very good; plays by Brooke Allison. Because this movie was divided into three flashbacks / stories, my favorite of the three, is the story when the Jaq mouse, became a man for a day, thanks to Fairy Godmother and her magic.
