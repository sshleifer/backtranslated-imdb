This movie has been on my wishlist for ten years and I recently found it on DVD when my partner's nephew was given. He followed and was delighted to learn that it was my generation - born in 1930 and evacuated in 1939 - and that she wanted to find out more about her - and me. Luckily I borrowed it from him and I looked at her alone and wept through it. Not only did it capture the emotions, the class distinction, the weights and warmth of the human relationships of those years (as well as the cruelty (spoken and unspoken), but it was exactly! ARP uniforms, ambulances (LCCs) in the right color (white) the impediment of managing bomb sites and the activity of heavy rescue brigades I could not bear from my memories Anderson and the WVS canteens brought it back The difference between the relatively unaltered life in the village and the war torn by London was also suddenly presented, I re-lived 1939/40 and my own evacuation from London with this production! Gold's activity, of course, and did not expect more than this meticulous detail, but far exceeded the exact representation of the facts and he reached profound chords about human responses and the only half-valued judgments of those years, inevitably argued, one of the most important places of which it was John Thaw's and Gold's direction and deserves to be better known. It's a great movie and I've already ordered some copies to send them to friends.
