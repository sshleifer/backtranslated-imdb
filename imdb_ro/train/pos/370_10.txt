I've seen this movie at least fifty times, and after watching it for the first time in a long time last week, I've still gotten it. The story itself was incredible, but it came to life through Spielberg's and fabulous expertise, including Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover and Margaret Avery. Akosua Busia deserved an Oscar nomination for Nettie's short but powerful portrait. You will experience every human emotion while watching this movie. I laughed, I cried, and I was upset. Like the best movies, she was seen by the Academy with a series of nominations, but without wins. But this film, undoubtedly, is definitely one of the best movies of all time.
