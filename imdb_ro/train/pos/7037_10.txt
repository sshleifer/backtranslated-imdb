This is a shining political satire. No wonder why it was largely ignored in the US: it expose our criminal foreign policy to what it really is. Another good film of this era, Rendition, was also totally rejected simply because it showed accurately that the US is a war machine tilted to torture, kill and kill civilians in search of total world domination. A smart plot, good action, some great stars (John Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei someone?) And some hilarious scenes should have made this movie a hit. Unfortunately, Americans do not like to hear the truth about themselves, especially when they are accomplices in mass murder.
