The coming of age movies is quite common these days. For the 1980s, "Foxes" really gives meaning. Jodie Foster plays her character directly. Since she did "Taxi Driver" four years earlier, she has a stronger character in this movie. She is Jeanie, a tall school that has plenty of courage and seems to escape any situation she's in. Scott Baio plays Brad in front of Chachi in Happy Days. He is considered immature by the other girls. Cherie Currie is Annie, hanging out of the wrong crowd, watched by her cop father. Jeanie and the other three friends decide to live in the wild until they move to a rented house where a party is entirely out of hand. Exploring life on the other side of the pieces can be fun or dangerous. Annie is saved by Jeanie and Brad every time she's lost. Reality is hard to come back to when killed in a car accident. And one marries a much older man. Growth is not easy, sometimes we have to explore life as it is. In reality, you have to be careful with the people around you. For me, I was my own person and I tend to stay that way! Great music, wonderful plot, this movie is a jewel! 4 out of 5 stars!
