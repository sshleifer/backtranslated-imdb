It's remarkable due to its notorious scenes, when the gorgeous Maruschka Detmers takes the young man's penis from his pants and mouth. Even without this moment, the movie is a splendid walk, if it is slightly disturbing, passionate and sexy. Detmers brings extraordinary performance to the delight that is partially upset, unsavory, wandering with her flat nude. Dressed, partially dressed and naked, she stole most of the film about love, sexual passion, philosophy and politics. For me, the last two are a little lost and the ending is the most confusing when her fiance is released while fellow terrorists are released, she seems unsafe as to who she wants and the young lover seems more interested in exams than anything else when crying , beautiful of course!
