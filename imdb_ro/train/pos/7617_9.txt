A very addictive series. I have not seen an exact combination between drama, action, suspense, and Sci-fi ever. I'm impressed in every chapter. The script is very smart, I do not know how the creators invoke all these amazing stories, each character has a strange past, problems, stormy relationships, gives the expression the human sense necessary to create intimate characters. <br /> <br /> The most incredible thing is that all the characters are linked: the numbers they met before without knowing them and so on. The others, the enigmatic security system and the Darma initiative are elements that do not let us lose a chapter. <br /> <br /> JJ Abrams, what do you think you are creating this stunning story?
