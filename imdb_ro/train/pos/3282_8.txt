I do not know what this movie was, I checked it at the video store and after seeing it, I liked it. Making a few more films directed by Bernard Rose (Candyman, Immortal Beloved). Great story and characters. As a fan of Glenne Healdy, I was surprised by her British accent. The only exception to this movie was the end. However, it deserves the rent.
