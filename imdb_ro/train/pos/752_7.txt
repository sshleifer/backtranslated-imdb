Four teenage girls in a suburb of Los Angeles face many kinds of problems: parties, drugs, cops, mixed parents, older friends. Jodie Foster, a kind of pack hen's mother, tries to keep everyone together as a "family" (like the family unit she never had), and the upset about the movie is that she can not. Slowly, everyone grows and leaves. This point of precise plot, although stressed throughout, is, unfortunately, manipulated. Do we really need a long sequence, with Scott Baio crossing a car full of criminals on the skateboard? Or even a longer sequence - also with Baio - where Foster has a strange soliloquy about the "pain of illusion." Some of the dialogues, in fact, are aside, and I did not like it too much for a late edition of the movie, which goes awry from a death to a wedding. But these are strange in what is essentially a very sensitive story about the loss of a close bond. And the face of Jodie at the end speaks volumes. If the viewers get to the end, the movie has won this. Do not pile for tears or sympathy. It shows us an example of friendship and we hope to understand. *** from ****
