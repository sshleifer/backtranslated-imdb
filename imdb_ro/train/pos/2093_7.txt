This is a bit long (2 hours, 20 minutes), but it had a lot of the famous novel Pearl Buck in it. In other words, a lot of land to cover. It was the soap opera sometimes, but it had some dramatic visual moments, also limited by a locust attack at the end of the movie. It was amazing to see. Since this film is about 70 years old, the special effects team on this film has done a spectacular job. Paul Muni and Luise Rainer have been the winning actors in their day and I do not disappoint here, both of which offer strong performances. The only problem is credibility, because all Asians are played by the Caucasians, and some of them, like Walter Connolly, did not look real. I would like to see a reproach of this film with Asian actors, not for PC reasons, but just to make the story and the sound more credible.
