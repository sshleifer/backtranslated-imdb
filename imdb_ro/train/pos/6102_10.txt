I had to give this film 10 just because she did what so many movies thrown to the black audience YOU did to do. This movie was devoid of all the slogans of video slut and also jumped over gangsters, rappers and unpleasant language. It has examined several relationships between doctors, African Americans and African-American male / female relationships to a whole new and refreshing level. I was very impressed by the mixed, humorous films directed towards the light, with some pretty tough and heavy issues. The movie will let you feel happy and sad at the same time. I saw it at the Boston Film Festival. She premiered at AMC Loews Boston and I really hope this movie makes her much more public. Black people (and anyone else) LOVE a movie like this - if only the industry was SMART enough to put them there! As an extra-if a doctor, a resident, a medical student, a premedical student, married to a doctor, has a doctor in a brother, has a doctor in the family, or knows a medical doctor - and they would like this movie. It represented living and practicing in a real-life way that was highly appreciated by doctors, residents and medical students who saw the movie. Dennis Cooper finds his full home in domestic medicine - so he surely applied his / her knowledge / experience in the film and that's very obvious.
