A bizarre and brilliant combination of talents between director Robert Siodmak and Ella Raines as secretary trying to save the electric chair boss watching a mysterious "ghost" woman and Franchot Tone as a mad sculptor and murderer. There are also some fascinating little parts played by Elisha Cook Jr as a trapped slider, as well as the other characters who are part of the conspiracy. If you're accustomed to seeing Raines in healthier parts, she's allowed to go overboard here, especially in her scenes with Cook. Franchot Tone also plays someone very different, and though not a convincing part, he acts phenomenally. While the conspiracy is too controversial, the film has a real atmosphere and is very interesting.
