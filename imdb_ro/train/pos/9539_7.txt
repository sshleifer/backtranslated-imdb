For fans of Troma or the genre Cyberpunk mixed with a bit of blood then shed this movie for you! There is a good amount of blood shed within the limits of this film, too, the effects can be impressive and wonderful. The story is ridiculous and refreshing, not being chained to what we, as a public, are expecting from movies these days. Also, extraterrestrials are remarkable, and I found them cute. Overall, it's a good movie for genre fans. Also, films like Tetsuo: Iron Man and Versus are recommended for the strange approach of the Japanese movie, full of wonderful obscurity and bloodshed. Of course, seeing this movie, you should already have knowledge of the two.
