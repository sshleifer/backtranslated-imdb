At your video store, you can find this gem. The human condition in modern times LA. No exaggerated drama, just a collapse of events that could happen to any group of individuals over time. <br /> <br /> It helps you understand the joys and despair of urban life. cutting are the top class. Cinema and music are very much watching the mood and the situation. And CAST !!! <br /> <br /> Great foundry and excellent action. Nobody is out of character or not. And it's not really as much a downer as you would expect. I gave it 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it, DO!
