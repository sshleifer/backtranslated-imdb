I really enjoyed this drama from Sidney Lumet. The best word I can describe is crazy. Throw the viewer for about an hour and fifty minutes and do not let you breathe until the credits start to roll at the end. Believe me, this movie will keep you guessing the whole way. The story is very well done and almost brilliant. It's almost like a more complicated story of Tarantino. The act is all amazing from all the pipes and even from the small parts, from the excellent distribution. I also liked cinema, gave her the real feeling as if it were an independent film. Was awesome. This movie is exhilarating, exhausting and teasing. It's almost hard to look, but you'll be glad you did.
