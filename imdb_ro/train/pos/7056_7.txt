The continued popular story of Cinderella reminded me to some extent of what they did with one of Beauty & the Beast films. In principle, three stories have rolled into 1. OK, mice are adorable (I like Gus! It's so cute!), And Lucifer's wonderful (as usual). I also liked some newer characters (Pom Pom was adorable and I liked Prudence). Still, the story was somewhat limited, but still very nice. So, I vote 7/10.
