The fair story is the story of an old man who decides to visit his sick brother who lives on the state line. He decides to make the trip on the lawn mower as he can not drive, and he wants to do it alone. The film describes beautiful the journey and the lives that it touches along the way. <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth turns into a beautiful performance like other distributors, especially Sissy Spacek in a charming performance like his daughter and Harry Dean Stanton in a small but infinitely crucial role. > <br /> <br /> At first I felt like a story about an old trip on the side of the country would be boring, but soon I discovered that Lynch with all the intuitions in human life makes this movie that I would recommend to anyone.
