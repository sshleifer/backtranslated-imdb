I wonder what this show looks like in the UK and in the rest of Europe. It is the help of being an American (especially white Americans). This could be a major reason for some of the venom and vitriol expressed here on this forum. I like the show but it's with some reservations and I feel it took the easy way out of the Spoiler Spoiler: Crashing and burning everything at the end of the second season. Julie pulled the closed door in any hope of reviving the show, unless her character sits on a hay in the middle of a farm. Who knows? It was a funny, twisted and occasionally scary show.
