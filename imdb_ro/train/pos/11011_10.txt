A big money maker for RKO Radio, Bombardier calls Pat O'Brien and Randolph Scott as instructors at a school for bombers. O'Brien and Scott oppose teaching methods, while their students are fighting for Anne Shirley's affections. O'Brien's methods prove safe during a bomb attack on Tokyo. Scott and his crew are captured and tortured by the Japanese, but the wounded dead Scott manages to light a gas truck, offering a perfect target for fellow bombs. From a stylistic point of view, Bombardier is one of the most schizophrenic war films, with moments of subtlety (the death of trainee Eddie Albert), alternating with scenes of the absurd melodrama "Yellow Peril" (the Japanese literally slip through teeth while torturing Americans helpless). Although it can only help to seem today, Bombardier remains a fun propaganda effort (the movie is sometimes mistakenly listed as the debut of Robert Ryan, which actually appears in front of the 1940 cameras.)
