While Cinderella is not the obvious choice for a sequel that love Jaq and Gus, so I did not hesitate. The format of mice writing a Cinderella book was inspired. I like to write stories and I hope the children will be encouraged to do so. The three stories are nice and fun, though the songs were forgotten. Jaq and Gus were my favorite, but I also enjoyed seeing Lucifer, Bruno, mice chorus and all. Pom Pom was the perfect partner for Lucifer and I liked the Government. A continuation continues for a change. My Rating 8/10.
