It is easy to forget, once a later series developed the alien extrapolar plot, that "X Files" once wrote episodes such as "GenderBender" and "Fearful Symmetry," where aliens were not all men or "goose control of mind, "but it could actually surprise you. "The fearful symphony" begins with an "invisible elephant" - in fact, an elephant somehow dislocated in space and time, not a mile away from "The Walk" - and ends with a gorilla pregnancy abduction. And it's very much an episode of wonderful moments. The subplot is worthy of dignity - yes, we understand that zoos are bad, except where they are not - but the ideas inside it are fascinating, visually powerful and memorable and cover an abduction angle that is largely neglected - why * people * would be the only things that aliens are interested in? Ultimately, it was not a classic moment, but it was pleasant to watch as it lasted again, very memorable, and mainly, it's something you could not imagine many other shows.
