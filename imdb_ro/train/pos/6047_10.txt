Brilliant work of Thenail and I is that surprising that not much time left college and life could go anywhere or with all other beauty. Freebird is something for those who probably never considered higher education and just went straight to work aged 15/16. I know that some large sheets blocked the knife in the film when he came out in theaters, but I saw a house in Hailsham and everyone seemed to enjoy it. I grew up in Forest of Dean, and it took me back to my days of mushrooms and drink (I had some big pairs - hates to think what they did before - probably lead council). I have seen several times on DVD and we have already seen the film as an old partner that will remain forever as part of my collection (how I love this movie and Dambusterii - seems somehow somehow) along the second half of this film, and I think scenes of social interaction with locals are brilliant. I like the mixture of the three main characters and there really some wonderful letters here, along with some very interesting lines and I dare say a good impressive integrity. I tried to get the soundtrack, but it was not released (ashamed as a reed). Someone told me it was a stage play, not quite sure how it worked, but I'm sure it was fun. I liked the little touches / references by Shakespearian seem to appear throughout the film (and Dylan Thomas ref) and all precious stones are always small things to discover that the final scene, which gives a sign of Easyrider they The next journey begins. All in all a piece of truly unpretentious cinematography (love it!)
