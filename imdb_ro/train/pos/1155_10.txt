It's very funny. It has a large distribution that each gives great performance. Especially Sally Field and Kevin Kline. It's a well written script by Andrew Bergman (Honeymoon In Vegas). I do not like soaps, even if I never follow them. But I like this movie because it's so crazy on the wall that it's playing every stupid soap they have on TV in the day. In my opinion, it is the best film since 1991.
