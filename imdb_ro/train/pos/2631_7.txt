If King Lion is a serious story about a young lion growing up to avenge his father's death, King of the Lion 1 and a half is the total opposite, full of whim and fright. King Leo told the story of Simba, the young lion, one and a half is from Timon and Pumbaa's point of view, a less perfect duo than a mecator who went home because he could not sound tunnels without his own, and bury friends and neighbors and a warthog that has a smell problem. The film is a bit short on substance, but Disney does a good job of filling time with different sketches with Timone and Pumbaa, while "watching" the movie with us. My favorite is singing along the time that happens halfway through the movie, make sure you watch the bouncing bug! Disney has published one and a half years as "the rest of the story", though it really is not. It's just a different perspective of King Lion, without all the serious stuff that has penetrated most of the second half of classic Disney classic. Credit Nathan Lane as Timone and Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa for their voice work, without their efforts, the movie may not have worked. Sing, they have fun and make us laugh. They also give us a reason to avoid a hot tub with a warthog.
