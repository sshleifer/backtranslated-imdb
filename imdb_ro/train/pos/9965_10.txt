Perfect for families with young children who are looking for lightweight, non-violent movies and are fun for the child and funny, though completely hardworking, in adults. It's not a bad movie for a low-budget job. The children will be amazed at Santa's workshop and the "magic" that allows him to enter the houses through small baskets or houses that do not have baskets at all! The children will be delighted with Santa's success by overturning the ugly devil called Pitch (complete with classic red hat with tail and horn!). They will sympathize with the poor little girl who is the greatest desire to have a doll of love. And the poor rich boy who just wants to spend time with his absent parents. And what kid does not know anybody at school, who are like the nasty boys who are invited by Pitch to help capture Santa and ruin Christmas? Finally, everyone, including the bad guys, just gets what's worth for Christmas! The film will love the children on Santa Claus as well as the love message he brings to people around the world. /> <br />
