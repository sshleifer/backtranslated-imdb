I was a crazy kid about Michael Jackson. His music, his dance ... It was and is the greatest of all time. A few days ago a friend gave me a gift .. "Moonwalker" DVD .. I could not believe it! So I took my time and saw the movie again. After many years, he gave me back in time. I almost screamed. Not because of Michael Jackson, but from the good times I remembered backward than when I went to his concerts, enjoying music and dancing. The film gave me a different perspective than when I was a child. You can really see the parody Michael passed through his life. Thank you Michael Jackson to bring me back to those wonderful times, to your wonderful music and dance. It's a shame that people forgot you ... I did not do it because you gave me wonderful moments with your music .. All the best for you where you are ...
