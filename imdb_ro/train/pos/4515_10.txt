This movie is absolutely fantastic! If you watch it with your friends, it can be a very beautiful day ... Obviously, you must know that the movie is bad and very badly directed and acted (Tomba / Unziker what a couple), and this is probably the worst movie in the world, but you can enjoy it a lot. I saw it in 19 and it was a very pleasant evening. The best scenes are the first when the killers kill Alex and try to behave like a desperate, and the result is a comic strip scene of the first category ... And when he shows Leva (Antevleva, what a name) "Palassio di giusstissia," and then Leva's accident, which once goes on her car out of the way, and a second later, the car is completely empty! What magic!
