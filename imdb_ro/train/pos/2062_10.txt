First of all, I will be the first to recognize that the scarecrow itself is quite a bit overhead. A toned down maybe less acrobatic scarecrow would make this movie much less cheesy. But on the whole, I think it's one of the best B movies. Tiffany Shepis is absolutely wonderful, not to mention incredibly beautiful. Although this film lacks the important nude factor, there are several other movies to watch. But here, she becomes all the decision of wickedness, especially at the end, when she departs from the swallowed sword. Also, Richard Elfman does an excellent job as a sheriff and his drunk friend. Yes, it's a B movie with a low budget. But of all this I've seen is certainly one of my top preferences.
