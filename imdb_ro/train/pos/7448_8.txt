I have not laughed so much in a long time - though the movie has also sad moments, especially when it changes from hyper-amusing to honest and serious. Characters are often realistic, sometimes sapwood, but quite credible. I'm not a fan of the show Jerry Springer - I'm sorry for the participating people. This film is instead a satire, and it's great. It's a pity that all the excuses were beaten while this movie was broadcast on public television, which takes a lot of fun. I'll start renting this movie to fully enjoy it. <br /> <br />
