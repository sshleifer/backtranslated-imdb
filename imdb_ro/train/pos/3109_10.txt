The third and final film of this trilogy is ultimately clear. It's a political movie more than a simple fun. Jason Bourne will finally find out who he is and will discover and remember the torture he has been subjected to in order to kill his old identity: he has truly killed someone who has become his corpse. But the film finally reveals that all these were organized and planned by the CIA within a Blackfriars program that is clearly revealed in this film as having the purpose of eliminating all American citizens who have tried to hinder the control of the entire society through a " limited group of people. Who was the CIA's chief officer until 1980, when he became vice president? This goes along with what is said on the Internet. Then the truth will come to Jason Bourne himself, but the principal person who will be able to bring that truth to the public and the only authority that can make a decision on the CIA is a woman, and that woman becomes the Senate involved in a general investigation. A woman and the Senate; Read my lips. In the US, politics are fighting in the media, and two media are essential to any presidential campaign: music and cinema. Right now Hollywood and beyond intelligence, academics and intellectuals use cinema in general, and especially this film, to build the idea in public that salvation will come from a woman and from the Senate. So go and look at the movie. It is quite fun and has a sweet perfume at the end of a period and the great change one expects and others are waiting for, but no one can pretend it will not come: the only thing is to know how deep and serious it will be.
