The film collapses from start to finish and the b / w photo of the American heart is amazing. We feel that we are there with them as we pass through the great shore of the sky and then into Mexico and again in America. Near the end of the film, the rain reflection on Robert Blake looks like small rivers of sweat and tears rolling on his face. Finally, we follow the stairs to the final moment. <br /> <br /> The two criminals, played by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson, like Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, can be seen on any street in any city. Hickock is a smiling boy alongside Smith, the star guy in his eyes on the wrong side of the city. This point is made in the film, and it always surprises us that offenders do not have a different look than anybody else. Evil, even the worst, is part of the human condition. These two deceived people kill a whole family, looking for a safe that is not there. Once they flee, they start writing inappropriate checks, sculpting a path for the authorities. There are many final supporting actors. I like John Forsyth as case detective, Alvin Dewey. Also, Will Geer shines in a short yet excellent scene as the attorney of the prosecutor. Often I wanted to see this movie all the way, but I caught it shortly; I finally got to buy the DVD. The result is the best classic killer movie I've ever seen. Do not miss this brilliant movie. For me, it's about the big movie.
