**** Includes Spoilers **** <br /> <br /> I've been a horror movie fan a few decades ago. Only when I think I saw all the best, another appears to surprise me. I've never seen this movie. It was a route also from the beaten track ... not just the way to the bamboo boat either. Here was a horror film of the 1940s that dared to try something very different. The cute girl is fearless for a change and saves the men, including the man he loves, the monster! How is this for a turn. This girl was the biggest opposite of most of the women in the movies of that time, without shouting in her shadow, without realizing the fear, without resisting a leaf while running. This gal is not afraid to live alone in an isolated hut, away from the rest of the villagers. Not only that, but the place was on a swamp rumored to be haunted. Hell, she even takes knots on the swamp grass in the open air ... like Ripley's regular version of the 1940s. No snake, gatherer, or ghostly strangler would dare to disturb the gal. Books about early feminist films should also include this past work. See this if you're a fan of me, those horror, classical horror B / W movies that they did only in the 1930s and 40s. And make sure you wear your neck of turtle cast iron for protection.
