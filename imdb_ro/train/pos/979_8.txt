The peaceful farmer, Robert Sterling, is on the weak side of the war with his ruthless neighbors, that is to say, until the premier Robert Preston appears in the blue to descend the ground. Soon it starts to go too far, fueling a growing sense of anxiety in Sterling, especially when his son begins to idolize the cunning killer. Sundowners are a bit of nuisance, pebbles and a bit surprisingly tough picture with excellent Preston performance. Here, he meets like a shadowy version of Shane, that is, until the real nature of the charmer and the legionary relationship is revealed. Most movie and video guides ruin the surprise! The spread of the show is Chill Wills, Jack Elam and John Drew Barrymore's debut, which became more famous for his descendants than for his acting.
