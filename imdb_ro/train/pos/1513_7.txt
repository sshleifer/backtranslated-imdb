This film is another horror anthology. He's pretty good, but he could have used a little more. We compare it to the "House of Terror Doctors," although it fits in this title. It has four floors, all related to a house. The first story is about a writer and his moving wife. He creates a murderer for his latest novel, and then begins to see the killer walking in his house. This is a kind of predictability, but eventually throws some twists. The next story is a bit more unpredictable and you do not even know where it's going. He has Peter Cushing and probably was my favorite group. This guy is buying the house, but it's not the center of attention, it's a strange wax museum. The third story starts pretty well and has the character of Christopher Lee. It has him like a pretty bizarre father who seems to protect his daughter. The problem is that once you know what's happening in the story does not end fast enough. It pulls a bit, which leads to a very predictable conclusion. Then the final story relates to an actor who buys a cloak in a strange shop. The actor really gets what he pays. Then there is a little story about an officer who is seen throughout the attempt to find out what happened to this actor, and then an explanation of why these things happened. Though I was not very pleased with the explanation, because I do not think he really explained Cushing's story. I think they needed a bigger story for that. However, it was an interesting set of stories.
