The first time I saw this movie, I liked it. It was different. I am a Christian (biblical faith). I do not go along with the crowd of the faithful on the right. I gave up that atmosphere. For my attempts to take over our government, they do what Judas tried to do. I call it Judas Syndrome. Judas did not succeed, even though Jesus said that his kingdom was not from this world. This film has certainly shown some of this. I also liked that Jesus enjoyed the simple pleasure of playing games and jokes with his disciples. He was also a very wonderful Jesus. <br /> <br /> It's a movie watching and over. Very satisfactory.
