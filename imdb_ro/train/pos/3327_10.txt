I like and admire Farrells! Why did I get to see this great movie just 3 years after its release? I made myself laugh, made me cry and warmed my heart. Big time. It's hard to describe in my rotten tongue - but I have to try anyway: The distribution is excellent all the time - from leadership to support roles, acting is great, dialogues are great and the movie is perfectly directed and edited. I think the Farrelly brothers' videos are often underestimated - they are not light comedies - they are deeeeeep! I'm talking about what life is all about (I'm not gonna tell you!). In my case, this movie told me what relationships are all: <br /> <br /> If you love someone: let them be free, let them be - try to share passion and pain and always be true to each other. I am not a sport hater, but certainly an ignorant sport. But in this movie - vibrations help you. I felt the smell of the baseball atmosphere. Finally, this film explained to me what a fan of the sport might mean to you and what wonderful fan family must be there. Thanks a lot, Pete & Bob! <br /> <br /> PS: If you have not seen it - please check KINGPIN!
