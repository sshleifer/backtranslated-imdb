Though it certainly was not the best movie I've ever seen, it definitely deserves $ 8 (which can not be mentioned for many movies these days.) This was a nice story about the true story, though many details about the real story were twisted for the film (for example, the character of Billy Sunday was three or four people in the real story combined together). Robert DeNiro was of course good, and Cuba Gooding, Jr., was also impressive.
