And I'm not saying that in a bad way. I watched this movie at the cinema when I was 6 or 7. For me and my cousins ​​it was magical, handsome and frightening at the same time. When we left the theater, Michael was our best friend, even if we knew he had no idea about it. Over the years, I've seen this movie being played several times, but I've always changed the channel. Even seeing a few seconds, it would bring that feeling of magic and I will warm my heart. And I liked it this way. So I just saw this movie once and I think it was a good decision not to look again. If I saw her today, I know I can not fail to criticize MJ's action, the plot (if one exists) and that and so on. For me this is a childhood memory, so my feelings towards her are those of a child 20 years ago. I see my adult admirer intervenes in my rating and gives her 8 for memories and wonderful music. For that kid who watched it 20 years ago, it's certainly 10-year-old.
