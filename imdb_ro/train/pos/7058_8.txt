Immediately after seeing the movie, the true magic of Walt Disney movies came to me and I realized that a long time ago I saw the "real" magic in a movie. > The combination of correct music, discourse and magical effects brings the sensation of Disney back into your body. Very special things I saw where the unknown effects of the movie began with the Disney logo turning into Cinderella Castle and ended like an old story telling the story with your grandparents. Magic has returned to me. I rate this movie 8 out of 10.
