If only 10 years later was born Eddie Murphy. Then we all remember. But even I was only four when it came out. If you have not seen him yet, rent Dr. Dolittle, Showtime, Spy, Pluto Nash, and all of Eddie's comedy movies - then watch this. With your hands down, you'll laugh 90% of the time. The other 10% will wipe tears in your eyes. You really need to be pursued more than once to understand all the jokes. From raw humor to a joke for kids! (If you have seen her laughing here) - you will enjoy his things. If you can, (or you're a big fan) try downloading clips from Eddie's acts. Many of the shows are different, as you would imagine, and he has even more fun jokes. But this is the best of "Eddie Murphy" X-rated "if you like. <Br /> <br /> All I can say is that you do not look at Delirious if you do not like the comedy, you do not have the sense of humor or do not If you want to know how Eddie took Beverly Hills Cop and became famous from him - Delirious it is.
