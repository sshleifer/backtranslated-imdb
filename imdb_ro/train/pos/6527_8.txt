The documentary begins with setting the perspective in a few light years. The Voyager travels our milky way with the sounds of our earthly life as a spatial monument for (aliens) (possible). <br /> <br /> The documentary contains images of Willy Dixen, Robert Johnson, Skip James, and J.B. Lenoir. The records of J.B. have never been published. The narrative is from "blind Willie" Dixon. However, it is done by an actor. The film presents the work of all these early blues men followed by the covers and performances of the musicians, such as Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, among others. <br /> <br /> Death of J.B. Lenoir (John Mayall's song) is an extraordinary event in the story. Lenoir has engaged politically and is considered to be Martin Luther King's league and colleagues. His political interests are found in the themes of his lyrics. <br /> <br /> Blues can be 'THE' native music of America. Blues are roots, and the rest is fruit. The title "Soul of a Man" is after a Willie Dixon song.
