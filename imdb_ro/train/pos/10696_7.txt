Every time I see Nicole, I love her. I like a movie like this. A woman you just do not give up, but she breaks your heart. The first movie I remember seeing was "Bondage Human," the Kim Novak version - Laurence Harvey. The beef about the correctness of the Russians spoken in this film is small, it was good enough to fool me or anyone else who can not speak Russian, I'm sure. Funny how people lack the point. The "no-goodnik" Russian boys were thrown too well. Finally, I have to confront Ben Chaplin's hat, as somebody else noticed, he plays a bunch of great dignity, and certainly there was a heat between himself and Nicole. To think, boys are paid for it, blow up.
