Since September last year, I've borrowed four to six films each week from Harold Washington Library, which has an impressive collection of DVDs. (HWL is really a circulating library: three quarters of its movies are at all times!) Recently I was delighted to find The Short Films by David Lynch. Yesterday, knowing little about the animated series, I took Dumbland. I'm here to report that, for David Lynch's fans, watching the eight episodes is half an hour well spent. The most remarkable feature of these short pieces is their soundtrack. Each episode has its own rhythm. Respiratory and digestive systems offer percussion. Strong voice scenes stop. Physical violence provides beatings. Creeping birds and pocket outlets brush along the edges. Many other elements complement the orchestra. Pacing of the raw animation often keeps in sync with the sound, but the soundtrack hit me with Lynch's primary interest in creating and disseminating this piece of work. In a way, these eight shorts are unique lingual rhythms. That being said, the situations are weird, ugly, profound, stupid and funny like the hell. And there is plenty of space in them to reflect on how absurd we can be. I can not say I'm following the collection again, but for anyone who has discovered in the Inland Empire apartment movements, Dumbland deserves half an hour of your time.
