There are so many good things to say about this "B" movie. "B" maybe in connections, but not in committee. It's about the best genres I've ever seen. One degree A Universal effort. The script is well done, imaginative and without fault. Writing credits: Howard Higgin's story and Douglas Hodges's story, John Colton (screenplay). Director Lambert Hillyer has managed the story and the complex locations very well. No diving on extra loads and locations. I liked Beulah Bondy (Jimmy Stewarts's mother in "A Wonderful Life"), Frances Drake is a beauty and was part of the grace and path for her husband Karloff, and Lugosi was correctly underestimated. I remember that I saw him in. As I said there are so many good things: the African discovery of the Radium "X", the melting of the stone statues (which reminds of the ten small Indians of And Then There were none (Agatha Christie) version of Barry Fitzgerald) , the appearance of Karlof in the dark, Karloff's mother interpreted by Violet Kemble Cooper with elegance and all these virtues, I found myself believing in the science she represented a good piece of art.
