Enchanting, romantic, innovative and funny. The vision of this extraordinary film is almost unparalleled, surpassing better known "death novels", such as Ghost. While we know intuitively that Peter and Jun will find the ultimate happiness at the end of the long stairs, joy is on the journey. The morality of the story, of course, is timeless: love conquers everything. But the struggle to achieve that victory is playing in a heavenly arena of a profound vision and of great greatness. With more than 500 suitable copies representing different ages and cultures, the vision of the directors on the sky remains memorable six decades later, far from the CGI era. However, for all cosmic scales, Powell and Pressburger knew an essential truth: the best story is told at the lowest level. The marvelous, romantically decisive part of "Ladder" is captured with absolute simplicity: a tear from June, preserved on a rose petal. <br /> <br /> This film, as well as the story itself and the set itself, is one for centuries.
