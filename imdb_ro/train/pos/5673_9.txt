I think Blackadder the Third is the best in the series. In fact, all the episodes are funny, I really like the episode of the "French Invasion," but the one with the superstitious actors in "MACBETH" is also very funny, how Rowan continues to play with them is in -adventure (English) Humor at the highest level. Actors: "Never say again, Play Blackadder: Oh, so you want me to say Scottish game? Actors: DA Blackadder: Rather than MACBETH ... I am a big fan of Rowan and I have a great deal of his work , but I think it made the Blackadder series very well. /> <br /> I hope Rowan will continue his great style, but I think we can count on him because he's already working on a Bean 2 movie that will be in this year, I can not wait ... <br /> <br /> I give this third Blackadder 9 out of 10 Rating.
