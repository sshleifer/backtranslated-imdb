This is one of the most fun and excellent movies ever made! Although I only saw forty minutes and I have to say that this is a good movie. Crying if it's funny and because there's sex around almost every corner of this movie. It's very funny and I do not see how anyone can enjoy this movie. I really want to watch the rest of the movie. She has a little ill-treated scene in it (believe me, it's not very pleasant), but besides, it's a great movie. I rate this movie a 7/8 for comedy, 10/10 for sex and 10/10 for plot. So if you're a fan of American Pie and you want to watch a movie that's about sex, buy this movie. Thank you. <br /> 10/10
