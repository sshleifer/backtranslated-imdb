Okay, first of all, I like to comment on this, but I felt like I had to deal with this movie. So many people were buzzing on her and I felt like people who might want to see that they should get a second opinion. First of all, Bend It Like Beckham is not meant to be the deepest movie of the century. If that's what you're looking for, go somewhere else. Just because it's an independent film does not mean it has to be artistic. It is supposed to make you feel good, and you have to have fun looking at it, and these two things are easy to do. Second, the action, though "Halle Berry in Monster's Ball" is still good. The film does not need to behave so honestly, so do not look for it. It's a family movie. If that's what you want, you do not want or should not look at this cinema. <br /> <br /> Finally, she has a really nice story. I think he thought well and it's fun to watch. It's also very true for life for most of the culture, so if you want to sit down and watch a movie you can enjoy and feel good when you're done. If you are looking for something with thoughtful thoughts and great dramatic landscapes this is not for you. <br /> <br /> -Lyndsay
