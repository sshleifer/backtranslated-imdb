The distribution is excellent, the action is good, the exciting plot, the suspenseful evolution ... but it's hard to tighten all these elements in a movie that lasts only 80 minutes. If it took more time to develop the plot and subplots, it would have a much better effect. Another 30 minutes of substance would have made this film really good, rather than a good one.
