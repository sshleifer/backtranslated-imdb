I became a fan of TV series "Homicide: Life on the Streets" late in the show, but it became a fan very quickly. It was a show of policemen, unlike any other: visually different in the use of handhelds, taking the viewer everywhere through its multiethnic and mutiracial distribution and their different and fascinating personalities and covering all the good and evil of a police department, including corruption and confrontations with personality that propagate to the surface. <br /> <br /> Homicide: The movie, the series follow-up meeting, is as good as a movie made for television. After Lt. Giardello (Yaphet Kotto), now a candidate for mayor of Baltimore, is shot, the members of the series towers came back to find the killer. In addition, casting members who have left the force and those who have died, also succeed in taking their place in the film. The intensity and fire that marked the series are coming back, and the script gets stuck with the same fire that marked the series. Generally, a great television movie. <br /> <br /> Vote: 9
