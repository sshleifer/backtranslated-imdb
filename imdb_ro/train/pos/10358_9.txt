I remember seeing the movie that was presented a few years ago on the Lifetime TV network and thought it was an interesting story. A few years later I see her again and fall over her head, in love with this film. The story behind the film is fascinating in itself. Distribution only makes it more appealing. Meryl Streep is definitely at the top of her game in this photo. She brings Mrs. Chamberlain's manners, accents and looks. She shows the pain, the wounds, the surprise and anger Lindy had to endure, and in this process it's hard to remember that she is not Lindy. In my opinion, this interpretation of Meryl's was better than Oscar winning role in "Sophie's Choice" and should have earned her the third Oscar. Sam Neill is perfect as Michael Chamberlain, and for some reason surprisingly, he has not been recognized by the Academy with at least one nomination. In total, this film receives only one Oscar knot (Streep's best actress.) However, he received several Australian nominations and nominations. Surely a top-rate movie: it tells a wonderful story and you get great performances from across the cast.
