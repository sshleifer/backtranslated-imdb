It is not a task for each film to stimulate you superficially. I will make an ambitious failure in front of a blow on the market every day. Although this can not be described as a failure, the sum of its parts remains ambiguous. This indisputable quality tantalizes me to pursue it again and again. This is a provocative, challenging film that does not end things upright. The problem with the film is in its structure. His inexhaustible field seems to end, just like a second finale. Although everything is technical, the movie is just too long for that unit. The longest wake-up period of Leo's awakening is about 20 minutes late. Great cinema often comes at the expense of a decent scenario, but here the camera's innovative technique offers a lot of visual ideas. The artifact of the composition is provocative and involved; A character is projected in the back, but his hand is not in the foreground. The world described is deliberate, misleading and absurd. Keep your eyes out for a memorable, technically stunning assassination that will make the jaw fall. The compositions are amazing. Anyone who chose to release video tapes (off-print) in pan & scan format should never have seen it. Where is the DVD? It is impossible for someone to give an inappropriate magazine to this originality. You should see it at least once. You have the feeling that von Trier has whispered more than he could chew, but this movie ends up being richer for him. I suspect he is familiar with Hitchcock's foreign correspondent, in which European detainees also manipulate an American duel and some Welles movies that enjoy delusional joy in technique as much as he did. All the movies in von Trier explores the naive situation in the midst of unforgiving societies. After von Zentropa, von Trier stepped away from this bold technical experiment in the face of a dead, over-evaluated, blurry soap, such as Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark.
