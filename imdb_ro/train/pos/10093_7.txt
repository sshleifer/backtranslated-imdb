A beautiful woman in London is swept up by a tea plantowner and is soon married and lives with him at the Ceylon villa. Although, based on Robert Standish's book, this initial configuration is very similar to Hitchock's "Rebecca," with a lady-in-chief, Elizabeth Taylor, who faces the imposing chief of staff at the mansion and her close husband , under his father's dying but dominant finger. Taylor, a last minute replacement for a distressed Vivien Leigh, seems to be creamy in her high-fashion cabinet, and her performance is strong enough; however, once husband Peter Finch begins to drink much and give him orders, one might think that his devotion is rather masochistic (this feeling prevents the end). Still, the film offers a lot of surprises for soap lovers: romantic drama, a little trip, an interpretive dance, an elephant fight, and a perfect cholelle outburst! *** from ****
