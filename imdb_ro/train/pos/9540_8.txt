Most of the feedback I've heard about the Meatball Machine has been quite mixed. A couple even says they think they "suck". Well, for those people I say, to get a f @ ckin imagination and to go alone. This was a very fun movie. The story begins with this mechanical bug, which attacks and somehow transforms its hosts into these gor-looking outfits, deathbots called Necroborgs. Finally, you will find that these mechanical bugs also attach a small parasite to you, which can then control your actions due to the hot wiring of the nervous system. Unfortunately, for two young adults who fall in love, they happen to cross the paths with the mechanical bug and before they know that transformations are taking place and the blood is sprinkled. Is there a way to stop transformation? Maybe a way to stop this mechanical threat of bugs? Why is Necroborgs fighting with each other? Are the two desperate ones alone expressing their feelings for each other and making them feel ugly? Just a way to find out. <br /> <br /> Get Into the Meatball Car I was very cautious because of the mixed reactions but it turned out to be a big surprise. Some unsuccessful questions, some sometimes acting environments and a slightly confusing end are the only weak points I can think of. From the anime feel to it, to the parasites becoming small characters and even to the low sense of the budget, this film strikes the right mark much more than it loses. With a growing story that's interesting enough to keep your questions all the while mixing with cool make-up effects and blood splatter, it's a fan of bizarro / horror fans / Tetsuo / splatter fans. 8 out 10
