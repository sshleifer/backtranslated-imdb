This film was nominated for the best picture but lost to Casablanca, but Paul Lukas beat Humphrey Bogart as the best actor. I do not see why Lucile Watson was nominated for the best supporting actor, I do not think he did a really good job. Bette Davis and Paul Lukas and their three children leave Mexico and enter the United States in the first scene of the film. He's headed to the house of Davis's relatives. Davis and Lukas were underground to stop the Nazis, so they are very tired and need rest. But when I get home, they are a Nazi who live there and can not do much more about them. It seems that the Nazis only care for the money and are willing to make a deal with Lukas. They are more of a plot, but you can find this for yourself.
