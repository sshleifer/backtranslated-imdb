Pig Guinea: The Devil's experiment is undoubtedly a star-star point of view, is a terrible and disturbing brutal realist in the dark side of human nature. This movie gets right to the subject, maybe you're thinking at what point? The idea is to meet the fans of extreme violence and gore. This movie has some gore, more or less just torturing a violent woman. There are really only 3 scenes that could be considered gore. I'll tell you one thing, though Guinea Pig: The Devil's Experiment makes Hostiles look like Sesame Street. If you thought Hostile was a crazy and disturbing torture, then you did not see your half until you saw Guinea Pig: The Devil's Experiment. Rating 0-5, Gore 0-10 <br /> <br /> Guinea Pig: The Devil's Experiment (untreated) ***** (7)
