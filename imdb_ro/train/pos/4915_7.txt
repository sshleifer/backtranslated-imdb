And a rather unexpected plot of plot - for the time: there's Plague in New Orleans - and only Richard Widmark can stop it! Elia Kazan's trade topics: water strips, workers, crowds, fugitives, blue-collar people, violence on a back street - all of them here. Jack Palance is quite efficient as the ice high score, Zero Mostel as Dom Delouise somewhat miscast, but definitely watched as go-fer. I enjoyed Barbara Bel Geddes as the cold and cold wife - I thought she and Widmark were a credible couple. He himself has always remembered something about Sinatra - in the face and in a quiet way - and which is considered a compliment if nothing is. I have not even heard about this movie, and yes, you have to admire Widmark's performance. I also enjoyed Paul Douglas - he seemed to play this role many times, they make an unlikely but effective team. The plague itself is a McGuffin - and you have to know it's not exactly as it was in real life, rather small-scale, at least not? - but I found that she had the plot along the beautiful. Check this out. It's good. *** outta ****
