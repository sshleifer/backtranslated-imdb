Great pirate fun! She has all the good ingredients to keep her eye on - a hidden story of intrigue, a hot fire pirate named Spitfire Stevens (Maureen O'Hara), who is attracted to the irresistible Mr. Hawke (Errol Flynn) a secret mission. They make a beautiful pair of romantic suspects! Anthony Quinn is the evil brook, bad evil weaned his villainous web of division and conquest. We noticed Mildred Natwick's well-known face, who plays a supporting role like Mrs. MacGregor, the protector of young Princess Patma (Alice Kelley). There is a beautiful film landscape of shores, ships and bay. A lot of fighting against spirits, ship battles, daring jumps of Errol Flynn (Robin Hood aboard the ship!). From reddish to flames, I once heard in an interview from Maureen O'Hara that he was very careful about whipping and that he could overcome Flynn in battle with the sword at the time, but it would not be it was necessary to try here. <br /> <br /> Very nice film.
