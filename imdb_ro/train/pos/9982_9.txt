I saw this movie last night after waiting for ages and ages so that he is released here in Canada (still in the limit of release). It was worth the wait and then some. I am a very passionate reader of Margaret Laurence and was pleased to see that this novel was turned into a movie. Actually, I got to like the movie better than the novel. I liked the fact that Bram Shipley's character was a bit tougher and that it seemed to be more of a love story between Hagar and Bram, which made the scenes at the end of Bram's life move much more. Loss seemed stronger. Hagar was no longer in the likes of the film, but Ellen Burstyn was a genius in this role. She was Hagar through and over. Christine Horne was brilliant and has much more to do before. I'm sure. Her scenes with Cole Hauser were electrifying. I could generally continue a 9 * of 10. Fantastic and can not wait for it to appear on DVD, it must be my own collection!
