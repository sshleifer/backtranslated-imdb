I liked this movie! It was all I could not do in tears while I was following it, but it is really very uplifting. I was impressed with Ray Liotta's show, but especially with Tom Hulce's talent as the twin brother of Ray, who is slow because of a tragic and terrible childhood event. But Tom's character, though he has no mercy, is full of hope and life. This is a great movie, do not miss!
