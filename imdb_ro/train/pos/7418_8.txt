"The shower" is a story about loyalty, the unprepared advance of the modern world at the expense of more traditional and humane ways of life. A man forced to choose between his successful business career, the life of his great city, his wife and his retarded brother. The eternal uncertainty between what we want to do and what we should do. Modern and versatile China. Public baths with its gatherings, cricket battles against shopping centers and skyscrapers. A lot of old people and women are no longer needed. China, a country, two systems, as Xiao Ping said ... although one of them kills the other. <br /> <br /> Tender, moving, full of funny moments, and sweet-sweet. Sensitive ones will laugh and laugh equally. The actors are enormous, especially those who play the role of the retarded boy; and Yang Zhang does a good, easy, simple job, allowing the story to run alone. <br /> <br /> My rate: 8/10
