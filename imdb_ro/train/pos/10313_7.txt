China O'Brien (1990) was an attempt to make Cynthia Rothrock a star in the United States. This Golden Harvet production was led by veteran director Robert Clouse. Unfortunately, he was lucky with Enter the Dragon or lost touch because he is not that big of a director. The only reason to watch this movie is to see the fighting skills of Ms. Rothrock and Richard Norton. If this movie was directed by Corey Yuen or Hoi Meng, it could have been a classic action instead of a direct motion action movie. China O'Brien returns home to help her father. She has problems with the local crowd and needs her help. So she returns home and restores her order (with two improbable people). But will they be enough to overthrow Mister Big and his bad friends? If you are a great fan of Cynthia Rothrock, then this movie will serve you. I just enjoyed battle scenes, everything else is garbage. Why did Raymond Chow not take a few shekels and hired a top action director? <br /> <br /> Recommended.
