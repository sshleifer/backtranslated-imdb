In the ten years since Wildside broadcast, nothing has come close to its quality in local production. These include the two series of Underbelly's pleasant, but overrated, which brought to life events in the recent criminology of Sydney and Melbourne. The Blue Murder miniseries (who also played Tony Martin, but someone on the other side of the law) may be the exception. Wildside is currently repeated late at night on ABC. After watching the show for quite a while, I'm still impressed by uncompromising story lines and very human characters. The distribution is excellent: Tony Martin as a detective haunted by the disappearance of his son, Rachael Blake (who later joined Martin in real life) as a community worker struggling with alcoholism and Alex Dimitriades as a young policeman whose vice is gambling . As well, support roles are provided by Aaron Pederson, Jessica Napier, Mary Coustas (yes, even Effie) and a young Abbie Cornish. ABC has inexplicably launched just the first three episodes on DVD a few years ago. The logic of this type of marketing is beyond me, but I think it might have something to do with license disagreements with the original producers. A serious series that has remarkably aged. Here he hopes ABC's DVD department to get involved together. <br /> <br /> (According to a moderator on an ABC discussion board, a different kind of DVD release will be released in December 2009)
