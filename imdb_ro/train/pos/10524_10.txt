Jane Austen will certainly approve of this! Gwyneth Paltrow does a wonderful job that captures Emma's attitude. She is fun without being overly stupid but elegant. She makes a very convincing British accent (I do not feel British, maybe I'm not the best judge, but she fooled me ... she was also excellent in "Sliding Doors" ... Sometimes I forget it's American! Also brilliant are Jeremy Northam and Sophie Thompson and Phyllida Law (Emma Thompson's sister and mother) as Bates women. They almost steal the show ... and Ms. Law has not even a few lines! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
