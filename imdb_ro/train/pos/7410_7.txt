I met "Dus" in the foreign movie section of my local video store and I went through it several times, since her cover looks like a farce or a comedy. I then gave a copy to buy at an economical price and I am happy for my luck. The "shower" is the story of three men, a father and two (2) adults, each coming to change life, while the world around them continues to change in modern China as well. As with many "foreign" films, Chinese culture itself is one of the most exciting facets of this film. Beyond the fascinating features of local color, the Chinese who set the story, it's tough, but still touching men and a single woman involved in the story, all set against the backdrop of a bath in the village. The story of the family is moving from alienation to understanding, and makes me glad that I have come to know these people. The main story adds the many small characters, the bathroom clients, their conflicts and their individual friendships. The "shower" is a film that moves away from smiles and touches its warmth and humanity.
