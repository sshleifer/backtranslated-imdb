The fleet is unjustly malignant as a smaller rival "Se7en". There is no reason to compare the two, except maybe for the similar landscape in the last showdown. Now that I'm no longer going to go see why the Fleet is very interesting in some respects. For the most part, it is a drama rather than a soul-filled thriller about a very vigilant social worker who monitors sexual offenders. From the very beginning you can clearly see that his work was better than him. Obviously, in two scenes where a criminal first interviews and shoots him around and the second when a woman tries to take it and all she can think of is his standard questions in his questionnaire. Gere is very good as Errol Babbage, the aforementioned social worker. His way of performing his job is no different from that of a police officer, he wears a gun and constantly checks the newspapers and provides law enforcement officials with information if part of his "flock" can be responsible for a sexual offense. He is also a person who has lost all his happiness to live, and his only relief seems to come from exacerbating his vigilant justice on his flock. You see him twice when he smiles, once he apologizes for treating his brutal partner and the other after he has beaten a member of his flock. While Flock is not as successful. Somewhat confused and with some irritating plot holes, but it has a series of amazing set pieces. Generally speaking, the Flock is a solid drama about a man who performs a dehumanized ministry and ultimately has to work hard to avoid being swallowed by the abyss in which he surrounded himself. The world we live in is a rather sick place, and the other one can get away from the worst, the happier the person is. The flock has that nice view.
