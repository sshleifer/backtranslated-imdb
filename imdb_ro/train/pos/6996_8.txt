This movie was a very good movie about something that affects us all. I know we went in person many times. Thanks to Will Smith jumped into the social mess of text messaging during the leadership. People, do not do that. One hour and forty-five minutes is not enough for this cause. Personally, I wanted to throw my cell phone after the movie. I was glad to see that other people in the theater saw the message and threw their phones out of empty popcorn bags. I decided to disable all text messages on my phone and encourage others to do the same. If you care about your family, make them follow this vital public service announcement about text messages during driving or could kill seven people. Thank you for showing us the way.
