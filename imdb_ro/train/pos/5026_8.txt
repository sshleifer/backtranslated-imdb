This is a great movie that everyone should see. It plays like a Dean Koontz book. Bill Paxton's performance was great in the fact that he really believes he believes in what he says and does. I do not know why viewers have to read some kind of support for religious crime in the film. It's fiction. The end is surprising, but fictional. So what? I think that's what makes this movie so good. SPOILER DO NOT READ MORE IF THE FILM HAS BEEN RECEIVED. Throughout the movie, the viewer is constantly shocked by Paxton's character, the impact on children, and the way children deal with this scandalous behavior. And then, in the end, it turns out to be true. God put him on a mission to escape the world of demons. Paxton is not clairvoyant, as other viewers suggest. Surely, he was told that he could not have known otherwise, but the film goes on to show how God "protects" Adam through a convenient video quality problem and the total lack of memory of the second FBI agent. The film does not plead for Christian crime but just takes the spectator on a very unexpected journey.
