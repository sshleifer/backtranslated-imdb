You have to watch the movie with great dialogues, wonderful music, great acting and a great atmosphere. In the film you will be followed by 8 people one day in the city of Antwerp, all are individuals and sometimes strange (so I love them!) <br /> <br /> I will not say anything, just go see and you enjoy it.
