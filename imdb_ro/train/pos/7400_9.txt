This is a wonderful story of family loyalty, which, fortunately, does not resort to ordinary tricks (or at least the ones I've come to see in American and European films) of supersentilence or dramatic tension. <br /> It's very respectable and very enjoyable. It has a beautiful cinema, but it's not just based on it for fun.
