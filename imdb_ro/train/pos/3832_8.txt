One night in a deserted road, in an empty salon, Martin Sheen turns a yarn for Robert Carradine from Hopalong Cassidy and friends who have watched a group of cattle-killer wizards who killed a few men and kidnapped her Cassidy's face. <br /> <Writer / Director Christopher Coppola He may have suffered William Boyd's puristic wrath, dare to make a low-budget budget movie with his beloved Hoppy, but I'm glad he did ! No character should be so tied to an actor that no one else would have allowed him to play again! I thought it was a good fun and an interesting update of classical programmers from the thirties to forties. Though guilty of bad action, this is pretty serious and stupid, which makes it hard for me not to like. The whole production is a little weird though, but I really liked the scenes between Sheen and Carridine. The fact that we are watching a story in a story makes stranger and exaggeration more enjoyable.
