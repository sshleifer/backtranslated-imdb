I started to ride pretty soon and, as somebody who ever flew, I fell in love with horses and their world. I rented Spirit on a whim, trying to pack my life with horse-related materials as much as I could, and I was surprised by the results. What I was expecting was a Disneyesque movie with animal talk and stereotypes every five minutes. What I received was an amazing film full of beautiful landscapes and animations and a stunning story that has the great potential to warm up your heart. <br /> <br /> Spirit is a savage mustang in the Old West, whose whole world is brought around him when he discovers that people slowly begin to take their homeland. The story unfolds with a wide range of characters, some people, some animals, all are well written and I am most pleased to watch the screen. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good story, and has an appreciation for history and animals. One thing I forgot to mention, but which I feel important is that the animals in this movie do not speak. It was a very enjoyable vacation from the animated Lady And The Tramps that everyone was used to today.
