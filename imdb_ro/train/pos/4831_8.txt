I got into this by waiting to not like it; I thought he would be very worthy and serious, and rather fruitive and boring. In fact, it's much better than that, and I find myself very happy. I do not know much about Queen Victoria beyond what I know the most - married to Albert, who died young and wept after him. Seeing the circumstances in which he grew up was fascinating; I actually woke up wishing to see the story more and I imagine we'll see a sequel at a time. From a visual point of view, the movie is amazing. The sets and costumes are incredibly generous, not too gaudy and above. The actress is a superior step of all involved. In a word, it was great!
