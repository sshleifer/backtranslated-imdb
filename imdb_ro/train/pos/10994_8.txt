This is my first comment! This is a fantastic movie! I watched everything with luck one night on television. At the beginning of 5 minutes I thought it was a B movie, but then I realized what amazing product this was. I suggested to some friends to see the movie, just to tell me it was a bad B movie. How wrong. Superficial criticism. I think the film is almost a genius product! The well-known director has done a great job here and it's a shame to say he's out of the game all the time.
