My sister and I hired this movie because we were in the mood for something unpleasant and not so demanding to look at. However, the film has greatly exceeded my very low expectations. It is much more than a representation of a century. She has very real portraits of the characters inside her and most actors do an amazing job. The different stories are ripe together with real-time recordings that give it a very unique touch. As I watched him, I really felt like I was caring about what happened to the characters. I would also like to give endless sums of praise to Julia Stiles in her portrait about Katie, she was great in a way that I recommend this movie to anyone.
