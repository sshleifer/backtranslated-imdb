I first saw this movie when I overturned the DirecTV parents' film channels. It was on the Sundance channel and it just started. I love music, especially the late '60s and that's what BJM called (The Dandys are all right). Everything about Brian Jonestown's massacre intrigued me with the music, the personalities of Anton and Joel, the illicit drug use. It was funny because, as I looked at the first scene of the party, when everyone was making lines, my parents walked and decided to look (look on their faces was priceless). Anyway this is definitely one of my favorite movies because it introduced me to the Brian Jonestown massacre which is now my favorite band of all time.
