I can not understand what the fans of the genre did not like about this movie. It was very fun. The special effects were great. Generally, I agree with IMDB voters and reviews, but not this time. I waited until I got home to the movie I felt was another reason why I would not enjoy the movie. I think movies with special effects should be seen on the big screen, but again that was not the case. For me the film compares to two movies released at the same time. Blair Witch and The Mummy. Both of the movies I thought were terrible. Blair was probably the most overrated movie of all time. The mummy was making a lot of money, and it was a pure matter. People liked it because they have special effects. Movies like Mummy and Haunting are not rich in character development, they are more like a funhouse ride. Well, with that analogy, the mummy was a ticket to the B Haunting ticket.
