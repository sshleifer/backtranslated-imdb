Some of the guys who watch movies and complain about them to live their lives forget something: the DVD menu system. People tell you, I've seen repeating the main screen in about 35 times. Was awesome. A cascading cinematic tapestry that wore me where it was, which was the beginning. Often the amount and Bam! I was coupled. Over and over and over. And over. <br /> <br /> "Doot de doot, de doo de dodedo." And that's just the soundtrack! <br /> <br /> I am left in bed, clean with my Vaio. The rain is flat on the roof and tonight's soft tonight is soft again. The cat is comfortable and my ankle that crosses in me is already resting. I appeared on DVD. I was fascinated. By night. "doot de doot, de doo de dodedo." <br /> <br /> Blob. See this. Steve Queen, two cops and a girl in the dress. Two fingers up!
