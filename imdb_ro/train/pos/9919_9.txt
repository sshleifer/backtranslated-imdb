Magnificent, astounding and frightening, this wonderful beautiful movie is "The Revelation Now" without fiction. Quiet in peace, quiet in the mood, gives careful attention to the poisoned patches of Earth, which may be signs of an inevitable condemnation. There is no doubt in my mind - nature is affected and we are the disease. Greed, the very essence of humanity that drives evolution and progress, has transformed us into a kind of cancer, on its way to consume the host and die with it ... The landscapes are an unforgettable experience - at least not I will never look at my toaster or the iron in the same way again.
