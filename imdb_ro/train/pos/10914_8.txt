I saw the Thin Man series - Powell and Loy are certainly wonderful, but there is something nice about Powell and Arthur's chemistry in this movie. Jean Arthur Shins looking at Powell. There is an unmistakable whisper between them. It is possible that this film does not have the spirit of the Thin Man series, but undoubtedly it does it in charm. As I watched him, I thought Powell had a tremendous deal with Arthur. My friends believed the same. This is a movie in which I wish I could go back in time (to block and lock your lips with Powell!) There seems to be no end to his ugly smirk! Powell's character, Lawrence Bradford, is probably the closest thing to the "perfect man." Okay, that sounds too gushy, but I can not help.
