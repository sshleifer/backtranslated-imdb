I just saw this movie and I fell in love with it. There is a bit of something for everyone, and a real free for all when it comes to the romance between Lachlan and Lil. When on the beach, I almost wept ... there is an unspoken achievement that time is the most precious commodity and it is most obvious when they are together. This idea has been taken from many points of view, from marriage and from friends to finding love in the least conventional places. The film almost makes you want for such a desperation when you know tomorrow might be your last. Crowe was particularly awesome in his role as Lachlan. I always had a weak point for accent, but I almost melted with portraying his character. The way this movie was shot is also beautiful, with music, open field backgrounds and superb action. All together, this is a wonderful movie that pulls all human emotions.
