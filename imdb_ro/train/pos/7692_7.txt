First, I give my rating for the general series; ******* 7 out of ten stars. I took three for the downhill descent that this series suffered after Ios Amos left. You do not understand that it was hard to hit episodes later, but only after Esther Rolle left for a season and came back. In February 1974, a very comely CBS award. First it was a television, a show about an African-American family living in the Chicago Projects in the 1970s. Created by Norman Lear as a spin-off of "Maude," he again hit the right rope with viewers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> (Well, it was the "South Central" Fox in '94 but it was not renewed.) John Amos as James Evans Sr. was the last figure father for this family and acted like any father should keep his family together and his children to descend on the wrong paths of life. Esther Rolle was a wonderful unimaginable figure who was on the same page with her husband when she came to raise her children. <br /> <br /> Ralph Carter as Michael a young young but very bright for his age, but stuck in a school system that does not meet his academic needs. The name of his character is the same as founder Mike Evans, who was Lionel Jefferson on "The Jeffersons." (Mike Evans died in December 2006). Thelma is a young woman aged 16 or 17 and has to deal with the danger of being a young woman on the streets of the ghetto. Jimmie Walker as J.J. Evans Jr. is the typical young man who cracks wise, javing a kind of young man who does not take his life seriously. Simply, all my favorite episodes are with John Amos, except for Penny Gordon / Janet Jackson story lines. After the death of character James Evans, the show lost stability and the spectators left. Esther Rolle left for a whole year, not wanting to play the second time in JJ's "Dyno-mite's" smart-aleck! <br /> <br /> She returned the following season, after assuring that the writer would even do things outside. Neighbor Neighbor, Wilona Woods, was a divorced woman who adopted an abused little girl, Penny Gordon (played by a Janet Jackson, 10 years old). Penny's abusive mother was interpreted by Totie Fields, Kim Fields' mother. In August 1979 the show ended, leaving all the projects for a better life. JJ artist sold an idea to a comic book company, Michael left to live on college campus. <br /> <br /> Keith's husband + Florida, Wilona & Penny, Thelma and footballer, moved to the same building in Chicago. It does not end most realistically, but it does not matter until then.
