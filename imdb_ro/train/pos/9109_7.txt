In principle, it is about two men who were part of the Portuguese revolution. It was easy to understand the contest, but usually directors start from a historical fact to talk about something else, or it also shows the period before or after that, everything here happens in those two days when the revolution is acting. It could also be seen as a documentary. The film focuses on these two people, showing how they were normal, not common heroes, because the revolution comes from people. Although it was made of the military military title, you can understand that they were just "captains" as the main characters. Colors and beautiful lights throughout the movie, excellent work for the director being her first film, she does not fit in the ordinary way. Looks good at the emotions and passion of the people and the crowd. The Maia character (the main one) is well done and there is a good interpretation for Stefano Accorsi, able to show the boundaries of Maia, this non-hero.
