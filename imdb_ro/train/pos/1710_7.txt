This movie is an exact copy of a TV series on the Indian television channel doordarshan, which was broadcast at least 15 years ago. The series was known as "bubbles", which means balloons. Each episode was a new story. The story is excellent and the original is much sweeter and "convincing". Abhay Doel does a good job, but does not fit the role of a "normal" and "third-class" boy (as it is called in the movie). In fact, Shayan Munshi, short-haired and without designer clothes, would be appropriate to Abhays, but Shayan does not have the talent to shoot him. is available. It's the same story, except for running with my mom's friends and introducing it. The action of TV actors was much better than these "stars". The only reason this movie is a flop is that the director tried to stretch a half-hour story (or 45 minutes) at 2+ hours. So it must be love. Even the songs of nasal weights did not succeed in doing so. This movie is good for a lazy Sunday afternoon and is very refreshing if you did not watch the original TV series. The script and the end of the series were much better <br /> <br /> ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ######### ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ######## ## #### SPOILERS AHEAD ######### ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ######### ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ######### Completing the original series was much stronger as the hero himself destroys the girl even though he believed he was willing to marry him. He is conscious and tells him that he does not want to be "reimbursed" and has never helped with this intention. The director or script writes somehow could not capture the original end in this movie. The original end would have bought tears of the girls' eyes and should have given the boys a sign of approval. The delivery was not correct. But I personally think it's a pitiful copy. No credit should be given to the director / writer. The story is amazing and is written by one of the most famous Romanian writers of the class Premchand munshi. I'm not sure if it's the story of premchand munshi, but many of the other stories in his series present some of the stories of Hindu writers of the premchand munshi.
