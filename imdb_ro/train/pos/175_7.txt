A fairly average but brave film from Mrs. Hawn to promote this vehicle as Exec & manufacturer as a leading vehicle. Although it ends, she is willing to appear as a bimbo dizzying. How many other listed actresses have been subjected to injury pratfalls since the beginning of this film? Not many. Does that mean that the female ass can not be funny? Goldie surpasses other actresses because she has kept a screen character and adventures in other projects will not. Sandra Bullock occasionally goes there, for example, Miss Congeniality, but Nicole Kidman will never stir pratfall. A wonderful interpreter. Great to see some of my favorite actors, Chris Sarandon & Cliff DeYoung in particular.
