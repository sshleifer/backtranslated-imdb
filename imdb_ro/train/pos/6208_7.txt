In 1997, indie dramedy low-key drama Henry Fool seems to have been a safe choice of movies that no one would bother to review for a sequel. A wandering, dissipated (Thomas Jay Ryan) rider walks around the city. His anarchic assemblies and anus inspires a garbage collector (James Urbaniak) to write poems, while Henry tries half-heartedly to face Parker Posey's sister. After the poet advances, Henry refuses. Nothing special about any of the characters or story. One step for Harold and Maude's Ghost would have been quoted by higher odds ever to make on the screen. But Parker Posey is not the semi-official Queen of India for nothing. "So when writer / director Hal Hartley came up with a new incarnation for his cast, a film was born. in a kind of dark comedy, completely different, that's about espionage Henry may have been an international spy - and possibly a double agent, or even a triple, for years before meeting with others. Hide from agents and authorities in many countries Everyone wants his incoherent diary that can contain encrypted secrets that could destabilize nations and economies Posey's Fay is either the wife he left to go to his lady or widow, depending on who is telling the truth.Fay's efforts to find Henry and / or the naturally disputed journals include a glove with global hits of multinational hits and patrons to each he does not know who to believe or trust. Also, while we sing these unlikely characters in Jason Bourne / Jack Ryan's territory, Hartley's script retains the ironic humor of their first appearance, eliminating them from the physical threat. His upset light of alliances of paranoia, duplicity, and musical chairs in today's geopolitics is beginning to collapse to the end. Even so, fans of the first film will be pleasantly surprised by the novelty of Hartley's recycling methods. (5/18/07)
