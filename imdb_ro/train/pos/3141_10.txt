Let's face it: The final season (# 8) was one of the worst seasons of any show I've ever enjoyed (especially, I've never found dry spells lasting a whole season). But if you judge this show until the last season, of course it will happen as inferior. This is an absolutely unfair appraisal - because the show "This in the 1970s was, in its day, a brilliant and hilarious sitcom about a past era and how the people living there were not so different from us in presently in modern times. All right ... ignoring Season 8. Topher Grace plays the role of Eric Forman, a horny geek of a teenager with a perpetual love of Donna (Laura Prepon), a feminist Danny Masterson (Hyde), Mila Kunis (Jackie), Wilmer Valderrama (Fez) and even Ashton Kutcher (Kelso) deliver fantastic performances in (almost) every episode. The best is probably Fez , a student of foreign exchange, who is as mentally promised as herself.What country is it? Try to figure it out For another dimension of entertainment, Debra Jo Rupp and Kurtwood Smith are phenomenal as Eric's parents. , like Kitty, is so formidable both abilly and sweet, as Mrs. Brady met Marie Barone, while Roy's Smith exists primarily to scare poles from all over the world. Don Stark and Tanya Roberts play very well for each other as Donna, Bob, chauvinistic, but capable, parents, and Midge. Tommy Chong has occasional appearances as Leo, a stoner who acts as a father figure at Hyde. Apart from the anachronistic errors that appear quite frequently and the higher-level lessons that sometimes come (and that the deplorable final season, the '70s' is a wonderful show with amazing writing, spot-on direction and a pleasant atmosphere in each episode Everyone is all right.
