A casual encounter between a seller and a man-victim changes their lives. This is a strange thing that works, an impressive effort for Shepard's writer-director. In a nice unpleasant role, which is far from James Bond, Brosnan is surprisingly effective as the man who hits himself, who gets embarrassed by the stress of his job, but fails to emotionally connect with anyone to help him cope with . Kinnear is as good as the seller, a decent man with a void in his life. Davis is fine as Kinnear's flamboyant wife. Mainly a character study, the film is rewarding because it feels fresh and unpredictable, an extremely dark comedy.
