I would like to know why he left the show John Amos and how he died from the show again? I could not refer to everything, but sometimes they struck home with the problems they were facing. By the way, have they ever managed to escape from the ghetto? I think the black Jesus episode was my favorite. We need to see them experience some good moments. something they did not have very often. I'd like to bring the show back. During the day, so people can stay up to date. I do not think there would be a movie or a new show. Especially without the original distribution. I'm really what Good Times Good Times did. These are my questions and comments. Thank you!!
