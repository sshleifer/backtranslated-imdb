For years, I have watched every horror film that has come out of Hollywood's boring retreats such as Saw 2, to the indiscriminate indiscriminate evil evils ... we suffer through all the bad movies, hoping to find precious stones like "Dark Remains". We managed to capture a movie of this movie at Shriekfest 2005. The audience loved it and I think it has come to win the award for the best film. <br /> <br /> Although it can not have the budget or the power of the studio movie stars, it packs a serious blow in the creepy atmosphere and in the scarecrow category. Act and cinema are top, but it's the direction that makes this movie worth the vision. The story and the characters are developing at the right pace to deliver fantastic fantasies. Editing and visual fx are also top. And while many horror movies fail to use music for their benefit, the score for "Dark Remains" adds only to his anger. I know the movie was presented at a bunch of festivals, but none was close to me, so I can not wait to hear it when it finally comes out on DVD. Believe me, even if you feel bad about the current state of horror movies, give it a try ... you will not regret it!
