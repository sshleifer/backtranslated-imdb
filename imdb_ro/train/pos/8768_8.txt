I saw this movie at a cheap store. I actually remembered seeing the ads and trailers some years ago. I thought "What's hei" and I bought it, essentially because the intrigue sounded interesting and Claire Danes was always a talented person in my eyes (and that before I became a huge fan Kate Beckinsale). <br /> </ p> <p> So, there are two girls who sneak on a holiday in Bangkok, get rid of drugs (they disagree) and then they are sent to a prison in Thailand. The film follows what will happen to them, and sometimes they ask questions about their innocence. <br /> <br /> Both Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale perform extraordinary performances, and the plot of this film is unconventional and raises some questions of wonderful moral discussion. a good film, but there could have been some improvement, it could have been more ... it would have helped to strengthen these characters, and a better understanding of Thailand's justice system policy would have helped. /> However, besides, it's a good movie with some great performances. PS For all your pop culture people to be looking for a two minute role for Paul Walker. I did not even notice him when I saw the movie.
