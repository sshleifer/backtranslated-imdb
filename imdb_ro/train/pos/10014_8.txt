The Night Listener kept my attention, with Robin Williams shining as the host of New York, who cherishes his friendship with a 14-year-old boy (Rory Culkin) who is very sick. Williams never met the boy in person because they were just in touch by talking on the phone. However, Williams' former friend (a nice job from Bobby Cannavale) raises doubts about the boy, prompting Williams to hold a personal meeting with him. What follows has a permanent impact on Williams in a way that she does not expect. I'll let it go. Toni Collette also plays. I liked this movie, with Toni Collette offering a memorable portrait of Culkin's adoptive mother. Sandra Oh also played as a friend of Williams. Night listening is inspired by real events and has a grim and almost terrible silence. Sometimes it's predictable, not because of reviews I read before seeing the movie and logic, but I liked it anyway. I liked Williams in roles like this, more than his comic characters, so it was an extra bonus to me. Recommended. 8/10
