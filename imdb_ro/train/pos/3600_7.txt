At first glance, I expected this movie to be puzzled, because I thought the plot would be so excessively feminist. But I was wrong. As you can read in the previously published comments, I agree that the feminist part of this film does not bother. I never had the idea that the main character exaggerated her position as a woman. It's like Guzman is presented as someone with a backbone, in contrast to his colleagues. So I was surprised by the story, in fact, I thought it was good enough, except for the predictable ending. Perhaps it would have been a better idea to give the plot a radical overthrow, so the viewer was somewhat more surprised. In addition, I would like to say that Rodriguez has earned respect by the way she puts her character away. I can not explain why, but especially in the love scenes she convinced me. It just seemed real to me. I think I gave it 7 out of 10, just because of the last half hour.
