This movie was great ... it made me laugh, make a balm and especially talk about animals in it! this movie should be seen by all sorts of people! is one of my favorite movies, and I like it so much that I had to comment on it !!! rox! is so felt in the heart and a wonderful story that makes a wonderful and honest movie! my favorite character is the shadow. this is because I think he is the most exciting and charming. I used to have a gold retriever just like the shadow, I miss so much! he was my best friend and I knew when he died he would be in a happier place but I miss my heart !! this movie is the best I love and everyone needs! Love your pets no matter what they do, cherish them forever!
