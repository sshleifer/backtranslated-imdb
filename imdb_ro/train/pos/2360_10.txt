He felt very balanced in showing what Jehovah's Witnesses had done in protecting American freedoms. It also showed the strong faith of two families who witnessed the first generation. We also appreciated how he showed how becoming a Jehovah's Witness affects the members of the non-witness family and how difficult it is to accept that they do not celebrate the feast, the sad side is that non-witness families do not think of having families their witness for family meals / visits or give them gifts at any other time, but for holidays or birthdays. When it comes to healthcare, witnesses want and expect a high standard of medical care, which forgets people is that blood transfusions allow medical care and inappropriate surgery, while bloodless treatments make the medical team highly qualified and trained , what do you prefer to treat your loved ones? I highly recommend this video!
