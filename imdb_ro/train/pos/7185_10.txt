Seated on the porch of the Burbank house, Ted Mapes told me that he and Reed Hadley were wearing the same size in all garments except the hat. Ted, one of the biggest stunt men, said that every time Zorro put his mask, he was the one on the screen. It was an exaggeration: it was a time when Zorro was obviously Reed Hadley, but in stunts we could be pleased to be Ted at work. And what stunts! "The Zorro Battle Legion" is, as a testimony, the comments here, one of the biggest series. It is interesting and generally very well done. Reed Hadley was a good actor and, as someone else commented, he made a very good fop. But of course it is what makes this movie so great. And what else could we expect with the direction of this excellent team, Witney and English, with extraordinary music of the amazingly prolific William Lava says it was unbelievable, but this is incorrect, the other compounds that were listed here, and I do not know if they have written music - sounds like Lava) and malice from, among other things, the Great Charles King, and with dozens of bits of bit? Also worth mentioning was a negative character played by Tarzan, Jim Pierce, who was the son-in-law of Edgar Rice Burroughs. (I urge you to read his mini-bio). There is only one chapter that depressively slows down things, but, heck, it's just a few minutes (maybe 20) and when you get through it, you get back to excitement. Turner Classic films are a great thank you for presenting this excellent series and we should ask TCM to bring us more. <br /> <br /> And we should thank all those involved that we can see them as a chapter or serial, and not as a re-cut feature.
