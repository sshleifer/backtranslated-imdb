We rarely find an indie comedy that leaves a lasting impression. Cross Eyed is a rare jewel. The director of the screenwriter not only approached the challenge of directing his work, but also hilarious performance as a bad colleague. The script has an interesting look not only on the difficult situation of the writer who is struggling but it mixes so much comedy in the writer's wild world that you can only help hiring Ernie as a character. Very funny. Despite the small budget, Adam Jones manages to give the film a serious look. It does not spin when it comes to making a good movie. I can not wait to see what comes next. This guy can make people laugh and think; is special.
