Well, it's time. I have really given up on any hope that there will be a standout episode in the ranks this season. Although there were still too many to go into the hohum, at least this episode proved to be good. It is quite funny that director Rob Schmidt, who has only bad luck to return to his credit and writer John Esposito, whose only scripting tasks so far have included Tale Of The Mummy and Shift Graveyard should be those that to give us the best written and most thought-provoking episode of the season. In "The Right to Die" we are treated to the story of Cliff and Abbey. At the beginning of the episode the couple has a conversation. Abbey caught Cliff cheating and desperately trying to win it back. As they speak, they find themselves in a car accident where Cliff is left with scratches and bruises but Abbey is thrown out of the car and caught in the fire when a spark comes on and the gasoline that drops over them gets caught fire. And that's just the people who installed it. Once in the hospital, Cliff has to decide whether or not the monastery should live in this state without skin and only with nervous reflexes. There is also a side effect. Every time she returns, Abbey walks like a ghost and causes problems for all sorts of people. Hands down this is the best episode of the season and is certainly one of the top episodes. From the terrible effects to the stretched scenario, which has thrown in a few twists, I have never seen suspense so touchy that you can almost touch, The Right to Die should have the right to continue to live forever.
