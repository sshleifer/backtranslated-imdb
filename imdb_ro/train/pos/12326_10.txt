I first saw this movie at the Berlin Film Festival and I have never seen the Hong Kong cinema. I felt like in a roller coaster: the action was so fast and there was no tedious moment throughout the movie. It has martial arts, love, special effects and a fantastic plot. My favorite scene is when the Taoist drinks, plays and fights for himself - one of the most scenes that highlights the extraordinary musical component of the film. This movie is a must!
