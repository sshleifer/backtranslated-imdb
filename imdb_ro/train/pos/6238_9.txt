The uncompromised vision of a 21st Century Vienna suburb that mixes the stories of six groups of characters by the former U.Seidl documentary is a challenging, minimalist and intense piece of observation cinema. After the world-wide spread of Big Brother reality shows, Hundstage takes modern voyeurism to a profound and profound level. It is a hard-to-please, but unregulated, European cinematic art piece may seem cruel and frightening, but it succeeds in conveying the alienated nihilist sentiment of modern society in a way worthy of praise. A necessity for world cinema lovers.
