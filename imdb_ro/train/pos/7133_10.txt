The absolute masterpiece of a movie! Goodnight Mr.Tom has quickly become one of my favorite movies of all time. No one should miss watching this movie, it's just too good! Mr.Tom is perfectly portrayed by John Thaw as a tough old man who becomes a soft father when William Beech (Nick Robinson) is sent for evacuation, almost like the "city mouse and mouse of the country." A true heart movie. The director knew exactly how to turn the book into film and did so well. The film was shot so well that the emotions of the characters and what happened made the audience feel a range of emotions, from love to fear, and these emotions could turn into a six pence. Situated during a period of turbulence during the Second World War, this film also shows the difference between cities and the countryside, they are almost like different countries. An absolute must see, those who do not miss on a truly amazing and brilliant film.
