I absolutely LOVE this soap. It was one of my favorites. I recommend you very much :) ... I like Brazilian soaps, dealing with real life events. I'm really sad that the soap is over, but I'm sure I'll find it somewhere. For those who have not seen it, please see it. I liked the characters, the plot, and how things turned out to be bad for the wicked. The only thing I would have changed is the end for Xica and her long love of life. I can not wait to see it again and recommend it. Xica was by far the best soap I've ever seen. Forget everything else :) GO XICA .. I hope you like everything, too.
