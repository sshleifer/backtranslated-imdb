This film features artistic cinematic techniques in which, instead of a landscape that captures the camera's attention, there are small details of how someone appears, how a cocktail hat can be worn and wrapped in a sheet. How can a husband wear a hat and socks, footwear and underwear and both seem so completely comfortable and comfortable. How challenging a woman is, is another feature of the painting the director chooses to tell us that he is a sexually free spirit and aims to obtain the pleasure he seeks without flirting directly or with a certain sensitivity to what the man feels. The relationship between wife and husband is unique. It is an open one in which she has nothing back, she does not feel any special shame about the way she has behaved and wants to share these facts with him, because her primary focus is always on the fact of their marriage. Nothing and no one can come between the two. Only chances of success can intervene - his prison during the war and what follows after his return to the end. A very interesting film that is totally absorbed.
