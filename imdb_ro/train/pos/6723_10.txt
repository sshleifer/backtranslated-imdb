Riding Giants is an amazing movie. It really shows how these people lived then just to navigate. Their life was basically surfing, living, breathing and fun. Did not care about money, jobs, girls or whatever. For them the waves were their daughters. I've never been on a surfboard and looks so cool, do not understand how they can remain not make any sense. This is a great movie and if you like surfing, then you should really see this film. If you are a surfer and you want to find out who started sailing, how he came alive, who is really famous or what ever, then you should really see him. It could be a documentary, but it's very good. -Tara F.-
