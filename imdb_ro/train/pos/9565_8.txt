Dog Dog Bite will not be for everyone, but I really enjoyed it. It is full of kicks, stabbing and shooting (but do not worry, leadership is a terrible blow), it can best be described as violence through Hong Kong and Cambodia. Edison Cheng plays Pang, a Cambodian assassin in the city to kill a barrister. Despite being dirty from his trip, he almost immediately sat down at a huge table in the middle of an obviously expensive restaurant. If this seems unclear to you, you should probably avoid this movie. She played the role of Wai (Sam Lee), a young and evil policeman who likes to beat people around as much as she likes to smoke. Wai is on a fine line investigating Internal Affairs and his father, a legendary Bun Cop, is in a coma after a drug business going south (the implication is that Wai leaves his father to take him on rap for his own corrupt transactions). There is a car accident, a lot of killing and a weird and weird love story offered here, all played in close-up comic book style. I guess humor was deliberate (no one uses gargantuan concrete monkeys without an eye for absurd extravagance), although the nature above the peak has lost a number of members of my audience colleagues. There are at least three points where the movie might have ended and 109 minutes could have benefited from a more ruthless editing or deleting one of the narrative threads (things with a light heart worked well, so I would left out interactions with the three parents). Am I inclined to give her a (big) pass, though, if only because of the end? I have rarely heard that so many people laugh so much at what should have been a miraculous moment. This is one to see with a group of friends who love ridiculously
