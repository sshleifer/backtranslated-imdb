A fun kung fu movie featuring scenes of acting, plotting and fighting, cutting more than average. All the characters are nice characters and skilled martial artists. The actors of Alexander Fu-Sheng, the proto-Jackie Chan comedy, are fun to watch, and his austere companion presents particularly impressive skills. For me, the film is just a hard-to-use defect - sometimes things get a little confused, because the movie baskets and the changes between different subplots, and some of the characters are not as full as they might want. But a kung fu movie should be judged primarily in terms of quality of action, and the Shaolin Temple certainly offers that number. The film culminates in a great body battle that allows each character to demonstrate his skills against a worthy adversary. Generally, the Shaolin Temple is a nice low-budget kung fu movie. It's not up to the quality of a good Jet Li movie, but it's definitely worth watching the fans of the genre. My Rating: 8/10. Various notes: The Warner Home 1987, which I saw, was (predictably) badly called, and did not have full credits and teamwork.
