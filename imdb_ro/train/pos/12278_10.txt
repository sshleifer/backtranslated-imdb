Well, I told her all in summary, I feel the adoration of the film and the cast ... I would give each actor an Oscar ... a great, great movie ... now I'm 25 now and I saw it 4 times in different times and I always think I will not cry and I will always do, 2 or 3 times ...;) meryl s was absolutely brilliant, beasts of jeremy, also brilliant ... i want the movie received several awards ... I really do not know anyone who watched her and did not love her ... Also, glenn was almost fantastic. the story was beautiful and sad at the same time ... I liked the fact that, despite all the things clear and isban they loved so much and how blonde it was to the parents ...
