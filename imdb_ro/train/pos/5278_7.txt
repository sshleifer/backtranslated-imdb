What begins as a generational conflict in this film ends in understanding, solemnity and grace. The film passes through Europe with his father and young son crammed into a car over 3000 miles. Christians force lifestyle, beliefs and life skills to collide. He is not really a clear winner. Everything is eventually added as experience, experience of several layers of life. For those interested in understanding Islam, this film offers a generous and gentle perspective without being put on the agenda. It's an age story for the young son, his repellent and rebellious nature, who turns to open to get more ways of life.
