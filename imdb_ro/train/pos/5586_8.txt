Eve (Hedy Lamarr) has just married an older man, and in the honeymoon she realizes her husband does not want her. Her disappointment with marriage and deprivation of love makes Eve return home to her father on a farm, leaving her husband. One afternoon, as he bathes in a lake, the horse takes off his clothes, and a young worker recovers them and gives them back to Eva. They fall in love with each other and become lovers. Later, her husband misses her and tries to bring Eva home. Eve refuses, and wealth drives the trio in the same place, ending the business in a tragic way. I just watched "Extase" for the first time and my first comment is about the horrible VHS quality launched in Brazil by Brazilian video network distributor: the movie has only 75 minutes of operation and it seems that different film rolls. There are some damaged parts in total, and the other components very damaged. Therefore, the beauty of the images is not touched by the Brazilian spectator if he has the chance to find this VHS rarely in a rental or sales period. The film is basically a silent film, the story is very dated and has only a few lines. Consequently, the characters are poorly developed. However, this film is also very daring, with Hedy Lamarr's exquisite breasts and naked fat body for the current beauty standards. Another fantastic point is the poetics and metaphorics used by flowers, symbolizing the relationship between Eve and her boyfriend. The way the director directs the scenes to show Eva's needs and deprivation is very clear. The inconclusive end is also very unusual for a 1933 movie. I liked this movie, but I hope you will one day have the opportunity to see a restored 87-minute version. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "ÃŠxtase" ("Ecstasy")
