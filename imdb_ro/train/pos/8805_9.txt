A mosaic of about 911. The 11 stories from 11 directors in 11 countries are sometimes humorous, sometimes boring (for example, the first), sometimes they used to say to the Americans, "I had more deaths than you and you supported the killers," sometimes very strange (but very symbolic and interesting). I really liked Claude Lelouch (the personal life of a couple in New York, which shows that our everyday problems are inconsequential), Shoei Imamura (bizarre, powerful against the wars in general) and Idrissa Ouedraogo (funny, optimistic and Youssef Chahine (an Egyptian, pro-peace intellectual, having moral difficulties accepting the US policy towards the Arab countries). I'm very happy to see that many Americans liked this movie. This shows that we (or they, I am still Belgian, but live in Texas for 12 years) are still interested in other cultures and are able to question the past and present government's actions as they should in a democracy.
