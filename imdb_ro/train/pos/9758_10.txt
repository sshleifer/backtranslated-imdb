Personally, this is one of my favorites all the time! No, I'm not 10 .. I'm 30! I have my own original VHS, the original of what I bought from a rental shop. I have watched countless times .. while it's a funny movie for kids, it's an exciting movie for adults. I saw this movie once I was. I was not sober. my eyes opened to things I had never noticed before. I have seen that morale is strongly encouraged, both clearly and sublime. I would like to remember all the things I have noticed, but since then it has been a long time. be sure, there are ALL things that are alluded to throughout the movie. if you have the chance to see it ... not sober .. do this, you will not be disappointed .. in fact, you will probably feel rather happy and warm. <br /> <br /> Unique and wonderful!
