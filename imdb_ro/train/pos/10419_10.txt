I have to agree with MR. Caruso Jr Lanza was the best voice that the god offered if he could find the courage to leave because he gave up Hollywood and headed for the work that Caruso could have represented, it could have been, but in any case it is a fantastic introduction to art that does not contain bones about it and whether it is the way it will be. see the movie, you'll see why Mr. Lanza is still in discussion even in my house. Someone says Pavarotti say MARIO LANZA. It for the film itself when it will be on DVD it must have restored it and the VHS is not good enough, but this should also be the only Lanza movie put on Other DVDs are down badly boring right.
