Pierce Brosnan's newest, but no longer James Bond, is an assassin. He is very good at what he does, but he gets old and tired. Greg Kinnair is very good as the straight and narrow businessman. Now, when the story opens the movie, these two people are in separate life. Then one night they have drinks in a bar and they start talking. Then, suddenly, you find these two people somehow attracted during a series of events. The story is excellent, the actor is top, and the humor is hilarious. I never thought Pierce Brosnan would be so funny, but he really is, and I must say, this movie is something you have to see.
