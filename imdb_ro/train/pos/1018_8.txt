The movie was sub-par, but this TV pilot offers a great launch pad into what became a Sci-Fi Ideal fan program. The actors also deliver the special effects (for a series of television) are spectacular. Having an interesting smart script does not last any. <br /> <br /> Stargate SG1 is currently one of my favorite programs.
