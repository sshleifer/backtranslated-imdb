The Sarah Silverman program is very similar to Sarah's; It is so high with prejudices that you can not take it in your heart. The fact is, however, that while most people will "get", it does not mean that everyone will appreciate it. It's a very polarizing and dimensional show, so if you do not like it after 10 minutes, you can give up there. If you like this after 10 minutes, stay at your disposal, because each episode was as good as the last one. However, like all shows, it is not perfect. I personally like the program, but there are some huge mistakes with it. The racist songs are fun, but they get older much faster than Silverman seems to realize - a problem I had with "Jesus is Magic." It seems that Silverman has given a song quota for the episode, which does not have to exist. Not to mention that while the songs of the songs they write are good, music is not. Another thing to keep in mind is that while this show will attract fans for some reason from Monty Python, the Christian Christian Brigade, etc., is nothing like these shows. I can watch Monty Python all day, but as much as I like this show, I can not look more than the half-hour limit at a time. It's getting very fast. The repetitive value for this show is too low - the second time around an episode is quite amusing, and the third time, in my opinion, is boring. However, for the first time around, it is very, very funny. Try.
