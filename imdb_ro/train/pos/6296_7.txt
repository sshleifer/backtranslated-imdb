Parker (Johnathan Schaech) is an aspiring writer who is still looking for a great break. Meanwhile, he works as a telephone counselor for a manhattan phone line. One day, unfortunately, his block of flats burns. Parker and his cat make it alive, but are now stuck with the difficult task of finding affordable housing in Big Apple. The word comes from Parker that a lady, Samantha (Alison Eastwood) is looking for a roommate, but will only accept a homosexual man. Since Parker is right, but the price is right, he decides to claim he's gay. Samantha likes him from the very beginning and greets him as his new co-owner. But, poor Parker. Sam is wonderful, smart and very desirable. How will he be able to control his true nature? In addition, Sam does not have a successful business friend anyway? This is a sweet, pleasant and humorous film with two very attractive stars in Eastwood and Schaech. Of course, the plot is a series of scenes, "how can I keep up this step," and Sam asks Parker for shampoo while walking or praying to keep her in bed when she gets bad news. It is also necessary for Parker to produce his own "fake" homosexual partner, Boris, when Sam insists on settling him with a man he knows. We hope that the homosexual community will not find too offensive because this spectator believed that most of the problems were treated with sensitivity and subtlety. For a small film, the costumes, sets and work on the camera were pretty nice. Therefore, if you love these funny love stories, take it soon. You will love what you see, I know.
