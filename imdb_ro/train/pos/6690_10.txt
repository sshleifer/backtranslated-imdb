Mystery Men is one of those movies that are becoming funnier over time. There is naive and funny innocence to the characters. It has become part of our family's "culture" and often quotes the characters. It's my favorite movie in the past two years. My children are 13 and 11 and we both love this movie. Great action and comedy. We love Galaxy Quest and Monty Python. Okay, we're not talking intellectual here, just the family bond!
