I was bored one evening and Eye Red was thinking about why not. Red Eye is one of the best movies for a long time. I mean, I just got into the movie was so brilliant. The story is new and different. The film also has two great stars in the film with Rachel McAdams as Lisa Reisert and Cillian Murphy as Jackson Rippner. The act is just brilliant and you feel for the people in the movie. Music is just great, it gives you chills and it can also make you feel relaxed. I really like how the movie was so well done and does not get bored. The red eye is just phenomenal. Nothing more and nothing less. It's an excellent thriller. Generally, I enjoy my red eyes so much that I can always watch it. <br /> <If you like Red Eye, then I recommend you Elektra and Cry Wolf. Give Red Eye 9 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Great movie
