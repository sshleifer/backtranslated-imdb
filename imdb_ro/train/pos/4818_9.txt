I always have a little mistrust before watching the British movies of the epoch, because they usually find insidious and boring scenarios (such as Vanity Fair or The Other Boleyn Girl) but with a magnificent production design , landscapes and thick British accents that make movies suggest artistic value that they do not have. Fortunately, the excellent movie The Young Victoria does not fit into this situation and deserves an enthusiastic recommendation due to its fascinating storyline, Emily Blunt, Paul Bettany and Jim Broadbent, as well as costumes and locations that unexpectedly make the film quite rich at sight. And I say "unexpectedly," because I usually do not pay too much attention to these details. <br /> The "Victorian Age" was (in my humble opinion) one of the key points in contemporary civilization, not only in terms of social, but also scientific, artistic and cultural. I did not really know the origins of that era, and maybe that's why I enjoyed this simplification of the political and economic events that have prepared so much for the landing of the modern era. I also liked the way Queen Victoria is a portrait, a young and intelligent monarch whose decisions were not always good, but they were at least inspired by good intentions. I also discovered that the image of romance between Victoria and Prince Albert is very interesting, because she is equally interested in the combination of intelligentsia and the emotions she evokes. The only failure I've found in this movie is that writer Julian Fellowes has used some clips of romantic cinema about the love story, something that feels a bit out of his script. /> <br /> I really liked The Young Victoria a lot and I even took a very pleasant surprise with her. I hope that more vintage movies follow the example of this film: costumes and landscapes should function as an interesting story, not as a replacement.
