Perfect for a few people's drama. Simon is dead, but somehow it's coming from outside. What he saw there is displayed as empty spots orchestrated at a magnificent score by the avant-garde German composer Werner Henze. Simon is haunted by his death, comforted by the support of death he had seen on the other side. His girlfriend tries to keep him alive but fails, he decides to follow him after his death in the end. Very moving and moving, profoundly psychological, but slow and somewhat boring.
