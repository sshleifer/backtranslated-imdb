This film contains one of Richard Dreyfuss's greatest performances as an actor who plays a dictator and makes it so convincing that his own mother does not detect the impostor. Also, this movie is funny, but it also has a serious part. What is particularly interesting about this film is Madonna, who is the mistress of the dictator, but ultimately becomes the country's leader. Evolution of Madonna from the mistress to the political leader has greatly contributed to the quality of the story and to the entertainment value of the film. And the main character, who at the beginning of the film is a fighter actor and somewhat buffoon, evolves and at the end of the film he respects the commands. I liked this movie.
