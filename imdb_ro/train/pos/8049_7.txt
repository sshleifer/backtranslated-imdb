Generally, I had to say I liked the movie. Some battle scenes are very good. Especially the fight against Leung Ka-Yan. One point that really bothered me was that they used an Asian to play a black. I really want to say. Discuss the wrong taste. During a battle scene, you see one of the fighters on the floor laughs. Otherwise, Sammo's copying Bruce Lee's fighting moves perfectly. 5 out of 10 Stars.
