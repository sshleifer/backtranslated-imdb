Scanners II: The New Order is as good as David Cronenberg's classic scanners, Scanners were made in 1980 and Scanner II in 1991, so they are an 11-year gap between the two films. The film captures the style of the scanners, which is a good thing, they would not be scanners without a head burst, so Scanner II has a head burst scene that is just scary as the first. Scanners II: The New Order have other imaginative scenes that are doing well. Scenario for Scanner II: The new Order is a new takeover of the series, as scanners are used as a vigilant force for a police chief and a group of scientists until a young Scanner named David Kellum discovers that it is used and decided to take revenge. Scanners II: The New Order is an extraordinary sequel to David Cronenberg's classic sci-fi scanners and must be seen. Check this. 10/10
