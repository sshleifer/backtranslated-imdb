Well, the movie is not even "funny". Okay, I admit, there are some HUMOROUS lines, but surely nothing is funny-out-funny. For example: Just before a sexual scene between Eleniak and one of his male cost, sh is handcuffed to bed and can not remove his shirt. Before leaving the room to pick up the key, he says, "Okay, do not go anywhere." See, humorous but not funny. but Erika Eleniak surely raffled the goal. She is hot and sexy and there is a really steady scene with her that can not help but rewind and re-watch. There are also some other very sexy scenes with her and she has some very challenging lines. <br /> <br /> In general, 5 stars. I would only give him three if not for Erika Eleniak.
