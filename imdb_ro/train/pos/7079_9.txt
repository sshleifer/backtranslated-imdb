I really enjoyed this - I'm a big fan of movies that mess with you and leave you with many questions and ideas for debate and that was a stellar example. But then, Terry Gilliam is always good at this (well, almost always. Let's just forget about Jabberwocky and Brothers Grimm, right?). I enjoyed the way she managed the theme of travel in time and avoiding paradoxes - the way in which past and future events were interwoven and joined each other. It was also very well done aesthetically - the art direction was really wonderful and I wish I could see on the big screen. Future scenes had a similar similarity to Brazil in many ways, and even current scenes were often truly convincing visuals. But perhaps the most striking thing was that it included two actors who do not like it too much, Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt, and both have played stunning performances here. Pitt in particular - I saw one or two movies before that, making me realize that she could actually act (contrary to what I originally thought), but that really overcame them. In fact, I woke up asking my friends at a time: "Are you sure it's Brad Pitt?" This is probably the most memorable show of his career (though, of course, I may not say too much).
