A friend borrowed this DVD, which I received from the director at a festival, I think. I have been warned that some of the technical aspects of the movie were a bit weird and that the writing was good, but not great. So maybe that's the color of my judgment, but I have to admit I liked this movie. News in which actors. Youssef Kerkor was very good as Ernie, the main character, kind of pathetic in a pleasant way. Adam Jones (who also directed) and Justin Lane were excellent as roommates who lead Ernie Crazy. The character Bill (Justin Lane), who spends much of the movie dressed like a panda, was by far my favorite; he seemed at least one-dimensional and reminded me of an old college roommate, so I called the guy after watching the DVD. Really kind of adorable, and very funny. Some of the other actors were good, some were so, but none were bad. I loved a very vigilant duo. Ridiculous and funny. Give me a big note, even if it has some problems, because you can tell when you look at the fact that these people care and they decide to make their own film. Well done to Adam Jones and the crew.
