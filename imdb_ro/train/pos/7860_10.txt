I have never seen a silent film until July 24, 2005. I have never seen a movie with Mary Pickford in it. I've seen thousands of movies. Very few are hypnotic to me. We have discovered that the Last of the Unforgettable Mohicans (Ray Liotta) is hypnotic, so consider the source while reading this. I started watching Tess from Storm Country on TCM just to see who Mary Pickford was, who was credited by many for Hollywood release. I had no idea what I was doing. Two hours later, I came out of her and I realized that I saw one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen, playing a perfect role for her. Imagine a fan of cinema in 1922, who has never seen anyone so gorgeous and expressive. You should see it again and again. The setting was perfect for a girl with expressiveness. He was a poor squatter, he could not speak English to the King, but he had to admire it. What movie ... time to start my Mary Pickford movie collection!
