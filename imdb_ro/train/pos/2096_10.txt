With the advent of IMDb, this film overlooked can now find an interested audience. Why? Because users here, who are searching for the two-time Academy Award winner Glenda Jackson, can find "Soldier Return" among his credits. So can those who check out Oscar winner Julie Christie. Ann-Margret's fans can give the title a click, just like those looking for great career Alan Bates. Not to mention the added bonus of a movie with the support of Ian Holm and Frank Finlay. Any movie with so many notable in it is rewarded by IMDb, given all the cross-references that take place here. So why is not this movie on DVD? Manufacturers do not realize that the Internet Database is a marketing gift for such a movie? And "The Return of the Soldier" is certainly a jewel waiting to be discovered. Come with him, people.
