As a Western who pursues another culture and a tradition of marriage, I found married married fascinating and delightful. The idea of ​​marrying a stranger through the mutual arrangement of parents is difficult, especially in this modern age. However, this is the case in this Hindi film. He said with humor and new insight, we learn about Abhay and Ritika, who met only once and are now in the traditional five-day honeymoon. As has been said, it is hard to believe in this age-rich mobile phone that such an archaic custom as a arranged marriage still takes place. We see the left hand that this young couple feels when they meet on their first night and how they try to make a connection, even if they do not know each other. We see different opinions about marriage and commitment, as they were presented by other couples and on holiday, from forty years married to others still uncertain about making marital engagement. There are songs, amazing dialogue, poisonous moments, mixing and comparing new paths and traditions. Watching the movie with subtitles surely loses some of the fairness of the story, but it is still a pleasure to look. Granted part of the plot is a bit trick and bus incident a bit drawn and contrived; however, the movie is worth watching.
