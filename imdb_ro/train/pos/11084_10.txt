<br /> <br /> I saw The Glacier Fox in the theater when I was nine years old - I bugged my parents to take me back three times. I started looking for the film five years ago, eventually discovering a copy on an online auction site, but I would love to see it either being taken over by a new distributor and resumed (I understand the original version was small) have the rights acquired by Channel Family, Disney, etc. and are displayed on a regular basis. It is a fascinating film that draws you to the story of the struggle of a fox family in northern Japan, narrated by a wise old tree. The excellent soundtrack compliments the film well. He would be a good seller today, better than many of the poor offers of today's children's films.
