Eventually he came to see this classic movie on an unofficially recorded disc from an old VHS, is a classic horror piece. It's a lot more sin in this corner of neglected horror in terms of official DVD and VHS broadcasts ... TV horror movie. Recommended for all TV 70 fans, just like the terror trilogy. Those interested should get the book on this subject by David Deal - Fright Films Television in the 1970s. Send me an email for a chance to see it ..... fabulous to see it again. There are problems that many TV movies have to be rather inventive in the effects department and even at 70 minutes may seem to be pulled, eventually we are all accustomed to more modern editing, but still wonderful things and much better than many anger theatrical releases launched today.
