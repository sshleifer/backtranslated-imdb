I saw his movie in Dallas, Texas, when he went out in 1986. I remember giving them awards to see to see the movie. After seeing the movie, I can see why. The movie was not bad, it was not great. The problem with this movie was that she tried to tell a side story. They created a new story, new characters and tried to wrap it around the Saget Masters. My biggest complaint is that this plot is about a second wave of Robotech Masters attacking the Earth. They even used the same scenes in Master Saga, but with a different dialogue. Like a child, I liked the movie. But, unfortunately, I did not see her as an adult and I can not give a better review. Looking back, I was disappointed, but now I'd love to see the movie and re-evaluate my position. Having said that, will someone please release the film for the whole world to judge? I love Robotech and can not wait for the Chronicles of Shadows.
