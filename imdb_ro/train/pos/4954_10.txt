A great, funny, sweet film with Morgan Freeman (who plays himself) and meets a Spanish girl called Scarlet (Paz Vega) in a small shop while studying an independent film. I was a little bit dubious about the movie in the first ten minutes, but as soon as it was in the store, I started enjoying the movie. It shows how a positive attitude can change anything. It does not contain any complex plots and is easy to follow, but it will raise the saddest state of mind and make you smile to the end without the need for little romance of clich√©. It includes several scenes that make you dress your faces with laughter. A very rare masterpiece!
