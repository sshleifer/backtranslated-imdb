I thought Mukhsin was wonderful writing. Not just about entertainment. There are tons of subtle messages that Yasmin tries to bring. And yes, it could be confusing for some of you (especially if you have not looked at Sepet and / or Gubra 76 times). I bet you noticed how I use characters from the two movies right before? It's really ironic how the characters connect. As the chief neighbor is the prostitute in Gubra. And the chicken from the snooker board turns out to be religious and the pious man's wife in the future. <br /> <br /> And I absolutely love the voice-overs. It's cruel but still fresh. Just like when they shot a score on the scoreboard, Rumah Tumpangan Gamin, suddenly, Mukhsin's voice said "Bismillahhirrahmannirrahim .." (the scene when he climbed the tree). He captured the Malaysian attitude (and in a slight way, the defeat of how pathetic it is) portrayed in character. For example, even children can be really sharpened in the form of tangles (complete with loud voice) and simply dumb mouth all the long film. And how can you be so loud and talk about PPL when your own life is not solved. <br /> <br /> All I can say is that this movie has fully met my expectations if I have not overcome it. <br /> <br /> I stuck on the screen, I could not even take my eyes off her. I can not even figure it out in the cinema. Ha ha.
