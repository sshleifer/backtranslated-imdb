This movie has an excellent acting, a great photo, and a very strong story line that makes you think about who you are, how you define yourself, how you fit it, if you accept to play a part or break up ... There are already comments excellent on these issues. I want to comment on the formal establishment of the film. Basically, there are two people on a roof. There is space and time unit with 2 protagonists, and the radio acts as a choir. Many directors have transformed the Greek tragedies into the film, many directors have shot contemporary stories as if they were a Greek tragedy, but no director, in my opinion, has succeeded as equally admirable as Ettore Scola approaching the purity and power of the great Greek tragedies in the story line and in the formal format. A masterpiece.
