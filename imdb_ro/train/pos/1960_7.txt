This is about one year after the events in "Basic Instinct". Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) is now in London. While doing sex with a soccer player as you accelerate into a car that goes to 110 miles / hour (do not ask), she goes off the road and finishes on the Thames. Survive - no. Police are hiring psychiatrist Michael Glass (David Morrissey) to see if he has psychic competence in court. Of course, she starts to play with the mind instead and a lot of crimes and sex follow. This movie was convicted before it was even opened. He took forever to get a cast and a director, scenario issues were constant and distribution was not happy (Morrissey often complained about the film). It's not too bad yet. It's very similar to the first - it's a score of lush music, beautiful locations, plenty of sex and nudity (this had to be edited for an R), a nice complicated plot and good action - but it has no impact . It feels like a retreat of the first one. People are killed here with a sock paddle (I think) ... just as people were killed by an ice in the first. At a nice moment, Stone takes an ice and looks at her loudly. He also plays mental games with a man and may be involved in murder. The similarities are too obvious. It is also very reliable - there is a lot of explicit sexual discussion, male nudity (Morrissey looks much better nude than Michael Douglas), female nudity (Stone still looks great) and some bloody crimes. The act is good everywhere. The stone is fantastic here; Morrissey looks miserable, but it's OK; Charlotte Rampling and David Thewlis are good at supporting roles. So this is not bad at all, but it feels like a remake of the first one. I still recommend it. People just attacked this because Stone did not like it and thought it was stupid to make a follow-up to "Basic ..." 14 years after it was done.
