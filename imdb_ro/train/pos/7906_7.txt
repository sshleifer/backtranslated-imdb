Gus Van Sant has made some excellent films. I'm really a fan. However, I can not help thinking that Tom Robbins's brain edge "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues" is lost in the big screen translation. Alone, Tom Robbins and Gus Van Sant are incredible visions and talent towers. Finally, although this did not work. <br /> <br /> It was not the fact that the characters were not well developed or the plot and content did not come alive. It's just that our imagination is much stronger when we read a book like this. We are taken at another time and in a different place, and sometimes we think the worst and / or the best and add to the general roller coaster of the book as it is easily carried out according to the author's precision . Movies can still leave someone with less imagination and emotion with a roller coaster to reduce their overall experience. That's what I think happened here. We suggest reading the book!
