I do not remember when I first heard about this movie, but I rented it six years ago and still remains one of my favorite comedies. I will admit that you will probably despise this movie if you know nothing about rap music. But if you're a fan of rap, even a casual one, you'll enjoy the jokes and references inside. One of the best lines in the film is about the difference between a b **** and a h **; I'm still using this line today and I have lots of laughs with her. One of the best shows comes from Larry Scott, who starred Lamar in "The Damn Revenge". It is regrettable that this movie will never have a DVD release.
