The gentle, dramatically speaking drama from Steven Spielberg was his first real venture in this genre. A departure from his normal adventure / fantasy adventure opened the way for his 1993 success, Schindler's List. Based on Alice Walder's winning novel, Pulitzer's award, the story relates to a marriage arranged by a young woman for a brutal and angry farmer and the painful separation of her younger sister, beloved, Nettie. While the plot - about compassion, abuse, and power of love to heal all wounds - is often powerful and moving, it loses its way through the continuity and scandal scenario of Menno Meyjes. "Purple Color" is sometimes hard to track and, on one or more occasions, tends to be a little irregular in terms of time. This range of scriptures has cost the viewer the depth and detail presently in Mrs. Walker's novel. A real shame that Master Spielberg has failed to recover and remedy these problems because most of the show is a wonderful example of his acting as a director. Performances are strong throughout the year, with Whoopi Goldberg debuting - which she never answered in terms of acting - that the Celie tearing heart who just wants to be loved. Danny Glover gives solid support, although "Moses" was his top turn in "Places in Heart". The remarkable picture comes from Oprah Winfrey, undefined, as Miss Sophia, the black woman, a single fighter, whose spirit is crushed by a terrible incident involving a superior white woman, patron. Good support also from Margaret Avery, Adolph Caesar and Rae Dawn Chong. Quincy Jones (co-producer with Spielberg, Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall) wrote a superb melodic score and offered some original occasion blouses. Michael Kahn's editing sounds as always, while picture director Allen Daviau shows the ability to capture some glorious southern landscapes. This true business of heart will surely bring a tear to the eye, it is just unhappy we are left with so many unanswered questions. January 15, 1997 - Video
