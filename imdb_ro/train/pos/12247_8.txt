I really loved this version of Emma the best. Kate Beckinsale was great as Emma and the strong brand was very good as a knight. the only complaint I had was Mr. Woodhouse ... I can not believe a man could complain so much or be so selfish with his daughter's life ... she was a smart girl in her the latter, however. as always, I like the places where these Jane Austin movies were shot. settings are so spectral. makes me want to visit England as much as Ireland and Scotland.) I think the actors chosen for this movie were a good choice, and all the other story lines interfere with Emma with the best! I'm glad I saw that too.
