This is one of those movies I've seen so many times that I can quote the majority. Some of the lines in this movie are just unbeatable. I really like to see him stumble and fall while drinking, going to the drunken fancy restaurant and the moose. I do not know how many times I've seen this sequence, but it's funny every time. From the moment Arthur gets to Susan's daddy's place with a moose, you're laughing pretty much all the time. I remember looking at the extraordinary moments about the lump. He descended as I imagined it would be. Everyone laughed so much that it was hard for them to shoot him. Sir John Gielgud was a great addition to this. His conduct, his warmth, and the way he handled Arthur were equally hilarious. It is always a funny moment when he swallows his head with his hat or tells him that he is a little hurt ____. I laugh every time I listen to "I'll have a bath" and the lines that follow.
