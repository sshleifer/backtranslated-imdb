The Dawn Shooting is truly a landmark in television as a form of art. Everything seems to pay tribute to Amelie and Tim Burton, but what, in a world where fresh ideas are extremely rare, this show will guarantee that you do not care whether it's fresh or not. It's just Brilliant. I was captivated from the beginning, intelligent writing, Direction on the backgrounds and dialogue make it look like the most incredible masterpiece from The Shield and The Wire (no good comparisons, but the beauty of Pushing beads is that it has no comparisons on TV) . Really addictive and absolute pleasure. Perhaps one of the pieces on the chest that are mentioned in such tantalizing ways.
