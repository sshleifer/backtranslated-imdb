Let's start by saying that the English title of this film, "The Power of Kangwon Province", is absolutely flawed. This is because in Hong Sang Soo's film there are no real shots of wars, problems, and conflicts. a province is neither right nor true in the context of this film. If we judge this Korean-language film, "Kangwon-ho ho" will appear as a cryptic statement about the emotional disturbances of his young protagonists, the minds are not at rest. Hong Sang Soo also directed a very prolific visual document on erratic choices made by people in their lives. The people concerned are a couple of young women who are always in the process of exhibiting their moods, whims and fancies. If he makes a film of nothing, it can be claimed as the meritorious virtue of the filmmaker, then Hong Sang Soo has to be hailed as a brave film producer, whose films talk about the omnipresent volume of human relationships, feelings and life. If she likes it or not, this is the only correct conclusion deduced from this film.
