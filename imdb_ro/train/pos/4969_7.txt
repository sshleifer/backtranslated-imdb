It is wonderful to see that Shane Meadows already has an international influence - LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDANT shares many themes with A ROOM FOR ROMEO BRASS: the vague identity of the class above the work, but far below the middle, the unspoken father, abandoned urban environment, failure, fascism barely hidden, underlying the modern urban life. <br /> <br /> But if Meadows is an expert formalist, Mariage takes care of the images, and his superficial, gorgeous, gorgeous, monochrome cadres serve to distract the dirty, rather gloomy subjects that, from the farce to the to the tragedy in a few seconds. <br /> <br /> There are longueurs and clich√©s, but Poelvoorde is upset, a man accustomed to ordinary ambitions, whose attempts to achieve them are dangerous; while individual sets - popcorn / pidgeon explosions; the best marriage sequence, since DEBIUL CHARGED - manages to pull the epiphany out of despair.
