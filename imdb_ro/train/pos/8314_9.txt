The film was actually a romantic drama based on three sisters who wanted to become a famous group of girls. In their attempts, the oldest sister encounters a drug dealer and a street called Satin that the sister takes because he thinks it is "the great time" that will give him everything he thought he wanted from life. Though she might be accused of killing her, she just kills her spirit and will to live, after which she becomes addicted to the drug and eventually dies because of an overdose. The story does not refer to street life or the Italian gang that tries to buy Stix, then threatens it, it's about how love can overcome even the worst tragedies in life, presented in songs and style, and the character that was the life in times of young women who are trying to be "discovered" then.
