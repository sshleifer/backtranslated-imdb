Rosenstrasse is an attractive story of courage in adversity. The Reichdech women found that their Jewish husbands were blocked waiting for deportation. An aristocrat renegade to her family, Lena Fischer, finds itself among the crowd just like the general Gudarian sister. But rank and privilege do not deserve special attention. <br /> <br /> Neither the Reich's service as a female prisoner whose husband is on Ostfront will learn. In one of the worst scenes of the movie, the guards take the wedding band given by her soldier. <br /> <br /> Do not think that this is the typical new German abrusion in America today have Lady Bush, ordering the ordering gold medal arrest Mothers Star (US mothers service members killed in action ), because their presence is offencive. Little, unfortunately, has changed in 60 years since Der Fuher Der confused the world. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the eight-year-old girl Ruth gets rid of capture. <br /> <br /> Waiting in the cold on Rosenstrasse Lena Fischer is initially reluctant to get Ruth responding in a way that we usually take in German. Even Fisher Lena's brother Colonel Arthur von Eschenbach, who is conscious of and opposite Holocost, warns Lena against her. but Lena chose to embrace the idea with an American frontier even renaming Ruth, the more arian Helga name sounding Lehmann <br /> <br /> The siege ends favorably on Rosenstrasse but Lena derives: What happened to Ruth after the war? A few years later, Ruth's daughter, Hannah, is looking for her mother's past and meets Lena, aged 90, under the guise of a personal history of the war. I found it interesting that Hannah wanted so much for the family, but she never checked the fate of her grandfather, who was last known to have served Ostfront.
