This film, while it seems to be based on a 1951 film with the same title released by MGM and Janet Leigh, is still a great movie. Danny Glover, in one of his best performances, brings George Knox, a baseball manager with a short temper to life. As for the addition of Christopher Lloyd (his stage experience and performances in his performances, a wonderful actor), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (the third rock from the sun), Brenda Fricker (a charming and Tony Danza (even he is good at this film), Matthew McConaughey (he stole the show in Dazed and Confused, and his role may not be as important in this film but he was exposed) Adrien Brody (what I said about Matthew McConaughey is the same for Adrien, except for Dazed and Confused), some great actors such as Taylor Negron (David), Tony Longo (Messmer), Jay O. Sanders (Ranch Wilder), Neal McDonough (Whitt Bass) and a veteran man of his final performances, Ben Johnson (Hank Murphy, the owner of California Angels), and the rest of the cast does a great job, plus a great story that rises up to somebody pretty much, I do not care what shelter you're depressed, he liked it it's like a kid, and it brings memories when I watch it today. I need this on DVD. I recommend any parent looking for something that her children did not see, and everyone else, for that.
