Man On Fire tells the story of a former type of drinking problem who accepts a job as a personal guard of a girl in Mexico during the wave of kidnappings for redemption. At first it is not friendly, but then friends with each other, decides not to drink, etc. etc ... then one day she is kidnapped ... and killed ... HE, she will not stop at anything to get revenge. This is, in principle, the story of Man On Fire, but wait a few twists at least a few times, including the end that is beautiful and probably will make you cry. That's because of the wonderful Harry-Gregson Williams music with Lisa Gerrard (Gladiator). But the strongest part of the movie ... wait ... things are, everything is perfect. First action. Denzel Washington is the best, Mickey Rourke and Christopher Walken, as always, great Radtha Mitchell and young Dakota Fanning. And that's not the end of the list ... Then comes the cinema that is dazzling and alongside the superb editing, it should definitely have won an Oscar. The story is ... not just a revenge movie. The story is smart, the story makes you believe ... and it's just beautiful. Really. This is one of those movies you have to see during your life, at least once!
