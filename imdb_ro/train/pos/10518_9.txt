Wrapped in splendid English countryside backgrounds, Emma is a delicious outfit to be enjoyed for vague escapes. Emma (Gwyneth Paltrow) is a clever and intelligent woman who has just married her governor - and confidently - to a marriage that Emma takes in confession credit. Desiring to use her talent for arranging things for her, she decides to match Vicar Elton (Alan Cummings) with her beautiful girlfriend, Harriet (Toni Collette). The result is a series of mixed signals and misinterpretations that end up breaking apart, Emma learning that she has no control over events as she thought. The film is full of Jane Austen's spirit-rich spirit of complex characterization. Gwyneth Paltrow is the best of them, portraying this girl of a firm and polite society, with spirit and ease. Her growing storyline with Mr. Knightley (Jeremy Northam) is the heart of this film. Mr. Knightley is one of the biggest Romanian men in the movies. He is incredibly beautiful, in a modest, relaxed way that is irresistible. It is certainly suitable for Gwyneth Paltrow. Their charming friendship, which began when she was 16 years old and a child, blossomed when he, a family friend, fits smartly with her in an old-fashioned way that grows a little more. With a frightening look or an undervalued punch at Emma, ​​Northam's Knightley is a pleasure to look. Other wonderful characters include comedy Juliette Stevenson, Greta Scacchi, Ewan McGregor, Polly Walker, and Talking Spinster, Miss Bates, which is very funny. Apparently shorter and more fluid than most adaptations of Jane Austin, Emma has a comic rhythm that promises real joy.
