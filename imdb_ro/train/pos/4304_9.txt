I remember seeing this movie when I was 7 years old; and when she shocked me. I've seen a violent movie before, but I've never seen a movie about the consequences and reality of violence. This film not only shows this, but also shows how people can change their lives and choose happiness. What made this film and the accident did not succeed was to be true. Crash tried to show how racism was bad (and Crash actually had an anti-Asian bias incorporated) and come to a superior moral position. The Grand Canyon came to things from such a brutal and real perspective that it actually reached a higher terrain than the accident. Especially when you compare the terminations. The end of the accident is this end that is supposed to be the best and that connects everything. While the Grand Canyon simply ends in a quiet note, where you know nothing, much will change in the life of the character, but that's because life goes on, there is no proper purpose. No matter how good ... you're bad. There is no end of a chapter to start another.
