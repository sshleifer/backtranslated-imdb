I thought Hugh O'Conor was amazing as the young Christy Brown, and he really deserved a greater recognition of his role. I could not believe how well he played. Of course, Daniel Day-Lewis was also brilliant. My favorite scene is when the boys play soccer and Christy uses his head to stop the gaps and then punish it! Amazing performances by the two Christys (and others, too).
