This movie has a special way to tell the story, at first I found it quite strange as it jumped in time and I had no idea what was going on. Anyway, the story line was simple, but still very real and touching. You met someone first, you fell in love completely, but you eventually broke up and promoted a deadly agony. Who did not go through this? but we will never forget this kind of pain in our lives. <br /> <br /> I would say that I'm rather touched because two actors have shown excellent performance in showing the love of the characters. I just want the story to be a happy ending.
