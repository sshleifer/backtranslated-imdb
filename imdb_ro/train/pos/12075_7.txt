Nina Foch insists that "My Name is Julia Ross" in this 1945 noir movie, with Dame May Witty and George Macready. It's short, and because it is, the movie suffers. It may have been fifteen minutes to half an hour longer. When I was grown up, Foch was a television, playing a neurotic woman, wife with a deceiving husband, nervous wreck. He became one of the greatest professors in Los Angeles. Here, she is an ingenious young man who plays the lead role. Julia responds to an ad for a secretary and is immediately employed by Mrs. Hughes and her son, Ralph. We know a little - even if we learn immediately - that the hiring agent is a front, ready to get only the right woman for this mission, a woman without a family and no friend. - in the situation; when Julia gets into the house, she's drugged, and when she wakes up she tells her she's Mrs. Hughes and she's not allowed to leave. The actor is very good. A small but fun budget - some things, especially at the end, happen too fast, which is why I said the movie is too short. However, I recommend it.
