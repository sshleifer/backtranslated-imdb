Dude, I liked this movie! That takes me back when I was a kid. These were the days when the teachers still showed classical movies on the coil, and even if you were good, it would have resumed the movie slowly, so you can watch to play back. I still remember one of the opening lines ... "Tutazema was his name and was an orphan and lived with his sister so in the village." This is a wonderful movie for children and as durable as the red balloon. Eventually, the other Indian boys in the village attract feathers to Tutazema and he becomes an eagle himself. He gets to live the way he always wanted. He grows up the heavens.
