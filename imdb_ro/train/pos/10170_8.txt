In contrast to the opinions of the other reviews, this movie was, in fact, surprisingly good! I kept on seeing myself, and I was expecting to get bored with clich√©s, jokes, and obvious noises, all that the trailer had promised. However, after 5 minutes, I really woke up laughing and I enjoyed the reviving action. With only one toilet humor, the body over her dead body manages to come up with fun realistic scenarios and, without too much damage, some of the moments involving animals are hilarious. of a good movie are all there; script, director and actors and compared some recent recent romantic comedy attempts, this film is high. Sure, you will not learn anything or you have no spiritual awakening, but if you go with open your mind you will probably have a good time!
