I was impressed by the beautiful photograph of this movie, which was shot on the Alaska site. Although technically a melodrama, we see a lot of activities involving eschimics, such as hunting, dancing, igloo construction etc. And their habits, such as offering their wives to visitors, are usually in the story. Hunting sequences were sometimes stocked, with some of the animal's back projection scenes easily recognizable, but they were fascinating. Salmon fishing, hunting, caribou, and even a polar bear and a whale have sometimes made it look like a documentary. There was no express list that reinforced the documentary flavor. Movie makers have tried to make it very authentic, and locals speak only in an eschimo-translated language either by someone on screen or by interlining. The introduction said that besides white traders and royal Canadian police, there were no actors in the film, but that was not strictly true. The two main characters, played by Mala and Lotus Long, have been Eskimo since birth but were professional actors with credits for previous films, and you've sometimes seen makeup. But they were excellent in their roles and continued to have a Hollywood career. Overall, the movie is worth watching.
