"Against All Flags" is just like the classic swashbuckler. It has all the elements that adventure fans could hope for even more because in this girl, the woman in distress is not even in danger. As Spitfire Stevens, Maureen O'Hara is the best athlete, running his enemies in contradiction with the social norms of the time. Anthony Quinn puts the first three billed actors as ruthless captain Roc Brasiliano and turns out to be a Nemesis capable for Brian Hawke (Flynn). For the classic adventure fan, "Against All Flags" is a must-see. Although it can not be in the same league with some of Errol Flynn's previous works (Captain Blood and The Sea Hawk, for example), this is still a story of entertainment.
