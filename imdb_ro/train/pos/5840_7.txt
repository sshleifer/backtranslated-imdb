While the premise of the film is pretty brilliant (Ollie is diagnosed with "hornophobia"), the film is a nice and pleasant film. It's also a bit better than the movies he's made after this - probably it was Laurel and Hardy's last film by Hal Roach. In fact, it would not be a bad idea not to see any of their latest films, because all the chemistry is lost in these movies and the boys are playing their pieces simply for the pathos - something true, the films Laurel and Hardy NEVER do what. They had a bit of edge that all the movies later lack. Stan and Ollie are working on a horn factory. It sounds pretty funny, but it's not. Not surprisingly, with all the rocket, Ollie is about to have a nervous breakdown and has to take some time to work. The doctor (James Finlayson - in his latest film with the team) recommends a trip with the ocean. However, they do not like surfing and Stan has the idea of ​​renting only a boat connected to the dock - then they can get all the air at sea they want without disturbing everyone! Once on board, a dangerous criminal ship escaped and accidentally started at sea. Fortunately, this part of the movie was actually well developed, and the end did very well. While it was not a long, long-lasting film, Laurel and Hardy, it was much better than most of them since then did not have annoying and distracting musical numbers (like BROTHER DEVIL or BABES IN TOYLAND). In addition, there is still a decent amount of physical comedy - something you would see almost none after this movie. Some of this was due to the poor health of boys (and Ollie's growing circumference), and part of this was due to the general lack of these films.
