I saw this movie when I was young and I remembered as one of the first films I liked a lot because it was not a movie or a comedy. So in recent years, I've decided to see again and see if it's just nostalgia or there really was something in that movie. To my surprise, the movie kept my expectations. It's a great movie. Emotional in the right quantity, some jokes, beautiful songs (not too big, and in fact, that explains why I did not remember it was a musical) and everything was useful in my time. I was surprised that the last films of my childhood I reviewed did not even pass the minimum requirements for a decent film, and yet this movie, which I first saw in the second grade, made to cry today,. Maybe that's because my dog ​​recently died and maybe not, but the most important thing is that it made me feel and that's why the filmmakers make movies (that's the money, of course). Yes, there are glitches of continuity. Yeah, the script has holes, but it does not matter. The film itself is fun and smart. So do not be fooled by the cynical people who always look for bad things in life, because nothing is perfect, and this movie becomes a 10 not because it is perfect. It's 10 just because it made me feel.
