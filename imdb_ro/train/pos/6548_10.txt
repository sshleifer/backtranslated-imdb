This is a great movie! I played all the games Nancy Drew and I read the books and I did not expect the movie to be so exciting and funny! If you've never heard of Nancy Drew, read the first book (The Secret of the Old Clock) so you can get used to Nancy, then you can watch the movie because in the movie, the name quickly. ;) My whole family enjoyed it and the intrigue was extremely exciting. This is a final comeback from Nancy Drew's previous films, which actor Nancy Drew has not found. This movie is akin to Alex Rider: Stormbreaker. It's so cool! Nancy Drew lovers, you have to watch this!
