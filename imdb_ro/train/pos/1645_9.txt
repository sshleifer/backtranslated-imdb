This Western is done in a different way from the others. Realism is the key here. Conchata Farrell comes to Wyoming to work for Rip Torn on his farm. How does this make it a very interesting American slice. I would have liked to see this on the big screen, rather than on the tape, but it is worth seeing how life was in the real west. The cinema is excellent. Solid 9. Torn & Farrell excels in this movie.
