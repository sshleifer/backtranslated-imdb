It's not a movie to be taken seriously, it's a great little movie. It's certainly not just a piece of fluff. The actor, the IMO, is excellent. One of the movies you have not gone out of the way to see, but it brings a smile every time it comes to the cable. Like an old friend. It is definitely worth seeing if you have the chance. <br /> <br /> - - - - - - - -
