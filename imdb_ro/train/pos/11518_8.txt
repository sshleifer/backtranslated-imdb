You can do a lot with a little money. Blair Witch has demonstrated that. This movie accepts it. It's just a sitcom in length and complexity. However, because he has John Cleese as Sherlock Holmes, he manages to be hilarious, even on a budget that could not afford a shoestring. The highlight of this film is that Arthur Lowe is like Watson's sincere, frightening, morning and slowness that lighten Cleese's spirit. If you ever run the movie, watch it for a weird laugh or two.
