This is simply the most amazing movie you'll ever see. I thought it was just another documentary, but it really is different. Do not try to teach you anything, show you how life is working in nature. I will not talk about the quality of the images, because obviously you know from other comments is unmatched. <br /> <br /> The earth is fun, tense and sad. It can make you laugh, it can make you cry. Sometimes both at the same time. This is the first movie that made me cry, not because you are sorry for the animals, but because you have come to realize how fragile our planet is and what treasure we have been blessed, but we do not appreciate it a little. /> <br /> This movie should be displayed in schools. It's the most wonderful movie you'll see, so go and see. Who knows, maybe it's the last time we could see our planet like this ... 10/10, but I'd rather like it more if it was possible.
