A remarkable documentary about the achievements of the Women's Advocates Association (WLA) in Kumba, southwest Cameroon, to legally safeguard women's and children's rights from domestic violence. In this Muslim culture, where men have always been sovereigns of women, according to Sharia law, one can imagine the difficulty of imposing secular legal rights for women and children. After 17 years of failed efforts, WLA leaders have recently begun to win some victories, and the purpose of this film is to share these victorious stories. Leaders of this legal reform movement are Vera Ngassa, State Prosecutor, and Beatrice Ntuba, Supreme Judge (President of the Court). Both are playing in this movie, which can contain spontaneous images, though I imagine that much of it, if not all, consists of subsequent recreations of the real events for the camera. Four cases are reviewed, and all the plaintiffs also play themselves in the film. Two cases involve repeated beatings, forced sex in one case; another involves forced sex in a 10-year-old girl; and the other refers to the repeated beatings of an 8-year-old child by an aunt. One of the beaten wives is looking for a divorce. We follow cases from investigating complaints to study results. The results in each case are favorable to women and children. Actors get terms of rigid penalty and / or fines; divorce is granted. The aggressive pursuit of a child who beats his aunt demonstrates that these criminal justice officials are genuinely neutral when it comes to law enforcement. Of note is the respect with which all parties are dealt with, including those found guilty. This is a very important and well-done film. (Interestingly, one of the directors, Ms. Longinotto, co-directed the 1998 "Divorce, Iranian Style" film, which dealt with similar themes in Tehran.) (English subtitles). My grade: B + 8/10
