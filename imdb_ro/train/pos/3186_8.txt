I find this movie very nice. The plot is simple and easy to digest, humor is light and clean, and because the story that implies a mistaken identity is quite common, I find myself looking forward to finding out how this movie creates this story. It looks very nice. The performance of the female leadership is admirable; the portrayal of an innocent, naive little girl who is trying to make some white lies for David's sophisticated role was very charming. I also find Vera's dance very, very well done. I felt attracted to my toes as she strolled on the stage effortlessly and without flaw. For those who have had plenty of profane movies full of today, you will enjoy this film with care.
