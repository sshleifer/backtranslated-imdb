When I first heard about this series on AnimeTV, I have to say that out of all the shows I've seen, this goes beyond all of them. I had to see this show, and that's what I did. When I got the first volume of this show, it was the best. I liked the animation very much and all the battle scenes were wonderful. I have to say that my favorite characters in the show were Saber and Archer and, of course, I like Illya. And, of course, all the episodes in the volumes were interesting and very interesting. Another thing I have to say about the series is Michael McConnohie (famous for Transformers and others) who plays Berserker's voice. He has a cool character. And I even saw the whole series again before watching the final volume. So if you see something good, then you see this show, it's the best.
