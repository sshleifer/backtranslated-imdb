I saw this movie once as a child at the late-late show and I fell in love with him. It lasted 30 years, but recently I found it on DVD - it was not cheap, either - in a catalog that specializes in war films. I saw her last night for the first time. The audio was good, however it was granular and had trailers between rollers. Even so, it was better than I remembered. I was also impressed with how true the game was. The catalog is here over here. If you are honest in finding her, fire me a missive and see if I can get your information. cartwrightbride@yahoo.com
