I rented Zero Day from the local video store last week. I've never heard of the movie and I had my reserves. Just by looking at the box, I knew the movie was an indie film and that, therefore, the quality would be less than a main movie. <br /> <br /> I can tell you that after we finished watching Zero Day, we started it right from the start again. The film clearly followed the basic sketch of what happened at Columbine High School in April 1999, but what struck me was how credible the two main actors were. For the first time, watching this movie, we were not entirely sure if what we watched were real tapes left behind by the Columbine shooters. Behind my mind, I knew that what I was watching could not be real, but at the same time, the act was so convincing that you had to give up your head all the time. <br /> <br /> The film is disturbing? Absolute! Will you see things that will question the merit of the movie? Probable. I think what most people will find worrying is that they will actually have feelings for the two characters, Calvin and Andre (played by Cal Robertson and Andre Keuck). Why is this a problem for some people? Calvin and Andre plan a massacre at their high school. I know for myself, I felt an immense sadness for Andre and Calvin. I had empathy for them, because their life has come to such a horrible point. They fell so deeply through cracks that they had started a journey on a road that could have been stopped, if only the people around them would have noticed their situation. <br /> <br /> Zero Day is a phenomenal movie. This gives you a close and personal look at events that most of us will ever see only on the news conclusion. It lets you think about the lives involved. And it puzzles you how to get to this point. A week after I saw this movie, I still think about it. For those who have not seen Zero, please note the following: The movie is an independent movie, with little or no budget, and the movie is shot on camcorders. The material in the film is disturbing. This is not the Hollywood mainstream and there is no happy ending. <br /> <br /> But if you can put everything aside, Zero Day is a movie that will stay with you and can help you to open your eyes a little.
