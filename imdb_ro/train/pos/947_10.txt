and possibly closer to Dickens's story line. Although I find the young Ebenezer hard to look at (which is the idea that he was the hair of the epoch, surely he could do better than that!), Scott does an incredible job like Scrooge. His delivery of some of Dickens's lines finally brought my life to me. Edward Woodward is all we expect even more from the presence of the Christmas Spirit. I find G.C. Scott Scott's much more than a credible miser than the more current version of Patrick Stewart. The morning Christmas scene, when Scrooge realizes he has not "missed", is enough to convince someone that Scott knows how to deal with overcrowding. It's phenomenal here. Almost all distribution is incredible. Tiny Tim in this version of Carol Christmas is a bit hard to look, almost too sweet. However, music and the landscape make it necessary to watch every feast. Enjoy!
