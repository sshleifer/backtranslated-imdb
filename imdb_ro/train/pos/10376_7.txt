I just saw the role and what pleasure it turned out to be. Toby Malone's performance really came out, I was worried about what's going on for Matt throughout the movie, which is very fun, very passionate about a good blend of well rounded characters, a pretty big achievement , time. There are plenty of good twists throughout, too, will keep you guessing by the end of the year. The other characters you have to watch are the crazy Tiny and Jesse attractive. Perhaps it does not have the huge budget of a Hollywood blockbuster, but do not let it stop, you could do much worse than check it out, you will not regret it. Fun. 7/10
