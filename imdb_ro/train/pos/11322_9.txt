This anime shook my socks seriously. When the anime opened for the first time, I felt it was too slow; the story was not long before, and Shirou was quite impressive. Once you learn more about tracking and find out more about Saber and about the Holy Grail war, the story opens and you can see more of its facets. It was fantastic. In addition, I felt that the way the characters grew up was very true to form with the way real people develop in the real world. There were not bad things, absolutely obvious; the development of Ilya and Rin was interesting to watch, but I think the way Shirou and Saber have grown in some personalities were just interesting to follow all this. Some of the "surprising" people who appear (Gilgamesh?) Also seemed unique from the rest of the songs expressed in one way or another, which means I did not replace Generic Bad-Ass A with Generic Bad-Ass B as soon as he died. Anddd, I liked music. The opening music broke down, and the final theme of the last episode only ... Seriously pushed the theme of the last episode much further. Good job, Type-MOON!
