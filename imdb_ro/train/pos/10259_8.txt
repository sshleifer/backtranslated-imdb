A lot of people wrongfully delete this series, but more videos from Guinea Pig are quite fun. Devil's Experiment has especially few effects fantastic - not just stage infamous eye, but also a piece of skin very realistic leg and a hand break a stick are very realistic - especially for vintage video and low-budget. <br /> <br /> Let me start from the beginning for those who do not know: This film is a film very tortured / falsified, which appeared in Japan in the mid 80s. It is a plot as simple: a young girl is held by a few men and forced to undergo a series of brutal torture to see where her breaking point. This involves brutal violence - all effects realistic effects, including those mentioned in the last paragraph, and a painful application of hot oil trapped girl's arm and placing maggots in wound later. > Sequences of the less effective they are at the beginning of the video and consist of a session palm inconclusive three men twist of the hand, going to hell, while the head falls, and a second sequence in which the three male twist and pushing it to the ground. These two scenes are obviously organized and destroyed by the realism of the rest of the processes. The actress who plays victim "experiment" is quite convincing to be in pain and take a good amount of abuse and hard stuff per room. His reactions, while they have headphones and loud noises, play for hours, cool off. Some of the other abuses he takes are caught in a net of a tree during the only rest periods. There is also a disturbing scene in which gigglingers take revenge through her and another disgustingly unpleasant scene in which she returns to an office chair and is forced to drink a bottle of Jack Daniels until she throws it. you have not seen this series I hope I helped you decide whether or not you want to give this episode a chance. 8.5 / 10 for the Devil's Experiment.
