This is undoubtedly the most frightening game I've ever played. It's not the average movie - everything - that moves in the kind of fps (which I usually do not care much about), but acceptable gfx, interesting weapons and magic, surround sound effects ("Scryeeee, scryeeee .." I like Scrye, which lets you play or watch events that happened in the past in some places. The only game I had to make regular breaks after a few minutes of playing just because of the intensity I am a great fan of horror, especially Clive Barker's stories and films, and participating in a horror story that makes me play for more games that emphasize the atmosphere and a more involved story 9/10 (- 1 because I'm not fan fps and maybe the game was a bit short?)
