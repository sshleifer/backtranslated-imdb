Antonioni really showed some "cojones" when he made this film. He went to America, worked on a contract in the most grandiose studio (MGM), and made the deepest portrait of the American society I've ever seen. After I first saw LA, this is the most accurate portrait of the crowded, overheated and impersonal city. If only Antonioni met Bill Hicks ... The later funeral of the studio is understood, after such an enormous investment and a hard comeback. It is sad that people do not get to see this movie because I think Antonioni has proved to be right. Here he predicts the end of the hippie / civil rights movement in America's politics. Everyone is more interested in what's happening in the pockets and in the unceasing expansion of the living space in the innocent (yet beautiful) desert and beyond. How I would like to see the interest in this re-lit film and a generous DVD version. I urge people to look at Zabriskie Point with an open mind and an open heart. We have a truly unique movie, commenting on a turning point in the history of the most powerful nation on the planet and forgetting about it. An unexpected gem.
