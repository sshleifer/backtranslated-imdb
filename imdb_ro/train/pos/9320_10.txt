A short subject of MGM MINIATURE. The editor of County of Cole's Clarion must decide what the IMPORTANT IMPERATIVE READERS are for her readers: an imminent frost that could trigger a disaster in their cultures, or the sensational shooting of a notorious gangster on the main street of the city. <br /> <br /> This is a remarkable small gift with a good performance by Charles 'Chic' Sale. Today, viewers will be more interested in the appearance of an unbelievable James Stewart, His nephew / assistant. Speaking slowly and somewhat badly, Stewart shows many of the attributes that would make him a huge star in a very short time. Often overlooked or neglected today, short subjects with one or two drums were useful Studios are an important training ground for new or thriving talents both in front of and behind the room. The dynamics of creating a short subject of success was completely different from that of a feature film, something like writing a short story, rather than a novel. Economics to produce in both budget and program terms and capable of portraying a wide range of materials, short subjects were the perfect completion of studio movies.
