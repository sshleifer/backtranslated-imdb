Girlfight is a story about a troubled teenager called Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez). Diana is burdened with the suicide of her mother and a sexist father who lives in a sexual community. A short temper and a lot of things to cause a fire is about to be kicked out of school for battle. Her brother, Tiny (Ray Santiago), trains Hector (Jaime Tirelli) in the boxing. Diana is informed by her father, Sandro (Paul Calderon), to pay those weeks of payment for Tiny's training. While Diana walks through the gym, she realizes that's what she wants to do. He wants to take it. Diana asks her father for money to train, but she refuses because she is a girl and she should do more "girly" stuff. All Diana wants to be treated like any other guy. Do not look down because she's a woman. She steals money from her father to start her training. Great movie. Genius, pure genius "effing". It recommends anyone who needs to see a good and clean film without a "monkey business".
