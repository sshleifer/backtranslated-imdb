Damn ..... this show was hit back in the day and still keeps cartooning today. I can not wait to see some DVDs to share with my little guy and see the same brightness in his eyes. I've already introduced it to Voltron (the 5 lei, not the 15 vehicles one) and I laughed when he told me someday "Daddy ... you sure saw a few lovely cartoons when you were a kid! "How nice this is. Come to Hollywood, this dust and give it a try for live action. It could not be worse than Spiderman 3 was ... Man Man ... 2007 has been pretty blade so far for summer movies. OK, I'll destroy now <br /> <br /> Cheers
