to communicate in the film essential things of life - such as life, has a meaning? - it's impossible. Of course, the possible answers to these questions are demonstrated in each film (story), but communication requires a direct appeal to consciousness. This happens if the input from the senses ignores the "entrance" of our mind, that is our thoughts. Few executives know how to communicate essential things. Tarkovsky, it is one. His "Stalker" presents images of existence, communicates life as it turns out and yet escapes your mind. I think De Zee and De Graaff do the same thing.
