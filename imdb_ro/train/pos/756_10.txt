I have to say that although I despise such shows, shocks of shock, I am a girl, I feel I have to express my opinion. I saw Dirty Sanchez before seeing Jackass and think he's far beyond Jackass in terms of programming. Story lines and interviews are interleaved to create a more exciting show. I saw a few minutes of the Jackass movie last night, and I did not realize how stupid it was together, the whole joked line after a joke unrelated to anything. It must have been the fastest performance ever, shockingly amateur. While drinking is not really my subject, as far as a substantial entertainment show is taking place, Dirty Sanchez is very far from Jackass's league.
