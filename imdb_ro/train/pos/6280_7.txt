If you like cars, you will enjoy this movie! There are some good actors in the film, especially Vinnie Jones, with his typical attitude, no nonsense and hardcover appearance. Others are not bad either. <br /> <br /> There are only two slight defects in this movie. First, the poor plot, however, people do not watch this movie for the plot. Second, the glorification of a car crime. However, if people really believe they can steal a Ferrari and escape with it, then look good to them, I hope you have a good time in jail! When I read for the first time that Nicolas Cage was to act the main role, I first thought "... Sweeet", but then I thought "... suck naaaa!" but finally, after watching the movie, I realized that "... yes, he sucks!". He only jokes that he plays the part very well. I will conclude this unusual review by saying, "If the murder of a murderer has, in one way or another, enlightened the cinematographic audience who had an audience about the grim shroud under the glossy floor of the criminal life, and inspired them to it's a lot of fun, it's gotta be so lucky. You can say "Criminal Slabit." I say, "We're poor" - Angelina Jolie Voight looks pretty beautiful!
