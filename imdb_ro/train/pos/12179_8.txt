I happened to watch this movie happening a few days ago, while flipping through channels. My expectations were not very high, but it was an exciting movie. In "A Guy Thing," Jason Lee plays Paul, a Seattle man who will marry Karen's fianc√© (Selma Blair), an uncontested life of the middle-class family. I meet first at the baccalaureate party where she does not want to engage in any of the typical bachelor party activities that she encourages (surprisingly few) buddies, if she is a little naughty and crammed arguments. Of course, the next thing he knows is the morning after the night before, he's in bed with an empty hula dancer and his mother-in-law telephones to let him know that Karen is on his way. And the hula dancer is the cousin of Karen Becky (Julia Stiles). From this small spur of potential problem grows a powerful oak of frenetic misery, as Paul grieves from a mistake to a mistake, trying to hide what he did, while preserving the appearance of being a good, family-oriented man , who is very excited about his future wedding. His efforts to make sure that Karen does not even remain the wiser about any mistaken possibility for him is forcing Paul to get closer to Becky, the fun lover, forcing him to wonder if he really wants the life that seems to have been characterized for him. The film contains the right mix of comedy and love. Definitely worth a watch.
