Maria Braun, sensual and tough. (Hanna Schygula) marries a soldier during the Second World War and spends half a day and all night with him. So long it takes marriage before losing the war and then the jail. She continues her life, becomes a successful business woman, being not only sensual but intelligent, ambitious and willing to use sex whenever it is needed: "I do not know anything about business, but I know what German women want. could even say I'm an expert on it. " As she climbs to success, does she always remember her husband Hermann (her husband), and is she convinced that she does anything? is for him, for their happy future life together. "Maria Braun" style reminds a lot of the melodies of Hollywood's favorite director, Douglas Sirk, and gives a look at loss and survival in post-war Germany. Hanna Schygula shines literally in every scene of the movie and she is fantastic. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
