This is one of the three movies of the 80, which I can think of and which, unfortunately, were overlooked at that time and unfortunately still overlooked. One of the others was Clownhouse directed by Victor Salva, a forgotten movie because of Salva's legal / sexual problems. Another is Cameron's Closet, which seems to me somewhat undervalued - not great, but not as bad as the reviews I've seen. The paper house deserves a lot of time and I think it's one of those very quiet movies that will stay in the brain much longer than you think. I mean, 10 years after I saw it and still give it a break, while something I saw six months ago came into the air.
