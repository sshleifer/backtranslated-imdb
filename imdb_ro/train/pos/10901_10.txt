This is probably the best documentary I've seen in a very long time. Jonny Kennedy was and still is a beautiful tragic inspiration. Not only has he survived one of the most painful diseases there but has used his beauty to show the world that there is life after death, and never give up on reaching people and spreading love. Watching the minutes of his long-term struggle was useless. Listening to his intelligent background remarks and seeing his adorable gestures were unimaginable. And seeing the smile was indescribable. I feel blessed that I was touched by this little giant. If you ever have a chance to watch this movie - consider yourself lucky to have met Jonny Kennedy.
