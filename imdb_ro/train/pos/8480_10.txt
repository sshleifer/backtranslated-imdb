Thanks to the Warner architecture, I can see this show of mammoth varieties that throws everything but the kitchen sink. (The bath is, however, present) This film gives screen time to all those who have been in contracts with Warners at the time. If some of the artists seem unknown to some, it is due to the fact that they were great in silent days and disappeared the most from the popularity of the talks. There are also some truly remarkable artists of the era of the veudeville. You will be very impressed by Winnie Lightner, who performs two numbers. There is also a French star, Irene Bordoni, who was singing a love song in a sexy way. Perhaps one of the most important things is the two-strip "Chinese Fantasy" technology, which has been restored for this version. She is really beautiful and she sees Myrna Loy and Nick Lucas. Finally, there is the massive "Lady Luck" that lasts nearly a quarter of an hour. This is truly an era of the early era of speech. Any old movie movie will like this.
