I loved this movie. It may not have had the funding and advertising that Hollywood's newest blockbuster has got, but it packs twice the emotional fist. The story revolves around this Utah family and is the link between the people in the family who give the film his fist. The main leadership (Giovanni Ribisi) plays his role very well, at any moment he does not let you think he is acting all his feelings. It's his brother (Elias Koteas) who stole the show for me, though. When the two were on stage together, they bordered their lines, offering fantastic performances. Great movie, great movie.
