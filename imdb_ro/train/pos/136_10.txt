This movie is a great way for the series to come to an end. Peter (the boy from Master Puppet III) is growing up and is now Master Puppet. Well, this girl is destroying the puppets and learning the secrets of Toulon, but listens to the doll story. Most of this movie is the Pupil Master II, Master III, Doll Master 4, Doll Master 5, Curse of the Master of Dolls and Master of Retro Dolls (sorry ... Dar Paramount does not let it use scenes from 1). Personally I Want Master Puppet Vs. Demon toys were finally done, but the way this movie ends is basically saying "This is the final movie in the series ..."
