The best part if this movie is the love relationship that is a tearjerker. song interludes are just at the right time, the landscape is good, the only part where this movie fails is if the jokes between Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav are too long and, after a while, I'm annoying, but in general this is a brilliant movie, I advise someone Read this review to go and watch, no matter other comments. 9/10
