I read some of the other users' comments and decided to put each other together. Some of the users are stuck in a kind of "realism" of mentality. This movie was supposed to be a "fantasy" ... a fun movie. It was never meant to be "real" or serious. It was very nice for everyone I knew when it came out - even if she walked to the tragedy of the Challenger explosion ... I was 30 years old and I loved it all - and my son loved -a! Later I shared it with my daughter and she also loved her. SpaceCamp is a fun family film that you should enjoy because - fun. All "real" people in the world should ease or stay on viewing documentaries or docudrams and avoid any other type of movie. I'm sorry for those youngsters who watched the first film and then went to SpaceCamp (one in Alabama and one at Vandenberg AFB in California) - they probably waited for the same kind of environment that was featured in the movie and then felt "letdown" ... I think their parents did not explain the difference between fantasy and reality. Good. If you like fancy-fun movies and you have not seen it, I recommend it a lot! Enjoy!
