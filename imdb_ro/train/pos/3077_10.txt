I missed the entire season of the show and started watching it on the ABC site in the summer of 2007. I am absolutely crazy about the show. I think all the distribution is excellent. It's one of my favorite shows ever. I just checked the ABC program range for this fall and I did not see it on the graph. It's so sad. I hope they'll bring her back ... maybe she's waiting until Bridget Moynahan has her baby? Or is it just my wishful thinking? <br /> <br /> I read some of the comments about the show and I saw so many brilliant remarks, similar to mine. I hope that ABC will reconsider its decision or hope another station will take over.
