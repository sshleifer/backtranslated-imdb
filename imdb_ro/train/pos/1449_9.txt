This is one of the best crime-drama films of the late 1990s. It was filled with a great cast, a strong story, and many of the players involved had great performances. Pacino was great; should have been nominated for something. John Cusack was also good, as long as the viewer does not mind Louuu-siana's accent. It may be annoying if you can not bear this dialect. The way Pacino's character interacted with Cusack's character was credible, dramatic, and sometimes easy to comic. Danny Aiello was great as always. David Paymer played an important role in his support. Bridget Fonda was good but not memorable. There were times when this image mentioned so many characters, probably too many. You may need a second view to remember "what Zapatti was who?" After so many cross references, we have to stop and think about just recapping. The end did not have a lot of sting. It was built so much and then it was a little letdown. This was one of the few problems with the movie. Since the movie was not billed as a big hit, it forgot that this movie existed. Pacino and Aiello were great, but the lack of "splash" in the theater may not have been nominations. It was semi-successful on the domestic market, and the audience still learned that this title is there. Made in 1996, it still stands up and will remain popular for many years. <br /> <br /> So make some lemon pudding (see) and watch this movie!
