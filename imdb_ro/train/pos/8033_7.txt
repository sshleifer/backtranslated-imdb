Zane and Beringer will keep you on the edge of the seats. I do not usually go for military / war films, but that's my time. It was serious, but it was humor. The character of Beringer proved to be heroic and honest. No matter what, you know he took your back. Zane's character has grown throughout the movie. He was not just a costume, he certainly proved he could be a hero and handle a gun. However, it ends with me. It did not work with the action throughout the movie, but I'm glad I saw it, though. It's worth checking out.
