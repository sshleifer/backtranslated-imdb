Very slick, very pre-Hays Code, and still very sassy. I would highly recommend seeing this movie, even if you are not a fan of Stynwyck. She's funny, she's sexy, she's working hard - and she loves that pen! Barbara Stynwyck is fantastic as the doze of a fluorescent rising in the world, perfectly portrayed by a bank building. John Wayne (in a suit!) Play one of his first conquests. <br /> <br /> The last three minutes are a letdown, but the sets, lines, clothes add to a heck of film about vertical uphill in horizontal position.
