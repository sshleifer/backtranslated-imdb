Sure, because it's great pictures and great sound, it's a spectacular speech of a home theater, but it's also an attractive drama as well as an informative documentary. The parallel stories that interconnect throughout this film will keep all viewers interested. Young people, old men and boys alike will discover that we are all fans of the car, especially high performance indy cars that are the result of blood, sweat, tears, ingenuity and perseverance. Brand Mark Knopfler and Ry Cooder are perfectly suited for visuals and content. I do not want to end, but Quincy Jones' last success, Days Like These, could bring a tear to the eye. Enjoy it!
