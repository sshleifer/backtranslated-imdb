I liked the movie, but, as everyone said, there were some bits that were not developed enough. I personally thought the girls were very vague before landing in prison; sure they should have been American innocent girls, but still ... I felt they did not have that link that my best friends ought to have. For example, in the arrangement they see, the way they held each other for the photo was very strange. Then there are parts that were very ambiguous. I think it's pretty clear that Danes's character did not, but I see how it could be confusing. Also, why did the room live on Manat wearing a very grim expression after putting the bags in their taxi trunk? I thought he was suggesting something, but it turned out to be nothing. Besides, the movie was great. I cried when Claire Danes blamed; she is a GREAT actress. I also wanted to see the tortuous Thai prisoners get your ass kicked. Talks about the lack of closure ...
