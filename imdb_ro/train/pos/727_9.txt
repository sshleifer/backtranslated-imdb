One of the best, if not the best, rock'n'roll movies ever. And it's not just mindless fun. There really were a lot of smart jokes in it. Of course I like Ramones. But with all the themes of "anarchy" and "hate high school", the film does not take too seriously, which is great about it. I first saw the movie in the spring of 1980, and I saw it again recently. Ever since I went to high school in the late 1970s, it made me a kind of nostalgia. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie is not taken seriously and it is not pretentious that so much other teenage rates of the 1970s, eighties, and ninety. And to speak, it's not really dirty or disgusting. Only rated PG. That's rare for a movie in this category. A special classic cult and a really incredible time capsule.
