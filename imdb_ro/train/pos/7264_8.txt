You have to agree with Cal-37 is a great movie, especially for the family, Kelly Linch is beautiful, the little girl is very talented and cute, of course Jim Belushi has earned her stripes! But I want to like the piano song, if you're a musician or you're not watching this movie just for that, you'll know what it is. <br /> <br /> "You're no one until someone loves you" Written by Russ Morgan, Larry Stock, and James Cavanaugh <br /> <br /> So have fun watching, you see, <br /> <br /> Nelson
