In Iran, women are officially banned from men's sports events. In June 2005, the Iranian national football team has an important match against Bahrain in the Azadi stadium for World Cup qualifying. A group of Iranian girls and fans of football dresses like boys and unsuccessful attempts to enter the stadium arrested. Soccer (and the Flamengo team), beach and movies are my greatest passions; therefore I loved this little jewel about a group of girls and their passion for football. Director Jafar Panahi of "The White Balloon," "Mirror," and "Circle," shot the film the day Iran defeated Bahrain and qualified for the World Cup in Germany. The dramatic and funny adventure of these Iranian girls is one of the most amazing movies I've ever seen. My vote is new. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
