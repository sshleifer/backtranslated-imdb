For those who think of Dame May Witty as the old and good old lady of The Lady Hitchcock Vanishes, this film needs an adjustment. Here, she is anything, but with kindness or batty. Instead, her son, George Macready, is the one who deals. Just do not give him a knife, otherwise his eyes light up and no furniture pillow in the house is safe. Now we know what she has in mind for Nina Foch caught, if she can get out of Mother's dominant hand. A very close woman in danger who keeps her suspense throughout her life. The script never fades away from Foch's dilemma. She was imprisoned in an ancient old Gothic house on the edge of an angry sea. He's going to kill her, but why. Her situation does not make sense. Tensions are set up as they try to unfold after another, but even strangers seem to be against it. I began to feel her helplessness and growing paranoia as the world moved away from her. Director Joseph H. Lewis made a big step toward cult status with this film, and obviously that. And then, watch Foch run subtly through a range of emotions without going over once over the top. The soul also shines like a really intimidating matriarch, who knows what she wants and how to get it if she can simply keep her son. My only reservation is the climax that seems too controversial in terms of timing events. However, it's a good, nervous way to spend a little more than an hour, studios in Colombia.
