IMDb has been showing this since 1972 for some reason, but the other sources we've seen, including the excellent program scores, mark it as '68. It does not really matter, except that it is quite interesting to watch this abstract film and video collage (one of the first artworks that apparently merges them) in the context of the 2001 Star Sequence released in the same year. Pure abstraction is not exactly my thing, but I can take it in small doses, and colors printed in super-saturated colors and the psychedelic sense of this series of flowers, Rohrschach spots, birds, etc. is quite convincing and quite beautiful. Of course, it helped pave the way for many other filmmakers in the 1970s and deserves to be better known.
