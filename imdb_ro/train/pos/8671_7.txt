Armageddon PPV <br /> <br /> The last PPV of 2006 <br /> <br /> The Smackdown brand. <br /> <br /> The results of the match were taken further <br /> </ b> We start the show with the Inferno match. Kane v. MVP. It was a good match. Nothing about fighting here. It was visual. On the whole, this was not bad. There were a few places here with Kane too close to fire, but eventually Kane won with MVP in the first fire. Let's continue. Teddy Long announces a new match for titles of label teams: London and Kendrick will defend against him: Regal and Taylor, The Hardyz and MNM IN LADDER MATCH !!!! Let's move! <br /> <br /> Match two: Fatal quad match. That was the total carnage. Judging by three of the four teams here, you would expect chaos. The stains were amazing. A total spot-fest. A point Jeff left for Poetry on the move and London moved and Jeff hit the ladder! Soon, Jeff is put on the top rope with two nearby stairs, MNM is about to kill Jeff, Matt saves him and Jeff kicking Joey Mercury's shot! Mercury is hurt. His eye is quickly closed and is stopped rough. Mercury is removed from the match and Nitro is still there. He will fight for titles alone! Regal and Taylor then grab London and supplement his face - first in scale! Jeff climbs the stairs and Nitro in a killer spot, descends the stairs to kill Jeff! Wonderful! Finally, London and Kendrick retain their title of the label team. What game! <br /> <br /> He was crazy. I can not figure out why WWE has not announced this before. The Buyrate would grow big. I'm sure the resume value will be good though. Mercury suffered a shattered nose and eyelashes. He's at the hospital now. Make your baby good. <br /> <br /> No other way here will be enough. <br /> <br /> Next: Miz v. Boogeyman (Ugh) This was a match of nothing. Will he ever fight with Boogeyman? The miz is shit. After a crazy crowd, that kills the dead. DUD. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit v. Chavo. It was a strong match. I liked. Chavo hit a killer superplex at some point! Benoit hit eight German substitutes! Benoit wins with the sharpener. Good stuff. <br /> <br /> According to the Helms v. Yang-Cruiserweight title championship. It was a good match. Unfortunately, stupid fans did not take care of this. WHY? Helms and Yang are very talented and fight well. I agree with JBL. He ran to the crowd. JBL is 100% correct. Learn to appreciate this or go out. <br /> <br /> Kennedy v. The Undertaker-Last Ride Game. Not too much here. This was a fest, with a few exceptions. Kennedy, at one point, threw Taker off the floor. The place was fine. The reaction was disappointing. The final point was Taker Grave-stone Kennedy on the robbery and won the match. Unreal. Kennedy needed this victory. They both work hard. However, Kennedy needed this victory. The employer should have been lost. The creative was hurt again. <br /> <br /> A stupid thing for a diva is next. I like women. Not this. At least Torrie was not here. It's refreshing. Judging by the crowd, Layla should have won. WWE and wanted Ashley. Consider this bath break. Next. Main Event: Price & Batista v. Finlay & Booker T. It was also a match of nothing. The accent was given in Price v. Finlay and Batista v. Booker. Batista and Booker can not work together well. Finlay is trying to make Price look good. The finish was disturbed. Finlay hit Batista's knee with a seat chair, and Batista did not sell the shot and finished the game. Lame. It is not the main event caliber. <br /> <br /> In general, Armageddon would have scored less, but the scale match was the main event here. That was enough for the money there. Some others were solid. <br /> <br /> The last word: A good PPV with the scale match being the savior. Smackdown is not a bad show, it's not quite convincing. Smackdown must stop leaving the Price tag along. Let the Smackdown stand on its own two legs. This show demonstrates that Smackdown can.
