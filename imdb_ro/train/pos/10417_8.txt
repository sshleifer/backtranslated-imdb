He traces with lies and magical spells to get the kingdom from his legal leader, the young king Ahmad, and a beautiful princess from her father ... He eventually becomes a victim, as all tyrants do in books and legends) , to love and to the ordinary man he ignored here, embodied by the little thief (Sabu). The armies of good and evil, black and white, are made with wonderful in both visual and literary ... The script is poetic, simply and very beautiful ... The costumes of the magician and his men ascending and falling like the wings of the black birds, suddenly attacking the night to cause destruction and create terror ... The radiant hero carries white turbans and clothes, and his princess is dressed in pink and blues pale ... <br /> <br /> For spectacular scenes fit with everything that was before, while using color, it brought to life a world as it did not seem possible before ... With the flying carpet and the white horse flying, with a giant genius (played excellent by Rex Ingram) , with wicked wizards, and with the good action of Sabu and Veidt, "Thief of Bagdad" captures the quality and true atmosphere of Arab Nights ... <br /> The 1940 version remains the most beautiful story of the screen!
