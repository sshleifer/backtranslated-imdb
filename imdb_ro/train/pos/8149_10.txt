I saw the first movie when it came out in 1994 and I just looked at it recently and it's still funny. I do not know if you need to understand the hiphop in the 90s, but it helps if you do it. In the 1990s, when NWA and Public Enemy were at the peak, there were internal conflicts within groups and members when their separate paths (Ice Cube, Easy E, etc.). There have also been rappers who want to get to the stage (Vanilla Ice, Freedom Williams from C & C Music Factory, etc.). This movie is entertaining all this in a way that seems to be a documentary fact. Kasi Lemmons plays an interviewer who spends a year in the life of a fictional group name N.W.H. The members of the group are: Ice Code (Rusty Condieff / Director), Tasteful taste (Larry B Scott / Mark's revenge and Tone Def (Mark Christopher Lawrence), a rap group that politics makes them controversial. is that he is so young in portraying the hiphop industry in the 80s and they are very entertained in it But, if you know the 1980s rap, you know how many things are true.However, on your own, unknowingly hip hop is still a funny funny movie, and for all those who ask, yes, Spinal Tap came first, but Spinal Tap is not the first spoof, just as fun and in some ways better than Spinal Tap. Just as Spinal Tap is heavy metal, Fear of a Black Planet is Rap. And songs are on the hook as well. CD DVD is extra chalk to include music videos from NWH as a group and as solo artists Brilliant Performance by Rusty Condieff and Larry B Scott.
