We first saw this movie when it was broadcast around 1988 by the BBC when we were working at the UK 2000AD. My friend, Steve Parkhouse, recorded the VHS and sent it to me. So far, I've only seen Shaw Bros movies with kung fu with their harsh light (so the audience could see the movements clearly) so it was a revelation to see something that looks like it would be was lit by Ridley Scott leaving Hong Kong. This was also my first exposure to Tsui Hark's films (apparently, "Choy Huk"). However, for all exterior smoke, backlit and special ambitious effects (stop-motion? In a movie in Hong Kong?), In the heart of Chinese GHOST STORY there is a simple and moving love story, made with more real than Leslie Cheung's actor's extraordinary talent (a tragic and tragic loss of a life!) And the beauty and elegance of Joey Wong. Joey's genius is superb, but his ballet gestures give the character an untouchable heroism that is hard to analyze. And though Joey is now nearly 20 years old (gawd, which of us is not?), This will always be the lasting image of that actress. Some commentators here said that the film is simplistic and has no surprises, but they lack the fact that this film was based on a Chinese story written by Pu Songling around 1700! It's a little too much to complain that Romeo and Juliet have a predictable ending and just copying WEST SIDE STORY. (I just wanted to get this out of my chest!) For me, the Chinese GHOST STORY is the quintessential romantic story. It has a great tragedy, because we know that Chio Sin and Sin Seen can never be together. It's about getting mature, because none of us can mature until we have big losses. It is about sacrifice, because sacrifice is an essential component of true love. And Wu Ma's comedy style does not hurt him. <br /> <br /> Enjoy the Chinese story GHOST STORY trying not to see it through a Western culture filter and you will continue with it.
