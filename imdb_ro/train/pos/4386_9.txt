This is a powerful movie. The first time I saw him, the Scottish accents made it hard for me to understand a lot, and that destroyed the viewing experience. I gave it up, but then I purchased the DVD, I used the English subtitles when I needed them, and even got into this movie, discovering how good it is. It's great. The image on the panoramic screen makes it spectacular in parts with some wonderful landscapes, and the story reminded me of Braveheart, a story that implies good and evil. Here is Liam Neeson (good) vs. Tim Roth (bad). Both do their work good. Few actors meet as sophisticated as Roth. Dude, you really want to kill this guy in his arrogant, irritating pussy. (He is so ugly and evil, sick critics love their character more than anyone else is here). Neeson is a man of man and a solid hero figure, as Gibson was in Braveheart. Jessica Lange is strong in the role of woman. The film attracts you and engages you totally, ready to have an emotional experience to see it.
