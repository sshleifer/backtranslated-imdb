I liked this movie, seen tonight on a big cinema screen! The audience laughed loudly at some very interesting things, and the rhythm was the most enjoyable. I, as a singer and music director, cast doubt on a section of Roby Keeler's voice in "By a Waterfall." The modulated key also sang much less, with a very thin voice that had no resemblance to the more moving voice than the tin she used in all the other voices. Does anyone know if this was overwhelmed by another singer? I find. I would like to know. Thanks a lot.
