I would not like to comment on how good the movie was or what the flaws are, because I'm not a professional film critic and I do not have enough knowledge about the films. What I know is that making such a movie in your first shot is a great achievement and I would like to congratulate the director for this. However, in some reviews I read, the critics complained that Hiralal's relationship with his brothers was not highlighted, and his brothers were completely erased from the story. Now I would like to raise a point here that, as the name of the film suggests, it is not a film about Hiralal's brothers, it is a film about Mahatma Gandhi's relationship with his son Hiralal Gandhi, nothing less. If we start complaining that some characters are not in action in the movie, it would be a little unfair because these characters do not fit in the picture, no matter how relevant they were in real life. So, I think it would be better to stick to the main idea and not satisfy a critic in ourselves. Enjoy !!!
