One of the most exciting movies with excellent cinematography supported by Mc Clarens lisp and the amazing quote "do you believe in love first?" A trace of expressionism was evident in this image, further catapulting the impeccable integrity of the film. Gabby (AKA Joey), played by Eva Longoria, loved the film and the role she played so much that she could not be bothered by mentioning it in her filmography. Lol <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie should undoubtedly be the heroic salvation by MC clure as he saved the young child "Handicapped" with speech impediment .. which he could add has been acted to perfection! The use of James Cahiil's sound effects is unmatched even to date. The drug bust that he performs early in the film is realistic realistic pain. When I watched this movie for the first time, I was so forced by the lack of respect for Gw Inthused brothers from the Southside band and CTM (Cutthroth Mafia). This was by far one of the most encapsulated creuzet Cahill committed to filming. Personally, this movie has a sentimental value to me and I will download it in the near future. That's if I can find it anywhere, LOL!
