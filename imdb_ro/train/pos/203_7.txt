Neil Simon's sons, starring Walter Matthau and George Burns, are a funny comedy about the strange connection with her life and lack, but the bitter taste. Seeing Willy Clark (Matthau) and Al Lewis (Burns), two great theatrical comedians, now reduced to imbecility from hard and incessant old age, you can only feel anger and blue. Willy will never surrender and continue to look for work, while Al is tired for the players and is retired in the country in his daughter's home. The couple, in their old days, was really fun and harmonious, but the scene was a continuous fight and arguing, and for eleven years after being broken they did not talk to each other. Now if they work, they have to come back together once more to make one of the best old sketches for a TV show of comedy. Are encounters explosive and liberating for old questions? Neil Simon's script offers a certain corrosive spirit to the story, and melancholy and blue overwhelm many gags, and the laugh succeeded in generating a good combination thanks to a big couple, Walter Matthu (Academy Award nominee, best actor) and George Burns Academy Award as the best supporting actor). The two actors are very credible and true, and their harmony seems almost as they work together for all the time and that reality they do not have between them. The film is also very appealing to all the consuming reality, because the story is narrated and how the Love-Heat relationship linking the two actors is a real part of the weird, yet ordinary, things in life. My rate is 7.
