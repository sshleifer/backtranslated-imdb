no dennis movie, gary busey, erika eleniak, tom berenger, dean stockwell, marilu henner deserve a rating below 5 here. This is a bad version of the movies, such as 16 blocks or the endless escape of midnight, except for the prisoner being transported here, is very easy on Mrs. Eleniak's eyes. Tom Berenger plays another hoarse warrior, military-style maverick and William Mcnamara plays his role - to get a good foil. The story on her face is absurd, because I lost the count of time that Eleniak should have escaped, but this is a fun movie and they are good guys from all the above actors who keep the movie on the move. This is not a family movie, because there is a curse and a rare nude scene with eleniak, but this is much better than some of the other sticks that came out at this time.
