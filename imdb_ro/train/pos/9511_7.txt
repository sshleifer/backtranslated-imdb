A story of a bloody gangster that takes place during the Great Depression years. She tells us about another notorious character, Michael (Mike) Salliwan. Somehow, this time the story goes back: Mike struggles to save his life and the only remaining son, because the rest of his family was killed because of his dirty boss's dirty play. He manages to take revenge and secure an honorable future for his son, but he is finally killed. Such a story never has a happy ending. Role of Mike Salliwan senior was greatly played by Tom Hanks, and the role of Mr. Rooney (the mafia chief) was played by Paul Newman. The film makes an extraordinary impression and we hear the well-known phrase "I robbed the banks". This movie is worth a look, although you could have expected something bigger from Sam Mendes after American Beauty.
