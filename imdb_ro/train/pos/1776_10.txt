I forgot the first episode of this show ("Protesting Hippies") so much in 1999 that we avoided the rest. However, when he came to "The Paramount Comedy Channel," I saw it totally and, to my surprise, I found absolutely hilarious (Motto: never judge a series of comedies in his first week)! <br /> <br /> Set in 1969, "Hippies" portrays Simon Pegg as "Ray Purbbs," editor of an underground magazine, Oz, called Mouth. His friends are feminist Jill, Alex are back and Hugo half. Back in the late 1960s, there was a feeling of incredible optimism among young people that they could change the world by printing magazines that no one read. Rather than wander to the hippie naivety, "Hippies" is affectionate to her. Arthur Mathews's scenes erroneously parody a series of icons of this era - "Hair", "Woodstock", "The Graduate", even the infamous "Oz" obscenity process in the early 1970s. Excellent performance in distribution "Alex" from Julian Rhind-Tutt gave me strangely the character of Richard O'Sullivan from "The Man About the House". It is a shame that there has never been a second series, possibly because of people like me. If you lost "Hippies," try it. Once you get over the evil oppressor, you go to a treatment!
