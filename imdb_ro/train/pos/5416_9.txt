I saw it once. This happened in 1952, I was seven, movie 13. I was so young ... But I remember, forever, the strong moments of Gunga's sacrifice. <br /> <br /> I realized how much a people can be hardly subjected to and used by a foreign nation. In these historical circumstances, in the film, the personal relationship of friendship, a kind of friendship that is ignored, the one raised among people who share everyday life, who see each other, know their name but belong to different worlds, it can only occur. Then, in the most critical moments, a worrying question arises: "Who are we, first of all, must we be loyal to?" Which Men, family, motherland, person you know near you? You do not have time to give a perfect answer, it is urgent and it is for life or death. Gunga-Din gives his answer with his own sacrifice. Somewhere, in a confused way, a problem remains unresolved, emotion grows with the rhythm of the movie until someone dies, only one life, nothing compared to so many other fictions or realities that we can see today, because this death life I lived, I shared with my child unconditional friendship. It was lived by the spectator I was in. That day, I lose Gunga-Din forever. As I left behind, later, my beautiful childhood, as I have since gone from so many worlds I have lived in. I have left all this forever and these lines are today a short visit that I did not expect to do in the morning when I got up.
