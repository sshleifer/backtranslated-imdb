I saw this premiere movie on Friday (1/19) night in Park City for Sundance and was incredibly moved. Sitting in a theater and hearing the first-hand soldiers of suffering were more than I could stand. Others in the audience were equally moved, and while we wanted to go back, at least we could do is to confess that these men and women shared their experience with us. Robert Acosta, Paul Rieckhoff, Sean Huze and Herold Noel, all veterans of the Iraq war and present in the film, were present. While I can be home now, you can say that this war is still inside them and probably will always be. Whether you support the war or not, it's OUR duty to support the troops with anything other than a protective sticker. View this movie!
