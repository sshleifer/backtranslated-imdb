I saw the movie in the worst possible situation. I have already lost 15 minutes when I woke up on an international flight between Sydney and Seoul. I did not know what I was looking at, I thought maybe it was a movie of the week, but it quickly became the lead actress's performance playing a young woman who was kidnapped. The premise began to twist and return that it would not come until the end of the credits I was making through the flight guide to discover what I had just seen. It seems that we have lately discovered Doon Jeon who won the best actress in Cannes for the role. I do not know if Secret Sunshine is typical of Korean cinema, but I'm at the DVD store to find out more.
