Tian's remake is not good at all. We just clicked on his remake documentary to see Wei Wei, the original actress in the classic 1948 movie, saying a few words to the crew. We'll meet Wei Wei this Sunday (28/3/2010) after Xiao Cheng Zhi Chun was presented in Hong Kong Film Archie. Wei Wei is almost 90 years old in silver hair, her look cameo in Hong Kong movies is always a surprise to her fans. This year, the Hong Kong Film Festival, a special program is dedicated to Fei Mu, director of this epic film and Wei Wei's still shot film is seen around Hong Kong. My son, who returns this year, is surprised by Wei Wei was so beautiful then.
