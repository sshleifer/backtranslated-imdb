I really have to say, this has always been a favorite of me when I came to see my grandmother. And it still is. It's very, very close to the book. The way it is filmed and the players were just excellent! I have to recommend this movie to all those who did not see it. Almost everyone I talk to hate TV movies, but this was very good! I gave it 10/10.
