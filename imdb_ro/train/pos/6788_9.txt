The story and the characters were some of the best I've ever seen. the graphics were good for PS, and cut scenes and voice writings were amazing. I beat the game at least 3 times and I loved it every second. I felt that the problems faced by the protagonist were credible and realistic and I think it deserves a continuation. or at least one remake. If you remake them for ps3 I would buy the system just for that game and can its amazing mgs4 also the idea and execution of the dragoon system is enough to justify a rental and on the top of the inventive ad, though sometimes deceptive baton ) the add-on and parcel system makes this game a definitive purchase.
