It's interesting how the research train can run. I started looking at an article about Cristo's "Gates" in Central Park. The article says that Maysles had been Cristo's films for years. Hmmm ... Then I have to look at their work. I think one of them has passed, but the other one is still filming Cristo and Jean Claude in their creative phases. Gray Gardens seemed very interesting. The video station in Boulder CO is the place to look for the obscure or offbeat and, of course, they had it in stock. DVD and VHS. Edith and Edie are women who live in the past, and what a glorious past it was. Edith had fun, was born on Bouvier, married well, had some wonderful relationships, and became a singer when she was 40 years old. Her daughter, Edie, was a dabbling, a fashion model, and she had a lot of drinks. He did not marry, and at some point in his thirties he had come home to recover. Looks like he has a nervous disorder of a kind. They worry too much about things. It's just a shadow of the world they live in, though, because Jackie O. came and spruced up so that her aunt and cousin will not be evacuated. It is a 28-room mansion that is used and used. But in the movie you will see fresh paint on the walls. If you look carefully at the cuts in the newspapers, you see it was a dirty mess. Edie's equipment comes with a very smart and creative. The viewer has the impression that Edith likes to go nude, but she does not do it in the movie. Edith was really pretty pretty and you can see the shadow of her beauty while singing "Tea for Two". And Edie was a beauty on her day and quite attractive at age 56. It was a good film, though not for everyone. When the cat urinates behind Edith's carrier, she says, "At least somebody does what she wants"!
