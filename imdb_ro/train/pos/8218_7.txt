With Harry Callahan waking up for years, the inevitable "old man with a chip on his shoulder" had to play in the end. Callahan, who sometimes looked fragile and out of place, was still unfocused. Fortunately, this movie took some time to develop another type of story, one that could reinvent Harry Dirty and the whole genre. While the movie failed to do so, it was still an excellent addition to the series, even though it was a little less room for foolish fashion trends and New Wave music.
