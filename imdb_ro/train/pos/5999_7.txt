This is a strange film for me because after reviewing a beautiful film from a new film producer (FAR OUT by Phil Mucci), another writer / director, Ryan Jafri, contacted me and asked me to forget to his film, The Cure. She does not normally shoot this movie, but what the hell - I like shorts and I could not wait to see another. Interestingly, while it turned out I loved THE CURE, I was not delighted and left Jafri to know. To give me confidence, he encouraged me to review it anyway - by giving me an honest assessment. The film has an extraordinary style and, with regard to Jafri's direction, is exceptional - especially for such an inexperienced film (his first film). The combination of exceptional color, rhythm and music options that were suitable for the film created a great sense of atmosphere. You're really shot in the movie and that's a credit for the movie. However, the thing I did not love was part of the writing. While the basic idea was wonderful, the conclusion was too easy to foresee. I really would have liked the end if there was a surprise or if there was an unexpected turn. However, given that this film is from someone who should not be able to make such a professional film, given his experience, he is doing well for his future. Good job.
