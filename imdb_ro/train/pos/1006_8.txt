Robert A. Heinlein, the classic novel of Starship Troopers, has been puzzled over the last few years in everything that was Paul Verhoeven's 1997 film on a series of televisions on a number of games. But none of these things, so to speak, failed to capture the spirit of his novel. Usually, the games are unrelated, the TV series has been more decadent, and even less so about Verhoeven's movie, the better. Little does he know, however, that in Japan an animated adaptation had already been made, he released the year of Heinlein's death. And, believe it or not, despite its differences, this series of six-part animations is the most faithful adaptation of Heinlein's classic plot. The most obvious addition to this series is the presence of the army's exoskeleton armament, something in which we were deprived of Verhoeven's film. Like the book, the series focuses more on characters and their relationships than on action and space travel, although we see a fair amount of each. While events happen differently than in the book, the feel of the book's plot is present. Rico and Carmen have a romantic entanglement, but they are only slightly touched by the book. While some may think that dialogue and interaction with the characters are a bit inferior to the book (it gets a bit of anime treatment, but what would you expect?), But it's a lot superior to the movie. Heinlein's political positions are just excluded, unlike the film, where they are reversed. The big gain of the series is, however, the climatic battle on Klendathu between soldiers and bugs / aliens, which shows how the armor costumes we would have liked to see in a movie version. > <br /> Generally, I liked this series because I wanted to see a vision closer to that of Heinlein. And I think they did pretty good with that. If you can find this series, take a look.
