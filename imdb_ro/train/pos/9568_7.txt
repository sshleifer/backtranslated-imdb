Some observations of IMDb here resemble Dog Dog Bite Dog with classic Cat III movies in the 1990s, but although it is undoubtedly brutal, violent and very vile, this Pou-Soi Cheang film is not quite weak, win this comparison. However, she still packs a blow that makes her deserve an hour, especially if sharp and sharp action is your thing. Edison Chen interprets Pang, a man who hits cambodia traveling to Hong Kong killing a judge's wife; Sam Lee is Wai, the ruthless policeman who is determined to pursue him, no matter what the cost. While Wai approaches the target, Pang will stop at nothing to secure his escape until he meets Yue, a rather illegal immigrant who needs his help to get rid of his life of abuse. drama with great cinema, amazing sound design, courageous performance and solid performance from Chen and Lee (as well as Pei Pei's new friend as Pang's lover) Dog Dog Bite is one for fans of Asian hyper-violence alongside Chan-wook Park's Vengeance trilogy). Fighting, shooting, ruthless beatings: everything happens regularly in this movie and is firmly attached to the director Cheang. Of course, this is the kind of story that is meant to have an unfortunate end for all involved, and quite surely, almost everyone in this movie dies (rather dead). Unfortunately, there is a fine line between tragedy and comedy (unintentional), and in its final moments Dog Dog Bite crosses it: in a final scene, Pang and Wai are stuck in battle as a pregnant woman looks. Finally, after all three suffered serious injuries during the fracas, a wounded Pang performs a DIY watchman on (now a dead) Yue, giving the moments of the child before he died himself. is not a "classic" slice of excess Hong Kong, deliberate action by OTT and elegant visuals, still worth looking for.
