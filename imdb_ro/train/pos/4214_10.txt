The best of the seven Sam Fuller films I've seen (including Park Row, Run of the Arrow, Verboten !, Shock Corridor, Big Red One, and this movie) of the best film clouds . Represents Fuller as the most controlled. I like when he has no control, but almost everything in Pickup is perfect. The movie is absolutely beautiful. Richard Widmark plays the role of a pocket stealing a microfilm that had to go to communist spies. Jean Peters plays the woman who takes the film for her boyfriend, played by Richard Kiley. Peters is forced to find Widmark and get him back. He finds him through a seat dove played by Thelma Ritter. Widmark and Peters are attracted to each other, which changes Peter's loyalty (and the fact that she learns to work for the Communists, things in the Cold War are really interesting). The love story is made a little bit quick and is not entirely credible, but it's not so bad that it affects the film (unlike Fuller's previous film Park Row). Richard Widmark is great. This must be one of his best roles, but I'm not so familiar with the career I can safely say. Thelma Ritter offers the most memorable shows. Her role gives the film an unexpected emotional resonance, and the final scene in this movie is just as exciting as any one you will find in cinema. I will never forget that. 10/10.
