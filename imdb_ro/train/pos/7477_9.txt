This movie is made up of such an excitement, especially because of the excellent soundtrack that coincides with the movie. Tom Cruise is one of my favorite actors because of his enthusiasm to make movies and have fun. This movie was not the first time I watched it, but three more times I decided it was one of the best movies I've ever seen. It takes place in New York and progresses through its lifestyle. Discover a delim in his life with his girlfriend (Diaz). He goes through a state of depression and then a mixture of imagination outside. This movie has exceeded my expectations and is one of Cruise's best movies ever!
