Mary Pickford ("born July 4", as Angela Moore) is "The Little American" (French heritage); she falls in love with Jack Holt (like Karl Von Austreim), who moved to America with his German father and American mother. French-American Raymond Hatton (in the role of Count Jules de Destin of "Destiny of Battle") fell in love with Mrs. Pickford. Triangular love tribe ends in France with the Great War (World War I, in retrospect), complicating its life considerably. A film by Cecil B. DeMille, the most fun, if it's propaganda. Torping and sinking a ship carrying Pickford is "typical." The plot of war becomes dramatic, as Pickford slowly becomes a spy for France, while the Germans occupy her ancestral home. Of course, German boy Holt arrives. It was hard to believe that they were so long as to recognize each other as they moved for rape, but it was dark; and before the events, they believed one another dead. The film goes all the way in symbolism. Pickford was, by the way, Canadian - though few could deny that he was not a "little American" for all his intentions and purposes. FUN spot extras, which later became major stars include Wallace Beery, Colleen Moore and Ramon Novarro - in particular, watch Mr. Novarro showing "star" quality during one of the most memorable sequences of the movie : Pickford and the wounded soldier greet one another, being taken by her on a stretcher. Novarro even makes Mary Pickford write a letter for him; obviously, has a future in images. Also, the future is Ben Alexander, who plays the boy "Bobby"; he becomes a trustworthy actor and grows and becomes partner of Jack Webb on "Dragnet". <br /> <br /> ******* Little American (7/12/17) Cecil B.
