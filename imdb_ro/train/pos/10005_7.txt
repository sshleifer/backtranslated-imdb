Give it an art ... to make a thriller with a slow rhythm. The story unfolds in beautiful volumes, while you do not even notice that it's happening. Robin Williams. The angle of sexuality in the movie may seem useless and probably affect how much you enjoy the film. However, the base plot is very committed. The movie does not hurry up and still aglow enough to ask you. Direction is good. Using lights to achieve the desired effect of suspense and unexpected is good. Very nice 1 watch watch if you want to turn around and hear a thrilling short story!
