This movie is hilarious, original, and beautifully guided. I became a BIG BAD SWIM band, aiming to make film festivals whenever and wherever I can. I've seen it about a dozen times now, and every time the audience's enthusiastic response confirmed my feeling that this is one of the best movies that will go out over the years. At almost all the festivals he has promoted, he has sold or won the "Audience Favorite" award. It is clear that people love this movie, and even more clearly why they do. The cinema is superb, the brilliant characterization and action, the fantastic end, and the compassionate direction, wisdom and perfect art of synchronization. It's hard to believe this is Ishai Setton's first film. I hope it will be released soon so that everyone can see it.
