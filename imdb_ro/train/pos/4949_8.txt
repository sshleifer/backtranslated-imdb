10 ITEMS OR LESS is one of the "under radar" images that is drenched in the simplicity that most independent films have: honest, ad hoc performances by the two leaders - Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega who set a complementary duo if is not unlikely. The biggest thing is that the whole movie seems unlikely despite the roots of the "road movie". How the abnormal character of Morgan Freeman, psychically (not physically), reaches where this little girl meets an unhealthy relationship with her current supervisor (who also happens to receive her with her filming husband played by Bobby Cannavale in a small role) is somehow left to us to confess more than deduct their wandering witch - two people on the opposite sides of the coin of society - is misleadingly simple. So in short, while there is no bang! moments of terrible revelations of the earth, this film is a piece of joy that has probably been lost in a mix of Indians that came out in 2006, but it is worth seeing, even for its honesty.
