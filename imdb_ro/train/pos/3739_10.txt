I really like this movie. Bozz is an extremely cool soldier who does not have to be intimidated and does not want to go to war. His person is similar to Yossarian in Catch-22, Joseph Heller's classic novel about men and war. This film, however, is not established in a war zone, but in a preparatory battle-ready battle. This wonderful film refers to the fact that the Vietnam War was a mistake, and those men who were bound to be sacrificed for a losing cause. Colin Farrell is brilliant as Bozz, a soldier who has shown a great deal of genuine love and compassion for his soldier, as he scorned and disobeyed the institution that was trying to kill him. Bozz is completely cool and non-plussed, testing and tweaking military superiors, getting their goat on any occasion. He is a figure of Jesus Christ, with a degree of psychology, "salvaging" his soldiers and showing those who really need it, leaving this man's army. Action and action are clear and credible and as a "bedroom," Tigerland goes down with Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket as one of the first three films in Vietnam, in my opinion. FIVE STARS, a top pick.
