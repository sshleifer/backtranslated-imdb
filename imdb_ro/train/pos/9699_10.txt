Something about "Paulie" touched my heart for as few movies do. It's a spiritual, funny but emotional movie. It's a late end to becoming a fan of this movie. I did not see Paulie until May 2004 and since then I ordered the Widescreen DVD from an eBay seller. The special effects of Paulie's show are great. My son asked me how the bird knew so many phrases. Probably my favorite part of the movie is when Paulie is in the company of Gena Rowlands (Ivy) followed by Cheech Marin (Ignacio). Tony Shalhoub (Misha) plays a great role as the good man. You roots for him all the way through the movie. <br /> <br /> You can not go wrong renting or buying this movie!
