Snobs and pseudo-experts consider it "far from the best De Sica". Those who suffer from a serious lack of innocence will find a problem related to this masterpiece. De Sica spoke in a very direct way. His Italianity does not have a complicated examination of modern Italian films or pagan self-parody of Pietro Germi, Mario Monicelli, Visconti's solemnity, or Antonioni's cold observation. De Sica told us stories like a father sitting on the edge of his children's bed before he slept. There is no attempt to intellectualize. Miracolo A Milan and, to a lesser extent, Il Giudizio Universale are realistic fairy tales or what we call magical realism today. The film is a jewel from the beginning to the end and Toto is a kind of character that you accept with an open heart, but which, of course, requires a heart for you. Cinema in the purest form. Magnificent.
