Marjorie, a young woman who works in a museum and lives with two fellow female colleagues, Pat and Terry. One night she enters the car and is attacked by a man with a knife. His plan is to rape her, but she manages to escape. Now, one day, when Marjorie's roommates work, her attack comes over there. His name is Joe. A long fight begins against this man. But then he manages to spray his eyes and mouth with repellent insects, things that will kill him if he does not get help soon. It taps and makes Joe subject to the same physical and psychic attacks he (1986) is directed by Robert M. Young.It is based on the controversial 1982 off-Broadway game by William Mastrosimone.Farrah Fawcett, who has hardly lost the cancer battle last year is marvelous like Marjorie. James Russo, who played the attacker in the game, is convincing that Joe. Alfre Woodard and Dia na Scarwid are wonderful as Pat and Terry. James Avery is seen as Guard Guard. He has a Golden Globe nomination. This is not a movie that you should have fun with. Asking a question is justifiable revenge. It's not a perfect movie, but I recommend it.
