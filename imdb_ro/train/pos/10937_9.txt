For all the hoopla, respect and recognition that this film receives from Kung Fu historians, they are still not clearly missing in some critical areas: actions and battle scenes. But I have to say that this plot is probably the best and most original I've ever seen in a martial arts movie. Five Deadly Revenue, no doubt, we must not only see a movie you can watch again and again; but I also have to say that once you've seen it, you feel it could have been even better. It leaves you the way you want something, you want more. Chang Cheh sets up the beautiful story for a masterpiece, but fails to bring them more to the action we want. The fighting styles in the movie really capture the viewer (Centipede, Snake, Scorpio, Lizard, Toad) and are shown, but the battles are considerably short. The Toad and Snake styles are particularly interesting and should have been presented much, much more, in fact, turtle frogs are killed in the middle of the movie. Quite interesting with this film, the absence of constant action or struggle leads to the development of a wonderful plot, this being one of the few kung fu movies where you are really interested in the story and worrying about the outcome. This film has a dark and vicious tone and is attracted to vibe. Disrupted weapons and torture tactics are used throughout the movie and added to the movies they feel. To start the movie and introduce the producer Clan Poison Chang Cheh takes us to a dirty prison. The ending battle scenes are certainly good, but they seem to be camouflaged and, in a way, you expect more. Still, this film is the best of the Shaw brothers and it's pretty nice. My overall impression of the movie will end with this: the styles the fighters have used did not show us and have not presented us in detail, sadly the director had the goods for something extraordinary right at the fingertips and it did not extend on it. I wondered what could have been with this movie, still one of the best. 8 out of 10 on the scale.
