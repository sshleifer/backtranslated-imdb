Personally, I think the film was very professional, I loved choreography and acting. The plot is also captivating and mysterious. The movie itself is very emotional and what I liked the most is that it makes you think later. Antonio Gades has spent the rest of his role all the way, and I have to say that is one of my favorite pictures, and Saura is a great director.
