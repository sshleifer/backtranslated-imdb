Ira Levin's deathtrap is one of those mystery films in Sleuth's tradition, which would be very easy to spoil, given any real examination of the plot of the film. Therefore, I will shortly say that it refers to a play, a man who is a famous mystery dramatist, another man who is a promising writer, the playwright's wife who is much younger and sexy than the role should have been and a German psychic for travel. Director Sidney Lumet, no stranger to filming, is good enough for most of the tension that the film has to do. The dialogue is fast, fresh and spiritual. Michael Caine excels in such roles. Christopher Reeve is useful and actually increases on you as you see it more. Irene Worth stands out as a funny psychic. How about Dyan Cannon? Lumet's love packed them back in those pants that really fit and probably wore her most crowded heels around her, but she's very stupid in this role - a role that should have been given to an actress older and sometimes less seductive. But why read with an obvious attempt to bribe male spectators when nothing will change it now? Deathtrap is fun, sophisticated, smart and stylish. The mystery has some blatant deficiencies, which makes little less, and I was not completely satisfied with the end, but Caine and Reeve's eyes under Lumet's lead with Levin's high verbiage were enough to embrace my interest and keep him captive the whole length of the film.
