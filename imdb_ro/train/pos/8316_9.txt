I watched this movie every time I got it, back in the seventies when it came out on the cable. It was my introduction to Harlem, which fascinated me then (and by Bill Clinton). I was still very young and the film made a big impression. It was wonderful to see a movie about other young girls who grew up, trying to decide who they wanted to be and doing some bad choices as well as the good ones. I was amazed at the beauty of Lonette McKee, the greatest dresses she finally wore, and the charming dialogue. Like someone raised by a single mother, I could really identify myself with these girls and their lives. It's funny, these characters seem closer to me than Beyonce Knowles!
