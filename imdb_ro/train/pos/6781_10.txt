When an actor has to act as actor, fictional or factual, the task becomes more difficult than playing a role. In double life, Ronald Coleman has overcome himself as Anthony John, the double tortured personality. He put in that character all talent and sincerity. Facial expressions, manners, walking, and position were eloquent about what Anthony John was going through while playing Othello on stage. Coleman did a very good Shakespearean actor in those short Othello scenes that were part of this film's jewel. Closups of Coleman's face as Othello tortured by doubts about Desdemona's fidelity were in themselves scenes worth watching.Add to that, his character is out of desperation scene and only someone with Coleman's depth of perception can touch. It was like seeing Spence Tracy as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, except that this double role was much deeper and tougher. Shelly Winters looked so sweet, vulnerable and gorgeous at the same time and added her talent to the movie. It is believed that Ronald Coleman liked his role in this film, above everything else he had played, and won the Oscar for Best Actor in 1947. I would see you this movie repeatedly and never I feel bored.
