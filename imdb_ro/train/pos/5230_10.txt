In fact, I liked this movie very, very much. Not because of a plot, actor, jokes, no. I liked it because it is one of the worst movies ever created. It's so blemish, so bad it gets terribly funny. Some jokes are actually wonderful, but the rest makes me pray for unemployment for the screenwriter. "Men in White" are so stupid and stupid that you can do just two things. Turn off the TV or rotate it on the floor laughing (beer helps you a lot :). I chose the second option.
