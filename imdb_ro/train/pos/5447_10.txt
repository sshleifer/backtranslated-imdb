The personal rules of taste when it comes to talking about movies such as this precious little jewel. Back in the eighties, in the early eighties, I discovered this film, like many released at that time, "Night Patrol", "Bad Manners" or even "King Frat", artwork and blur on the back of the covers,. Of course you are of age, movies like this I have already mentioned, as well as stuff like Screwballs and many others have captured your imagination and fortunately many years later I still remember something with love and some with contempt many movies that help keep my love like this parody or pastic. It did many years after the huge success of the "Animal House" and after seeing how it escaped over the years, now I know there will be no way that this movie would ever eclipse the box office dollars nor would it be remembered, just like the National Lampoon holiday. honestly, not everything that labeled the National Lampoon logo was a wild success, yet Me Class Reunion remains one of my favorite movies over time with easily recognizable characters such as Bob Spinnaker, played to perfection by Gerrit Graham, so good in Charles Band's "Terrorvision", which still remains in the glories of his past. Or what about Stephen Furst's tower, which turns into headaches, while lazy lazy mad college crazy Hubert Downs. Which makes me think. As I have already said, the personal taste does not resist. People can be so cruel that they will never win prizes or be compared to others in the world of comedy. He has merit. It was one of the previous scenarios, written by John Hughes, who would later be one of my own favorite in his "Weird Science", as well as a wonderful theme song by the great Gary US Bonds. <br /> <br /> What else can I say is a movie waiting to be rediscovered from time to time.
