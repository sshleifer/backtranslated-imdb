The first time I saw Buster Keaton's first debut film and I have to admit I liked it very much and only want to have crossed it years ago. The Rohauer Bloc from the outset warns that the unique three-year nitrate print was rediscovered and saved in 1954 just in time before the combustion, and many frames that seemed bonded without bonding were separate. So it's a rocky view in the places, but I've seen and I've survived much worse. It would have been okay like the three short films, but as an approach to Intolerance, it's inventive and funny from the beginning finish: In the Stone Age, with baddie Wallace Beery riding an elephant and good riding buster a companion brontosaurus; In the Roman era, Buster riding a wheelchair trolley adapted for sleighing, there are no signs of parking in Latin; In this technological age of need for speed and Greed his car fits nicely to the bits at the first cock. Both he and Beery are after the Girl over the ages, an endless bastard. Favorite song: As a pilgrim, he is beaten back on a rock edge, but still blows a kiss on the camera - a second or two amazing! Great stuff, reaffirming my love of silent film comedy.
