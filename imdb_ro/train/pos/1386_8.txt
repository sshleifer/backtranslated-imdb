Three teenage girls in an incomplete triangular relationship. The base of the triangle is just there. At the top is Marie, a serious, short and weak tomboy with a Belmondo-like facial structure. Her best friend is the physical and psychological contrariety: coquette, bastard - I dare say fat - and want her first kiss with a boy but not too ready for her first sexual encounter. Because of her wickedness, the boys do not seem interested and it lasts. The other foot of the top is a beautiful blonde vampire "fatal fillets". She is deeply involved in the synchronized swimming sport that is at a competitive level. Marie sees her during a competition at the local public pool. Marie is insinuated in the vamp's life, using the desire to become a swimmer synchronized as an argument. Vampa has the reputation of being a slut, dealing with any male couple who orbits around her. Marie is not eliminated by this reputation. Put your accent on reputation. <br /> <br /> The first half is set up. We'll see a lot of synchronous swimming as we get acquainted with the three faces. Finally, the story leaves behind the synchronization of swimming and focuses on top-of-the-line relationships. Then unexpected things happen. It's a trademark of French films to get rid of the wits of wisdom on the viewer. This is no exception. This is about ceilings and death. See the movie to learn more. The director says the use of synchronous swimming is objective. This sport for women is a metaphor for a girl's life: cute and feminine on the surface, while working hard and competitive underneath. A series of scenes triggers this point: elegant moves and smiles for the audience, feet hitting underwater. The title in French is also suggestive: "napuve", or octopus, suggests that an individual has to juggle more pressure at the same time.
