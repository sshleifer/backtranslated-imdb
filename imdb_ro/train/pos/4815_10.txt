This is on my top list of favorite movies all the time! It's a fantastic and insightful movie. It was interesting from a historical and wonderful point of view! I thought Emily Blunt's actor was fantastic and Rupert Friend was a fantastic Albert, the best actor was chosen for Albert. The costumes were wonderful, and the settings and scenes, such as the opera house, were stunning and detailed. I loved him, everything! I liked childhood scenes when she was "harassed" by John Conroy. And where her mother says she has to go upstairs with an adult. One of the writers did it! They produced this fantastic script! <br /> <br /> Much worth the awards they have received. (Oscar and BAFTA winning Sandy Powell for her costume design.) BAFTA for the best make-up and hair, an Oscar in the best performance in the direction of art, the best achievement of the costume, the best achievement in makeup. Design, also nominated for best actress Emily Blunt, CDG for excellence in film costume design - Hampton's International Awarding Ceremony for a public prize for best PFCS narrative for best design costume.Sudbury Cinefest, do not say what. VFCC for best actress, Emily Blunt.) In total 10 wins and 11 nominations! Very good! http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0962736/awards Take a look, really exciting! Personally, friend Rupert should have received a prize.
