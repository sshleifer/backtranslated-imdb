Freebird is the perfect marriage of road comedy, tapeworm, stoner, and British movie of good sensation. These are the brilliant characters who destroyed this film by other films of this genre. Stars Phil Daniels, Gary Stretch and Geoff Bell have great chemistry and make their characters really enjoyable and realistic. The main story focuses around their journey from London to Wales, as well as the adventures and shortcomings that take place along the way. This little film also has a big heart - it's not just for the fans of the bike but it's based on the relationships of the character, including dreams and regrets, like Fred's Gary Stretch desiring for the family he left behind. Cinema is also wonderful - a love letter for the countryside of Wales, as well as the capture of the streets of London and the typical pub life of the country. funny story - I would recommend Freebird in a heartbeat!
