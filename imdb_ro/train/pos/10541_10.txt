I thought it was a great movie. The theme song is sweet! :) Anyway, the only thing that bothered me somewhat was when it all had to be normal. It was very weird and unrealistic. The big cable company is mainly what I'm talking about. Besides, the film was very creative. I think all the acting was well done, the actors played perfectly the characters of their characters. Everything fits well. It is a shame that it is not a soundtrack. That would have been great! Because this is a Canadian movie, and because it's one of my favorites, I give this movie 10 out of 10!
