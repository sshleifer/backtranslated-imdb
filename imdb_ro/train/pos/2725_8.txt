"In Cold Blood," adapted by director Richard Brooks of the famous novel, Truman Capote, deals with the brutal and senseless killing of a four-person family by a pair of unhappy criminals. The film excels as a character study of the killers, especially the man with trigger Perry Smith (Robert Blake). The cast includes some easy-to-recognize names, but it brings them to life with ease. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson are excellent as two criminals with disparate personalities. They play each other effortlessly, while Blake also has a lot of opportunities to explore the idiosyncrasies of his character. The rest of the distribution is only average and is not worth noting. Richard Brooks received Oscar nominations for both his screenplay and his direction. In my opinion, both were excellent, although the scenario does not compute wrongly with some inappropriate narratives in later phases. Oscar-nominated Cinema by Conrad Hall is also of prime importance, just like editing. Also noteworthy is Quincy Jones's jazz score that provided the last four Oscar nominations. Unlike many other crime films, it does not shine violence. Brooks turns the killers into pitiful characters, rather than their conviction. If you agree or disagree with this feeling, the film presents an interesting alternative to Hollywood's usual approach. We recommend the movie for this reason and also for the expertise with which the technical aspects are dealt with.
