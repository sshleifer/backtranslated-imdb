This very funny British comedy shows what would happen if a section in London, in this case, Pimlico, declare itself independent of the rest of the UK and the post-war laws, taxes and restrictions. Eternal chaos is what would happen. The explosion of a war bomb leads to the discovery of ancient documents showing that Pimlico was ceded to the Duchy of Burgundy centuries ago, a long, forgotten historical note. For the new Burgundians, however, this is an unexpected opportunity to live as long as they want without any interference from Whitehall. Stanley Holloway is excellent as a minority politician of the city, who suddenly is one of the smallest nations in the world. Dame Margaret Rutherford is a delight as a history teacher, with Pimlico. Others starring Hermione Baddeley, Paul Duplis, Naughton Wayne, Basil Radford and Sir Michael Hordern. Welcome to Burgundy!
