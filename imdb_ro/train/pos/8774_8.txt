In the late 1800s, Errol Flynn (as James J. Corbett) works at a bank and enjoys participating in local battles with co-worker and friend Jack Carson (Walter Lowrie). One day, beautiful Alexis Smith (like Victoria Ware) enters Comstock Bank, where Mr. Flynn works. Flynn is so taken with the elegant beauty of Mr. Smith, he offers to carry his retirement bag. Smith is secretly taken by Flynn, but he is weakened by his excitement. Flynn, the good deed (in fact, an attempt to take over), receives it as an "Olympic club" conveniently includes a gym (with boxing equipment). However, Flynn's furious way and practical joke (he gawk men on parallel bars) irritate members of the "Club". When a British boxing champion visits him, members strive to bring Flynn to fight with the man. They are hopeful that Flynn will resign, humiliated by his defeat - but, Flynn wins! <br /> <br /> The first time producer Robert Buckner puts together a beautiful package for Warner Brothers and director Raoul Walsh. Mister. Buckner certainly enjoys the success of his contribution (script) to the brilliant studio "Yankee Doodle Dandy". Unfortunately, this story is positively ridiculous. There was a "Gentleman Jim" - this story is supposed to make James J. Corbett's true autobiography "The Roar of the Crowd" - but this film has to be significantly fictionalized. Flynn is a very attractive man; he manages the script easily and should have been recognized in the early 1940s as an excellent actor. Many of Flynn's characterizations were (are?) Forgotten as great performances, and this is one of them. Smith does well and his feminine interest, transmitting his emotional abilities to the spectator. Director Walsh makes the appearance look smooth and extravagant. Unlike Alan Hale (as Pat Corbett), Lon McCallister ("Paging Mr. Corbett"), Gentleman Jim (1942) Raoul Walsh ~ Errol Flynn, Alexis Smith, Alan Hale
