So we were lucky to see this fantastic movie at the Palm Springs International Film Festival. At the entrance to the theater I received a small book of opinion that would be used for the personal evaluation of the film. Looking at the book, I turned to my wife and said, "How many movies in your life do you think you can appreciate as gorgeous? Only 5 for me." But then, watching the interaction between Peter Falk and Paul Reiser, while watching the spectacular landscape of the New York State film, I slowly slowed down, hitting the movie in a category at a time. Of course it was good, but the overall reputation of the actors and a performance awarded by a man who, unfortunately, probably will be detained for a waterproof carrying a detective rather than this film, the film jumped to an excellent level. <br /> <br /> By the end of the movie, there were few dry eyes in my house, and my heart, usually stoic and painful, melted like Grinch's, and I came to give her a gorgeous. This image is a must for anyone with parents. Not violence or nudity, but powerful language.
