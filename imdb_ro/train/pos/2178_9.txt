With lots of sunshine, brilliant light and shadow that filters through the windows and in the rooms, watching pictures moving through crowds with the camera, fast editing and extreme close-ups and photos, photography is the thing in this exciting, artistic film made . The film of this film begins as a bit of a puff in connection with a beauty contest. The film begins on a hot Sunday at the local swimming pool, where we meet the wonderful Lucienne aka Lulu (played by Louise Brooks) - a bit of a show in front of the gay men by the pool, soon deciding to enter to represent France in the Beauty Miss contest Europe, largely for the noise of his fiery, jealous fianc√©, crazy (indeed, a rather annoying man). By gathering the track, the ten contestants are shown in swimsuits, while the winner is chosen as the one who receives the longest applause (I was wondering that the girls could go slower to prolong their duration - and therefore, applaud the monastery?). Lulu is soon pursued by a prince and a Maharaja, but her hot drink does not like the attention given by other men or her adorable audience, for this (I think he only wants it in his house, cooking his meals, and Louise Brooks is beautiful and charming, her presence contributes to the improvement of this film, but it is really the way it is photographed that has kept me most interested. A little distraction is the strange dubious sound, which is a bit off. The print on this version looked very clear and full of beautiful contrast though. Following this, I just tried to ignore the sound problems and watch the video, and I found the movie to be excellent, well worth it to see.
