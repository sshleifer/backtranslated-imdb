I really liked this episode, which was a big surprise, given the bad reputation she seems to have acquired. From a purely written perspective, the "16 mm Altar" is an absolute treatment with a fantastic dialogue and character analysis, typically Sterling. In particular, I enjoyed the philosophical indulgences of the episode, addressing themes of existence and reality, balancing it with more psychological topics, such as denial, pride and desire. The "sixteen millimeter altar" is an episode about how these ideas based on a rejection of accepting change can apparently face a constantly changing person in the rest of the world. It's also a fantastic twilight twilight example; one that explores the mind, rather than the world outside it. These elements come together very nicely to create a challenging and incredibly exciting 25-minute thought. The episode is not without its flaws, which are mainly in Lupino and Leisen shoes. Ironically, I felt that Lupino was not convinced of everything, with only a few scenes that could be considered memorable. This, of course, being an absolute shame, considering how well Sterling wrote his character. Moreover, Leisen did not seem to know what to do with most of his characters, sometimes standing on the set next to anything - which probably explains why he accepted the poor performance in Lupino half the time -. Fortunately, Balsam does a good job of covering a lot of weak places, helping to redeem the show from a perspective that acts at least. As I said before, however, if you are a fan of classical film and brain science fiction, this should not be as bad as it ever did. In addition to the writing I mentioned above, the episode also has a fantastic photo (it still amazes me that the show looks good for almost fifty years later!) And a pretty decent design. Overall, the "sixteen millimeters altar" is a big episode, and above all, it's certainly one that makes you think.
