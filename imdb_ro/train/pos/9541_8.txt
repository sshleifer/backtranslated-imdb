Wow baby, this is really an oro / gore in Asia, and an unusual movie. This is a Japanese splatterfest that reminded me a little of Tetsuo, unless blood and courage exists, there is a bizarre love story. It's hard to imagine how they dreamed of this amazing film, with some extraterrestrial creatures that infect humans as parasites, turning them into a partial car or supposing cyborgs. The only thing wrong with these creatures after they take over a man is that they have to kill each other and eat the other. hmmm, yum yum. This would probably be called an industrial splatter or something like that, with a superb soundtrack to add fun. The film also borrows little of Carpenter's "The Thing" in the design and effects of the creature. I would put this in the must-have category for gorehounds because there are non-stop carnage and some very fine gore. And you have to have stoners, because you do not even have to read the subtitles, just the visual images are sufficient for a journey of mind. The design of small creatures living in the human body like a fetus reminded me a little of Frank Henenlotter's films, which is another homage to some excellent gore films with a sense of humor. "Meatball Machine" is a great fun for gorehounds, there is no doubt about it, and I just loved it.
