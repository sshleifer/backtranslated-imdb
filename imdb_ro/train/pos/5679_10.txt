Following the success of the second installment, Richard Curtis and Ben Elton decided that Blackadder should have a third appearance. This time, instead of Tudor times or Elizabethan times, Edmund Blackadder (BAFTA nominee Rowan Atkinson) lives during the French Revolution. Accompanied by Baldrick (Tony Robinson) Blackadder, now the stupid but loving one, is the "faithful" witness to George, the royal regent of Wales (Hugh Laurie). Throughout the third series at the awesome sitcom, Blackadder tries everything he can to become rich and powerful. He tries to pick a gentleman for a round neighborhood, tries to sell a book, tries to win a bet on The Scarlet Pimpernel, tries to be a man on the highway and eventually presents himself as the Prince. This is a very good installment for the popular comedy. Includes appearances by Robbie Coltrane, Tim McInnerny, Miranda Richardson and Stephen Fry. She won BAFTA for Best Comedy Series and was nominated for Best Design and Best Makeup. Rowan Atkinson was the fifth largest British actor, comedian comedian number 24, and eighth on Britain's favorite comedian, Edmund Blackadder was No. 3 in the top 100 TV characters. The biggest comic characters in the world, and Blackadder (all four series) was No. 2 on the best Sitcom in the UK. Impressive!
