This movie has everything you want from an action movie. Explosions, shooters, bad boys, and boys worse. It's fun to see James Belushi using his humor to get out of the trouble he's been through since he stole $ 12 million from the last big Captain. That's what I call cheese, of course I was fun I'm watching this movie. It's much better than all the direct DVD dumps that are being made today. If you can go over the stupid story, you'll find that this movie has quite a lot of surprises in stock. You may feel that breathing is predictable, but the rapid pace of this film does not give you time to think too much about it, which is a blessing because this movie is not related to the revelation of the last twist. just the title is a little misleading and this may be the reason why so many people hate this movie, they probably expected a movie about mobs instead of double brothers.
