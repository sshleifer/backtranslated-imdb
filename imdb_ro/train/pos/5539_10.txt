When I watched this movie for the first time, it was a recorded copy and the title was / is Caged Terror. I still have the tape and I confess I have looked at it several times from start to finish! Film is a very low budget, and dialogue is often unintentionally funny! I received some of my friends to watch this and I had some big laughs about the terrible scenario. The movie refers to a couple (remember it's the beginning of the 70s, so I'm just a man too lame!) I'm going on a weekend trip to what I think was supposed to be in NY. They have a hilarious dialogue after they have caught and eaten a fish, and the girl looks at the death of the fish and they ate it! The guy turns around with something strange about how he was eating the fish, and now he was a part of it, and he was leaving; - And she's a nice man! Hard, very hard man! LOL! Anyway, a few vets from Vietnam, one of those who play the flute, come along, I think. (In any case, they are musicians!) The guys are clearly attracted to the girl and when the couple proves unfriendly, they end up with night terror. The guy ends up in cages in a chicken basket and has to watch his girlfriend kidnapped by the two guys. In fact, by the end of the night, it seems to be pretty in it, and when the morning comes, the guys leave, and the girl and the guy are free to leave. It is assumed that the guy learned a lesson about how to treat people, and the girl has a smile on his face! :) Anyway, I would recommend this movie a lot to anyone looking for a damn laugh! Never amuse me! If I could find this on DVD and replace the old tape version, I would actually buy it again is a classic camp! You must like this stuff!
