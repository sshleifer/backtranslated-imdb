This film is not morbid, nor depressing. It's - sad, because AIDS in the early 90s - it was sad. But his real message is love and perseverance. Marcus and Tom have been in a long and loving relationship. Their devotion to the other is obvious immediately, and once the AIDS ravages climb and become the focal point of their lives, you will see the force and commitment that are truly unimaginable. When "Silverlake Life" was originally released, I was deeply involved in HIV / AIDS education and health care, volunteering as a counselor at an HIV / AIDS clinic. The film spoke to me that no other AIDS film on his day could, because Mark and Tom were real people, experiencing the experiences we had seen daily in real life. I suddenly knew the experience of what was to look at AIDS to eat in the past, vibrant, young, healthy; seeing Mark and Tom going on in the movie was a lot like watching my real-life friends get damaged. It touched me in a way that, even in all these years later, still affects me.
