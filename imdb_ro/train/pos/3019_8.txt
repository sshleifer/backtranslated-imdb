For starters, I loved Göta kanal 1 had plenty of jokes classics, including the guy fucking canoe which seems to be always in the wrong place at the wrong time, still operate on the same type in Göta kanal 2 movie, but according my performance, Heb's performance is not as fun as in the first movie, you actually do not notice it. One thing that made me think bad about this movie is the choice of boats, in this movie there are only racing boats, they are certainly fast, but those who do not waves like the big floating villas used in the first film, I liked the old the best and these new ships make one of the last scenes look ridiculous when the canoe man suddenly jumps out of it to escape the "big waves" from those small fast boats. Really a minus. You have to accept that we no longer live in the same Sweden until 1974. This film also contains a little more violence than the first. Although the movie was great in all. I just focused on some opinions I was disappointed about, but the rest of the movie was up to my expectations, so go see it! It's worth the money.
