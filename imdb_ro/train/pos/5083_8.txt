In the hands of smaller actors than Claudette Colbert and Robert Ryan, this movie could have become stupid. But with these two experienced spectators, I found "Silent Fury" a very interesting and pleasant mystery. When their wedding is interrupted by a stranger who claims that Colbert is already married and that he was the best man at the wedding, one can feel that there is a kind of plot against her at work. While Colbert, Ryan and her lawyer have decided to reject the alien's request to obtain a prior marriage, they are met at every step with more evidence that seems to strengthen the claim that she is indeed married. Although it's not hard to figure out who's the main baddie, it's still very fun, as the intensity and rhythm of the story grows. Overall, a good, solid, mysterious film with good performances by the two main actors, as well as a fine cast including Paul Kelly, is often underestimated.
