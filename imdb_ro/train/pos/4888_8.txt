This has just been broadcast on the BBC and I'm absolutely excited to have seen it. As the credits rolled, the distribution only made sure they would let me go. After just five minutes I was completely immersed in this beautiful movie. Yes, it was a formidable and predictable formula, but that added somehow its charm. Flashbacks of the forties have been great placements and have captured an equal feeling in several productions. A true movie of good sensation, punctuated throughout remarkable music. When it's released, I'll buy it!
