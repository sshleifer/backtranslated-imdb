this big flick.it from Disney is the story of an elderly baseball coach (Dennis Quaid) who was once on the way to the big leagues as a pitcher, but suffered a career that ended the injury. Morris (Quaid) gets a try with a major league team and even makes it on the roster. This is a great family movie. It's inspirational, but do not pour over fun and too much fun. Adults will enjoy this film as well as children.it is based on a true story, although I'm sure the filmmakers have got some freedoms in telling the story.Quaid is sensational as the title character, very convincing. if you are looking for a movie the whole family can enjoy, do not look any further
