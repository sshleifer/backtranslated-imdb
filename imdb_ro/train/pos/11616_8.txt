I have read with great interest the only comment made before me on this film and I would like to say first of all that I understand the view of the previous user who commented very well on this film: seen from an Israeli perspective, you can imagine very well that this film reaches very sensitive issues and that the smallest detail can be of great importance to a viewer who is more or less directly concerned by the events described in this film. What I would like to say is that "distortion" was presented at a Geneve Film Festival in November 2005 (Cinéma tout écran) where it won the public prize ("Prix du public'in French"). For what affects me, I liked Mr Bouzaglo's "nerve room", which, in my opinion, was a very good atmosphere of tension and extreme unease in the film, and I think most of the Swiss spectators have appreciated this in the film . However, this perspective may seem wholly alien to an Israeli spectator, but not so surprising with Swiss spectators, since Switzerland is a country that NEVER has been subjected to any terrorist attack. Therefore, it is no surprise that the Geneva audience considered this film with a more "detached" perspective. I would also like to quote what Mr Bouzaglo said when he was interviewed by a newspaper in Geneva (translate from French): "After 50 years of living here and after we have gone through all these violence, we can ask if it is still possible to stay normal We may sometimes believe it would be easier to commit suicide than live It's like the characters in my movie "on the edge" That's why the private detective, which is somehow "voyeur," is the happiest person in the movie, because he gains his existence because of the system, takes advantage of this situation. "This is basically the main thing that I and the Swiss public, in my opinion, underlined in this film and that I did not pay attention to inconsistencies about the characters in the film that the previous reviewer showed with great precision and humor. So, to summarize, the different country = a different perspective, but I think this is somewhat awesome, because it reassures me for what affects the future of the cinema, that is, it is never the subject of a "single" formatted "thinking.
