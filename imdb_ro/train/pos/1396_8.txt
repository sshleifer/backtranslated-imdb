Perhaps one of the first examples of tracking a suspicious, dramatic (in this case, Balance of Terror) episode with an easier adventure, Shore Leave is the first real test in the name of Star Trek writers to produce a more entertaining play, and while the formula is not quite right in this entry (the true triumph is Trouble with Tribbles in Season 2), the laughs come quite fast, as long as the viewer is willing to allow all things. <br /> <br /> Conversion from the tradition of the show, Enterprise is not in any correct mission in this episode. Instead, Kirk found a perfect planet for his crew to spend free time: a well-deserved break after three months of uninterrupted work. The Earth-like planet is very attractive, but it takes only a few minutes before something strange happens: Dr. McCoy begins to have visions of a white rabbit that seems to come directly from Lewis Carroll's work. Soon, other people start experiencing similar things: a woman encounters a Don Juan-like character, Sulu has a snap-in with a samurai, and Kirk faces a double encounter with the past, almost love and the guy he used to take him to the Academy. Throw into an incredibly real tiger and it's easy to see why Kirk and Spock are determined to figure out what's going on before someone gets hurt. The idea is a classic one: the idyllic place proves to be away from the heavens. Emotion of the episode on this topic is quite successful, it was not a dark turn of events that does not rest well with the rest (of course, everything is doing well and ends again) and the general desire of the cast to show a more fun part (most notably and ironically, otherwise hilarious William Shatner). And yet, Shore Leave deserves recognition that it was another good example of writers who are trying new things, things previously unseen: the definition of Star Trek success. 7.5 / 10
