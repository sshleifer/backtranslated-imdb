Dragon Hunters must be the best animated movie I've ever seen. It was a drop of fault. The movie is about some money-seeking travelers, their blue fur dog that shines the fire and a girl who dreams of becoming a knight and are sent in a quest to go to the edges of the earth to kill the captivating world, an impossible dragon huge. But honestly, it does not even matter what the film is about. Because it's very nice. Gravity in this fantastic world is different, so architectural blocks and earth spheres float around cathedrals and castles and villages, and there are lush floating forests of lily. The world is so creative, so beautiful and unique, with a kind of muted story book. The world looks like a set of gorgeous paintings. The monsters are also amazing as a fire dragon composed of a swarm of evil red bats. Some plots are not too original, as the main protagonists who want to have a farm from mice and men and do not seem able to do it in the world; but the gorgeous graphics, some very sinister scenes and evocative dialogue make this movie spectacular.
