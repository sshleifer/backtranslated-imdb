Some of Laurel's and Hardy's favorite films have a very, very small plot. Instead, I give them a rather playful situation and just let them be hilarious! Movies like HELP MATES and BUSY ORGANISM are among the funniest as you see boys working or cleaning the house. Here, in DIRTY WORK, most of the film is similar to the other two films - Stan and Ollie are baskets and spend most of the movie trying (quite unsuccessfully) to clean up a crazy teacher. Seeing Ollie falling through the basket, boys make a total mess out of the house, and Stanley's crazy behaviors work together to make a great movie. However, in a strange twist, there is also a really weird subplot that begins and finishes the film. It seems the teacher is really a crazy scientist and is working on a formula that makes things younger. Then, in the movie, you see them doing a duck in a duck and even in an egg! Since he just leaves boys in the room, is there any surprise what's going on here? While this subplot was not necessary, it worked quite well. What worked extremely well was the middle portion. Give the boys nothing interesting to do and you'll be amazed at the hilarious results. One of the best movies of the team and almost wins 9.
