Pure Orson Welles genius makes this one of the biggest movies. Welles is attracted to a murder conspiracy, only to be set up as an autumn man to whom he refers to the sarcastic commentary "The Big Dummy I am." The plot is so complex that I still do not know if the victim knew that his life would be lost. The scene of fireworks in the carnival mirror room is one of the most amazing films ever made. Only that scene deserves the admission price. This is the only time Rita Hayworth has ever played a complex but credible character. No one, except Welles, would have had the courage to cut his hair and paint him blonde. No one should miss this picture.
