I gave this movie so great, because it was really cute, very funny, all of them unpretentious. I went to see this movie when playing in the Philly area and was the center of a great party with friends. The film is well written and well put into practice, and though it feels a bit like a sitcom, rather a film that does not move away from the film. You just can not find comedies like this, where you do not have to shock people to be funny. The film focuses around a Ukrainian housekeeper who finds himself alone in search of a young couple who needs help. Although at first it helps, it soon adds more insanity to their lives when the couple has been negotiated. Things are getting more out of control until ... you have to see! The banter made me laugh, even after I left the theater. This movie puts me in good shape. I can not wait until it's released on DVD because I want this movie in my collection.
