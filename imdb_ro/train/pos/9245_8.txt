Jean Harlow and Clark Gable have been an excellent team on the screen and this can be the best movie together. Yes, Hold Your Man can be cheesy and predictable, but that's not what I like about the movie. I like to see Harlow and Gable together and in this movie they are simply wonderful. It is obvious that they really enjoyed working together, and this is part of what makes this wonderful movie. Spiritual dialogue, scenario and attention in detail are the other things that make this a good movie thing. I liked this movie the first time I saw it, and in every subsequent view I always noticed at least a new detail. For me, this is a sign of a great movie. Dialogue and script are better than most movies in this period (30 years). She adores classical movies, but I admit that most are just environments and sometimes I do not care. Hold Your Man is one of the exceptions. This has much to do with the fact that Hold Your Man is a "pre-code" movie. (The Hays Code was not executed until one year after Hold Your Man.) This movie could not be done under the code. It could have been done, but it would have been a totally different story. Blessed, the code was not executed until 1934. Otherwise, we would have missed this gem.
