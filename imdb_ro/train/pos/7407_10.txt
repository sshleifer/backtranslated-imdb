This movie took me with a total surprise. I looked 2 or 3 times. I really enjoyed this movie. There were many truths that brought this movie. I like all the characters in this movie. This movie has a lot of sense because, because society "gets more advanced" What does losing culture? Do not call preached. I can actually refer to this movie at my baby's hood and I'm losing my life, which will never come back or was not the same. This movie is on the first 5 movies I've ever watched. There is just such a raw truth that I feel when I look at the film and not the truth that you have to dig right in front of your face. The creators of this movie have done a great job and I really enjoyed this movie. This movie may not be for everyone, but if you have an open mind, I think you will love it.
