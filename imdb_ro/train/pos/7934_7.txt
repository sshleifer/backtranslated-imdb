According to this forum, I think you either love or hate him. Usually, how goes with all the movies. There is no need to try with others. Everything we do here is giving out opinions. I hired this movie last night and I want to come and cast my opinion in the mix. I was surprised at how many people I hit, though. There is a difference between a movie fan and a horror movie fan. I'm a horror film fan. Most film fans do not like horror movies. So many cinematic films of small size have gone out these days. It's hard to keep up. And what makes it hard to stay in these movies is how bad they are. I wanted to come and write a review of "Hood of the Living Dead," because it's pretty good compared to the rest of the junk there. There's nothing special, but those horror film makers who are trying to be too serious are making a terrible horror movie. I liked very much. You tell me there's no effort in that? And one more thing, I bet you all have these huge DVD collections that you're so proud of, but there's nothing more than Major Motion Pictures? Nothing is wrong with this, but you need to know how to appreciate the independent independent budget. I knew what I had when I looked at this movie. I will not be angry because I thought it would be a 100 million dollar movie. Some of you may have to stay with the Matrix again and again and never try to compare everything with the Matrix. And if the majority are under 24, that explains everything. Good movie people, check it out.
