this can not be "War and Peace," but the two Academy schools should not have come if it was not for James Wong Howe's genius ... this is one of the few movies you've ever fallen in love with and you came back without dissatisfaction. if you have any interest in what fictional or not, BB & C is a visual feast. I'm not saying it's his best work, I'm not an expert there. but the look of this movie is amazing. I like everything about it; Elsa Lanchester, cat, hoo-doo crazy, retro-downtown; but the way it was put on the movie is staggering. I really like the inconsistencies highlighted on this page above and the "special effects" that seem now back. everything creates a truly consistent world.
