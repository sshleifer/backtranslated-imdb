This epic of Cecil B. DeMille of the Old West contains what might be Jean Arthur's best interpretation as a hysterical, eccentric, incurable amoral, but courageous, daring, Calamity Jane. She pulled her! Gary Cooper is the most tactile, but he manages to say a few noisy words: "The plains are great, but sometimes they cross the trails ...". The story is a passion for ending all traps. All cowboys heroes in Western history seem to be there in a way, except for Jesse James. Even Abraham Lincoln opens the story in person (or, at least, DeMille would have thought so). There is no room for anything as evanescence as subtlety, this is a "stomp" in front of "the masses." One remarkable thing about this film is, however, that it is a complete, very early frontal attack on what Eisenhower would eventually call the "military industrial complex." It's not just about a story about gunmen, but about arming everyone for money, and doing that in the heart of Washington, but let's not go into politics. we are leaving this to DeMille, which can be guaranteed to be superficial. The main interest of this film is that all these years later I use the first film score composed by George Antheil, who has much to say about his autobiography, "Bad Boy of Music" Antheil seems to come from the "great sound" adopted by all the subsequent vestments, where the plains sing with countless cowboys voices and sounds in the sky, celebrate the open spaces and intersect me so it's not unusual, because I heard it a thousand times. But he seems to have been the first to summon the combined rustling of all sage brushes in this open sky symphony that has entered the history of the American myth and gave him a soundtrack that has not varied since then, but is, of course, appropriate. It's fun to see Anthony Quinn in an early appearance like an Indian Cheyenne. Gabby Hayes is there somewhere, but he's missing in the crowd. Gary Cooper meets everyone, rises in the sea, - but when did he ever make it small?
