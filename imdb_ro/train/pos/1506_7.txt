Before movies such as Texas Chain Massacre, Suspiria and Halloween changed horrible vision forever, there was a more gothic and much less violent genre. Movies like "Hammer Horror" and "Baby Rosemary" were what scared and blossomed the audience in the 60's and the early 70's. I can not tell you how many times I rented this movie during my childhood, but I did because there was something about it. I did not want to limit myself to the slasher and zombie films of the '70s and' 80s and movies like this production of the famous, but unfortunately gone, Amicus film company were a good start. <br /> <br /> Pro: A grandiose, weird music score. Strong performance from a star distribution. Brilliant cinema. A lot of old fashioned chills and chills, especially in the first and last vignette. Some haunted moments and images. Moves at a slow pace, but at the same time. The house is a scary, oppressive home. Great design design and set of decorations that give the film a true old Gothic sensation of horror. It depends more on mood and bloodless chills than on free gore and nudity for emotions. <br /> <br /> Cons: Some stimulus issues in the first half of the year. Apart from "Mantaua," the rest of the stories feel as though they were before. Clich√©s galore. The second story, "Waxworks," has an adventure and moments, but it is the weakest of the four in terms of frightening and suspense. The low budget really looks sometimes. Final Thoughts: After seeing this movie for the first time for many years, I see why we hired it so often. It's not a masterpiece in any way, but it's a good example of when horror movies have been made with style and class. Look at that with the lights off. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 5
