We have shown this film to university students in the law of discourse and the press, because their lessons are endless: Why speak of injustice is important and can bring about the changes sought by oppressed people. Why freedom of the press and freedom of expression are essential to democracy. This is a story about how apartheid was brought to the attention of the world through Steven Biko's activism and Donald Woods's journalism. It also offers an important lesson of free speech: "You can throw a candle, but you can not throw a fire. Once the flame begins to catch, the wind will blow it higher." (From Biko by Peter Gabriel, Shaking Tree).
