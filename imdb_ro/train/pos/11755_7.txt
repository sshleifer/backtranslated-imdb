I like this movie, but music at all graduate meetings is just bad. The fateful game took place in 1972. This means that the protagonists graduated in 1972. But almost all the music played on the dances, etc. are from the 1950s and very early in the 1960s. After I attended my 30th high school meeting, I can assure you that the last music to be played at the dance or dance of the former high school is the music of their parents. I understand the difficulty of finding relevant music in the 1970s - we all know what a musical moment was. But he was not completely deprived, and filmmakers should have been more careful. I found those very offensive dance scenes for the suspension of mistrust in the rest of the movie. He was a bad director and / or a manufacturer's decision.
