I watched this presentation on PBS in the U.S. when it was first released in 1988 (?). Assuming the miniseries were available on DVD, I bought the first edition of all three books last year. Since then I've been looking for the series on internet movie websites. Today I found this website. I'll give up the search. And I'd like to buy this full miniseries - 26 episodes. After I bought the DVDs, I would read each book, then watch the episodes for that book. That's what I did with Karla's trilogy by John LeCarre and Larry McMurty's Texas Ranger trilogy. Does anyone have suggestions for books or series of books that have become the very good TV miniser - or series of movies - that are now available on DVD?
