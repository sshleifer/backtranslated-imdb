I liked watching "Sea Hunt" "back the next day, I was in primary school and would get home doing the homework and 04:30 would be ready to watch" Sea Hunt "and Mike Nelson in Adventures its underwater. I liked! He took for you a place not very accessible at that time, in the great blue sea. For "" Thunderball "" or even before Cousteau became common, Mike Nelson was what led the imagination of the children. I would be willing to bet that more than a few children developed a passion for oceanography or biology or one of the sciences at viewing this photo show. Underwater has also progressed, the fascination for exploration is easily stimulated by watching this show. Watch and enjoy !!!
