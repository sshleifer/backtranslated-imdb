In a penitentiary, four prisoners occupy a cell: Carrère (Gérald Laroche), who used his company to commit fraud and was betrayed by his wife; the love of Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach) and his protector, retarded Pâquerette (Dimitri Rataud), who ate his sister for six months; and intellectual Marcus (Clovis Cornillac), who murdered his wife. One night, Carrère finds an old diary hidden in a hole in the cell wall. They realize that the book was written by Danvers (Geoffrey Carey) at the beginning of the last century and is about black magic. They decide to read and use its content to escape from prison when they find the truth about Danvers' fate. "Maléfique" is an original, exciting and claustrophobic horror film with a low budget in the French region. The story is practically in the same location, has no clichés and draws the spectator's attention to the last scene. I am a great fan of French cinema, usually novels, drama and police stories, but I have noticed recently that I have seen some French horror films such as "Un Jeu d 'Enfants", "Belphegor" and "Dead End" . My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Sinais do Mal" ("Evil Signs")
