I think this movie was probably much stronger when it debuted for the first time in 1943, although today it seems a little too preached and static to lift it to greatness. The film was established in 1940 - just before the US entered the war. Paul Lukas plays the very serious and decent role of his family. He is a German who spent seven years fighting against the Nazis and avoiding capture. Bette Davis is his very understanding and long-lasting wife who managed to educate and raise children from time to time without him. As the film begins, they cross the Mexican border to the US and for the first time in years they will relax and stop. <br /> <br /> The problem for me was that the family was too perfect and too decent - making them seem a positive positive propaganda instead of a true family suffering from real problems. While this has a very noble goal at the time, it seems to be fake today. In particular, the incredibly strange and extremely scriptural dialogue used by children just did not sound true. It seemed anti-fascism speeches rather than the voices of true children. They were extremely annoying - especially the least who came sometimes like an arm. The only real bells were Bette Davis and his extended American family, as well as the poor scumbag who lived with them (although he had no discernible accent). It is hard to believe that the ultra-famous Dashiel Hammett has written this dialogue because it is simply not true for life. The story was based on the play played by his lover, Lillian Hellman. And the story story and story are good, but dialogue is sometimes bad at times. All in all, an interesting curiosity and a movie with some great moments ... but that's really all about it.
