When our local TV station launched the first time, it filled a lot of the program with the old British programming. "Lock the daughters!" was properly broadcast, and I - moved for a few seconds of the movie - appeared in a black box. The best thing I've ever done. The actors are beautifully suited to their characters and bring them to a delightful life, complete with appropriate accents (Christopher Plummer's Foppington will leave you in seams, just like Hoyden and her family). The double recipes abound, the plot wheels inside the wheels mix and match the characters, the noisy gags look in every scene and the risque comments are done regularly. I showed the movie to friends a few years ago and called the play "a lost treasure" as much for the play as for the story. Until today, I can think of dialogue. If this jewel ever finds its way to a DVD version, I will be at the front of the line.
