This is my favorite FAVORITE ALL time movie. It was the movie Friday night with a pizza and a bottle of wine when I was alone. I first saw this movie with my aunt Brend and sister Chasity. I was in the 2nd grade. I fell in love with Travolta, and Sissy was my best friend. I have read many comments about why Bud left as Sissy Sissy and must "learn to act" married. But let's go back and look at this for a second: SPOILER - My interpretation of the film now, not when I was eight years old, is Bud & Sissy's relationship returning in the worst case, because it makes him mad at the journey of Gilley Taur. They enter a huge battle. Bud is trying to make Sissy jealous asking Pam to dance. Sissy thinks two mistakes will make a right, and Wes asks if he "needs help". They are all on the dance floor that act like fools when Bud Pam asks, "When I go home and rape me?" Pam replies: "When ever you're ready Cowboy." Bud then goes home with Pam to her condo in downtown Houston. What Dad bought for her with his petroleum money and "everything he does". Bud is the one who deceives Sissy. Sissy is waiting for Bud when he returns home the next day. Sissy is the one who leaves Bud. Then it is Bud's duty to prove to Sissy that he is a true "cowboy" and wins it back. <br /> <br /> Anyway, that's my interpretation. Everyone has their own I'm sure! I like this movie. Believe it or not, I've become a real cowboy! I love him too! :)
