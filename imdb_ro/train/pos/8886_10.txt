I was not alive in the 1960s, so I can not guarantee that this film was an accurate representation of the period, but it is certainly a moving and fulfilling experience. There are some excellent performances, especially by Josh Hamilton (of With Honors), Jerry O'Connell (Sliders), who play brothers divided by war. Bill Smitrovich, a character actor who has long been ignored by many, gives a heartfelt interpretation as their strict father, who is forced to question his own beliefs and values, while one of his sons makes him proud to go Vietnam, inside, while the other is exactly the opposite. On the whole, this is a powerful and delightful film that I hope everyone has the chance to experience.
