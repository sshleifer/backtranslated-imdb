This is MGM's colorful, colorful music of the early '50s and is certainly one of the best to look out there. The film was directed by the expert like Vincente Minnelli and Gene Kelly star in the main advantage. Both have made quite a few movies together in those days, of which it is probably the most well-known. <br /> <br /> The film itself managed to win the best Oscar image during the year, which meant that it had beaten films such as "A Place in the Sun", "A Streetcar Named Desire," "The Queen African "," Quo Vadis "," Blue Veil "," Death of a seller "of that year. A real achievement of the course, but at the same time too much credit for this delightful movie, full of light and fun. When you watch this movie, you will surely be entertained by everything, which is also due to the film's beautiful color appearance and many beautiful characters in this movie. The musical numbers are also all done nicely, which is not a great surprise when you have people at work like Vincente Minnelli and Gene Kelly. But really, could not have everything that was said in this movie was done half an hour less or so? I mean, we already know where the film is going, but still manages to stretch it as long as possible. It does not make the film shoot anywhere, it just makes it a little longer. The film could have certainly been done with some less musical numbers in it. One of the best MGM musicals that is not flawless though. <br /> <br /> 8/10
