Many people judge it as a service movie for fans because a lot of super star plays in this movie (Gackt, Hyde and Wang Lee Hom are well-known singers in Japan). But do not judge him before you look, that's what I say. Gackt and the staff are very serious when they made this film and worked so hard. It's a good movie with a delicate story inside. Several scenes can be so fun and others are so sad. They did so well until I can not stop seeing it again. <br /> <br /> The story has written pretty well, but I admit that their act is a little disappointing. This is especially true for Hyde because his talent to act is under the other, and it is strange to hear how he speaks with another language, except for his mother tongue (Japan). But it's comprehensible because it's the first time in the movie. I think Gackt is trying to show us how someone can be so weak when he loses the most important person in their lives. When Toshi was killed, Sho asked Kei to turn Yi-Che into a vampire like him because he would not let her die. When Sho brother died, Kei Shoot Son dies, I even told him that Hyde's expertise is still strange, but I gave him two beats to that scene! There is a time when the plot goes too fast that they did not tell why the Son can join the local Mafia and being Sho's enemy because I'm a good friend in the past, and Sho's son is also a brother in law. Anyway, I like this movie ~ (very much ^ ^). <br /> <br /> This is an action movie with a beautiful story.
