It's time for Gunga Din to be released on DVD. I can not say exactly how many times I watched this wonderful movie, but I never got tired. The main actors worked so well together. Victor Mclaglen (Sgt McChesney), Cary Grant (Sgt Cutter) and Douglas Fairbanks Jr (Sgt Ballentine) are an unrivaled team. I can not get over their exploits in India. Look at Sergeants Three for the first time when you see them involved in the fight with other soldiers on a so-called treasure map. The three sergeants are sent on an expedition to find out what happened to the communications line and that they enter a largely deserted city - or so they think. They engage in the necessary repairs and soon find some "residents" in hiding. Immediately after they were attacked by a group of madmen and barely managed to escape to the base. Later, they are sent to another mission that gives Sgt Cutter the chance to go hunting for gold with Din. They find the golden temple and are trapped by the evil supporters of Kali. From is sent to receive help and Cutter is captured. Soon, McChesney and Ballentine arrive with Din, and are too captured. Against the killing, they look helpless, because their regiment comes to rescue them. The wicked looks and is about to break out of surprise when a wounded Din climbs onto the golden dome and hits his spear, which then alerts the British to the ambush. For this purpose, Din is shot dead. The soldiers attack the wicked and soon defeat them. Finally, Din is honored, because he is made as an honorary captain in the British Army.
