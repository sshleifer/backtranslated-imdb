I had to see this jewel twice to really appreciate all this. When a widow's father of the two interrupts his two sons with a shocking revelation, they are torn between believing in him and not. As the terrible events of this story unfold, we learn a lot about the father, his two sons and their destinies. With the shocking twist after the shocking twist, this film never allows a return to the scene. Bill Paxton plays the father, but his most notable performances are his older son, Fenton, played by Matthew O'Leary and his younger Adam, played by Jeremy Sumpter. This is one of the best thrillers I've seen in a while, and you'll want to watch this a few times to appreciate any complicated aspect of the plot. I give this movie 9/10.
