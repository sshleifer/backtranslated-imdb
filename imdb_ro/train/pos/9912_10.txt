Absolutely wonderful drama and Red is the top ... We recommend this movie. Her performance, in my opinion, was the material of the Academy Award! The only real fact here is that Universal did not see that this movie was ever available on any video format, be it a tape or a DVD. They ignore a VERY GOOD movie. But Universal has little attention to the DVD library, which is sad. If you have the chance to see this somewhere (you are not sure why it happens very rarely on cable), see it! I will not go into the story because I think most people would rather have a movie opinion and too many "reviewers" spend hours writing the story, which is available anywhere. <br /> <br /> 10!
