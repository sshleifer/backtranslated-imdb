I first saw the film when it landed in the US one year after it left. She blew my little head, I was only 16 years old and was the first new wave of music I had heard, being a very classic child growing up. Music fascinates me, like Hazel O'Connor's amazing look and charismatic vocal performance, and Phil Daniels's hard but soft Cockney manager stole my heart. But I think my favorite character was Jonathan Pryce's saxist player. He was so helpless in the band and so pathetic and harmless, but he asked for sympathy. Preferred scenes, performance when the lights went out and the love scene in the train. Okay, so the movie is not Rose! But he was really excellent for his limited budget and for his portrayal in the UK in the early 1980s, exploding with the rebellious youth, looking for an exit from the edge of the edge. I went to the UK only a few years later and found that the film reflects a lot of the atmosphere I found when I was there. If you have the chance to see that. It's a great movie with some great shows and music will blow you up. <br /> <br />
