Henri Verneuil's film may not be as famous as Parallax View, 3 days from Condor or JFK, but it's certainly not worse and sometimes even better than these classic classics. The action takes place in the Western fictional state in which the fictitious president was killed. After several years of investigation, the special commission of the government decides that the president was killed by a single war man. But one man - the prosecutor Volney, played by Yves Montand - thinks there is still something to investigate and so the movie begins. This film does not deal with some accurate theories, but it includes the whole structure of the relationship between government and society in today's world. Such a film could only be made in the 1970s, but it will not lose its momentum. Besides, it's even a little afraid how accurate the oracles are. 10 out of 10.
