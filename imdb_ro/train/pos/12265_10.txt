"Tintin and I" first struck me as a masterpiece documentary. Photography and editing are really breathing (almost anti-dogma). We are following the life of the drawer Tintin Hergé through an open interview since 1971. The Tintin series was drawn against the backdrop of the great ideological struggles of the twentieth century. In the midst of them, Hergé has his own demons fought, and much of his drawing activity seems an attempt to get drunk and to escape into a world of perfection. Even if there are shots of spectacular panoramas of the Tintin albums, and some reconstructions and album passages, Hergé's story is told entirely through interviews and archive materials, and never through reconstructions. Hergé lived a turbulent life a real, suffering artist. But the fantastic world that came from his imagination will continue to amaze readers again and again.
