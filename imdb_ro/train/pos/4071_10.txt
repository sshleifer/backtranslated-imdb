I first saw this movie when I was seven years old and I was completely enthusiastic about it, but for years I could not find out what the movie was called. now I'm twenty-one and I accidentally shot the film two weeks ago and bought a copy. though my memory of the movie was a bit cloudy, I was not disappointed with what I saw. the animation in this movie is superb that conjures up a whole world that is so credible and so animated that you are attracted to the film only through it. But this film also has a plot that will delight and entertain both adults and children alike. with a floating island, a crazy general, a friendly grandmother and a well-built love story, this film will not disappoint you, I would recommend this movie to anyone.
