Writers Perry and Randy Howze have created a very interesting story in Chances I am. <br /> <br /> Using the idea of ​​a reincarnated man who is going home to his ex-wife, many years later, the plot turns unexpectedly, charmingly. <br /> <br /> Twenty years, Robert Downey, Jr. makes a delightful performance, assisted by Cybil Shepherd as a widow and Ryan O'Neal as a good friend. <br /> <br /> This trio has just the right chemistry for this crap, playing each other with a graceful style. I watched this movie several times on TV and every time I felt very nice.
