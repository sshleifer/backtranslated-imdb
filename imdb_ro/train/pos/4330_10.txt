<br /> <br /> "Bleak House" is the best adaptation of a novel Charles Dickens ever put on the screen. Along with one of my favorite novels, I was extremely pleased with this Mini Series TV. At the latest, the great Denholm Elliot was perfectly presented, while the noble John Jardyce and Diana Rigg were perfectionists of perfection as a Dadlock sority. The film captures the essence of Dickens' era and is extremely faithful to the book, making minor cuts that do not influence the story. everywhere a brilliant movie, in motion and atmosphere.
