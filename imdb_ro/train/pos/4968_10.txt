Diego Armando Maradona was and remains the best football player, he offered the game. Not just an athlete, but an artist. This documentary documentary whether the 1986 World Cup will live forever in the memories of all football fans around the world. Because of his tremendous and unbelievable goal he scored against my own country (england). There is absolutely no point to diminish this star. Although I do not give Spanish, I can appreciate the Argentinean narrator. In fact, he complains of happiness and barely can express his emotion ... All that I have written can be meaningless and difficult to understand, but readers ... you have to follow this to know what I mean.
