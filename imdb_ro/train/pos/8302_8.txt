Blasting guns, buildings explode, cars collapse, and that's just the first ten minutes. <br /> <br /> This action movie involving an ex-CIA mercenary who can not seem to die no matter how many times he was shot (hence the title) is pretty decent. <br /> <br /> Gary Busey usually throws like a bastard in these kinds of movies, has his usual crazy charm, but he's a bit more submissive: he still carries the whole show. Which does not mean that there are not many terrible supporting roles, including William Smith, Luke Askew, Mills Watson, R.G. Armstrong, Henry Silva, Lincoln Kirkpatrick, Thalmus Rasulala, and some other forgotten actors. <br /> <br /> There are enough smaller sequences of action to keep the whole story: Busey has to release a group of "kidnapped" US military elites and return a high-tech "supertank" (a regular tank with a added cheese - glued to the top) back to the United States. <br /> <br /> But America deserves this killing machine more than bad guys? This question is, of course, like in any CIA-centered film ... but without receiving a predicate.
