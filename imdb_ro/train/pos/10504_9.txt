Or at least one of the best. I think this is a very fun and very exciting game for the N64. Bowser is up to his usual shenanigans (yes, it's a bad word, but the only one I can think of) and Mario has to stop him again. This game is very fun to play and contains a lot of nostalgia for me. The only bad thing about this is the graphs, which are terrible for today's standards, but everything is pretty good (especially the mini-games you can unlock). It's the second best N64 game (the first is the best is Conker's Bad Fur Day) that I recommend for any Mario fan, or any platform gaming fan. It beats out mediocre Super Mario Sunshine on any day. 9/10 or: A
