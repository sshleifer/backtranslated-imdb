I looked at the DVD of this movie, which also has an excellent commentary track (in English). It seems that in Cambodia (English subtitles say the character speaks in Thai, but the film says Cambodia) a very bad man keeps boys getting hungry by hunger and to train them to fight and kill. He sends Pang to kill some people in China, and during the assassination, the cop's partner is killed. Police officer Wai is a vague cannon who is worried about his father, who is also a policeman who was shot and in a coma. Wai's boss is his father's friend and is worried about Wai's irregular behavior. He does not know that Wai was the one who caught his father in dealing with drug dealers, shot him and put him in a coma. Pang escapes and hides himself in a garbage barge, where he meets a woman who has come to find her mother and continues to repeat that her father will not let her go (Pang does not speak Chinese and does not understand that, but it saves her father who seems to have sex with her maybe this is the reason for Cat III). Wai is becoming increasingly obsessed with Pang, but Pang is almost unstoppable. Even after Pang steals a boat and takes the woman home where they are married and gets pregnant, Wai follows and joins the evil (which drives the guys) doing a business to fight and train to get it help Pang. There is a great demonstration between Wai and Pang with the seriously abused woman, the major victim, leaving Wai dead and Pang cutting his baby from his mother's death just to die and leaving him as a possible next boy to be raised as killer. This movie is beautifully photographed with an excellent soundtrack. There are many very violent scenes. The woman with a long angle off her leg. Throat and trunk knives. Weapons shot right in the head. And some very intense beatings. Maybe it's bleak and intentional, but it's definitely worth seeing.
