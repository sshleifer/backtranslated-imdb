No hidden agenda. Researcher. All funny. I saw the original on TV and I was scared pretty bad. I was a child :) The original one can be appreciated more compared to the new one I have seen and forgot. The original, with star Steve McQueen (BULLET), is by far the best and the only version anyone should see. Production of films is dated, but the fx used to make the Blob stand up to the time trial. I was convinced that this was moving from his own initiative. 10/10 <a href = "http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional%C3%A9
