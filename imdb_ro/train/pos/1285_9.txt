Former middle-aged deputy lawyer George Maxwell (a beautiful performance by George E. Carey, who also produced this photo) can no longer wait for Edith, a furious, frightened woman. Still worse, poor George is still caught up with a baby's newborn baby and a teenage lesbian lesbian (Disney brunette Sheri Jackson). George has a flickering adultery with Candy Wilson, wonderful, in love and in love with the hippie, (played delightfully with the sexy aplomb of Patricia Wymer). The challenges arise when George wakes up with Julia Freeman (a very good venom by Kathy Williams), who wants George to launch her motorcycle lover, Laurence Mackey (a frightening Robert Tessier, who has a hair full of hair here) dungeon. Director Tom Laughlin (screenwriter James McLarty) and screenwriter James McLarty splashed the splendid storyline with a surplus of delicious feminine nude, gentle feminine and raw violence. Moreover, they accurately capture all the unusual and unusual youth culture of the 1960s and report this plot in a 75-minute execution time, making sure that this film does not get too much. One of the most important moments is when Candy invites his best friends in Maxwell's house for a sublime fairy tale full of smoking, crying with rock music and, of course, hot dancing chicks. Robert O. Ragland's fantastic score strikes the scene. Stanton Fox, the black and white cinema, strictly adds an extra noisy edge to go the same way. Best of all, this film looks like a wonderful showcase for the alluring and fresh Pixie, Patricia Wymer, who positively illuminates the screen with its sweet, bubbly and captivating personality. A total treatment of trashy.
