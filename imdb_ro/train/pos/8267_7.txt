Brown from Harvard is a hard movie to fix. We expect many of our films nowadays, so we remember that the audience of the 1920s was a bit more innocent. William Haines is charming as the unhappier who has to stumble through pain and humiliation to find success and even glory. All the relationships in the movie feel very extinct except for the homoerotic tie between Billy and Jack Pickford, the city's cane. The film has everything, romanticism, tears, love, death and even sports ... It is a wonderful education about the change of society in the twentieth century.
