Incriptible how could make such a jewel of a very low budget movie (read it!) That they had ... <br /> <br / > Synopsis taken from the site: "One morning an old man wanders in the woods looking for his runaway cat, finding instead a child without parents and a carcassless murder ..." <br /> <br /> this site (IMDb) there is no trailer but I will leave a link here to the movie site itself, where there is a trailer that is quite disturbing, so please go and check it out. .. <br /> <br /> www.softfordigging.com
