maybe I need to analyze my head, but I thought it was a pretty good movie. CG is not too bad. I've seen it worse. The appearance of the creatures (and the creatures I refer to the good and the bad serpent) was pretty cool. The scenes of action involving snakes were really good, I thought. There are some shortcomings in logic sometimes, and the story does not always have sense.but for a creature feature, there is much worse. A lot of other creatures seemed elevated from other movies, so it's not completely original. I think the essence of the story is original. There's a little bit like Godzilla (the big budget US version) that I really liked. like this movie as much but I still say it was pretty good.i also liked music.all in all, I think Dragon Wars is about 7/10
