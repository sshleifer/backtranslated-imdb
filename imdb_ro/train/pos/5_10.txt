I got into the middle of this movie, so I had no idea of ​​any credits or even the title until I watched it here, where I saw it received a mixed reception of your commentators. I'm on the positive side about this movie, but one thing really caught my attention as I looked: the beautiful and sensitive score written in a Copelandesque Americana style. My surprise was wonderful when I discovered that the score was written by no one other than John Williams himself. He has written sensitive and painful scores, such as Schindler's List, but one usually associates his name with such bombasticities as Star Wars. But, in my opinion, what Williams has written about this film goes beyond what I have ever heard about him, for tenderness, sensitivity and beauty, fully in keeping with the wonderful and wonderful plot of the film. And another recent score for "Catch Me If You Can" shows more intelligence and sophistication. As for Stanley and Iris, I like educational films such as How Green was my Valley and Konrack, one with John Voigt and the young African American business in South Carolina and Danny deVito Renaissance Man, etc. spiritual awakening, a story that can not be brought quite often. This is an excellent addition to that genre.
