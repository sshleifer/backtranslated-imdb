Spirit is a unique and original look on Western life from the point of view of a wild horse and native Americans. The film focuses on the friendship and dangers a wild horse, the spirit, encounters during his life. Very well done in the presentation, using the technology available today to offer stunning images that shine in depth and realism. The music is fantastic, with songs by Bryan Adams and music by Hans Zimmer, who was also responsible for the extremely popular music of the Disney hit, The Lion King, in 1994. The story does not is very profound, but the fact that it is not even as in-depth as some films do not, in my opinion, distract from the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> An excellent movie that I enjoyed a lot and which is suitable for the whole family. Not one to be missed. (10/10)
