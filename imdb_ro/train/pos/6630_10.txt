This is an important movie. It challenges the spectator and encourages you to pay attention. There's still a lot to be done here. The director seems interested in destroying some of the most tedious kinematic conventions. Unlike a lot of recent American films, this film is interested in what it means to make a movie first. The DVD includes plenty of bonus features and there are two comments explaining the movie to the viewers who are left behind after an initial viewing. When the film was shot at Sundance, it made more than just a few members of the public inconvenient and upset. This is a Sunday coffee morning movie, not a party film Friday night. For the dedicated spectator, it is a treasure.
