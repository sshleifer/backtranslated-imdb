To be fair, I expected to watch the car in this movie. It was just one, but besides, "Freeway" was a great movie, which I enjoy holding on DVD. The only big names in the cast are Richard Belzer of HOMICIDE as a radio psychiatrist and Billy Drago as B-Movie villain par-excellence as Revelation - quoting the Freeway Killer. But the rest of the cast generally offers good performance. I especially liked the way Darlanne Fluegel gave his character, Sunny, a little courage. She could have been a helpless victim, but she's completely rounded up while looking for Drago with James Russo's bounty hunter. I'm afraid Russo as a wood, but then again, the character he's playing, Frank, is not very well dressed, except for a Sunny story story given by his former commanding officer. The tone of the threat is gorgeously maintained throughout the film and the lonely motorway atmosphere at night, while the killer who crosses the length of his sinister gray sedan is an excellent way to build tension, and the music used to emphasize the film is properly composed. I do not know why there are people who hate this movie like that. Different strokes for different people, I suppose. But I really enjoyed "Freeway" and I can recommend it.
