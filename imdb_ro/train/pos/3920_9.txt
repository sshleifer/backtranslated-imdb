The film in the movie - a concept made several times in the history of cinema. This is done here as well as in everything. If you like Carmen, you like this version. If you like flamenco, you like this version. <br /> <br /> The plot of the classic opera is played in the real repeat of the work by a flamenco team. Music is authentic. Wonderful direction. If you like dancing, you like this version. <br /> <br /> There is a tragedy. There is passion. There are intrigues. <br /> <br /> It is not ... <br /> <br /> Carmen.
