This movie has a very simple but intelligent premise - an unemployed man trying to steal from a convenience store, and the head of the shop gets him into deed ... the thief flees immediately with the shopkeeper. During this time, the store clerk has problems with a lower rank Yakuza quangpur (gangster). Throughout the pursuit for the thief, they look at Yakuza, who searches for the shopkeeper. The story then moves into high speed gear like a Tom & Jerry (cat and mouse), but adds to the dog following the cat. The entire second act of D.A.N.G.A.N. Runner (can be translated into English as "PINBALL RUNNERS") is about tracking, and tracking continues until until the end of Act 2, the killer forgets why he runs and Yakuza does not remember which of the two guys on who pursues them, nor does he remember why I run away from him. Similar to the subsequent film by SABU POSTMAN BLUES, most of the movie is simply all the chase and action, with a lot of physical comedy and dark humor injected to keep the audience engaged. What is happening is the end of the pursuit when the three men no longer have steam and in one of the most chaotic Mexican situations you will see on the film, which looks almost as if Sabu would have paid homage to Tony Scott TRUE ROMANCE (written by Quentin Tarantino).
