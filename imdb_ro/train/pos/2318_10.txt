I saw this film as a teenager and I immediately identified it with Reese Witherspoon's portrait of Dani Trant, a 14-year-old tomboy in Louisiana around 1957. She feels she will never be as beautiful as her sister sea, Maureen saw Emily Warfield), and the feeling of no longer having any place in her conservative Baptist education. Then, Foster Court (Jason London), the son of her closest girlfriend (Gail Strickland), moves to the next door, and Dani feels her first crush, while the Court enjoys her company and her intentional spirit. Dani manages to get her first kiss from him, but as soon as she sees Maureen, he falls on his head, leaving Dani behind. The close relationship between sisters is severely fractured by the rippling rivalry that deepens only when the Court dies in a tragic accident. Then the girls are made to realize how much they need each other. Sam Waterson and Tess Harper are just perfect as loving parents, trying to balance the individuality of their daughters while trying to keep the family together. The beautiful cinema and the wonderful soundtrack, including Elvis Presley, The Platters and many more, make a wonderful contribution to the atmosphere of the movie in a simpler time. A sensational age video with an uninterrupted message.
