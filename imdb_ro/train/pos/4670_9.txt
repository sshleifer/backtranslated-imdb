Those who just remember Sir Peter Ustinov as totally as Hercule Poirot or a professional gifted would do well to look for this charming piece of satire of the 1960s. Ustinov plays the role of a convicted embezzler (for the first time, we see him in the last day in the prison, where he prepares the tax declaration of the prison governor) who, feeling that the future lies in computers, raises (through an identity fake the identity theft) computer expert and intends to infiltrate an American multinational. Ustinov (who co-wrote the script) is in a top form, just like the enchanting Maggie Smith, unusually present as a cockney prone to crash-Puts a dolly bird. Bob Newhart also puts it in a funny show as a suspect executive who has drawings on Maggie Smith. In addition, Karl Malden is satisfactorily reckless as the head of Ustinov and Newhart. What do I especially like about this movie? Not only is it a well thought-out "caper," but it's also a little moving story; Ustinov and Smith are very persuasive, as the two shortcomings stop in love (the whole scene involving the book package is particularly effective). So, what do not you like? Well, the script is not as computer-conscious as most of the films (that is, hard to reach), even if it's capturing the sense of iron business in the 1960s. There are also some small bullets that you can not see until the second or third view, but I think they are minor negligence. <br /> <br /> As I said, this is a movie worth looking for, and once you've seen it, you'll want to see it again at regular intervals. <br /> <br />
