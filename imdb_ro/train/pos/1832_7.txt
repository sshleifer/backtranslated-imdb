I saw two movies on the weekend, one was "kaal" and one "Waqt". Both films are made in "Bollywood," but they are separate worlds. The fundamental difference is the story and the director. The Shaw Vip made its mark with Ankhen, one of the best Hindi comedy films. Casting Charecteres is perfect. The story apparently taken from a Gujerati game is great, the treatment is superb with a few exceptions. In Bollywood, when a film is put together, the first thing a Bollywood director makes to do is to score a music director, and such (mediocre Malik in this case) is required to crawl six songs a- and fulfill the contract. So even a good director like Vipul Shah must use them to quell tranquility Finacier and grandmother who hardly manage to obtain sufficient numbers. No music director can sing in such good songs in this movie. None of the songs has no melody and are obviously invasive narrative story, except background music and western version of Bharat-Naty. The duel and the role that plays the Father and the Son is a good action by Bachachan and Akshay Kumar. His stunning scenes are clearly remarkable. A good director surrounds himself with good actors and is willing to wait until a good story appears as in this great movie. Then we have a Producer unlimited class cheat, like sharukh Khan, to be let down to connect shameless and promote garbage "Kaal" to get rich at the expense of improving art and surrounding talent limit and recovers the investment before the start of the word. These are locusts bollywood who prey unexpected public to raise Awards "Film Farce" Bollywood granted Chamcha and most are in the press.
