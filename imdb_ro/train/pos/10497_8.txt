I thought it was great and I still do. I am grateful that we are able to see things different from what floods close to Hollywood. Saving Grace is smart and enjoyable - those who feel offended by marijuana work, go better to see America as bridesmaids as a movie. Saving Grace also shows that a funny movie does not have to be stupid. I laughed at my ass for the most part of her, but also meditating questions about what female character the lead character should do to pay her husband's deceased husband's debts. In short - a wizarding story with typical English humor and good action and direction. You could not ask for more. 7/10.
