Unlike some comments, mine is positive. This movie revolves around a table with a group of friends, some of you like, some you do not. Some are related - mother, daughter, son. Their stories are not smooth, happy with everybody and anything, with the type of life - like real life. Some story lines are not evolving but just happening. But as true families and good friends, they stay together. Parents who want to be babies who buy a baby are like holes! You are happy for the end. Poor Delmar is stuck between a cliff and a boulder that takes care of her, her mother, her son, and trying to keep her whole life together. This does not end with a walk in the sunset or a house in "burburiri and all live in a dream world, but it is a real image of people who live day by day, from month to month. it's a good story and a great movie!
