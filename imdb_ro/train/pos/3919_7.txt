As Carmen de Bizet resumes, middle-aged choreographer Antonio Gades brings sexy Carmen (Laura del Sol) to play the lead role. Antonio falls in love with Carmen, an independent and seductive woman incapable of accepting a possessive love. When Carmen has an adventure with another dancer, Antonio is consumed by his jealousy as D. José in the original work, enchanting fiction with reality. "Carmen" is another great film of Carlos Saura's trilogy dedicated to Flamenco. The dramatic story of love is developed with the lives of artists who are bordering on the characters they repeat, and often it is not absolutely clear whether what is happening is reality (with dancers) or fiction (of the play). Paco de Lucia is another attraction of this original version of the famous Bizet opera, based on Prosper Mérimée's novel. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Carmen"
