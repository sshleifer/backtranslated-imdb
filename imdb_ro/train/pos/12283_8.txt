The photo of this bid budget production is surprisingly bad. The colors are dirty and brown, and the photo has a very good look on it. Targeting and editing are often pretty uninspired and also TV movie. * And * at first the film seems to just want to torture viewers with angry images about sex and violence. Hans Zimmer's score is also a simple and gentle work of this overwhelmed, untouchable composer. But if you are willing to watch the film further, you will be rewarded with a very moving family story, Edna Ferber eps Giant's family. While at first you ask why Clara married this idiot, even his character gets deeper and more background you can judge. Clara conveys the spiritual lesson of the film, a tremendous and moving statement against the terrible events in her country. Her daughter, whose girlfriend is a young Antonio Banderas at the beginning of her international career, understands this lesson and eventually tries to live through her. The way in which the plot with the beginning of the mirror was built was great. And the actors do everything well. I was wondering, "Who is the actress who plays Blanca?" all the time, but of course it was a really young Winona Ryder! Overall, this movie made me want to read the book.
