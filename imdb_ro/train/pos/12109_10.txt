Yaitate !! Japan is a very fun show and I really like it! It was presented in our recent country at Hero TV and ABS-CBN every 5:30. This is Azuma Kazuma who is trying to fulfill his dream of making Japanese bread that will represent his country. He works in the Pantasia branch in southern Toyo and helps his friend (Tsukino Azusagawa) and other bakers (such as Kawachi Kyousuke and Kanmuri Shigeru) to beat St Pierre and take control of Pantasia. He struggles with other smart bakers in many other countries and not only learns to make different types of bread, but also learns to cook other foods. It's a truly funny and unique anime because they also imitate characters from other anime (such as Naruto, Detective Conan and One Piece) and real-life people. It is one of the best works of Takashi Haschiguchi and is indeed a necessity for people of different ages.
