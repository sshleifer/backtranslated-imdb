Manufacturers chose the best people for the workplace and they set a wonderful scene. Every interior is full of details that tells you everything about the people who live in it. Whether the era is the 20's (the first story), the present (1950) for the middle story or the 1910s (last), the costumes and settings are respected and created with love. I like the agitated costumes of the two old ladies in the sanitarium - a refined lace dressed up by the most beautiful Shetland Shawls. Roland Culver as Ashenden is very attractive, but never cares about young lovers, Raymond Huntley is the man who despises our wife's health and independence, which has brought us emotions. Usually he played typically comic, pompous, but here he is subtle, convincing and very impressive. The Black Sea (the 30-year-old film with Gable and Harlow) has stolen the plot from the All Know episode (and has also released a story from Kipling). I'd like to see more about Naunton Wayne as a jealous husband - though she has a good time looking for melancholy in a Mexican hat. I like that bird who plays his wife.
