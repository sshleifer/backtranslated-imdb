My wife and I took our 13-year-old son to see this movie and I was absolutely excited about the fun of the movie. It has an extra attraction for boys and men who remember their childhood, but even women enjoy the film, and Hallie's refrain, Kate Eisenberg, "The boys are so weird." It's refreshing to see a movie that shows unequivocally that boys and girls are really different in their emotional and social makeup. Boys make such strange things and usually survive to tell the story and scare their silly mothers! We enjoyed the film so much that my son and an 11-year-old boyfriend, me and my 23-year-old daughter, I went to see the movie the next day for a boy. We had more fun for the second time and everyone was reminded. It is pure and engaging with a pre-adolescent TV show that reminds of Classic TV "Freaks and Geeks." We all feel it will become a hit that is no different from "Freaks & Geeks," which did not survive its first season, but it has sold its DVD. I see especially if you have boys and you will find that it stimulates conversation about fun and safety! Girls will love her because of the opportunity she offers to say, "Boys are so weird!" Do not miss ...
