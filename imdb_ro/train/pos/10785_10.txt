I saw when I was young and it was great. Kelsey White as Lisa and Meecy Mices where cute. Susan Bonde as Doodle and Sandra Dee Heidecke as a snoodle where Hilarius. Karen Boettcher-Tate as Profster was interesting. Burl Ross as Little Bunny Foo Foo was funny. Gregory Donavon as Kaiso was brilliant. What is Hilarius that Snoodle and Doodle eat too much candy. It's sad that Little Bunny Foo Foo who bites Meecy Mices on his head, then through a fairy will give Little Bunny Foo Foo some desires, then he will turn into goon. This story is about when Lisa, Snoodle, Doodle go to Big Rock Candy Mountains. This show is great, the kids will enjoy this show, new words, songs and watch them play.
