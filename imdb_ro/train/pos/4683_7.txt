(Question) What do you call 100 film critics buried to the neck in the sand? (Answer) A good start. Well, I do not know Peter Mattei from Adam, but if he is the author, his filmography suggests that "Love in Time of Money" is a "good start". A classic movie with musical melodies with musical style, this movie looks at a chain of delicate relationships as it moves from person A to person B to person C ... etc ... and back again ending with people A & B in carousel mode. The film easily detects the unfortunate circumstances of nine people, with finely rendered shadows, beginning and ending with a street slut and her client. The downside of this film is the lack of a story that could have anything to do with the many weak criticisms it has received. I watched last night the monster "Angels in America" ​​and bored me at the end while this concatenation of the character studies kept my spell. Be careful. I may be the only person who really liked this movie. (B)
