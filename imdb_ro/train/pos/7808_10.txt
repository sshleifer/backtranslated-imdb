This is a movie that everyone should look at. In addition to raising the most important points (while South Africa is on its way to recovery, there are still many countries in similar situations now), it is brilliantly directed, while Denzel Washington gives, in my opinion, the most good performance in his career so far. Kline also offers good performance, though not as amazing as Washington's. John Thaw also puts a good rate on the head of the police. There are so many possible areas where a film about apartheid could fall down, but all of this was avoided. It would be easy to portray white men as bad boys and black men as good boys, but Attenborough did not do that. Sure, there were some white characters that seemed inherently evil, such as the captain at the Soweto uprising, but adding additional dimensions to all the characters would make the film more unbearable. Some people complain about the length of the movie as it is, but I think it needs the two and a half hours to tell the whole story, because it's really an incredible one. The best scene in the movie is the funeral of Steve Biko. When the whole crowd starts singing the national anthem of South Africa, it is probably one of the scenes, if not the most moving, that I have seen. If you have not already seen this movie: watch it. Maybe it's not a comfortable viewing, but it's definitely worth it.
