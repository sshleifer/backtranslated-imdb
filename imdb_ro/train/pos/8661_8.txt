I have long enjoyed the Law Series and the Intentional Criminal Order. Kathryn Erbe, Det. Alexandra Eames, the female detective is pretty tough and looks a bit bitter in the series of criminal intentions. See the other side of this movie. This movie shows a wonderful part of these talented actresses, and if you are a fan of the Criminal Intent, this movie is a party in her acting and you are a fortunate good-weed family in the south. I did not like the role of Albert Finneys in this film because she did such a convincing act of actress of the oldest who is hardly led and intolerant and unacceptable to change. He reminds me of so many young men, and the portrait is divine, but you'll probably find it hard to like it in this movie. Katryn Erbe is easy to enjoy in this movie and why I recommend that a 10-star star for criminal intent, fans of law and order.
