Hello Dave Burning Paradise is a movie for anyone who likes Jackie Chan and Indiana Jones. The main protagonist of the movies is certainly the bastard son of these two strange parents. As for the other characters, transformations of similar action film stereotypes are well known. If this movie is original, it's in the blend of Hong Kong's traditional film style with the Hollywood adventure. Unfortunately, this was not true for the movies he made at Hollywood.
