This was the beginning of everyone! Granted, it's not friends at the highest level, but he was the pilot of the show, let's not forget and not forget about it. We are present in the band and in the Perk Central, where our story begins. Even from this first episode we get a sign of Ross-Rachel's relationship that will come in the next ten years when Ross says, "I just want to be married again," and Rachel knocks a bride dress on ... probably not intended as when the writers went for a Monica-Joey relationship, but it fits nicely now when they look back. Otherwise, in this episode, Rachel is presented to Chandler as if the two had never met before, but in later episodes, the so-called "flashbacks," this is contradicted, as the two met in three previous occasions. However, the point is a good start for a great show. This episode may not be ordinary friends as we have become accustomed to them, and the cast is still a little bit experienced, but in the next few episodes we see why the show has come to be what it was! Continue to watch, the first season is an explosion!
