Fortunately for new Real McCoy fans (most likely all Boomers children who grew up in the late '50s and' 60s), three of the adult actors / actresses appeared when they did for the show in 2000. Tony Martinez and Richard Crenna died shortly thereafter. How pleasant it was to see Luke, Sugar-Babe and Pepino together, was equally mysterious about the complete absence of any mention of Lydia Reed and Michael Winkleman? I understand little Luca died in 1999, but I'm not sure how. There is no information about Hassie on the Internet that I find. Very curious why were they not even mentioned? It was so obvious, their absence from the Reunion show, that I suspect that the family of Michael and Lydia herself (if still alive) 1) asked to be left out of the discussion and therefore their wish was granted or 2) TNN could not find any trace of Michael or Lydia (like the rest of us), they seemed to have disappeared. Therefore, it would be the safest policy to quit them. Otherwise, the retrospective on Walter Brennen was wonderful. They did not bones about it ... Grandpa made the show success. I remember, like a child, the imitation of my grandfather's and my parents' walking laughing (as I'm sure another million kids did then). A tool that bothered me a bit was Richard Crenna's tendency to dominate the discussion ... sometimes, interrupting Tony and Kathleen to do something. In fact, although Tony Martinez seemed totally capable of contributing to the conversation, he was not allowed to speak and talk too much during the Reunion show. Unfortunately, since I wanted to hear from all three equally. In general, the Show Show was a real living for me. I've seen it several times on DVD and I've enjoyed it every time. <br /> <br /> Dodgerdude
