Walter Pidgeon is Braley Mason, a civilian lawyer dealing with a criminal case in "The Unknown Man," a 1951 film, also with Ann Harding, Barry Sullivan, Keefe Braselle and Richard Anderson. A great believer in justice, Pidgeon accepts a pro bono case for defending a young man, Rudi Walchek (Braselle), accused of murder and receiving him from acquittal. Shortly thereafter, he realizes that man is guilty and extorts protection money from both the victim and other neighborhood merchants. It is advised by DA (Sullivan) that Rudi is a small change, that in order to destroy the organized crime, we must find the top man. Mason finds the top man and faces a dilemma. "Unknown Man" is a small and black-and-white movie that manages to hold the spectator's interest with his various twists, although the plot is somewhat contrived. It is indeed the story of a good man seeking his god, righteousness, and what he is willing to do to attain it. And this is the most controversial part of everyone. I think there was a time before OJ, the Menendez Brothers, etc., etc., when people believed in the lawyers' integrity. For this viewer, however, these days are long. Walter Pidgeon does an excellent job - his beautiful, elegant and declamating behavior shows us a successful, confident, but also a profoundly worrying man. Pidgeon had a magnificent career of 60 years but never really grew up at the superstar. He was a solid actor who could play almost anything and did it. Perhaps, from the moment he was leading, he was well in his thirties and missed being a matin√©e idol; or it might be deprived of that; or that it was printed earlier as the second lead to a big woman like Greer Garson. Hard to say. He gives an honest and moving interpretation here. Very good movie with good performance.
