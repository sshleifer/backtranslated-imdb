A sweet scorn, whose length of 65 minutes does not seem to be too short a second. My name is Julia Ross, who returns to an English tradition of things that are not as it seems - Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes is an example. Out of the job, Julia Ross (Nina Foch) finds a dream job at a new London employment agency, whose sinister representative seems very impatient to find out whether she has a living relative or a friend. After being informed about the debt, she wakes up (in a vast Manderley-like bunch) on the Cornwall coast, supposed to be George Macready's wife, who has an alarming interest in knives and ice. His eager and satisfying mother is the irresistible Dame May Whitty (this time a livelier efficiency model on the other side of good-vs-evil than it did in The Lady Vanishes). The nightmare's vision of this story is claustrophobic; we know what's going on, but they're powerless to tell poor Julia. This film, with curiosity, is regularly awarded a place of honor as one of the first films (and very few British). I think it is closer to the old-closed Gothic tradition than the American one of humid stones and urban corruption; however, it evokes a more modern, psychoanalytic thinking. No matter what you call it, it remains a very satisfying thriller.
