In his directorial debut, Denzel Washington makes a true story, which also happens to be a very difficult story and brings it on screen with the sincerity we have come to expect from Washington's acting efforts, but now we see this regret as a director. <br /> <br /> Recently, we have seen some of the disastrous results of children who have fallen through public fissures. This story tells of a nightmare that leaves terrible scars, but it suggests the triumph of the human spirit in the end. We can select the first effort problems with too many related situations and not the best ones in editing these scenes, but the simplicity of other scenes that project such power can not be underestimated. If the academy overlooks this movie, it will be transvestite. This movie does not shoot any blows and goes to the cold facts of the story with a purity that usually does not exceed a novel on screen. This, of course, is a tribute to the director. <br /> <br /> This is a dandy so go see it and tell your friends to go see it!
