This is one of those movies you have never seen before - so you can see again "for the first time". Van Dine's books continue to delight - but are termed excessively floral by many. This film is by far the best adaptation of his work. William Powell is William Powell - he does not say. The plot is complicated. The story is moving too fast, because you want it to last. Enjoy.
