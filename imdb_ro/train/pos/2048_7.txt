A brutally depressing scenario and some great performances by Peter Strauss and Pamela Reed and good location shooting in Ohio serve this great television movie about hard times in the rusty area. As the branch closes and the jobs of the units disappear, blue-collar workers are threatened by everyone: their leaders, their owners, their wives and their children. Strauss is completely credible in his role, and Pamela Reed is, as always, awesome. See if you can recognize John Goodman before weighing. The heavy metal score - was someone to do a word game? - is sometimes disturbingly disturbing, but Frank Stanley's cinema is knock-out, especially mill scenes.
