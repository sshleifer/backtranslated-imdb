Family problems are abundant in real life and about which this movie is about. Love can hold members together through trials and trials, and that's what this movie is about. A man, Dad, has the maturity and the force to support the family in the face of adversity. Children all grow hard to understand that, regardless of age or parents, the parent still loves the children and is willing to give them a cushion when they fall. All actors who portray their characters have made remarkable performances. Yes, I shed a tear along the road, knowing I had similar experiences both as a young adult and as a parent. This true life is what every young adult and parent would do well to see, though some will not achieve it until they are parents. They have to see for those who care for their families.
