This was surprisingly intelligent for a TV movie, and quite true for my own bulimic experience. In fact, it was well researched and I can only assume it was written by someone who went through a similar experience, because he had all the details. The characters were very well drawn and the performance of Mare Winningham and Alison Lohman were wonderful. I think what I like most is that they have made specific and intelligent and that there was no reason to reject the reasons for bulimia Beth (this was not a "diet" that was not controlled due the pressure on girls to media pressure that we will not address the reality ... "). her mother was not completely clueless - often in television, they will take an issue that everyone has realized and try to tell us that their protagonists are the last people left on earth who do not ( "Diabetes? Oh, my world is all drunk, doctor, please explain to me everything like I have a small child", etc. ). it was wonderful that her mother was a psychologist and I do not even see the signs. and the scenes that take Beth were too melodramatic and sensational, focusing more on the need for secrecy Bulimics and their lack of control. scene in which Beth tells his mother that he is bulimic would have made me cry if there were no other people in the room. Okay, that's how I liked those bits. What has not worked so well for me was the end that turned to the territory of the TV movie we know and we do not particularly love, but I think it had to wrap it up. "And you can heal your child's eating disorders if you have a lot of money and you live in America ..." And I can say again that I really like Great Winningham. She's great.
