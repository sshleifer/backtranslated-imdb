Yes, I remember that! Many years since I watched it. The story was entirely surreal, but still awesome! What someone who evaluates and analyzes the films must have in mind is the purpose of that film. It's the same with "The First Kid," which follows a similar pattern. Some movies - such as this movie here - only target simple and comical nonsense. Such films can not be evaluated from the point of view of a hypercritical reviewer. Of course, these films are lacking in quality, they do not have a sophisticated story, most of the time they do not have a first class act, but if they fulfill their primary premise - it's okay. I do not have this movie here on my preference list, but I thought it was funny, it had some very nice sequences and it made a good story. Brian Bonsall is anyway a clever actor.
