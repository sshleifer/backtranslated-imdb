The year is in 1896. Jeff Webster (James Stewart) does not like people. He is just a friend he has and is Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan), an old sympathetic man. They lead a herd of cattle with them. their key to wealth. Skagway faces trouble when Sheriff Gannon (John McIntire) takes the cattle. Now Jeff just needs to return it and drive it through the American Canadian border with Dawson. Now they have a group of other people, such as the ladies of Ronda Castle (Ruth Roman) and Renee Vallon (Corinne Calvet). The two men enter the gold business. The fourth collaboration of Anthony Mann and James Stewart, "The Far Country" (1954). The act of acting is gorgeous. Walter Brennan makes an incredible perfume with Stewart. The Roman novel is brilliant and Corinne Calvet is delightful. Jay C. Flippen is very good as Dawson Marshal Rube Morris. Big Jack Elam and Kathleen Freeman are seen in smaller roles. It's fantastic to watch the way Jimmy Stewart overcame The troubles in his path. It's just man and his rifle. But it's also vulnerable.
