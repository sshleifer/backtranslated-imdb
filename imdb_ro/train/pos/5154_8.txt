As an amateur historian of WW2 / Nazi Germany, I could not wait for this to appear on DVD. I missed the first time in 2003. I do not want to repeat what has already been said in the last 8 pages of commentary on historical inaccuracies. A better work could have been made portraying the "charming" Hitler. We also had a small problem with some casting choices, not so much for their action as for their appearances. Peter Stormare does not look too much like Rohm, why did not Babson make Hess wearing a wig? And the biggest complaint ... how much has always been made of Hitler's blue eyes, why did not Carlyle make blue contacts? In addition, I thought the actors who played Goring and Drexler did look pretty good. Again, as long as people look at this, I understand that this should be the first entertainment in the 2nd history, I do not think there will be much harm.
