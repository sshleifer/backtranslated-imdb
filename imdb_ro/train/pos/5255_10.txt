Tim Meadows must be the most underestimated of the notable members of SNL. What was initially a low leaf look at a weak giglio develops in a disturbing 90 minute, though still a little forehead. Do not listen to him in anticipation of beautiful cinema or Oscar-like performances. She enters her waiting for a brilliant glow with Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell doing what they do best - making the audience laugh. Leon "The Ladies Man" Phelps is a naive host, very little about anything except wang's paths. As a gifted woman, she gives away to the wives of countless stews who have been tied together to hunt him. The director makes an inspired work to guide the actors into a comedy event, which is complete for lack of parcel development. How much would the plot expect from an SNL skit? While some scenes are a bit off, for the most part, Meadows "a line and absurd sexual comments hit directly funny bones. For example, in one scene, Meadows compares to Mother Theresa, but for to be destroyed, of course it's alright, but we are not all in the privacy of our homes and we are tormented by our advice to an entire city to "do it in the ass"? In another scene, immediately after a kiss of heart with the female leadership, she suddenly recalls the name of being a benefactor, a woman she slept many years ago. He stood up in front of the woman who obviously fell for him and proclaimed that "The Lady is coming back" to her obvious defeat. Billy Dee Williams hits the park ball as a barman / narrator. Will Ferrell, the suppressed homosexual, deals with solid performance. Watch this movie if you are in adult humor. If not, stay away with extreme prejudices.
