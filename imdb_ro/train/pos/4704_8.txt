This movie is just a lot of fun. I've seen it a few times, but it always has something funny that I remember. The "duckies and bunnies" scene is one of my favorites and I still quote Morone's versions of certain words! There are so many jokes running, that's amazing. But I love Michael Keaton anyway!
