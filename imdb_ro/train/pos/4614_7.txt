This movie is ridiculous! That's exactly what I like about this play of "Pleased for pleasure." It's easy to condemn this movie because you did not include Pat Priest and Butch Patrick, the original Marilyn and Eddie. But look at the year and do the math. Pat Priest and Butch Patrick have gone a long way! Time is doing this to young people. Yvonne De Carlo, who regained her role as Lili, pushed Big 6-0 (even though she still looked good and stayed perfect "Lili"). It is a shame that Yvonne De Carlo was not given a bigger part. However, it was good to see Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis in the roles that made them so famous! During the two seasons the MOUNTS had in the spring, Gwynne / Lewis chemistry made the success of the series. The rest of the cast supported casting members, not to say they were not needed. They were! The television series would not have survived as long as it did without them. Given the choice between Butch Patrick and Happy Derman (the original "Eddie"), the choice was too easy. Yvonne De Carlo was also the best choice for Joan Marshall. Although this film is not measured until the original television series, it still measures well and is one of the best "reunuin" that suffered a boob-tube in the late 1970s / early 1980s. <br /> <br /> "
