Hook or By Crook is an incredibly innovative film from a pair of incredibly smart and talented creators, Harry Dodge and Silas Howard. They manage to tell an original story in a distinctive cinematic style and is beautifully shot by Ann T. Rosetti and writing great - really poetic. <br /> <br /> Driving characters are true heroes and serve as a sort of rare model / inspiration for dung and trenches of the butcher everywhere. This movie has so much energy, so much heart-hearted and passionate heart in San Francisco. I can not recommend it long enough! <br /> <br /> The best friend movie of all time!
