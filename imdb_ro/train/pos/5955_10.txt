As a producer of "This Darkness," I admit that we neglected 3 very important gratitude in our final credits. Omissions were visions that could not be corrected once employed, nor the parties involved - who saw the movie - did not mention it at the time. On behalf of the excellent distributor and the crew of the film, I relieved them. Obviously, some critics posted here are tough in the light of their credit being incidental. Our production values ​​were negligible and our "special effects" were really very special, but the plot is very strong and John McLeod's cinema is superb. We hope the reader will enjoy "this darkness" and the efforts of those who have worked for free. Thank you, Dylan O'Leary, Director.
