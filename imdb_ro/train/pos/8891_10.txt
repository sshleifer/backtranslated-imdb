I can agree with other comments that there was not an enormous amount of history in the film, but it was not a documentary! He was meant to have fun, and I think he did a really good job at that. I agree with the black family. The scenes seemed to be lacking. Like suddenly, they would have thrown in, but we caught the story and the relationship between the families later and found it pretty good. Despite the fact that it was not a re-enactment of the 1960s, it brought to light the very important and important reference periods of the decade. It sounded very fun and worth watching.
