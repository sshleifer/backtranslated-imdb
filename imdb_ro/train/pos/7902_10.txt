The film is exceptional in its homosexual iconography and extends this beyond asthetics to music and distribution. Throughout the movie there is a child-like wonder, as seen through the eyes of the main character. Her love of heart with the light around us is comic and beautiful. In a way it's a weaker film for girls. Watch that you feel a fun relaxing movie in the middle of the night. Buy this, if you like, differ in the media world and the combined love (?).
