This is the best Emma that exists in my opinion. After seeing the other version (1996) that is good and reading the book, I think I can safely say with confidence that this is true interpretation and is Jane Austen's most faithful masterpiece. The 1996 film with G. Paltrow is also good, it's just like a different story. It's very light and fluffy, you do not see the darker edges of the characters and if you just want a nice movie, that would be good, but the complexity of plotting points, such as the Churchill / Fairfax enthusiasm is so glossy as virtually nonexistent . But if you want the characters to be composed more, more real and multidimensional, the 1996 TV version is superior. Emma is a remarkable person, but she's faulty. Kate Beckinsale is a master in showing the little strange characters of the character. You see her disgusted with Harriet Smith's simple conversation, but he does not show any remorse because he has ruined Harriet's proposal until this action has the effect of ruining her own marital happiness at the end. You will see her narcissism and mirror Frank Churchill in harming others to achieve their own goals. For Emma, ​​she played a money hunter and had a new friend while she lost time after losing her governor's marriage. For Frank Churchill, she assures the promise of the woman she loves while treating her and others abominably to keep her secret. In the book, she does all this in a crushing awakening at all the gafes she has done. Both Kate Beckinsale and Gyneth Paltrow are convinced in their remorse, but Paltrow's is more childlike and stagnant, while Beckinsale's awakening is quite real and serious, and you see the shift from selfish, child-like behavior to an adult good and thoughtful. Both versions are very good, but I prefer that.
