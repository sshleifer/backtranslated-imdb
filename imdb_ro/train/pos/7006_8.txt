Haunted by a Secret, Ben Thomas (Will Smith) is looking for redemption through the radical transformation of the lives of seven people he does not know. Once his plan is established, nothing will stop him. At least that's what he thinks. But Ben did not intend to fall in love with one of these people, and she is the one who will transform her. Will Smith is back with director Gabriele Muccino after the film inspiring life "Wearing happiness." "Seven Pounds" is another life-changing movie experience that not only reminds you of the previous collaboration, but also tears you in the end. Will Smith is also the producer again with others. These films are very realistic, describing the life of an ordinary man and his struggles through life. Seven pounds might have taken some time to get the real boost, but after half an hour of the film, the movie is ready to master your heart. Also, this movie has some twists around, allowing viewers to keep guessing. Director Gabriele Muccino is once again the winner, with his emotional and inspirational message. It makes all the characters of the film very real, so people can find themselves in a place somewhere in the movie. Together with the director, Will Smith is still a winner, with his superb acting skills. Once again, the duo of the director and actor functions as a charm. There are also other talented actors in the movie that have been pretty good. Rosario Dawson, beauty with the brain, this can be called. It looks beautiful and is a very good part. Barry Pepper offers great support to the film, and Woody Harrelson does the same, though Woody did not have much screen time (it would have been better if he had more). You will not forget this movie easily. Watch this movie and change your life. First-class cinema!
