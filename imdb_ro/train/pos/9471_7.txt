Steve Carell plays Dan Burns, the uncle of the agony newspaper and his three-sided father. On a big family return, Dan meets his perfect woman just to find out that she is in a relationship with his brother. What is a man to do? I really liked "Dan in real life," but I would imagine that his success or something else in this movie will be down if you're willing to accept Steve Carell playing a relatively straightforward and retained role rather than go through the wide movements of the comedies that made him so successful. If you can not accept it, do not worry, "Get Smart" will be later this year, but for the record I thought it was really good. "Dan In Real Life" starts out as your typical, weird, funny, but it becomes funnier and more fun as it goes on, and Carell's frustration with his situation grows. It's not massive original (but if you've only seen movies with original ideas, kinematic picks would be very rare, would not it?), But "Dan In Real Life" is fun and a good distribution (which would not fall into love at first glance with bright Juliette Binoche?) take full advantage of an insightful enough script that contains many weightings on the meaning and passion of love. I hope Steve Carell is pushing and not exciting again.
