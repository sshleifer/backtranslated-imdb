Anyone who saw this movie and examined it badly, I would refer to Roger Ebert's review of this film. He is one of the most respected critics in the industry and gave him 3Â½ stars. This is a great movie. Maybe it's not perfect or spectacular, but I liked it. A line of choirs is not so much a story, for it is a group of stories about the lives of hopefuls on Broadway. I read reviews if people said that too much time was wasted on romance between Zach and Cassie. This is an incorrect view. It's another story, along with all the other stories that everyone is expecting about Broadway. What people fail to realize is that those who are dancing for Broadway shows go through the same things ordinary people encounter. And that's what I think is really the point of the whole show. It's about showing not only the talent of these special dancers, but also about giving us some amazing things to think about in general life. This is a study of life as a star on Broadway. Anyone who dreamed of becoming a Broadway star follows this movie with a sense of great relationship because they have gone through exactly what the characters are going through. <br /> <br /> This is a great music. It has its slow points and sometimes gets a little confused with the rhythm of story lines, but overall I enjoyed it a lot. Look closer to the movie, and then maybe you'll understand what I'm talking about.
