It was not until I saw Napoleon Dynamite that I remembered how I saw the Cracker Bag. Only nice feeling and still not lean to be soppy. There's a great cinematography, and the lead face is pretty brilliant. It captures more than the nostalgia of the weather. He has a real heart for that. Achilles' early childhood is refined and painful. A simple story is always effective when doing well. This Glendyn Ivin has a great future and I, I look at his next project. Tracking is always the most difficult thing to do. It's like the second blue album for most people. <br /> <br /> I just hope his next film is not something blade like a shark movie. Good luck at all. Enjoy cinema.
