Skip over McCoy (Richard Widmark) with Candy's wallet pockets (Jean Peters), which contains an important microfiche for the Communist cause. She is followed by two federal agents waiting to resist once she handles her microfinger to her contact. However, Skip is denied postage on the subway under everyone's nose and begins a hunt for him both by the police, Joey (Richard Kiley) and Candy who want the microphones back. Omission can only be tracked through Moe (Thelma Ritter) who sells information about criminals. It is clear that "what he stole is important, and both sides want the movie, but he intends to resist for a high price." This leads to Joey following him and a conflict between Joey and Jean, who fell in love with Skip. has a deadline to deliver his boss's microfiche. <br /> <br /> It's a well-acting movie and has a good start that immediately involves you. It's a bit unrealistic how Jean Peters immediately falls in love with Widmark, but this is necessary, otherwise why would it be later to keep Joey. It's a good movie.
