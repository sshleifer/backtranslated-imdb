Yes, the plot is hardly plausible and very thin. YES, the act does not range from average to ridicule. YES, it was done so many times before. However, what we are dealing with is a film that does not depart from these facts and pretends to be nothing more than it is. There are indeed some original death scenes, and the tension increases throughout the movie. Besides, you will not be more than a few minutes away from a heavy killing. I urge everyone to look at this film with an unprejudiced eye and see it for what it looks like; a frightening, funny hit with a second theme song.
