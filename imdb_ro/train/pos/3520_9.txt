This is the movie "B-series" Noir, and my vote reflects the membership in that genre. I saw this movie last night at a Paris-based cinema on the left bank where he opened a two-week film. The film has some deficiencies, yes, but too many delicious items to ignore. As the previous reviewer remarks, the drum scene is incredible! (The B movies could go where A-movie was forbidden to enter!) And the plot is interesting. As far as Franchot Tone, however, I can not agree: for me, he is properly mysterious; just right the creepy shadow. We have to keep in mind that there is a kind of German expressionism here (director Robert Siodmark was a German who came to Hollywood during the war) and so an exaggerated air fits into the whole movie. At least he does for me. However, Ella Raines is gorgeous who, in her third credible performance, has kept this viewer entangled in the whole movie. A kind of "girl on Friday" with a strong resemblance to Gene Tierney, it's a wonder she did not become a household name. But it is very good here that I ordered another movie of her ("Impact") on the Internet and I can not wait to see her too.
