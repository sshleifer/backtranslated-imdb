Jessica Alba Max and Valerie Rae Miller's Original Cindy shine in this series of action and atmosphere. Wonderfully politically incorrect. Quality varies greatly from episode to episode, but generally the standard is high, and when it's not, Jessica always deserves to look. Valeria's African-American Jivetalking becomes almost Western Dark Angel on the territory of the sitcom.
