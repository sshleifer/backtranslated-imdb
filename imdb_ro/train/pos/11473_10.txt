Zero Day is a movie that few people have come to see and what shame it is. When I saw the end, where the two main characters descended into the room and humiliated the people, then committed suicide, and made me take my stomach. I just shaken, that's how this movie is so strong. The movie is amazing. It's too incredible not to get a perfect ten. It is sad that so few people understand the true beauty of this film. It's not a budget that makes a good movie, it's the amount of sentiment that decision-makers have put into it doing what's right. It leaves you a permanent impression in your mind that you simply can not go out. It makes you realize the real horror of the shooting - especially if you knew that person, and this movie makes you feel like you know these people. We recommend Zero Hour for those who feel they are mature enough to follow. I am fourteen and I feel that this movie is too amazing to be put in words. It feels like you've seen something that happened.
