Reviewed at World Premiere screening on September 9, 2006 at the Isabel Bader Theater during the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). It had an interesting concern, but it seemed to go too long with too many photos (recycled computers, keyboards, cables, etc. delivered over China in tune and then sorted and remodeled into new products to sell back) and other dexterity . Producers tried to get more interviews to stimulate the human element, but they were often prevented from doing so because of Chinese censorship. However, what was there was interesting. The particles of a real estate agent in Shanghai, shining around her luxurious mansion and gardens, interconnecting with the scenes of others who lived in medieval conditions, were particularly striking. The launch of a plant tracking on a 480 m area was something alike. Scenes of the Dam Three Gorges project were also a complement to Jia Khang-je films from TIFF (Life Style / Sanxia Haoren and Dong Documentary), which were also built around the subject. <br /> <br /> Director Jennifer Baichwal, producer Nick de Pencier, cinematographer Peter Mettler and Edward Burtynsky are all on stage for a Q & A after the world premiere. Producer Noah Weinzweig was introduced from the public and was pleased to be the most important person who witnessed ground access in China itself.
