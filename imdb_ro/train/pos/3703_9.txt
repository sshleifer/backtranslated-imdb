Okay, so it's an adult movie. But it is really very tastefully made. It is obvious that the producers spent much time and money to make a kind of classic movie. I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Even the act was pretty decent. The plot was more solid than most of the adult movies I've seen. Room activity was above average. It's just a good movie!
