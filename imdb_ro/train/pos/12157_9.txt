They left their past in the West Midwest and moved to Hollywood to start their own dance school for aspiring nuns. Adele begins meeting with millionaire Lincoln Palmer (always well Dennis Weaver). On the other hand, the Helen's feminine brother soon becomes desperate and crazy. Director of Curtis ("Night Tide," "Ruby"), Harrington, works from a brilliant screenplay by Henry Farrell (who wrote the book "What Happens to the Child Jane?" It was based on and co-wrote the script for " Hush ... Hush, Sweet Charlotte "), truly realizes a complex and persuasive psychological thriller about guilt, fear, repression and religious fervor that work dangerously in the midst.
