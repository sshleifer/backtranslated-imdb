I wonder why the gun used in Beckett's film and the bullet caliber it should have shot. If this is based freely on Carlos Hathcock's sniping, I think he's a 7mm. round. I'm also curious about the rifle itself. He also made a comment in the Sniper final movie about the rifle that the Vietnamese man left him to use, which belonged to his father. Beckett mentioned that he thought he was the best sniper rifle ever produced. I'd like to know who the rifle is. I know this rifle was made around World War II or before. I have not seen the movie before, to identify it. As he kills Mr. Hathcocks, the longest hit was 1.47 miles, and 93 confirmed killings and 14 unconfirmed killings. After his wounds healed to some extent to be burned in Vietnam, he spent the rest of the sniper teach the career in the USMC with the skills they needed in the field. His sniping career is still mentioned to our brothers and sisters trained in the USMC. I got the name from my friend who is the former Marine. Any information would be great.
