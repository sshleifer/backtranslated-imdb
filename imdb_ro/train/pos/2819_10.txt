This movie is bufoonery! and I loved him! The "Dragon" (Jacky Chan) and his buddy, "cowboy," made the film fun, meaningful and simply stupid. The film is a rare mixture of good and bad fighting and (somehow) wonders and fun that grow. Long Shao Ye takes the viewer through the daily activities of the young dragon lord (so called because he is the son of a wealthy family) and "cowboy," which includes the implementation of smart and elaborate ways to get rid of studies (with the help of the entire household including tutor) who competes in a rather boyish way (and idiotically interesting) to win the affection of a local girl who competes in "football" (you'll see what I mean) and the list goes on. Somehow they are in the middle of a fight to save a valuable antique transport and the lives of a few people. The movie has serious moments. But they do not depress, rather inspire. Feeding boys is not lost in this exchange, but is actually used against evil. What I really liked about this movie is how it ends. Not the typical confrontation (which itself was wonderful), but well, you will see. Let me say that it truly surprises the spirit of the film. Fools, spells, meaningful and nostalgic. great movie.
