I wrote comments to IMDb, but I do not do that anymore. It happens that IMDb has become massive and therefore subjectivity has destroyed the scores. What I want to say? That someone who does not have any special pleasure in movies and does not have any expertise in this area, follows some nonsense (or the opposite), and if he likes it, he offers a number of 10 and if it does not work. 1. Of course, this does not can measure anything right. Now for the movie. I really regret that I have ever given ten times to a few movies, because then I have to score 12 or 13, which is not possible. This documentary has something I do not expect to ever forget in my entire life in any other movie. It's simply fascinating, and it's not just a way to say; it really is. The last 25 minutes have a load of energy, visual joy and wisdom - the words spoken by the boys at the beginning of the scene, that really ... there is no possible match. I do not have movies, I rarely find a sense, but this is the kind of movie you have to buy and keep and watch from time to time, perhaps 10 or 20 times as you pass years. I have nothing to say. This is a real goal, goal 10 for me.
