The only review of this movie from this date really destroys the stars and the film itself. I usually like to read user comments to give me an idea of ​​what to expect from a movie I do not know about. It is regrettable that when there is not much comment about a particular piece, because when there is only one review and an unreasonable film and casting, you have no idea what to expect. I read the review before watching this title and I do not know where the venom comes from for this movie and the stars. Douglas and Blondell were both very talented and attractive people who usually delivered even when the material was not the largest. I found the movie and the fun and enjoyable shows. It's not one of the best classics of all time, but a fun and fun diversion - much more than you can expect in most of the newer movies. If you are a fan of these stars, you will not be disappointed.
