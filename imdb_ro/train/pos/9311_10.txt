This was the worst movie I've ever seen, but it was also the best movie. Original Sci Fi movie should be bad, that's what makes it fun! The line "I like my well-done dinosaur meat!" is probably the best quote ever! Also, the plot seems to be something of a pot-induced dream. I can imagine now that writers wake up after a long night to rise up and play a dance dance revolution, then put ideas together for this: Space sailors arrived on a foreign planet, infested with dinosaurs and has medieval houses In it you protect a team of scientists studying the planet. The best idea ever! In fact, it fits completely Sci Fi Original Verification File: Medieval Gun Dinosaurs Time Terrible Spatial Travel <br /> <br /> So go watch this movie but do not buy it.
