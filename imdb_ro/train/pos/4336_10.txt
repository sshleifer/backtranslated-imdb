Thing About My People is a wonderful film about relationships - first of all an adult son and his father, but also that son with his wife, sisters and mother. Paul Reiser wrote a semi-autobiographical film about his relationship with his father. The movie is fun, challenging and challenging. I determined to reevaluate my relationship with my father now and with my adult son. Peter Falk is excellent as Paul's father - the role could not have been better expressed. I hope that both Mr. Falk and Mr. Reiser are recognized in next year's film awards for their efforts - Falk for his performance and Reiser for his screenplay.
