We found this movie really funny because you have a young black comedian (Chris Rock) who dies and is sent back to earth in a white body in the mid-1950s. He does not realize that his behavior should change and continue to act as he had before. He listens to rap music, he plays over time and plays the stereotype role of a black urban man. The real humor of this film was followed by the misfortune that this behavior has with the black community.
