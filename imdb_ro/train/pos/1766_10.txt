I received a free pass to preview this movie last night and did not know what to expect. The premise seemed bad and I assumed there would be a lot of shallow humor of virgin fun. What a wonderful surprise. I laughed so hard that I was crying at some jokes. This film must be seen for anyone with an open mind and a slightly twisted sense of humor. OK ..... is not a movie to go with your grandmother (Jack Palance?) Or with little kids. The language is dirty, the jokes are (very) raw, and the discussion about sex is just as graphic that you will find anywhere. What's amazing, though, is that the movie is still a sweet love story. My girlfriend and I both loved her. Steve Carell is awesome, but (like The Office), support distribution really makes a movie. All the characters have defects, but they also have depth and sympathy. They all pull weight, and chemistry is perfect. I can not wait to receive the DVD. I'm sure she'll be there with Office Space for replicas and quoted lines.
