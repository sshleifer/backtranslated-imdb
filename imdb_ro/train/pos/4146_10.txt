Anyone who has lived through the centuries of revenge of monsters and girls will appreciate this film. It's one of those movies that offers everything you want in a "Spring Movie" PLUS makes fun like a college movie. It's funny, she has a cast to die to make you laugh aloud (Amy Pohler, Rachel Dratch, Sophie Monk, Parker Posey, Missy Pyle!). Writer / actor Rachel Dratch is a comic genius, and Sophie Monk is such a bastard. Wilson Phillips! I DO NOT BELIEVE! (Just repeat now ...) Live with girls who like Miranda July, but I feel like eating ice cream and claim to be stupid.
