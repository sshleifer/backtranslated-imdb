For a long time I have not seen such a beautiful animated feature. Having a healthy respect for Pixar, I have to say that Ratatouille or any other film made by them can not be compared to it. Animators have created an incredibly beautiful world here. The graphics are stunning, the backdrops are wonderful, almost every object in each frame is drawn perfectly. Sometimes I felt my movements on the back - so much I liked what I saw. The land is absolutely romantic. As romantic as animated film. The characters are full of love, especially Hector, the blue rabbit, which he holds, pawns, rocks and rules! The other characters are very beautiful. Humor is top. Generally, it seemed like the creators did not invest too much in this. I mean, it does not seem to have taken much of it from people at Pixar & Dreamworks who are trying to think of something new from time to time. And I am very pleased that a product of the European animation studio has proven to be so great. They made a wonderful movie, touching, a candy for the eyes and the heart. The only minus is the bad start and that's why it's 9of10 not 10/10
