I've seen this movie just once 25 years ago and so far I've always told people it's probably the best movie I've ever seen. Since there was no verbal dialogue and only a thought-out dialogue, I found the movie to be enthusiastic and I just woke up holding my breath to make no sound. I would recommend this movie, I would like it to be available on DVD.
