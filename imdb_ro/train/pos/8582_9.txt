Love the characters and story line. Very funny, with lots of action. Thomas Ian Griffith and Tia Carrer deliver extraordinary results. I liked Griffith's dynamic and comical interaction and career. Donald Southerland plays a very pleasant, surprisingly nice, burned man. All three actors are among my favorites and I made them in this film made for special treatment. A nice addition to my vast DVD collection. I recommend this film. If you like ... Mr. and Mrs. Smith, The Killers of Replacement, L.A. Confidential, The Long Kiss Kiss Goodnight, Abisul and The Whole Nine Yards ... you will love this movie.
