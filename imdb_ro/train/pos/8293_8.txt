As a 90-minute experience, it's not up to the "Drive" standard, because the actors have clearly learned their trade at "Who am I?" academy, while the action sequences are generally not better than those in the superb game mark by Mark Dacascos. However, those who enjoyed "Drive", (and I thought it was wonderful!), Will undoubtedly enjoy this too. You will definitely not return to the beginning and you will not look at everything, but you will definitely return to some action scenes for a long time. It is cool to see that the art of quality fighting choreography is still practiced, even if not in Hong Kong, and I would like to see what these boys can do with their budgets, time and respect for Yuen Woo-ping and Corey Yuen Kuei . If you stay in the first half an hour and you are not crazy about the atrocious dialogue, then you are in a treatment. Bosch is magnificent and can really bust a movement with some magnificent acrobatics, blows and simple acts of bravery. If you are lucky enough to be 500 kilometers away from a copy, then watch it and watch it. It's not Shakespeare. In fact, it's less articulated than Coolio in "China Strike Force," but you'll be impressed with both the movements displayed and the stunningness felt by the stunt team - (I'm pretty sure there's no safe way to land directly on the head, or be forced to head a head of a wood of an acceleration machine !?)
