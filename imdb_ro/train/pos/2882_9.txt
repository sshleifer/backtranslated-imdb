Cinderella was one of the first movies I've ever seen, and it's timeless for me. It's a great movie with a superb animation. My favorite animation scene was the clothing scene - I like those mice. The songs are also wonderful, not as good as Snow White's, but they are a pleasure to sing and remind of Tchaikovsky. A dream is a desire and so is love? are standouts. Characters are also a delight. Cinderella is idealistic and strong, and mice have offered a great comic relief. They have also done well, as well as Lucifer. But I fell in love with the best stepmother, it was very bad, compared to a great character in the name of the Mother of God. It's true, the film draws lightly with the ancient mice, but they were really funny, so I do not care. I do not think it's overstated, undervalued, do not you mean? They rarely play on TV, but the really bad continuation is on Cinemagic on a regular basis. if you want a great adaptation for Cinderella, try the wonderful Ever After, or generous Slipper and Rose, which is not as good. But whatever you do, avoid the continuation that I have the mistake of having, because you will thank me. 9/10. Bethany Cox
