Okay, we have extreme violence in Verhoeven (although it's not as extreme as other Verhoeven movies), we have a lot of sex and nudity, but something is missing ... Oh, yes, I miss the information that Paul Verhoeven knows about movies its SF. I admire the way Verhoeven introduces the characters and the way they have a sense of humor, but unlike most Verhoeven films, the film itself does not have enough humor to make it comedy. What makes Hollow Man a good movie is not the story, not the characters or the characters, but the stunning effects of the special effects that would otherwise make a movie impossible. The crew really made an invisible man without using things like a floating hat hanging on piano threads and other practical effects (effects on the set). The most amazing scenes of effects are not seen while Kevin Bacon is invisible, are when Kevin Bacon becomes invisible and visible. The problem is that this invisible man story deserves to be more pictures. This is mostly done in a laboratory. I would have liked to see the invisible Kevin Bacon robbing a bank and moving away from it or saying that they were stealing something from people's wallets or something like that. But what is shown is decent enough to make a Hollow Man a fun movie. Grade: B
