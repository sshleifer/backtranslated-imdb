A strong adaptation of the best-selling book and Broadway game refers to the life of Bessie and Sadie Delany, two "colorful" sisters who have passed the age of 100. They played wonderful at their ages by Ruby Dee and Diahann Carroll, telling their story in flashbacks to Amy Hill Hearth (played by Amy Madigan), a white New York Times reporter. Flashbacks and current scenes are not so inspired in them as in the book, but they are really powerful. However, certain aspects of the life of the sisters, such as their mother's inter-racial background and the reasons behind their father's strict personality, are not clearly stated. You must read the book to fully understand these things. Which is just as good, because the book is just as wonderful! Apart from these flaws, it is wonderful made and accomplished, especially by Dee and Carroll, and a very powerful and educational film.
