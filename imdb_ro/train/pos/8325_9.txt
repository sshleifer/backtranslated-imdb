I liked the idea of ​​this movie from the moment I saw a trailer for the first time. Einstein has always been one of my heroes and his image as a gentle, playful, easy mad genius was enough to make me see the movie. Added by Matthau spices as Einstein did it even better. The story is purely fancy, but delightful. A car mechanic falls in love with a beautiful woman who happens to be Einstein's niece. With the help of four gods of Fairy physics, Ed launches a search to win Catherine's heart. Throw a jealous fiancé (exemplifying the worst of experimental psychology) and Eisenhower into the mix and have a pure fun. The film is full of great value actors and delicious sweet and daffy shows. Walter Matthau plays Einstein's role as an impressive evil; cupid with a slide rule. Tim Robbins is awesome endearing as Ed and Meg Ryan play a step above her normal rom-com. Stephen fry is a joy like Ryratman's "RRRatman" and fiancé; who does not have a single romantic body in his body. The film fell under most of the radars, but it is a delightful treasure that does not multiply with repeated views. It offers first-class writing and performance and is a delicate treatment in a less mild world.
