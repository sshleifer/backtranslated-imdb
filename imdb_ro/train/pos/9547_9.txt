This film is the first cinematic experience for many people in the cast. All of them are experienced actors and have played in several television series and tracks. Sahan Gokbakar is a well-known comedian in Turkey. It's weird to see him in a thriller, while he's at the top of his comedy career in Turkey. This film is the first long shot of Togan Gokbakar and almost the first experience as a director. But they all did a good job. We are glad to see such an enthusiastic bowl. It seems very promising for the future of the Turkish film industry. Doga Rutkay being Sahan Gokbakar's long-time girlfriend, is also a talented actress, known for her recent play in theatrical play "Number 27" and several TV series.
