Now that these days, some people do not see a filmless movie, so much Dogma, Lars Von, Brothers Watchosky, is changing what we expect in a movie, maybe Casomai is not one - more - Independent - American film, the movie takes all the resources and language of the film to tell us a simple history of love and marriage, but much more. Full of views, lectures and thoughts ... and I'm sure you can not fall into during a 116-minute long second. We calculated that they do not have a single scene longer than 3 o 2 1/2 minutes.
