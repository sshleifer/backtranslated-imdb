Reda is a French young man of Moroccan origin. Despite his Muslim heritage, he is very French in attitudes and values. Suddenly, his father announces that Reda will lead him to the Hajj (pilgrimage) in Mecca - something Reda has no interest in doing, but agrees only on the obligation. As a result, Reda is angry at first, but is a traditional Muslim man, his father is difficult to talk or talk about his doubts. Both father and son seem very rigid and inflexible - and it's very ironic when Dad tells his son he should not be so stubborn. When I read the summary, she talks about how many characters grew up and began to get to know each other. However, I really do not think they did, and this is the fascinating and sad aspect of the movie. Of course, there were times of understanding, but so often there was an underground of hostility and repression. I liked it and I appreciated that there was no complete solution to this - as it would seem to be false. In general, the film is well acted and fascinating - giving the Occidental an unusual outlook on Islam and Hajj. It also offers a fascinating juxtaposition of traditional Islam and the secular young generation. While the slow pace and lack of clarity about the relationship throughout the movie can bother some, I think it gave the film real realism and made it look like a movie about people - not a formula. A beautiful and unusual movie.
