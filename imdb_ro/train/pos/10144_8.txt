But the fun is on the way. I found this movie extremely enjoyable, not only that both are extremely easy on the eyes, the humor of the supportive distribution and the jokes made me laugh a lot many times. Yeah, it's predictable and yes, it's a romantic comedy. But the idea is that it's a sweet story, the message of finding a real love is also true in many ways. The dialogue is dead-on and the action is well done on all sides and over the top for the comic effect. The Bulgari scene is worth its weight in gold, the actress there is worth mentioning honorable! For those who have prescribed it to be predictable - If you want a movie with twists and turns that keeps your guess ... then you want a thriller. This is a romantic comedy ... touched my heart and made me realize that I was fortunate enough to find my true love in life and that it deserves any effort on the way. movie, a great movie for a happy cry ...
