This is a movie I never thought of seeing until the age of three had seen her at the video store and grabbed him after he liked the Nabooboo island's animal cover image. I've picked it up and I've been watching it since then; In fact, since then we have rented it several times. There are very few non-animated films that my son will follow and pay attention to; what a beautiful change from Dumbo and Little Mermaid. The actress is remarkable, the songs are compelling, you get deeper into your head and you can not help but sing. The story, while specifically about the Second World War, is timeless in its own way and is something new to be seen every time you look. I heard it in comparison to Mary Poppins, but I think there are two very different movies, both excellent, but somehow my son has no interest in Mary Poppins. This is one of those films that children will want to look back and forth again and which parents will not bother to respect. There are days we watch before bedtime and bedtime and do not feel that it's terrible that comes when it wants to repeat any other movie.
