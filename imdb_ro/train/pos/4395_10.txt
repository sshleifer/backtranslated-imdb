One of my favorite films, which has been overlooked by too many moviegoers, is an obsession that makes me misinterpret. Not only directed by the acclaimed Ang Lee, he had many young actors to become great viewers, eg Tobey Maguire (before Spiderman), Skeet Ulrich (before Jericho), Jonathan Rhys Meyers (before Tudors), James Caviezel, Simon Baker, Mark Ruffalo, Jeffrey Wright, Tom Wilkinson and Jewel. All the acting was superb and each of the actors mentioned made memorable performances, especially Meyers, who portrayed an evil villain who killed for the sake of killing. When the director's biographies and achievements won an academy award) and actors are listed, this film is usually omitted from their previous performances. I accidentally discovered the movie on DVD and became one of my most watched films. However, it is rarely seen everywhere on the cable. I look forward to reading what others are suggesting are the reasons why this film is not well known.
