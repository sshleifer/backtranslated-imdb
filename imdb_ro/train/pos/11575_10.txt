saying I mean it's not a good movie, but it's a very good version of the real event and the best description so far. And if you are a warlord of the Second World War, then this is a treatment for you, of four saboteur members who play roles in this movie. It is a theater that acts in the best case, but then it is just as it was before a semi documentary. I personally am a fan of the deadly death of our almost human human heroes in the Second World War and there should be hundreds of these films show us what they did, so they will not be forgotten by future generations. Nowadays, kids do not read books, I see movies. So if you want an extravagance of action, Ryan, that's the truth about long-suffering, scandalous resistance and the will to fight when everything seems lost.
