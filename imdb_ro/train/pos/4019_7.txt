Not being a fan of Snoop Dogg as an actor, I was even more concerned with seeing this move. I remember being interviewed on "Jay Leno" and said he refused to play Adam Sandler's comedy "The Longest Yard" in this movie. So, obviously, Snoop was on a serious mission to prove that he had cracks. I will not overwhelm Snoop for his performance in "The Locals". They are certainly better rappers / actors, such as Mos Def, who could have done more with his role. But the point is Snoop did a "good" job. He does not seem to get rid of some body movements and vocal influences, but Jack Nicholson has something to do. The point is that I found it convincing in the role and the tension between him and the captivating character of Dylan McDermott. McDermott, by the way, offers the best performance in the film, though its subtle action will most likely be overshadowed by Snoop's action, which is not so subtle. Being a great reader and aspiring writer myself, I could not help finding the characters and plot somewhat fascinating. It has aggravated me how Snoop's character will constantly ask McDermott to read his work and beat him for criticism. But you know what? I'm sure a lot of writers are like that. His character had to be defective, as was McDermott in his own way. My only light criticism of the film would be its end. For some reason, he felt too hasty for me, although the resolution certainly had a sense and was motivated by characters rather than plotting.
