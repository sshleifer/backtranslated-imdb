I saw this movie when I was 8 years old and I liked it but it was not until I saw again at the age of 13 that I really understood it for what it is; a cartoon about a killer dog with a real heart of gold "adopts" a little girl to exploit her for her talents to talk to the animals. The dog show, Charlie B. Barkin, is killed by his official business partner, Carface, who is absolutely diabolical. His soul then goes to Heaven only to find a golden watch that is really his time of life, which Charlie, being the gift of glamor but pleasant to steal and return, send back to Earth. Once returned to Earth, Charlie goes looking for revenge on the evil Carface. That's the young Anne-Marie, the only lonely orphan who can talk to animals that Charlie plans to cheat for his talents to return to his enemy Carface. But the bastard Charlie is actually looking after Anne-Marie and his uncomfortable plans because he has to decide to do what is right after Anne-Marie discovers her "best friend" Charlie really used to earn money for the new and better dog casino. Now she has to save her from the dreaded Carface. I still like this movie right at the age of 22. The idea and the plot are really quite different and original than those of many other animated films. I especially like the idea that a dog plays the role of a bastard for once. Carface was even better than it was in the All Dogs to Heaven sequel. In that photograph, he seemed rather dubious about his role as a villain.
