I saw this movie a few months ago on cable and it was fantastic. William H Macy is one of my favorite actors and his performance was amazing. He makes you take care of his character, even when he makes the wrong things clear, and Neve Campbell gives a show that is undoubtedly the best show I've ever seen an actress this year. She is fantastic as a wild woman who is wise beyond her years. Donald Sutherland is just creepy like Macy's father, and John Ritter is fine as a psychiatrist stuck in the middle of everything that's going on. <br /> <br /> I would like this to be in the theater because I feel it is a movie that should be watched by a wider audience. It's a shame, because it's much better than most new movies to come to the theater now. <br /> <br />
