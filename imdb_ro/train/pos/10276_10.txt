The opening of the film with a Bach Toccata is an aural hint of what is happening in this intense drama. All the compositional devices that Bach has perfected in order to preserve the intrigue and entertainment of the listener (and performer) apply to this film. There is no mutual sensitivity between the two main characters, and the lead woman in the final scene I feel is justified by saying she was raped even if her victimized victim feels he has been warned to fall. Mammoth convincingly explores the emotional gait and gender differences, but I feel she is not aware of how she compliments each other, given a healthy sense of humor. If Mamet ever developed a humorous response to gender interaction, I wonder how would this work be done? As it exists, it is very bleak and full of spirit.
