I saw this movie and even if I knew who the killer was from the beginning, I liked to look at him. I would recommend this to other people. It's pretty much on the Lifetime network of movies. And I think that, since he's close to Halloween, he could play more. So please be careful if you are interested in watching it. I think Alicia Silverstone played very well her role. I like a lot like an actress and a person. She looks so cute and earth. Kevin Dillon's performance was so for me. I'm not trying to knock him or anything else, but I think his brother, Matt, would have been able to better shoot this evil bad guy in series. Kevin seems too sweet to me. But I think he did well.
