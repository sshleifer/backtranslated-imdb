Pretty and charming, funny and full of beatings, less but significant plot, "Before the East" (1995), Richard Linklater's third film is dedicated to everyone who was in love, in love or not in love , she hopes to find her. It is one of the very rare films that is / will / will be just as exciting for teens, their parents and even grandparents. It looks like a very simple film without spectacular visual effects, car searching or long and steamy sex scenes. Two young people in the early 1920s, two students (American coach Ethan Hawke returning home after summer in Europe and French student Julie Delpy going to Paris to attend Sorbonne classes) meet on a train. They are attracted to each other instantly just before they start talking, looking for a train from Vienna, where they explore the city all night. They talked and fell in love. That's it, that's the movie. It could have been boring and stupid, but instead is a wonderful, credible, intelligent and moving story that gets better with every view (at least for this viewer). The high praise and my sincere gratitude goes to the director and writers to offer two charming characters, a gorgeous writing, always interesting and full of spirit, two wonderful shows and the magic atmosphere that falls in love. Julie Delpy, who looks like an Angel of Botticelli, is wonderful in portraying a smart, independent and incredibly attractive young lady.
