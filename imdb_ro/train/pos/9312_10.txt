I like to see this movie very much because of all scary scary scenes. I like dragons because they are scary. My favorite pieces are those where the raptor looks behind the pillar because he reminds me of a scene in the movie on Friday 13th with the little girl eating the banana. I really enjoy watching this movie because computerized graphics seem a little fake, but it's okay because once you get into the movie, you do not even notice what's going on and I think it's a good end even though we did not understand really what's happening to me first couple views I've been thinking over time and that's the big part. The other important part is how frightening dinosaurs can be if you look at it for the first time. <br /> <br /> THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE.
