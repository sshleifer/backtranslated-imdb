WOW! What - a - movie !!!!!!!!!!! I am not at all a fan of contemporary Italian directors. I usually do not like dramas. I'm not a fan fan Will Smith just thinking that he is a very good actor ...... but this movie! It's such a great movie with such an original script and such a good direction and so good action ... wow ... it's amazing. This movie captured my attention for a minute, and I really did not like the "Looking For Happiness" (perhaps because I did not like to act Will's son, who is a very bad actor, while children usually , he and last night in "The Day the Earth stopped" and I confirmed the feeling that Jaden could not act). I do not want to write spoilers and do not talk about the story, but what I can say is that this movie discusses love, death and other feelings they do not like to watch in movies .... but This movie is a great movie . If you have a minimal heart, you will not regret watching it
