my name is Heather and I'm a girl whose story was based on this movie. I want to thank all those who have seen this movie and enjoyed it. as cruel and tough as some of the things that were described in this movie were, really did not even come to describe how bad the things were in fact. not to mention what affected my mother and my sister. I thank once again for the wonderful comments that everyone has had, I really appreciate them. <br /> <br /> Hello everyone! This is Heather's mother. It's hard to believe it's been so many years since this movie was made. It's harder to believe people were following her a year ago. For any of you who have gone through the same situations, please know there are people here in cyberspace who fully understand how you feel. Our thoughts and prayers are with each of you.
