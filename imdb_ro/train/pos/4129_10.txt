It's an American cooking show. It will not be the Japanese version. The show is great. I could care less about cooking, but this show is just fun to watch ... From the intensity of the chef to the president. Really a good way to spend some time watching TV. <br /> <br /> You could criticize the show to have guests like Marc Ecko as a judge ... But ... Meh. It's fun enough to watch and generally the winner deserves the prize. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah and I am bitter John Besh is not the new iron chef ... <br /> <br /> Ala Cuisine!
