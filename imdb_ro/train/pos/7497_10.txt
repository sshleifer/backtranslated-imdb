I will never forget when I saw this title in the video store back when. I have always been a great fan of Weird Al and when I saw this movie I rented and watched it. I was too young to appreciate all the humor and sublime satire of Al at that time, but I remember much later when I was old enough to understand what I was looking at. If you are a "Al" fan, especially for his previous work, you will enjoy this film. It's done in the "Rockumentary" style of MTV and tells a true story (but sometimes exaggerated) about how Al got in 1985. You will love if you like his brand of humor and, more importantly, his music.
