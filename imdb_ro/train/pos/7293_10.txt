What do you say about such an absolutely beautiful movie? I saw this in Atlanta, Georgia Dragoncon, considering that this is my main city. I am very much a sci-fi aficionado and I enjoy action movies. I woke up all night and was ready to call her a day when I noticed that this movie is playing in the morning. This is not an SF movie, no action movie. Let me start by saying that I'm not a fan of Witchblade and Eric Etebari after watching some episodes (his performances seemed obsolete and robotic). But he managed to really win me in this show. I mean, it really earns me. After seeing Cellular, I did not think there was much in the way of acting for this guy. But his performance as Kasadya was simply amazing. He was extremely convincing as the evil demon. But it was so much in detail that this character really amazed me. Later, I searched her online and found that Eric won the Best Actor Award, which deserves to be worth it, given the best of his career and earned my respect. Now I keep reading about fx and the production of this project and just telling me that I did not pay attention (I'm sorry Brian). They made it very beautiful, but I was even more impressed with the story - which I think was even more of its objective (seeing Godzilla movies with immense effects, I even stopped). I could not sleep after this movie, always thinking in my head. The situation of an abusive family is never an easy one. I showed the trailer to my friend online and almost complained because he affected her so he lived with abuse. This is a movie I'm constantly thinking about and recommending a lot.
