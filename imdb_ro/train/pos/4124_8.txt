Lloyd Bridges as Mike Nelson and his boat were all stars of this series. What made me so good when I looked was the true sense of going underwater. The show presents a youthful energy for exploration underwater, which is infectious. The performance was also educational, showing the scuba diving viewer's point of view from someone who appeared to be a pro, Mike Nelson. They were great shows, and the program always looked good. Granted, drama in the script has sometimes hit the same notes in more than one episode, but each show keeps on any other show produced in this era, the beginning of American television.
