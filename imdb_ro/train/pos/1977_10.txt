I really like this movie. I remember once when I was in the 2nd grade, my teacher showed us on a 16mm film coil. This movie, however, may be a bit frightening for second-class students, such as the scenario where Bill kills Nancy and sees Fagin for the first time on screen. One of my relatives feels ill seeing this movie because she studied her in the musical class. If I were a teacher and I could classify the people who produced this wonderful film, I would give it an A +.
