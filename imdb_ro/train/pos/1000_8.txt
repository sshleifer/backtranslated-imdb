I liked the movie. Some action scenes were very interesting, tense and well done. I especially liked the opening scene with a semi-trailer. A very tense action scene that looked good. Some of the transition scenes were shot in exciting ways, such as time-taking, unusual colors or interesting angles. Also, the movie is funny is several parts. I also liked the way the bad guy was present. I would give you a movie 8 out of 10.
