You probably already know this, but 5 extra episodes have never been broadcast on ABC.com. I watched a lot of television over the years and this is probably my favorite event. It is a crime that this beautifully written and acted show has been canceled. The actors who played Laura, Whit, Carlos, Mae, Damian, Anya and omg, Steven Caseman - are incredible and so natural in these roles. Even the children are wonderful. Wonderful view. So sad he disappeared. Of course I wonder why it was canceled. I can not believe that Mrs. Moynahan's job has something to do with her. It was the right time for this market. I watched all the episodes again on ABC.com - I hope everyone will come to DVD one day. Thanks for reading.
