Scott Henderson, the engineer who uses Carol Richman as his assistant, makes a point to call her "Kansas" whenever he speaks to her. It shows us that Carol, actually played by Ella Raines, should be a babe in the woods as far as Manhattan of the 1940s. Only a woman outside the city followed the shady bartender to a high solitary subway. Even then, only a naive girl could do such an adventure. Robert Siodmak directed this noir movie very well. He shows a flair for infusing the story with a lot of raw sex, which was surprising for those days. How else could we justify how the drummer in the musical orchestra, if Scott takes the mysterious woman with an unusual hat, makes such a visit to a lady at a meeting? The drummer who played with high tension by Elisha Cook Jr. does not hide his wishes for any of the ladies who stood in the front row of the hit music where they play. It was a real explicit invitation, first to the "ghost woman" of the story, Fay Helm; after that, drummer Cliff, is very open to Ella Raines, who goes to theater disguised as the mystery his boss had originally taken. This is a movie that will swallow up any viewer from the beginning. There are things that are not explained in it, but it has the interest of the other. The killer is not revealed until the end. Ella Raines with her expressive eyes was an under-estimated actress. She has her own much more experienced actors. Franchot Tone, a New York actor working in Hollywood, has never found the fame he deserves in this environment. He is effective as the best friend of the accused. On the other hand, Alan Curtis meets like a man who, when framed, accepts his fate and is saved only by the tenacity of the woman who loves him secretly. Thomas Gomez, Burgess Inspector, is a good thing for the film as a detective who has doubts that the police have caught the man who committed the crime. This movie will not disappoint.
