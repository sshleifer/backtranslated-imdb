This is a jewel of a movie, not just for those who enjoy the fun and strange premise, but who love the history and traditions of Sci-Fi and Classic Hollywood. Every Martian crew alien is the embodiment of a Sci-Fi classical character or Hollywood kingpin and it is a pure pleasure to watch them jump from each other and the Big Bean inhabitants.
