This movie was very, very weird and very, very funny. All the actors are pretty real and very strange. The overall appearance of the film was also different, a kind of dreams and bleached, which only added to the strange, strange, strange atmosphere of the whole thing. It's not for everyone, I mean, it's not what you would call mainstream, but that's what I liked. It's different from anything I've ever seen. . . unpredictable, with strange rhythms and punch lines in strange places. Children are so naked (and full of heads) that can only help you feel for them. In other words, they are far from the "hollywoodised" versions of adolescents. All that is good for me.
