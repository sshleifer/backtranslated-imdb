Sentinel is a movie that my father recommended me many years ago, and since then I have seen it several times. She always manages to have fun, being both creepy and hesitant. Flashback scenes are what really made me. Cristina Raines' father, running around with sorrow, with the two creeping women, always manages to send me chills on the spine. it's your typical good and bad thing, but at least it's fun. The end I consider to be one of the best in the history of horror. He has a lot of shocks and suspense, seeing Burgess Meredith doing his job as Chazen, put me on the edge of the chair. Sentinel has a perfect stretch of tension. We're never comfortable whenever you see Allison on the screen. We know that something terrible is always waiting for him, which makes things tense. This movie is often neglected among horror fans, but personally it is one of the best in the horror scene and certainly enough for all Horror fans to be satisfied. Performances. Cristina Raines has moments of wood, but has come largely for the most part. She's beautiful to look at her, and her chemistry with Saranadon felt natural. Chris Sarandon is great as a friend, Michael. He had an instant presence on the screen and I could not love him. Martin Balsam, Jos√© Ferrer, John Carradine, Ava Gardner, Arthur Kennedy, Sylvia Miles, Deborah Raffin, Jerry Orbach, Richard Dreyfuss, Jeff Goldblum and Tom Berenger have memorable roles or small cameos. Burgess Meredith is great as Chazen. He looks like a normal old man, but what we find out is absolutely terrifying. Eli Wallach and Christopher Wlaken are doing well, just like the detective gossip. Beverly D'Angelo has a cooling scene that I will not hurt. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line. Sentinel is an effective horror film that horror fans, sad, tend to neglect. It will give you the thrills and the tricks you need to be satisfied. It's worth the look. <br /> <br /> 7/10
