You do not read anything about this movie (especially anything that could contain any spoilers). Watch this great movie without knowing anything about it - and you'll have great experience. If you like to see a smart, twisted story: Go, take the DVD and you will not be really disappointed. "Cypher" is not really a SF movie, more of a psychotic thriller set in the globalized business world. These are corporate secrets, what big companies are spying on research departments and the methods they use. Actors perform a great performance, and the overall visual style of the film offers a perfect coolness. Cypher is much deeper, more complex and - which belongs to the story and the end - much more, much more satisfying than the other films of Vincenzo Natali, "Cube" and "Nothing." Actually, this is one of the best movies I've ever seen (and that's something I do not say about every fifth well done). Sorry, I can not tell you anything about this movie without risking hurting your experience. Give him a chance. ;-)
