This is a wonderful story of the guilt-driven obsession. Matiss, in a lonely walk in Riga (?), Passes through a woman on the wrong side of a bridge rail. He goes without a word. Only sprinkling of water, followed by a cry of help, causes him to act. And then too little and too late. The film chronicles its efforts to learn more about the woman. On a local bar, he finds his pocket. He's making more and more of her life together. His "look" changes as his obsession grows. He has to do the right thing. In a wonderful dialogue filmed with "the former bastard boyfriend", Alexei forces her to face the guilt she feels too. Haunting long takes, a soundtrack to accentuate guilt and barking dogs. Footprints. Beautiful movie noir with a wonderful twist. A good indie is over.
