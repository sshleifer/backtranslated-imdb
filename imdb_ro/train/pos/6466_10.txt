I really liked this movie, so did the audience I saw in Los Angeles. After the film, many people were crying and saying how much the film had affected them. I can see why there was such a big blow in his homeland, Sweden. The movie is boldly directed and every character is brilliant, so you know these people all the time and care about them. Music is very natural and the main song in the film is rather awkward but inspired. It would definitely recommend this movie for everyone to see - even people who do not normally go to subtitled movies. He definitely deserved the Oscar nomination for the film's profound themes unrequitedly reflected in a small town community with ordinary people. It is a film that unites us in this divided world and shows us the potential of the human spirit. MUST SEE!
