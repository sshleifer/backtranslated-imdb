If you have not heard of this Walt Disney Pictures movie, do not worry about it. It would be classified alongside other Disney movies, which are intended for educational purposes, such as "Family Planning". She was co-produced with Kotex to teach pre-adolescent girls about menstruation, probably. It just educates on a superficial level, so it does not come in hard detail for the animation "Ram's Head" / reproduction system sequence. The movie shows "The Wonderful World of Disney" elements such as the return of the page and the use of animation to tell the story. This movie is impossible to find, so if you can find the movie, you will have more luck and you will enjoy it.
