We hoped it would be a good idea to be a fan of James Timothy Dalton's connection and, although it was not his third business merit, it was a laugh. Belushi brought a good humor to his side and Dalton did it nicely, but it was probably a little useless. his role liked a staged version of Jack Nicholson in a few good people. the other one in it was a bit shocking, but overal was a laugh.
