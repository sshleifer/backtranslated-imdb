This movie surprised me quite a bit. We had no big expectations, but I was wrong. Mary & Rhoda was very funny and well written. They did not spend too much time to revive the past, so they did not rely on the success of the old TV show to wear the film. Overall, it was very fun. My friend commented that it could be a weekly sit-com and I think I would agree with her.
