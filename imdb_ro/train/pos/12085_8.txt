Shirley MacLaine in another adapted role. As the aunt of a single mother in a working class neighborhood in Chicago in 1962, the veteran character actress gets another job as a woman who will not let any back sets defeat her spirit of success. The children, a boy and a pre-teenage girl, are attracted by their auntie Zoe, although the many magic tricks and practical jokes have learned from her and have applied to all the wrong opportunities to finally get them out of school. The plot is ingeniously rooted in the Cuban missile crisis, with all the social implications. Men build bomb shelters, people who watched the news programs about what seemed to be the only television, a supper and a general mist of anxiety and fear in the air. When a "harmless" miracle is blown out of proportion, the climatic conclusion still makes the viewer feel good. Yes, Virginia, the sun will come tomorrow! Clearly a low-budget production, this is still a sweet film, full of the magic that Matinees made on Sunday. With a choice of "Oldies," thrown into an efficient sound track, the whole family will enjoy it. ****
