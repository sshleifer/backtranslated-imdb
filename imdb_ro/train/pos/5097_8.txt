This is a very rare and probably the least known film in Shirley Temple because it is not on any of her collections. The reason he is probably because he does not have a happy ending, unlike all his other films. even though she was wearing a song called "World owes me a life." The film was made in 1934 and originally in black and white, the version I have in the colors and the VHS, I would say they did a good job because the color seems realistic, unlike the colorful films of Laurel and Hardy I'm terrible. The film is good for his age and the story never gave, I'm surprised that nobody tried to make a remake.At times the movie is a little talky as some of the scenes with Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard seem really dragged out, in some scenes, they seem to take fifteen minutes to say what they could say in five. Although do not stop because this movie has some really good moments in it, especially when {Jerry} Ga Ryu Cooper steals a necklace and hides it in Shirley's crayon. Tensions and slows are enriched in their actions, while her daughter is dancing to an audience in another room, is very well targeted. Gary and Caroles edgy facial expressions when put under control are also very good. In all this is a good movie from the early 30's, you accept it for his age.
