If it's an action and adventure you want in a movie, then it would be best advised to look elsewhere. On the other hand, if it's a lazy day and you want a good movie to go along with this mood, check out "Straight Story." Richard Farnsworth puts a convincing performance as gentle and gentlemanly Alvin Straight in this true story about Alvin's journey on a three-state grass mower in order to see his alien brother who had a stroke. Farnsworth is perfect in this role as he travels long and winding up the road, making friends of strangers and doling a lot of advice about the grandfather family along the way. The story moves along as slow as riding a ride, but somehow manages to keep viewer watching, waiting for the next lesson of life Alvin will offer. <br /> <br /> Spread on the couch, relax and enjoy. It's the only way to watch this very good movie, which rates a 7/10 in my book.
