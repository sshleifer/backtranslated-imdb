An excellent family film ... offers a lot of thought ... There is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie. Everything is perfect. The script is wonderful - it is so ... true ... such things could happen in everybody's life. And do not forget about acting - it's really great! Look at Frankie and you'll know what I thought ... This picture is a real can not miss!
