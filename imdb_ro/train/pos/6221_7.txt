If this movie was a bit better, it would be there with the best Astaire and Rogers. As it is, it's a great but long film with a boring subplot, Randolph Scott, romanizing Rogers sister, played by Harriet Hilliard (who is Ozzie Nelson's wife for you baby boomers). Scott are two Navy men. Scott meets Hilliard the first time he looks like a stereotype librarian and later after Ginger Rogers asked his girlfriend (a blond but blond Lucille Ball) to shine her. Meanwhile, Astaire tries to take the place where he and the old dancer have stayed. The result is a great number of dancing, with Astaire and Rogers as the team, as well as separately: "I put all the eggs in a single basket," "Leave to leave" and "I would have led the band". Hilliard is sweet, but a bit lethargic that Jane has turned her face to glamor, though she plays the two songs well, "But where are you?" and "Get behind me, Satan" - a poster did not care about that song, but I like the title. Rogers is vivacious and a youthful Astaire is a dynamite. The climax of the film comes to the end with "Let's face the music and the dance", one of the most beautiful songs I've ever written and certainly one of the brightest songs performed by Rogers and Astaire. In it, they symbolize the brilliance and fantasy of the 30 years. It is truly cherished and looked again and again.
