Boys and dolls must be one of my favorite musical films ever. It's a great movie to see and nothing more. it embodies what people have forgotten about musicians - they were made musicians to have fun, not to preach. Nowadays, we also have Chicago rent, which are excellent musicals and good movies, but they can not bring us a solid entertainment without attachments. The only thing that disturbed me in the movie was Marlon Brando, the guy can not sing! It was very annoying to listen to him singing and talking when I could not understand him. If it had not been for Marlon I would have given those 10 stars. Boys and dolls offer old-fashioned entertainment that we rarely have these days. Watch to have a good time!
