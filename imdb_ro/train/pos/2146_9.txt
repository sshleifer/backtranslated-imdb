I've just seen this exciting film of Japanese film at the 5th annual Roger Ebert Festival with the film that was passed to Virginia's historic theater in Champaign, Illinois. Although this film, subtitled in English, the film actually shows the world outside of Japan how rigid family structures, employment (salaryman) and recreation still exist in modern Japan. Writer / director Suo Masauki (surname and last name) uses the not so popular theme of ballroom dance to show Japan's societal structure. <br /> <br /> [I will also not use the movie characters if the world's readers may not be familiar with Japanese names that might confuse them. I will refer to the actors by their professional names appearing in the Internet Database.] He uses the help of his real wife, the professional ballet dancer Kusakari Tamiyo in her first and so far only film. She is a dance teacher at her father's dance studio. However, her real ambition is to compete once again in an international dance competition, which she was disqualified in the past. No, I will not say "why." See the movie. Salaryman Yakusyo Koji is the main star of the film. A veteran of about 25 films since 1979, he provides a sterling interpretation of a 40-year-old man who has a wonderful wife, adolescent daughter, and has just bought his house. <br /> </ span> <br /> <br /> And yet, something is lacking in its inner happiness. See this movie to learn how she gets involved in dancing in the hall and goes secretly to lessons. Most of the dancing characters are released by the traditional Japanese hierarchy of social structure. They are friendly, warm and welcoming. Of course, this is in contrast to the way in which Japanese society is structured with the philosophy of "the place for everyone and for everyone". The movie has so many funny moments. Nearly 1,500 theater spectators spontaneously laughed during many comical moments. This proves that the comedy does not have a foreign language. Actor veteran Takenaka Naoto is funny and brilliant, as well as Watanabe Eriko. They are two funny actors. You could buy and read a book on the structure of life in Japan, or watch this wonderful movie and begin to understand how people in Japan grow into a rather rigid societal structure. Watching the movie "Dance is a quick diving in the further study and viewing of other Japanese films." I recommend this movie to everyone, it is funny, it is charming, it will make you cry a little and warm your heart. <br /> <br />
