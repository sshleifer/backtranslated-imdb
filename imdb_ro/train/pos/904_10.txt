Suraj Barjatya is the best in marriage movies. And here it is; back to the basics on Vivaah. As the story goes, this is a story from the engagement to marriage. A movie that you can watch with your entire family around you. A movie you will hate alone. The story is simple, but the music is good, the cinema is excellent, the direction is the best, the whole movie has its own class. There are a lot of scenes that will make you cry, and I'm sure that if you watch the movie for your sake, you will surely keep your hands at the end of the movie. Shahid & Amrita Iodi kicked us earlier than Ishq Vishq, & Shikhar. Although Shikhar was a good film, it was not accepted by the audience. A Shahid & Amrita movie.
