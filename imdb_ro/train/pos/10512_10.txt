I first shot this movie on VHS than I had to buy it on DVD, it's on my favorite movies of all time. I read the book, but I think the movie is much better. I loved Gwyneth Paltrow as Emma and Jeremy Northam, as Mr. Knightley was an excellent choice. He was brilliant! <br /> <br /> It's a 10/10 movie! <br /> <br />
