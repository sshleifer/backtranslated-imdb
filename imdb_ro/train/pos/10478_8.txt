<br /> <br /> This is definitely a 'must see' for those who occasionally smoke a cold in their secret hiding place, trying to avoid being trapped by parents, teachers, policemen, etc. The protagonist is a lady forty, living in her manor, growing orchids, and not knowing that her so-called rich and true husband is actually broken and deceived over her. When she suddenly dies, she faces the truth. The bailiff comes to tell him that he has a huge debt. He does not know what to do until the gardener tells him about the recent success of marijuana in the UK. She decides after some long thinking to get rid of her flowers and start growing pot in place ... The story is quite original, the remarkable performances! I can only think of some movies that made me laugh more than that. However, the melodramatic touch is present. The film is typically British: jokes are not vulgar, there are no violent implications. It is not necessary to mention that it is advisable to take some currents before watching the "Salvation of Grace". It will be much more fun! Especially the scene with the two old ladies in their tea shop is hilarious. I thought my Jawbon would explode. 9/10
