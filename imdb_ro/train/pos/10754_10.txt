I was a bit skeptical if I had to look at this when it was presented to CBS. I was one of the most people who were in New York that day, I was going to school at Hunter College. I did not want to see again all sorts of devotion and massacre, but, like many, I was curious to see what it was all about. In my eyes, tears came to me by looking at this documentary. All my memories came back and only the intense images were unbelievable. I bought the DVD at the one-year anniversary and watched it a couple of times. How these guys could capture this material was incredible. If you have not seen this documentary, do yourself a favor and check it out. It is obviously depressing and will bring tears to the eyes, but it is an incredible document of this country's darkest countries.
