Animation seems to be always marginal. In Japan, this may not be the case, but in Europe, and even more so in the US, the animation has a big "KIDS" tag on it. France is probably one of the most comic-liberal countries, home of classics like Tin-Tin, Asterix, Lucky Luke, Valereon and so on (if you have never read them, it's not too late. DC or Marvel) It seems like a movie like this appears in France. It suits my damaging image of the French as art-based, anti-American and talented filmmakers. Fortunately, there is also a "dark scanner" there to suppress that vision - art seems almost international. Anyway, as Renaissance, Art, and French could have been gathering. If you're a normal person, you'll hope for that. However, there is no need for that! In terms of its slim, sleek and stylish look, there is a good thriller and a good overall movie. It was one of my fears for this film. It's so easy to turn the spectacular animation into a trick, like Sony and C: I'm doing it with Pixar rivals. I was expecting a confusing film, sometimes boring and not very interesting, but fortunately, I was wrong. I would have enjoyed neo-noir things anyway, but it was good that he deserved that level as well. NOTE: I saw the French oak which was OK as far as I could see. English might be more interesting with Craig and everything. A last word of animation praise. Was awesome. Very nice, nice camera, smart solutions (for example, my eyes looked very good, which is hard to do) and, thus, astonishingly visual I realized that I was breaking it "This is so impressive!". Then again, I really like the animation and I appreciate the effort that the studio made, so my verdict is a bit less directed. The good film, anyway, lives beyond the "gimmick".
