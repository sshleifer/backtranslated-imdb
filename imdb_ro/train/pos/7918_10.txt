I liked this movie. Actually, I liked being an actress in this movie. I was introduced as a pregnant teenager in the second half of the movie. You can remember me more clearly in the classroom when the werewolf is on the film. I was the female in the front row with my hands on my face in response to what I was watching at the movie projector. In fact, they doubled me a couple of times, so it's hard to miss that mistake. Thumbs to Full Moon High. They want to come to the cable soon. Cheryl Lockett Alexander Leesville, Louisiana I liked this movie. Actually, I liked being an actress in this movie.
