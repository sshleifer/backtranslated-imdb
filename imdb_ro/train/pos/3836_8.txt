Extremely interesting and interesting film. Similarities with David Lynch (which is literally quoted by the presence of red curtains in the film) and the novels of Franz Kafka (the house owned in this film is called Mrs. Grubach, as in Der Prozess ...) are clearly present, but in this case they are accompanied by clear references to the Belgian colonial past in Africa. The exact content of the film I can not describe clearly: this colonialism is an important part, as well as the inability to cope with such a past, but the personal memories of the main character are also a central issue and its search for social contact and love. These are the symbolic themes I have inferred from the film, but in fact they are only impressions. But even if you try to follow the linear story without these symbolic environments, you will still discover a very fascinating film full of splendid images (beautiful battleships, larvas and other ugly insects alternate with great dream sequences, the dark atmosphere gives it extra style to the film). Maybe you can say I did not get my movie, but I looked hypnotized for 1.5 hours, deeply impressed by the visual quality and the fascinating mystery.
