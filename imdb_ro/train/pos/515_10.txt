I remember the first time I saw this movie - I was in the office working over the weekend and the TV was in background noise. But I woke up more and more involved in this movie that I have never seen or heard until I was completely absorbed. A matter of life and death (the British title - Stairway to Heaven in the US) is delightful, convincing, capricious and moving, all in one gorgeous, well written, well-behaved and perfectly targeted package. It's a classic that's really there with Casablanca, it's a wonderful life, it's gone with the wind, the citizen Kane and the carts of fire. Why has never received the same public note and importance for the video store? Fortunately, some well-known critics have put "Top 100 of all time" on their lists. There is hope - Fantasia of the 1940s was not a blow until the 1960s, and the Wizard of Oz was a boxing boy, but he made a television hit. Buy it - rent it - watch it - ask for it! You will not be disappointed!
