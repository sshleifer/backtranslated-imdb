Before I start, let me tell you how great this sound is in stand-up when playing Sonic Adventure I DX: Cut Director at the same time (especially the red level of the mountain). So, while watching this special stand-up, I suggest - no, DONING that you do it. Carlos Mencia rises to the extreme in San Francisco, California. There, he makes everyone fun with absolutely no excuse. I thank God very much here that Carlos did not do the things in which he uses the same joke always and over and over and over and Again. He does a great job of making everyone amused and at the same time being true about it; I know a few times that I said, after Carlos said a joke: "Damn this guy makes a good point!" Then the Game Over screen came over my TV because I forgot to play Sonic Adventure I DX: Director's Cut. What's wrong :) So yes, there is nothing to cry about this special stand-up. If you have TiVo or something like this, please do a favor and record this historical time.
