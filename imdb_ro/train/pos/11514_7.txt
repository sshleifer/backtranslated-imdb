It's never been the most successful television project, John Cleese, "Strange Case" has the feeling of a first project that has been rushed into production before any revisions that could be made. There are some stupid ideas in the whole and even a few intelligent people, but the story as a whole, unfortunately, does not add too much. Arthur Lowe is a hohot, however, as Dr. Watson, bionic bit and everything. "Good God."
