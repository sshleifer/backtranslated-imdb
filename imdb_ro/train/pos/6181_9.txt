A very nice movie, giving you to know how to watch musical / old mysteries. Maybe it does not come to Agatha Christie or even Thin Man mysteries like a noir movie, but it's more interesting than your guy's "boy meets girl" or "let's put a show" in musical backstage. As a musical, it's not a Busby Berkley unit or a Freed unit, but it can boost the classic "Coctail for Two" and the weird "Marijuana Sweet." The film runs in real-time during a stage show, on the opening night of Vanities, where a murder - and soon another murder - is discovered behind the scenes. Is he the killer in front of the curtain? Sure, but the search is fun, even if it's somewhat predictable and marked by comic relief bursts (fortunately in the form of the female goddess of choir girls, Toby Wing). The stupid cop is just a little too stupid, the driving hero is just a little too pleasant, the lady driving a bit too graceful, the naive first donna a little too bitch, and enamored waif a bit too self-sacrifice but as stereotypes go, they're pretty stylish. There are a lot of really gorgeous girls who are even better chosen than the girls for a Busby Berkley musical of the same period that sometimes tend to be a little on the full side. Yes, this movie could have been a lot better than it is, and Duke Ellington's number is embarrassing, but if you enjoy diving in old movies, this will prove to be an extraordinary tantalizing trip.
