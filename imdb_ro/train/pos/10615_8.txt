The Unseen is made in a style more like Hollywood's old mysteries than a horror show. The movie is somewhat slow, but a myriad of bizarre images keep the movie live and watchable. The basic idea of ​​young girls watching something in the basement is old, but good production and production make the movie worth watching. The film is notable for its emotional impact and certainly not for any explicit action or special effects. I rated it at 8 out of 10.
