Well, not really. This movie is really fun though. I went and saw her with my friend last night and I had to use the routine "I think there might be something in my eyes." The film is a great combination of comedy and a typical story. Jim Carey is great as a lucky reporter who has the power to change himself and the city where he lives. In fact, all the characters are wonderful. The movie is not too funny or funny, a good move to go see with your wife. <br /> <br /> All in All 8/10 .... Note * I'm not an easy student. All this is from BigV over and over!
