Overall, I found this movie funny and fun to watch, with lots of laughs of loud moments. <br /> <br /> But this movie is not for everyone. That's why we created this quick question if you answer yes to any of the following questions than we recommend watching this movie (1) Do you enjoy brutal sexual humor? (2) Do you like the humor of alcohol? (2) Do you like the amazingly hot faces? (3) Do you like to see tits? (4) Do you like to see more tits? (5) Did I mention all the beautiful bouquets in this movie? If you noticed the spoiler alert, which refers to the amount of nudity you can expect in the movie, I have no idea what the story was about. Not that it matters.
