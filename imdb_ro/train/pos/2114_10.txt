Two warrior workers in a leather garment shop turn out to be secretly loved as they match under box number aliases. In this simple idea and in a day-to-day atmosphere, Lubitsch produces a rich tapestry of mood, drama, polarity and irony that never leaves. Stewart and Sullavan are perfect as the average couple with real emotions and tensions, and the rest of the well-developed characters have their own sub-plots and jokes. Though it was mistakenly eclipsed by Stewart's 39/40 films (Destry, Philadelphia Story, Mr. Smith), this is easy to look and we enjoy a whole range of subtleties that are not seen in other movies.
