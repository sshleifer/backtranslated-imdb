I caught the first film on his first run on HBO in (probably) 1981 and aged 15. I thought the movie was hilarious. I remember I DO NOT see the images of Alfred E. Neuman shown in the theater trailers. When the MAD magazine satirized the movie and abruptly halted halfway with the apology of the "ordinary band" because they had snuffed such a piece of nonsense, I just assumed they were having fun themselves, which I'm sure they are, to find them seriously (and Ron Liebman) so embarrassed to remove his name from any credits, I was quite surprised. Certainly there are many worse movies to be associated. Watching the video now (at the age of 32) with the restored MAD references, I still take a shot from it. And being a fan of Ron Liebman (Hot Rock, Where's Poppa?) I think that's his crown jewel of the shows (SAY IT AGAAAAIN)
