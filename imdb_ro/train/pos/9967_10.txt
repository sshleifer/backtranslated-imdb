There are a few things I will never understand; why body linen comes in packs of three, when this is not enough, is an example. Similarly, I will never understand this movie, and that's brilliant. If you get close to this movie, waiting for a real movie, you may be getting closer to Satan waiting for a hug; although this may be possible if you salute the satanic figures of this movie. Take Pitch, for example; the most ineffective camp, the black portrayal of a devil since Freddy Mercury and Wayne Sleep joined forces to create a ten-Satan outfit in red body paint and hooded condoms. However, it creates some of the most hilarious moments of any movie ever. Seriously, this is not undervalued. The same can be applied to any other character that prevents the girl who acts so innocently that she is probably excessively compensated for a serious crime he is part of. Then, again, if the Santa Claus reconditioning station is real, there is no chance that it could have avoided it so much. Simply put, if you have not seen this movie, you can not be considered a serious bastard. Painful characterization, characterization, concept, and racism almost under radar make this seen above any movie up to now (if you are after the pure laughter that it is).
