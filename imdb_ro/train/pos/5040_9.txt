I first saw the Frailty trailer on Yahoo Movies over the course of the day, after I heard Stephen King praising her in high heavens. Not even a fan of any star, I still wanted to see him because I'm a huge thriller fan. I was not disappointed. The act was superb, especially from the two young boys. Usually, I've got a lot of actors, but the young Adam and the young Fenton were excellent. Bill Paxton has indeed done a good job of guidance. She was beautifully shot. <br /> <br /> You also need to notice the overturning of the plot. The three end breaks hit hard and fast, and I did not see them coming. The final twist of the film, accompanied by the gravity of what has just been revealed, gives me chills until today, even though I have watched the movie so many times. A real jewel.
