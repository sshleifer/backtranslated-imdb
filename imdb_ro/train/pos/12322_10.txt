This movie is one of my favorites. It's a mix of genre with action ingredients / / Horror / Romantic / Comedygenre. Some special effects may seem outdated compared to modern standards. This minor defect is easy to ignore. There is so much to discover in this story. The romantic relationship between the two main characters is so beautiful that it hurts. And the pictures are beautiful. The action is wonderful, which is not a surprise, originated in Honkong, the birthplace of the best action movies in the world. Humor sometimes seems a bit stupid, but in a good way. Somehow this movie is capable of balancing the various provisions and staying good. Absolutely recommended.
