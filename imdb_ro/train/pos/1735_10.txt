DeCarlo's debut debut has everything the writers could do - from the Franco-Prussian war to the American Civil War, the great Western American, elderly San Francisco, the ballet, the opera, the vudevil, the waste. Even when you thought the intrigue could not get a screwdriver, it is. It is wonderful, taken in the cheek. The character of DeCarlo (here named Anna Marie - NOT Salome, the role he is dancing) is freely based on the career of renowned Lola Montez, who was the mistress of the king of Prussia and provoked a revolution when he gave him the crown jewels. He escaped to the West. There is a town in Arizona called "Salome, where he danced," based on the historical fact that Lola Montez danced Salome's role there. StageCoach Cleve and the Russian noble falling into its charm are not historically accurate, nor do I think it is the Chinese wise with the Scottish accent - but it is one of my favorite classics, and DeCarlo is beautiful in all beauty.
