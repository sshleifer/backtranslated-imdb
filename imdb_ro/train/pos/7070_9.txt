One of the most appealing elements of a Gilliam film is that well-done images, anxious backgrounds and frustrated manners are evidence of creator involvement. Instead of most movies (if the director is a director-for-hire who is paid to present a star or two), you can feel the presence of Terry Gilliam through the experience. "12 Monkeys" is proof of Gilliam's own vision and style, unlike making films offbeat for their sake. "12 Monkeys" is a similar version of Gilliam's repertoire: oppressive / recessive societies, protagonist loneliness, frustration associated with unbelief and parallels. In this film, Gilliam does an excellent job of destroying the lines between the two areas, using ambiguities to force the public to believe rather than to know. This tendency for Gilliam to neglect to fill certain gaps leads to criticism of the pretense of art. The difference between Gilliam and the poster of artists is that Gilliam's choices clearly have a purpose and all his pictures make sense. Cole's two almost identical bathing scenes were meant to unravel comparisons that left the audience uneasy. His bald head is a sign of uniformity in the disease-ill future world, but it has made him recognized in the world since 1996. The title itself is a fingerprint of Gilliam's creativity, because it requires that most of the story be perfected for its meaning to be fully understood. Generally, Gilliam's dedication to making creative films that are exciting to pursue still requires thought and interpretation from the public. The movie has a tremendous amount of review because there are subtle details and suggestions that can be forgotten at first viewing. Definitely one of my favorites.
