- After their sons are sentenced to life in prison, Adelle (Debbie Reynolds) and Helen (Shirley Winters) begin to receive threatening phone calls, because someone has fallen on their sons has fallen slightly. The couple decides to move to California to get rid of the process and start a new life. Start a dance school that is very successful very soon. One of the students has a rich unmarried father with whom Adelle falls in love quickly. Meanwhile, Helen is busy growing rabbits and becoming a little too infatuated with a radio evangelist. It is only a short period of time before everything falls apart and women enter a world of madness and crime. - I can not help but compare the problem with Helen? to whom she killed Auntie Roo? also Shelly Winters. If the film seemed almost narrow in his crazy Auntie Roo's presentation, there's nothing to keep Helen back in this movie. It may take a long time from the movie, but once it's in, Helen is a Bad Mad Mutha. You do not want to move with her. Winters is so delightfully demented that it was impossible for me not to enjoy her performance. I'm not going to ruin the movie, but the things Helen can do is over. As well as Winters, Reynolds is totally ridiculous in her role as a gold dancer. I have the impression she thought she was in a movie that would make her a nomination for a prize. It's not Citizen Kane! Stop acting so seriously. Hey, Debbie, you do not realize your main purpose is to be a victim of Winters' madness. I really like these former female stars in the star-of-their-horror movie career. What's the matter with Helen? it's as fun as any other.
