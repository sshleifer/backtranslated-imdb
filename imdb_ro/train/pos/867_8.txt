Just like in Amelie's case, the recent French films seem to take a stereotyped male-female relationship, focused on a woman who finds true love. In this case, despair leads to a convict, which leads to its evolution into a prototype mob. Strange and surprising story in many ways, except that the woman is there to support men. For those of us who do not speak French, subtitles are not fast but not unreasonable. The soundtrack, as it seems to be happening more and more in the case of European films, is great and suits perfectly with the variations of the film. Nothing seems to be forced. From a visual point of view, it reminds me of different urban horror films. There's a Wes Craven in Chicago.
