This anime is a must-see for the Evangelion fans. It's an earlier work by Anno Hideaki, but his unusual, dramatic style is pretty much in place. Also, those who did not like the Evangelion could find this version a bit more enjoyable. Gunbuster is quite unique to sci-fi anime in the sense that it actually relies on real science. In fact, the show has some little "Interviews" lessons, explaining the physics behind some of the events in the movie. One of the great dramatic points in the film is the relative passage of time at speeds close to that of light. The series does a great job of treating the traumatic imaginary experience of leaving the earth on a six-month mission that travels almost at the speed of light and returns to a land where it has been ten years. The main person remains aged 17 or 18 throughout the series, while almost all other characters ages considerably. Be warned, this show is hard on the occasion sometimes. She also has some of the most unpleasant breast photos I've ever seen. It seemed easy for me to ignore the expensive uniforms and boo-hoo scenes, because the series is otherwise very good, but the spectators with a poor latency tolerance might want to stay away from it. On an interesting note, Gainax, as always, managed to get rid of money in the last two episodes. However, they managed to use black and white films and action sketches to produce good resolution anyway. The end is a little stupid, but it has left me so good in my bowel that I can only help him than love him. Gunbuster is, in my opinion, one of the most beautiful pieces in Anime.
