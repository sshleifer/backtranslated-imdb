There are really many things that can complain about this movie version of Molnar's mysterious game - Farrell looks good in his title role, but his line readings, honestly, smell. This also largely suffers from this being credited as the first film that uses the back projection. Sets look fake. However, there are two strengths in this show: although the dialogue readings are clear, the visual performance is perfect. Rose Hobart, like Julie, is a little remembered today: mostly for ROSE HOBART, in which Joseph Cornell cut off the EAST OF BORNEO programmer to simply take pictures: the Melford style credit for the stylish vision of the original. Its extraordinary beauty and simple performance (though the early attitude) helps repair damage caused by the earth-related sections of this film. However, one of Borzage's themes is the mystical power of love, and it is the manipulation of the celestial sections that make this wonderful thing, from the arrival of the heavenly train to the "Hot Place" trip. H.B. Warner's performance is, as always, perfect. We have a bad, but very interesting version here. I think Lang's version of 1934 is better, as well as the celestial scenes in Henry King's version of CAROUSEL, the musical remake wounded. But I enjoyed this version very much and I think you should give it a chance.
