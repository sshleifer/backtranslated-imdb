Many of these viewers complain that the story line has already been tried. That could be so, but adding the narrator and Dr.Suess as a landscape makes this show a watch. With an adult clue throughout the series and a touch of childhood through the set, the show is so reminiscent and refreshing. The portion of the investigation of the show is not what attracts the audience's attention. The twisted plot and the lines of love scattered all over the paradise as if it is what keeps loyal spectators to return for longer. This is a success that ABC should never give up. Bravo ABC. LOST was aging to revitalize the time of the first. 9 episodes before the strike of the writers left the audience desiring more.
