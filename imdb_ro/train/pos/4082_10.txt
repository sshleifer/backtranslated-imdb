Hayao Miyazaki has no equality when it comes to using manually drawn animation as a form of storytelling, but it is often compared to Walt Disney. This is so unfair because it becomes obvious by watching Miyazaki's films that he is the superior artist. He really has a thrilling gift for both adults and children, and Laputa is really a wonderful walk. But where can I start to describe such a magical and miraculous film? Miyazaki's work never ceased to amaze me. Laputa is a great adventure and I wonder how a movie can be so full of details and imagination. Ask yourself this question: If you are a child dreaming of such a great adventure in the sphere and so magical as it is? The answer would be to tie yourself in a chair and see Laputa, because it's really a childhood fantasy. Every minute of the movie is rich and appealing ... from the train follows the stunning flight sequences ... and the wonderful view of the floating castle itself. Not to mention Joe Hisaishi's excellent score! Everything you ever want from an adventure movie is here.
