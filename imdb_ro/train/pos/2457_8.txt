When you are in a state of mood or depression, watch this movie. It shows a lot of beauty and joy in a simple day-to-day environment and is very encouraging, especially from a feminist and humanist perspective. When you know both Turkish, Danish, or German, watch the movie in any case. Half of the dialogue is Danish in original, synchronized with German in the translated version, the other half Turkish, subtitled in Danish or German, respectively. When I looked at her in Mannheim in Germany, the reaction of the Turkish speaking public proved that there must be a lot of humor in the Turkish dialogue, which, deplorably, escaped me most of the time, being imperfectly subtitled. Still, the movie is interesting, even if you do not know Turkish. Aesthetically, the movie plays a lot on the theme of speed and slowing down. At first glance, there are plenty of rapid body movements like lightning, making it a fast, agitated film. In particular, even if this is a Kung Fu movie, take care of the running scenes, expressing a lot of emotions. But there are also some very slow, emotional and intense scenarios. And above all, characters are developing at a much slower pace than you would expect in a drama about the coming of age; however, there are some character movements to: Look closely at the Omar man, whose part and action I really liked. The contrast of speed and tranquility contributes nicely to the image of human anger and dignity - displayed simultaneously with the same characters at the same time.
