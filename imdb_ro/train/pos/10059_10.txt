This movie is the best movie ever. I do not remember the last time a movie drew tears. with a tear in the eye, I admire this film. It has all the elements that a good movie needs to have: Excellent Dialogues, Music, Acting, Story / Plot. A story of friendship, courage, courtesy and loyalty between a street interpreter who is famous for the King of Masks and a little girl who sold himself as a boy in the bazaar of the serf. The little girl liked to be his niece, and the king of the masks liked a nephew. They were not conventional in reality. Each scene they were together was invaluable. Working with the camera is perfect and catches you. The actor is inspired. Xu Zhu was excellent as the King of Mastiffs. Renying Zhou "Doggie" looks pretty and played her character very well. Zhigang Zhao as Liang Sao Lang was great. He played very well his useful and benevolent character. If you do not have this movie, try one time.
