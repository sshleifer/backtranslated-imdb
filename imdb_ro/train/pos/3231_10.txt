The soldier is not a great movie and all those who hate him have good reasons. But I really liked the Soldier, partly because my expectations were so low that what I saw surprised me. First of all, the direction of art is tight and well executed. In terms of science fiction backdrops, Soldier does things with more design, then 90% genre. The sets, costumes and props were all executed in a consistent and competent manner; I did not like the whole future military style, but I was impressed by this effort. For me, this made the film worth the time to watch. Second, I'm a Kurt Russell fan. I've grown up with this guy in some of the most memorable films of my youth ... Barefoot Executive and John Carpenter's movies. The soldier is essentially a film of action, and the role of Sergeant Todd is an essential hero of action. It's not an award-winning role, but Kurt brings convincing emotions with very little dialogue. Third, battle scenes and battles are well-choreographed. This is not an iron monkey or even a matrix, but once again far exceeds the average level of gender quality. If you have not seen it, and you like science fiction action movie, pick it up if you go to the rental warehouse of choice. Do not expect the next Bladerunner.
