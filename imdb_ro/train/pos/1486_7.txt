I was very excited to go see a movie "Milanese" shot in Milan. Alessandro Alatri is a romanian director who understands and fortunately has printed a film in Milan. The film tells of a standard of the Milanese couple in the career, from "birth" to death. The birthday wedding is so typical of any scheme that becomes original and involves all the wedding invitations in a story about how the couple came to each other and felt in love. Life is difficult in Milan's "uranium" and after the old sweets have become tougher and toughest, and finally the product: a child who, instead of strengthening the couple's relationship, weakens because "the selfish effect" of the metropolis. " advertising with all the "creativity" under the stressful atmosphere helps to get involved in the plot, we lose the values ​​of life and this is well and profoundly reflected in this beautiful and sharp film by director Senza Pelle. also characterized by a positive surprise, an unexpected good Fabio Volo, known by the TV series "gunoi": Le Iene Rating: 7/10
