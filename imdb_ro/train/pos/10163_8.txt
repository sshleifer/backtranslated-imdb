This had a good story ... it had a nice rhythm and all the characters are being developed cool. I've seen a lot of movies in the last two weeks and that was supposed to be the best I've seen in the two weeks. <br /> <br /> The character of Jason Bigg was the best. <br /> <br /> Even though he was young, he has been crafted from the beginning. /> <br /> This may be a romantic comedy and I do not like the most, but writing, direction, performance, sound, general design in all capability has just been thought cool enough. <br /> <br /> This movie was pretty big of all the movies I've seen lately - and the rest were big budget or better made public. <br /> <br /> Good work in writing.
