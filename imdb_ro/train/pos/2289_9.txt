I'm a rather pedestrian, with slightly smaller tastes. However, occasionally I try to raise the bar on my cultural consciousness. This movie was one of my attempts. I was amazed throughout the movie. I liked it so much that I took my own tape so I could see it again. This is a very attentive and emotional film. I saw it as a huge question for the spectator: What is the depth of sacrifice that can be accepted, may be asked to accept, should it accept? As a military member, this is, of course, an important question for me. This question weighs heavily on the viewer of this film. Recommended.
