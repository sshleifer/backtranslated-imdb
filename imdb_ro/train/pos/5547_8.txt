Strangler of the Swamp was made by the low-cost PRC studio and is certainly one of the best movies I've ever seen. A man who was hung for a crime did not commit a return as a ghost to the revenge of those who accused him. He uses a rope to squeeze his victims, and after many deaths, including the old man operating the ferry over the swamp, he disappears. The old man's niece takes over the ferry and also falls in love with one of the local people and decides to marry. This film has a lot of foggy atmospheres, which makes it very creepy. The cast includes Rosemary La Planche, Blake Edwards and Charles Middleton (Flash Gordon) as Strangler. Strangler of the Swamp is a must for old horror fans like me. Excellent. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars and a half out of 5.
