Indian cinema is the policeman of two broad categories: they are either the honest or the bad guys. The honest boys always shout at the top of their voices and struggle with the system, while wicked policemen enjoy most, but suffer at the end. This film increases at least this common formula and provides a refreshing view of the police and their lives. The direction takes an inner look at the life of a young ambitious policeman who. Music is interesting, and editing is a setter of trends as Indian cinema goes. The film is sometimes slow, and the dilemma faced by Anbu when it comes to the Maya is sometimes overlapped. But I would still give this 9/10 simply because she has many credit bonuses.
