Lots of comments on this page mention that this movie is a bit dark for kids. This depends on the child. This is not a movie for a 2-6 year old child; is more oriented towards the crowd of 8 years and more. I saw this movie when I was 10 years old, I loved him absolutely. At the time, most of the animated movies were a bit too copious for my tastes. This film deals with more serious issues and therefore has a more emotional impact. In this movie, the characters can go, and be sent to HELL! This gives a more emotional weight to scenes where the characters risk their lives. Good boys are not always perfectly sweet and cute (like other cartoons). They have "real" motivations, such as vengeance and greed, but also compassion and friendship; shows that things are not always black and white. <br /> <br /> Excellent movie
