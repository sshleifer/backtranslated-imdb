I've seen hundreds of silent films. Some will always be classical (like Nosferatu, Metropolis, The General and Wings), but among them, my favorite movie is this movie (maybe not the best - but the favorite, yes). In fact, when I looked at IMDb, I noticed that I immediately laughed at me because the movie was so cute and cute. Marion Davies has proven with this film that he really has a great talent and was not JUST William Randolph Hearst's lover. The story involves a Georgia hick coming to Hollywood, with all the expectations that she will be an instant star! Her experiences and the first cameo of the times of the era make this a real life for film lovers and a must-see!
