Ho, ho, maniacal homicide! This turbulent adaptation of the EC Comics horror tournament is undoubtedly one of the best episodes in the ever-made TV series. Director Robert ("Back to the Future"), Zemeckis takes full advantage of Fred's "Night of the Creeps", "The Monster Squad", Dekker who focuses on a merciless Ellen Trainor marriage, was married to Zemeckis when she starred in this episode), who kills her husband suffered by a husband (a beautiful house by Marshall Bell) on Christmas Eve, kicking her with her head. The challenges arise when a murderous murder killer dressed in peace, Kris Kringle escapes from the nearby asylum and decides to pay Trainor a decisive unfriendly visit. Alan Silvestri, scandalous, scandalous and typically-polished Dean Cundey's movie, still increases the macabre fun. And Larry Drake (giant Benny on "Law L.A.") With his terrible misfortune, a dazzling glow in his bright green eyes and a sad, really sorry smile makes Saint Nick bloody, sensational.
