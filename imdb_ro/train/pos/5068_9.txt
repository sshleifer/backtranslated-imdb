This movie is a wonderful movie based on the life of a man called Gray Owl in the 1930s in Canada. I realized he was similarly riveted and sincere like "Rudy" and "Awakenings". He begins late in Gray Owl's life and watches him through the most tumultuous and influential period. The film is about a Canadian Indian trapper who is about to promote the situation of the overcrowded baby. He also predicts the decline of natural lands and the excessive use of Earth's resources. This is a scandalous concept in the 1930s and surprisingly well received. He becomes a well-known speaker and the masses are ready to listen. Pierce Brosnan's casting seems odd, but it's not outrageous. Anyone who wants to argue this point must first look at the film to understand. Brosnan offers great performance, just like Annie Galipeau. Galipeau is a powerful actress, whose place with Brosnan is naturally refreshing, compared to forced pairs of recent Bond films. I would recommend this film to anyone interested in a good drama, beautiful landscapes or environmental causes. It's also a movie for families, though children under the age of 10 (depending on maturity) would have trouble following the plot.
