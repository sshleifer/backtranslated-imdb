I did this in the Danger After Dark box and I watched it only because of my interest in Hyde and Gackt's performance. I was expecting a horror film that was a great gore-fest and a very bad conversation. What would have been if it had been done in America. Instead, I find myself intrigued by the good character development and the way Sho (Gackt) develops through film as a person. The action skills of both stars have been surprisingly good, as they are not professional actors, and the director has done a great job altogether, establishing him in the future, minus flying cars and holographic panels. <br /> <br /> On a side note, Taro Yamamoto's performance was very surprising. The only other movie I've ever seen is Battle Royale, where she plays Shogo Kawada, and in this movie seems to be exactly the opposite of Shogo. Toshi is bright, exuberant and hyper, serving as a kind of comic relief with his ancestor. Shogo was the big guy on the island who killed without thinking about anything. So, watch out for his performance, if you're familiar with Battle Royale, you'll be very surprised. But do not look at the back of the box, because it's not just a vampire movie. It's just a movie with a vampire in it. Hyde's character is a vampire that is almost a matter of substance with what really happens in the foreground, and you will enjoy the last scene. It is a very moving picture at some points, the photo is very well done. It's definitely something to take the next time you're at Blockbuster.
