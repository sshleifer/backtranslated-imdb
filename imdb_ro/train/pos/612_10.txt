This remarkable movie can be summed up very easily. First, while comparisons with "Princess Bride" are inevitable, it is almost useless to do so. While both films combine the spirit and humor of adults with a fairy tale background, "Stardust" is so different from any other fantasy / sci-fi movie I've ever seen. It is such a hybrid of genres, but its plot and script are so unique that - along with performance, special effects, cinema and score - the finished product is not entirely comparable to what ever appeared on the silver screen. Secondly, the score is very effective to pull us together in the story and in the fantastic world where it unfolds and pushes the story over time, while creating the right amount of amazement and enthusiasm needed to make the magic credible in the domain in which there are characters. Thirdly, I did not find the film as being difficult to track or confused in any way. In fact, the interesting interaction between the three main insights has actually made it even more impressive to follow. Wonderful to do, and acted gorgeously across the board. This fantastic adventure (with SF elements) was the best I've ever seen from "King's Return" (not that we compare it to the two). So it's not so easy to sum up, but do not let any brutal and / or heart and cynical review or movie pathetic PR stop you from participating in the best moment you could have on movies this summer in a long time)!
