OK - for the two versions of this movie. There were two people involved in production - John Korty and Bill Couterie (George was just the producer - he really had no way to say that in the movie - just helped with money) - the "Adult" version was possible Bill Couterie. John Korty did not like or approve this version (as it was behind him). Thanks to the Ladd films that went through it, they did not advertise this film and tossed all the public money for The Right Stuff, hoping they would shoot them, and not. So this movie has never had a chance. When "Twice" made it to the cable (HBO) - they showed the rolls with Bill's version and John threatened to sue if he had already shown (did you notice how the adult version was not very long? ). Showtime received the "clean" version. The version on the video and laser disc is the version approved by John (who has more power than Bill). It is a sin, indeed, because the "adult" version is actually better and makes more sense. But it is very doubtful that it will ever be released in that version on DVD (or any format other than the bootleg). I'm sorry to disappoint everyone. I know all this information, as I was the president of the Twice Upon A Time Fan Club (still have many elements in the movie - they were used to have an "adult" version in letters but they were stolen - only have a copy Partial HBO now). 8 star adult version - 5 to "clean" version. Any other questions, just ask.
