This fantastic whim is an early prototype of what has soon become a very popular genre. I was happy to see that William Powell manipulates a detective story with charisma and charm and without the stupid attitude of his character, Nick Charles (of the Thin Man series). While the story is good on its own, I think what really makes this movie fun is Michael Curtiz's "fantastic imaginative direction. From a visual point of view, this is a rich texture film, Curtiz showing an incredible command of the environment; from screen shots to strange camera angles and imaginative flashbacks, Curtiz proves he was one of Hollywood's best directors, highly recommended if you are a fan of this type of movie.
