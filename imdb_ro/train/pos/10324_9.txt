The tremendous amusement set in the 1930s is a spin on the classic cliffhanger series, just as much as the "Raiders of the Ark Lost," made only by a low budget and a lot of campaign by director Michael Anderson. The opening scenes have a liberal volume of Gothic art, taught to Batman for two decades. Play as Ron Ely (Tarzan) as the perfect hero and the gorgeous Pamela Hensley as the local mona from Mona, who heads to our hero in a gold hunt in the non-existent Indian country of America by Hidalgo. The best line, our hero to Mona, holding a fist on your chin just as you expect to be tender with her and embrace her: "Mona, you're a brick!" Paul Wexler ham and cheese, Captain Seas is an absolute delight. Expect a bit of "Raiders", a "Batman" bar, a little "Lost World", a little "Lost Horizons" and a lot of plain and you'll be right. Beware of Michael Berryman's favorite cult as a broker, and enjoy the routine use of John Philip Sousa's patriotic music. A first candidate for launching DVDs is certainly delayed. An unforgettable treatment for the whole family. 9/10
