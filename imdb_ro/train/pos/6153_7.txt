The obvious parallels between fantasy fantasies Walt Disney and Bedwagons and Broomsticks and Chronicles of C. Lewis of Narnia are quite obvious. There are more coincidences than Bedknobs and Broomsticks compared to Mary Poppins, even if a lot of the same creative talent has entered the two Disney films. Like the Chronicles of Narnia, it involves some English children who leave London during the flash and come to live in the country. And those kids have to deal with a world of magic. But, unlike C.S. Lewis, the Rawlins children have the magic to invade their world and help defeat people to make a mess of it here and now. I'm not retiring to a fanciful kingdom, like the children of Pevensie. There's no hard philosophy here at Walt Disney except that it's not a good thing to eat witches even those apprentices like Angela Lansbury who learns the charlatan magic like David Tomlinson. Mrs. Lansbury did not become one of the most banal performers for anything. She has her own magic brand that even Disney boys have failed. And they won an Oscar for the Kingdom of Magic in that department for this film. Two artists have done good-time films in Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Tessie O'Shea played her last role in this film, she has made many films in the UK as one of the best performers in the music room. And director general Reginald Owen, as a general retired, who runs the old houseguard at war and in offerings of adieu songs to film audiences around the world. The team of Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. Sherman who wrote the score for Mary Poppins wrote here a good and useful one. The Age of Not Believing was nominated for Oscar, but lost to Theme from Shaft. Personally, although I like David Tomlinson's tribute to the most colorful streets in London, Portabello Road. Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a fantastic movie, which is still well after almost 40 years. Imagine how it would be with computer-generated graphics.
