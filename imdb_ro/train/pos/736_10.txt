A necessity for any punk rocker, this is the movie that made the Ramones a household name back in the early 1980s (when it first appeared on premium cable stations). It was one of America's first and best American punk rock movies with a classic cult status up there with The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Originally, the producers wanted to create Trick cheap as stars, but the release of the album "Live At Budakon" just made them superstars and an article too hot to be in a low-budget movie. Very good fortune for Ramones, who is looking to break out of the underground punk rock and mainstream market (which, unfortunately, did not happen until the groups disappeared). The band, especially Dee Dee, was not always despised by the 1980s, but fans have always loved them and could recite most of the movie while they were waiting to enter Ramones. This movie, like most classics, is stupid fun with some classic Ramones movies in their glory. Do not expect more, you will not find. It's a great fun, so you enjoy it. Another classic film Allan Arkush in a similar blame is Get Crazy with Lee Ving from the legendary punk hardcore Fear band.
