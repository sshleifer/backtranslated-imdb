A documentary without loss of words ... ever ... Suppose the narrative is more than a doll, suppose it is a comment on Japanese society. And as this film is as fast as an absurdist documentary, the style is constant, so fast, and as little translated as it is - in the current version of the festival scenario as seen today at Cinematek in Copenhagen - is still quite pleasant. <br /> <br /> But for the patient, and just for those really patient and open-hearted, I'm talking to Jim Jarmusch's fans with recent relapses, I think this is a movie for you. It's a smart movie if you let it win you. Very nice and pretty kitsch and quite Japanese subculture. And quite experimental. Static 2D in a 3D world. All in all, Fun for those who want to see a Japanese movie that weakens Japanese food culture. A big finger if you have a mood for something completely different.
