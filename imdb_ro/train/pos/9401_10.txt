What a wonderful movie, eligible for so many labels that you never get: Science-fiction, film-noir, scenario and high intelligence dialogue that involves an educated, cultural audience ... in 1960 England (and was presented only in the art houses of the United States when it first arrived) and has never been made in the US. The main characters in The Man In The White Suit (1951) Alec Guiness and Joan Greenwood commonly use polybasic, scientific reference words like "the polymer" and discuss and explain the concepts of chemistry as "long chain molecules" and then communicate the importance to ordinary people and the benefit science offers them. > <br /> <br /> The White Man (1951) is the opposite of the video-game explosion films, which now (2009) dominate world cinema and certainly dominate most American cinemas ....... is a careful action, said intelligently the story of educated and credible English actors, educated and accomplished people), and everything is done with comedy, charm, passion and a sense of irony that the ancient Greek dramatists would have approved. Everyone should see this movie and someday, some worthy moviegoers and his supporters should do like this one. Is awesome.
