This movie is perfect for all romantics in the world. John Ritter has never been better and has the best line in the movie! "Sam" strikes near the house, it's great to look and have fun so much. Ben Gazzara was an excellent and easy-to-fall cast. I'm sure I met Arthur on my travels somewhere. Around all, an excellent choice to take every night. :-)
