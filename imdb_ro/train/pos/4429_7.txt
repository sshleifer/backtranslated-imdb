I personally thought the movie was pretty good, very well acting by Tadanobu Asano of Ichi, the fame Killer. I really can not say much about the story, but there were parts that confused me a little too much and generally I thought the movie was too long. Apart from that, however, the film contained gorgeous fights that took place and many of the locations were beautifully shot, great effects and a sword play. Another solid effort of Tadanobu Asano, in my opinion. Well, I really can not say about the movie, but if you're just a look at Asian cinema is the Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or the House of Fighters Flying, I would suggest you try to rent it, but if you're a moral fan of the cinema Asian I would say that this must be in your very good Japanese movie collection.
