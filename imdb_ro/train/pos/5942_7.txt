I really liked BATMAN: DEAD END, I thought he had a theatrical feeling and gave Collora a chance to make a great movie. This trailer did not give me the same impression. The story line, or potential story line, was pretty good, but due to the action and special effects it left me feeling that this would have done a good television movie or a television show. First of all, Michael O'Hearn is not such a Superman. In fact, I thought that in his short appearance, he made a decent Clark Kent. I'm sorry, I do not think of SuperMan as that bufon. The costume that Kent wore with his size. Batman can have the body of a bodybuilder, but not Superman. Soup is undoubtedly toned, but not loose. Anyway, I did not care about all of his points, and his transformation from Kent to Superman seemed to be daunting. Now, this could not just be O'Hearn's fault, Collora might have to take some credit for scriptures and bad directions. Secondly, the special effects for the flight were noisy. Superman flies through the sky. If it was obvious that this Superman had flown near the ground, with the cables and telephone buildings visible above him. I do not think there were any frames filled with Superman's body flying. Obviously, O'Hearn's harness and support gear must have been located on the lower torso. On the whole, it was a good trailer. I would probably have paid to watch a movie, if it had ever been, and would be sure to get it on television. The story line, an alliance between Lexcorp and Wayne Industries, Superman is jealous of Lois's attraction to Wayne, Lex and Twoface, equipping Superman to beat, and the union of forces between Batman and Superman is a good one. I'm sure that with a larger budget and approval for a complete Collora movie and a company, even O'Hearn could provide a decent film. Of course, one better than most of the stupidity that comic has come out of Hollywood lately.
