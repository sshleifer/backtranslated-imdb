I saw this movie a few years ago and I have to say I really love it. Jason Patric was perfect for this strange role he played. The director ... I do not have much too much about him ... and no - That's the script, he's sure. Just a few words I have to say about this weird, weird, even dark movie, but it's a good one. I saw it a few years ago, and I have never seen it since then. I want to see it again and again. I know I will not get sick to look at her. The scenes, the atmosphere, the actors, the story ... everything is good. The film should have lasted longer. I think 120 minutes should have been perfect. Hope for Part 2 for this movie. Too bad it did not happen. Jason Patric: You're the man! very good movie. the end. :-)
