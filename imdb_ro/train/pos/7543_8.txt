this is a visual adaptation of the manga with a very small dialogue. what dialogue exists, appears in the word bubbles as it is in the manga. the plot of this is existent, but only vaguely accentuated. there is a manga problem on which this version is based, available in English, in the blast collection, "Japanese underground comic", and has a real underlined dialogue that explains the plot more than here. We recommend checking the volume if you like this because it explains some of the film's "plot", which is otherwise inexplicable. wise animation, this is pretty decent, a good use of non-intrusive computers and the images are, for the most part, done well. jumping in and out of the episodes, while the characters, a cat and an older sister cat, the dead brain, strolled out of a series of weird pictures: a boat, a circus, a desert. for half an hour they go through a series of semi-plots and settings, which makes me think that the director has chosen a series of long-term manga problems to adapt to the accident, but has been chosen primaril visually. knowing what happens may somewhat increase appreciation. this reminds me most of the kind of stuff they played in the MTV show, cartoon sushi, especially a short one showing a cat watching a man cut off his head around the house. only in this case, cats are better suited to their adventures, and their adventure is expanded to include death and reincarnation and a host of other themes [though not everything easy to tell what's going on]. This DVD has a director's comment and a "make" of features, but I can not comment on those because I did not get around them. Give me an 8/10 for now, here is not much to compare it to anime, and I hope for more than that.
