This is a film that on the surface would seem to be all about J. Edgar Hoover being on the AA Big Pat on the back to fight the Klansmen, going after the Indian killers, famous gangster hunting in the 1930s, his Nazi fight in USA and South America during World War 2 and Commies in New York in the early 1950s. Of course, in 1959, we did not know about Mr. Hoover's obsession with keeping secret files on honest Americans, people complain like Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., but most evil of all, his secret love affair with his deputy director, Clyde Tolson (If you want to find out more about this subject, I suggest you see the movie Citizen Cohn). Hoover Part One, this story of a life in the FBI as Jimmy Stewart said for a decent but dated film. Vera Miles as well as his devoted wife is also good. But Jimmy is the movie. As much as Hoover's controlled production and always assured that the FBI has been seen without blame, Jimmy Stewart gave the film a human side, quite an achievement considering Hoover was always looking over his shoulder. The bottom line is also pleasing. I read recent online articles suggesting that this is a forgotten movie. Jimmy Stewart was one of the greatest movie stars of all time and none of his movies should be forgotten. TCM was the last network to be presented a long time ago and I hope to show it again.
