Stunning performance from Simon Pegg, who gets better and better with each role. As usual, he plays the role of a very frightening character that makes you hide behind the pillow in hell for him sometimes, but that's what Pegg is all about. The ladies were regular and their eyes wet, and each one of them was targeting Penn. The film was set in a very smart way, where each character plays a very sophisticated and serious role, with Penn being the only humor involved, which is a great credit to director Robert Weide. without a round of brief applause to Gilliam Anderson, shining all the way. Highly recommended to everyone.
