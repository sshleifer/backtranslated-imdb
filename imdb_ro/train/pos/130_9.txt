In October 1945, German descendant Leopold Kessler (Jean-Marc Barr) arrived in a post-war Frankfurt, and his uncle Kessler (Ernst-Hugo Järegård) received a job for him in the Zentropa line as a conductor to sleep . As he travels on the train and learns his profession, he sees Germany ruined and meets Katharina Hartmann (Barbara Sukowa), the daughter of the former transport entrepreneur and Zentropa's owner Max Hartmann (Jørgen Reenberg). Leopold remains neutral between the allied forces and the Germans, and realizes that there is a terrorist group called "werewolves" who kills supporters of subversive allied actions and leading allied forces. He falls in love with Katharina and, earlier, reveals that he was "werewolf." When Max suicides, Leopold is also pressed by "werewolves" and must take a stand and decision. "Europe" is an impressive and frightening tale of Kafkanian by the great Danish director Lars von Trier. Using an expressionist style that reminds Fritz Lang and alternates a magnificent black and white cinema with colorful details, this film reveals a difficult time for Germany and some of the problems that this great nation had to deal with after being defeated in war. Very impressive is the action of occupation forces destroying resources that would allow a faster reconstruction of a destroyed country and corruption with the Jew who should identify Max. Jean-Marc Barr has an amazing performance in the role of a man who wants to remain neutral, but he is being manipulated everywhere. The hypnotic narrative of Max Von Sydow is another class note in this award-winning film. My vote is new. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Europa"
