There's so much about this movie. It's not your typical snack. Of course, there is nudity and sex with nuns, but this is almost incidental to the story. It is located in the 15th century Italy at the time of the martyrdom of 800 Christians at Otranto. The struggle between Muslims and Christians occupies much of the film. It was interesting when everyone ran from the Muslim treasures, that the upper mother would ask, "Why are you afraid of Muslims that they will do nothing to Christians for you?" Of course, there was enough torture on both sides. Sister Flavia (Florinda Bolkan) is sent to a monastery for defying her father. In this process, she confesses and trusts many things: the comfort of a stallion, the rape of a local woman by a new duke, the torture of a nun who was overtaken during a visit to the Tarantula Sect, and a whip when she fled a Jew. Torture was particularly scary when the hot wax was cast on the nun and its nipples were interrupted. Sister Flavia is on the verge of continuing to trouble, asking the society dominated by the men she lives in. She even asks Jesus, why the father, the son and the holy spirit are all men. Finally, she joins the Muslim ruler as his lover and they take the monastery. Here you see more meat than you can enjoy at some point. But the tragedy must come. She manages to repair her sweet revenge on all, including her duke and father, but finds that the beloved Muslim treats them exactly the same. She is a woman and that's all there is. I will not describe what the holy churches did to this heretic at the end, but before the Saw or Hostel torture over the decades. <br /> <br /> Nunscape fans will be pleased with the talks, but movie lovers will find a bunch of meat to digest.
