ROLL is a great movie. Toby Malone plays an 18-year-old (very good, stepped in, by the way) who is in football. Malone's cousin pulls him out the night before his big game in an adventure with many twists and turns that involve two gymnastics bags, a drug master, tough motorcyclists, police and prostitutes ... and the film keeps the guess about which characters are why part of the law, the contents of each gym bag, and even what kind of a key motorcyclist is. Some of it reminded me of MALE WORKS and of the two smoke. <br /> <br /> For me, ROLL has strengthened three views that we already had before seeing ROLL. These opinions are: 1. I really want to visit Australia one day. The country and the towns are beautiful and look like a cool place for a holiday. <br /> <br /> 2. Some of the best Australian filmmakers. The ROLL cinema was particularly impressive. I liked stylized colors and lighting in many of the scenes. <br /> <br /> 3. Australian women are HOT!
