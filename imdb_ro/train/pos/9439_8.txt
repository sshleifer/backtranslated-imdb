Before watching this movie I heard a lot about him and certain scenes in the movie, but listening did not do it to me, so I planned to see and watch it! Ned Beatty, Ronny Cox, Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds make an interesting group of individuals who are inclined to go to the Cahulawassee River and the unfortunate series of events that come to them all. Developing characters takes some time to teach spectators with a better understanding of each person, but eventually you know these guys as if he were your friend. The actor, the dialogue is very real, just as close to the reality that you can do to act in Hollywood. The character of Reynolds "Lewis" was interesting as a guy who is very tough, but under the male fur is a very soft and torn man (I was impressed by his performance!) Jon Voight seems to be the character who is the most much in the spotlight, the unfortunate circumstances that seem to find him at every corner really bit him and made him into another man at the end (the transition of his character was excellent). Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox seem like foolish tricks who want to joke and do not seem too horrible unless they have and did ... I was really amazed at Boorman's vision of Dickey's novel, very impressed. You can not go all your life without looking at this movie. I give it eight out of ten stars, extremely impressed.
