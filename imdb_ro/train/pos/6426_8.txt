One of the best films "Amitabh comeback" I liked. This was the phase in which Govinda was going strong with Dhawan. The songs were wonderful and totally called "masks". A cheerful entertainer, with the crowd Anupam Kher, who sneaks. The story line has a lot of hilarious ups and downs, as is known for dragons David Dhawan. With a timely appearance by Madhuri "Nene" Dixit, there was a total revolt to the end. It was great to see Amit play with such force and humor after a long exile. Although some might consider a typical Bollywood Masala movie, I would follow it every day. I give a slightly 8 out of 10 just to be purely Bollywood.
