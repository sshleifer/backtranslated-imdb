If you are under 13 or over 13 and you are quite intoxicated, you will enjoy D-war. If you are a serious fan of all types of non-brain action movies, you will enjoy D-war. Otherwise, do not bother! I saw the movie today with my grandchildren and 3 of their friends. They really loved her, and that made me feel good. After the movie ended, all the children (my nephew and friends) could not thank me for bringing them to the theater. CG is good. Action and direction are horrible. The story is extremely simple. But as half of the audience was children, they shouted, shouted and encouraged each time the dragons appeared on the screen. This has made the viewing experience much more interesting than it should have been. It's a good movie for your kids, but with the exception of the last battle sequence, D-War is disappointing. I give this film 7 out of 10, especially because the kids liked it so much.
