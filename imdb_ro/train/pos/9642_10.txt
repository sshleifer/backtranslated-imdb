The film is very realistic. Absolutely, it does not belong to Hollywood cinematic genres where each line has to be pronounced in a perfect manner and where every movement is accurate. Players playing lovers' roles do a GREAT job representing the feelings and thoughts of the characters - their daily life adventures. Generally, the movie culminates in a depressed state. Here is the realism of the whole story. Not everything happens as we think it should happen. But I can say that the film does not end on a bad note. We forget, learn, experiment with ourselves. This is probably the moral story of this story.
