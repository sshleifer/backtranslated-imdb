I know that many people have a special appreciation for the Alistair Sim version of Dickens' story, but for me this 1984 version is the one that needs to beat. My wife and I have a copy of this VHS movie and look at it together every Christmas eve. Often remarking that we could also watch Halloween, because it's a fantastic story. Scott - typecast like Scrooge - is bad and bad, making her transformation even more miraculous and moving. I think he's there with his performance in Patton. Spirits are all effective, each being later than last. Watching the dark, floating, skeletal shape of the Christmas Spirit that is just coming, sends me rivers on the backbone every year. And what support distribution? David Warner, in particular, is in the top band like Bob Cratchit, just like Susannah York's wife. <br /> <br /> I remember that this version is closer to the original story than most of the others - but I might be wrong, as it has been a few years since I read it. Regardless, this is a wonderful Christmas classic.
