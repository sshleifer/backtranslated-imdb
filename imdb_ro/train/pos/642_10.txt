I was dragged into this movie about four years ago by a friend of my French actress. In the first half hour I stood in my uncomfortable seat at New Beverly Theater in Hollywood, hating this film, hating and even hating the French actress. And then ... I do not know what happened, but I was shot in the movie in a way I have not been for years. And this was despite the fact that one of the projectors broke out and had to make every manual change. I was in the theater for almost four hours, but it was worth it. <br /> <br /> I think the great movies pull you inside a world, make you a part of it and then let yourself talk to your friends about coffee or a drink. This movie did this. It was one of the best shooting experiences I've ever had. <br /> <br />
