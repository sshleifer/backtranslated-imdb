I am completely dependent on this show. I can not wait until the week passes to see the next presentation. is an extraordinary line of stories and has the best actors and actresses on the show. I will tune every week to watch her even if I'm not at home I always have my vCr set to tie the monarch cove. simon rex is the best actor on the show. is suspensive and interesting. I think this show should stay in the air and I think everyone should be keen to look at it. I saw his first episode and actually I could not look at him but I was looking at my life someday and I decided to look at him because he was on him and I love him absolutely and right now it's my show favorite. I really say it.
