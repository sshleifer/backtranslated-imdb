this movie just goes to show that you do not need big explosions, billions of billions of dollars on computer, or highly paid actors and movies to make a good movie. All you need is a great story line and a plot. which the master of all Japanese films, Akira Kurosawa, is shining away. I recommend this movie to all those who love an era. and for those who enjoy Kurosawas works earlier. 10/10
