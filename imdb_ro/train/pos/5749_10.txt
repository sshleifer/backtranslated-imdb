I want to alert you that there is a very poor quality for this comment. Also, this comment will be much more important to you after seeing the movie. Although it is tragic to say, this movie has a resemblance to my life, which is so striking that it is really scary. The others will never know how precisely this film describes how people who were in situations like that act and react in their later life. It could not have been a fictional work; had to rely on personal experience. My testament to how good the film is, it is shown that although it was one of the best movies I've ever seen, looking at my portrayal on the silver screen was such a painful experience that I will not be able to see it again. But I enthusiastically support everyone else as a chance to look into the soul of another human being, as you have never experienced before or ever again. I know that, in fact, because it is my soul, you will notice.
