Multiple multiple leaves on the backbone! I'm surprised they are people who did not like it! I saw her at 10 am and still scared rigidly! And I've seen hundreds of thrillers / horror films! Because I cry aloud, I'm 22! I mean, OK, the voice works, not very good, perhaps even in the movie. But the real aspect of terror, the sound effects, the flow! From the very beginning, I hit you again and again with relentless and unforgiving terrifying scenes! So many cliques, but none can surprise / scare! You know he's coming, coming, coming, BOO! and still jump from the chair. Take a pillow and blanket, call your closest friend and do not watch him at night! Hats on the Japanese!
