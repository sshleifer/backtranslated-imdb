This is the type of movie you want to see with a glass of wine, with fire and feet up. It does not require much Christian power to follow, so it is very good after a long day. I would say it is very unrealistic - if you expect something serious, then it does not bother you, but it is very funny. Just thinking that a businessman would go so far as to accept living in a butcherhouse for a while and then enjoying it ... I would certainly recommend it.
