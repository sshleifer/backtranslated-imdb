This is not "so bad that it's good", it's just good! For those who do not understand why, you have the intellect of a four year old (in response to a certain comment ...) Anyway, Killer Tomatoes Eat France is a parody by itself, a parody of yours and a parody of me . It is the simplest text in cinematic history. I have the three prequellers placed on my DVD near Herzog and Kurosawa. It embodies the recognition of absurdity and undermines everything that you or I call the standard. I write scripture and this movie has opened a comedy for me that I have never seen. It can only be taken in the gates ... its exploitable genre ... for now, I'm just trying to get a minimum of ten lines. My comment ended some time ago. We hope it works when I send it now.
