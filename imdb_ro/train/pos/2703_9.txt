I am not a big fan of the kitsch and viewing type "so bad is good." However, I really like this movie for its fun factor and - I think it or not - is innovation. The whole thing has a John Waters ring and he's incredibly enthusiastic, but with some good actors and considering driving most of the movements of movement and domination. Billy Zane moves with incredible expression (see the bus scene for a book lesson on how to use the movement) and is framed by unexpected stars. <br /> <br /> Perhaps you do not like this movie, you can not enjoy it, but if you have the chance to watch it, then you will waste your time, because you will end the movie with a confused face smile and a new one perspective on the sense of humor of some great stars. Highly recommended.
