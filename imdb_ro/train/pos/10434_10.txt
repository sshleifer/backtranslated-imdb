the most amazing combination of love and mentality of the two young people, presented in the most sublime manner and surely touches your heart. a rare combination in which continuation exceeds the prequel both in the story and the intensity of emotions. the movie reaffirms your belief in love and the separation pain. the joy of seeing your loved ones is unparalleled and anything sacrificed. Ethan and Julie have developed eternal characters with such simplicity that gives the film a joyful joy and a love to follow. You have to watch the movie for all people who believe in true love. by far the most romantic movie (at least one of them) of all time.
