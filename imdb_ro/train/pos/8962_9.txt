Like a pagan, I have to say that this film has no magical significance. It's a "fun" witchcraft movie and is not meant to teach us anything, except that love is the most powerful Magic of all and never use it in a controlling or avenging way. This is a lesson that everyone has to teach, not just Pagani. After being told, this movie is wonderfully written and sweetly executed by Kim Novak and the venerable Jimmy Stewart. <br /> <br /> Hermione Gingold offers a starring performance like Bianca, Elsa Lanchester (with too many credits to mention, except that Mrs. Jane Marbles of "Murder by Death") was wonderful as Queenie at the top supported by Mrs. Novak. Also in the role of Jack Lemmon (great show) and Jim Kovacs (wonderful full of spell). "Witches can not cry, why can not they leave a single tear because their heart is full of magic. You do not have time for stupid things like love." Queenie. Gillian Holroyd (Novak) and her brother Nicky (Jack Lemmon) are Manhattan witches. Deeply wrapped in the hidden world of Craftsmen, they live among other New Yorkers as one of them without causing a high eyebrow. Shepherd "Shep" Henderson (Stewart), a firm, non-nonsense businessman, dedicated to being married to Gillian's old colleague rival. <br /> <br /> With a strange chance chance, he wakes up in Gillian's building and is instantly "bathed" by her charm and grace. By using Magick, with little help from Pyewacket (Gillian's family trained by Robert E. Blair) and Queenie, Gillian begins to work on this beautiful dreamer man to return to his old enemy. <br /> <br /> But Magick should never be used to control or injure, and Gillian learns that the hard way in the bitter way. Not only does she have to deal with what she did, but she has to confront Shep in her fault. <br /> <br /> From the critical perspective; Still, the movie has a serious change: The effects are very data up to the point of being pure camp. Some of the scenes were apparently shot in the basement of someone's house, but at least the characters were strange and fun. On a personal note, Pyewacket steals the show. Big cat! Excellent preparation by Robert E. Blair. <br /> <br /> As a touch of Trivia, this is the roots for the Bewitched TV sitcom. This introduces Samantha and Darrin. All note characters are present and accounted for. You just have to look, see for yourself. This is one of my favorites and I often forget. This movie gets a 9.1 / 10 clip. <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
