I admit I had some fear when I first saw the views for this movie. Was VH-1 trampled naked? I mean, Harris and Quinn did not look or even sound like John or Paul. But I have to admit that this movie really surprised me. He's away from the exploitation movie we've been waiting for. Instead, it is a study of characters, a confident, frightening, and ultimately bitter look of friendship and the ultimate lesson we all learn: it is hard, if not impossible, to capture what we had once and what has passed.
