It's an excellent thriller in Turkey that can make sense. A great job from the Gokbakar brothers. First, I want to make the game on screen. Overall, the screenplay in most of the films in Turkey is not enough, but GEN has the best photos to say "perfect". And also transition pieces are really excellent. On the other hand, "Gen" has a great subject that influences everyone. Especially a woman, who wants to be a psychiatrist in a sanitarium, has a mother who is a common folly. The main causes and psychological consequences are given in Gen. The only thing you have to do is to combine all the suggestions. There is an impressive part of aggression played by Doga Rutkay and Sahan Gokbakar. This show may be more realistic than "Irr√©versible (Monica Bellucci)." The last thing I want to say is "Watch this movie, you'll be confused"
