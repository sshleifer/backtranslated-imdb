I did not know what Jane Eyre was before I saw this miniseries. I read and followed several classics before, and I thought most of the classics were boring, over-formulated and overrated stories with moderately interesting plots at best. This miniseries Jane Eyre has completely changed my concepts. Zelah Clarke is a fabulous actress and she offers a wonderful portrayal of Jane Eyre. Her accent is delightful, and her quiet but firm nature fits with the character of the young governor. Timothy Dalton is an amazing Rochester. His passion and energy in the film make me think he was born to play the role of Thornfield Hall's master. I could not sleep the whole night after watching this miniseries. The land is both haunting and inspiring. Characters are made with pride and the story is incredible. This is the best version of Jane Eyre that will ever appear on the film. I later read the book and am amazed at how close the miniseries followed Charolette Bronte's writing. Jane Eyre is now my favorite movie and book. If you want to see a life-changing masterpiece, watch Jane Eyre's BBC version of 1983.
