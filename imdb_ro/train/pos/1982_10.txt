This was my favorite film as a kid and I've been in the production of scenography a few times, so it will always remain my favorite musical and I doubt anyone can re-do Oliver Twist's story on the screen, better than it did. My favorite bad guy must be Oliver Reed like Bill Sikes. Not only did she scare my life when I looked at her as a 6-year-old, but now, like a woman, I can more empathize with Nancys, the bar / prostitute job that helps Oliver get the life he deserves. > <br /> Jack Wilde, as an artistic killer, was fantastic, and I do not think anybody could do it, like his pocket picker and Fagin's best friend. The music is fantastic, especially Fagin's numbers, I'm also pleased that they did not give Bill Sikes a musical number, he would not have worked with him as such a sinister character. Carol Reed did a great job for Nancy's sticky end, keeping her in a G-rated movie, hiding his beats but giving him enough to show Bill's violence to her. <br /> <br /> This film is both charming and charismatic as a musical song, as well as a moving drama that follows a young man as he tries to find the place he belongs in life.
