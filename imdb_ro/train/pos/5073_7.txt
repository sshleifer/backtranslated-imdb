This documentary drama is what you would expect from Richard Attenborough, the man who gave us "Gandhi": photographed beautifully, forcibly, well written, in the measurable and literary manner that Hollywood threw in the 1930s and scrupulously precise. It is remarkable as a genre film that excels in its native American portrayal (or better suited to Canadian culture, First Nations) and standing with "Black Robe" as a wonderful piece of photography from Canoe Country and its culture (here, circa 1934). This idyllic portrait derives from his subject: Archie "Gray Owl" Belaney, a high school student in Hastings (England) of aunts who have become so obsessed with the "Indian red" stories of his childhood, that he has gone to Canada, , and became a fiery and adoptive son of an Ojibway band. He was a vain man who had the habit of marrying and abandoning Indian brides, none of whom seemed to have thought less of him because he was an extraordinarily charming and pictorial character. One of his wives (a smarter one than he, by most accounts) made him become a fictional writer and early lawyer to protect the wild country of the North, and this focuses on Attenborough's story. The chemistry between Brosnan and Annie Galipeau (Gray Owl's Pony wife) deals with it, and if it's not burning, it's still quite moving. A good movie when you need some time from the crazy crowd.
