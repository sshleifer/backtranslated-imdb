Either times, I like the suspension of any formal plot in this movie. I've visited it several times and always get up. A little too stylized for some, but I'm sorry that any opera lover will love it. Norman Jewison, a Canadian colleague, has enormous chances with his films and casting and almost always pays off in movies that are out of the center and somehow delicious, as it is. I often asked about Cher's lack of roles if she chose to minimize this part of her life or get enough good roles to chew. I found her to be a gorgeous actress who can retire in a role, as well as in this, or she can be strong and daring and fierce as in Mask. I have sometimes discovered comedy mistakes (a hair salon called "Cinderella"), but that was the intention of both the writer and the director. Nicolas Page plays a tenor of opera, all the extravagant gestures, at a time asking for a knife to cut his neck. The scenes in Brooklyn are magical, this is a Brooklyn under the moonlight, romantic and dramatic, just like the opera. However, a very satisfying film, which was not the taste of all, with a long shot, we loved the end, everyone brought together a Greek chorus, each subtly tinted part and mixing with the others, down, leaving the players talking. 8 out of 10.
