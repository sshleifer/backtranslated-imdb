It took me time to appreciate John Carpenter's Halloween. As a child, I remember that I really liked the sequels, especially the Return of Michael Myers, which I still think is the best Halloween sequel. But I thought the first was slow and it took too long to get it right. I've seen it a few times recently and I know now that I was wrong. Today I really understand this movie, the sense it has, the whole feeling of this masterpiece of horror. It's not blood and gore. It's not the naked chickens and the jokes of blades. It's the worst night of Laurie Strode's short life. This is the night when his dementia brother returns home to finish what he started 15 years ago. This movie is meant to be frightening and I think it works very well. It's also one of the first slasher films, a horror sub-genre I've always loved. Halloween has a very dark atmosphere, creepy music and talented young actors such as Jamie Lee Curtis in his first role. Do I have to say more? Anyone who has never seen it, horror fan or not, should do their movie themes right now. Highly recommended!
