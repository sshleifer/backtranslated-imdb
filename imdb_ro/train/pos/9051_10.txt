I was looking at this when my wife called to search the other room for my choice of tariff. My comment? "I follow my life!" Even younger, but only five years or less than "Rocket Boys," I remember the absolute urgency Sputnick has met with our education administrators and how the whole issue of the Scientific Fair has gained momentum and took me and others in the competitive whirlwind. My tornado landed in my own State Physics Science Fair until the year 62, although our group was less successful in getting support, for example, the firefighters I approached for guidance and counseling until after a tragic event to allow us to visit the Nike rocket site on the shores of Lake Chicago. This movie brought me back and I bet it brought it back for a bunch of "UberNerds" from the late '50s and early' 60s. We are in a similar period of downloading the scientific brain now and we need this film as a country. See!
