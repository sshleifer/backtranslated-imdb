I liked this movie. It's an inspired movie. It fills you with pride. This movie is worth hiring or worth buying. It should be in everyone's home. The best movie I've seen for a long time. It will make you crazy, because everyone is so bad about Carl Brashear, but he eventually improves. It's a story of romance, drama, action and a lot of funny lines to keep you at your disposal. I like a lot of quotes. I use them all the time. They help me keep the task of what I want to do. It shows that anyone can touch their dreams, all they have to do is work for him. It's a long movie, but every time I watch it, I never see it as long as it is. I'm so involved in this, it's going so fast. I love this movie. I look whenever I can.
