I admit that I am somewhat disturbed by the kind of film of a small child that softens the heart of her reticent guardian. Did I see enough of them? Baby Boom, Kolya, About a boy, especially Martha, and to some extent the whale rider? to expect to get bored of the formula. What paid attention to the King of Masks was the darkness of darkness: the small city of China in the 1930s. The extreme poverty was a norm, and the children of the girl were considered as devoid of value to poor parents that they killed them at birth or gave them to anyone on the black market. When Wang discovers his purchased grandson, whom he calls "Doggie," he is a niece, he initially throws it away, even if he has shown a great promise as heir to the street. Even after he takes it back with patience, he's not too upset when he kidnaps. Then the movie is grandiose, showing the length at which a young, smart girl in the street had to go to survive in that society. The two lead performances are credible and convincing in their social context. In a Western society, at least a clue of resentment at Wang would be expected, because it did not get any more material. Wang has so well accepted the station as an artist celebrated with low social status, yet, I too. While Doggie presents an early and cunning level that might be suspect in a modern, suburban child, it is completely credible in the context of a constant child in the way of survival in a society that treat poor girls as garbage. And after learning that her seven owners have abused her physically and mentally, her firm attachment to Wang is perfectly meaningful. Looking at the life of a small town in a foreign country, the naturalness of the two leading actors, the surprising breath of plotting and, of course, the unimaginable resolution contribute to a very visible film.
