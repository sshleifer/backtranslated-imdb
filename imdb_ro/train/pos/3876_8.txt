The beautiful Danish actress Sonja Richter steals this film from under everyone's nose, with no little girl, taking into account the stunning performances surrounding her. Richter interprets Anna, a business outside the work, independent, to some extent a neurotic actress (and probably suicide) landing a desperate job for an unbeatable father, accompanied by a wheelchair called Walentin (the great actor Danish Frits Helmuth, who died at 77 shortly after the film was made). Walentin refuses to answer anyone - until she confronts Anna, endowed with a capricious and mischievous attitude, bringing the poor devil beaten back from a self-imposed death sentence. Writer / director / actor Eric Clausen made a powerful film about the difficulty of a hard-working businessman (Jorgen, played by Clausen) loves a father who never accepted him. The film is coming to an end, but Clausen has some important things to say about euthanasia, the nature and value of love and care, and how a person, an unacceptable Anna, can change the course of a human life. Highly recommended. Sonja Richter's performance is the only one worth the admission price.
