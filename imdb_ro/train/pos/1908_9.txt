This show is beautifully done. When it first came out, I was just an open-comedy comedy with a few good lines. It seems to express many families really well, with different concepts of both the parent and the child, however, as I said, I never thought about it then a good one night. However, my opinion was shot in the other window when the tragic death of John Ritter's fantastic funny funner died. The program was the foundation and really congratulated the life of the characters in a very sensitive way that touched the heart of all the admiration of John Ritter, a fantastic actor with the talent to do anything. When the show was broadcast after Ritters crossed, I wanted to give my father a hug and let them know how much he wanted me to say. I thought this glow threw the talent of action of the three children, especially that of Bridget's character, who was worried about the last words he said. He reminded me that no matter what horrible things I told my father, I do not understand them and it is very important to know this. Great show
