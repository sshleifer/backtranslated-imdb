My favorite character in the movies, but in almost all, Zorro's character has a piece of cloth as a mask, and if bastards can not tell who is under that cloth then they are tricked. <br /> <br /> <br /> But in Zorro's legend of fighting with Reed Hadley (1939 series) the mask fills his whole face, making him a real mystery about who Zorro is. <br /> <br /> But anyway, Zorro is one of the best characters in the movies and I bring him so far. I think Anthony Hopkins in "The Mask of Zorro" (1998) is a delight. My interest in movies is vast, but I have a real pleasure for the 30s / 40s series. <br /> <br /> Bond2a
