I call this and BABYLON 5 as the best sci-fi television series. Both are in mind because, unlike the STAR TREK series early, there is a constant evolution of plots and characters. If you look at the original STAR TREK and STAR TREK: TNG, there were beautiful shows, but there was no general theme or plot to connect all the episodes. In many ways, you can usually watch shows completely unsuccessful, without hardly understanding what's going on. This was less the case with DEEP SPACE 9 (with its huge battles that took all the final season) and the other TREK shows, because it was more of a bigger story that unified them. This consistency seems to have developed as a concept with BABYLON 5 and has seen this to a greater extent with SG-1. The bottom line is that, in many ways, this series was like a family view or a long novel to take the slow form. Sure, there were a couple of "throwaway" episodes that were not related to the rest, but they were very few and were very fun and were usually funny. And speaking of amusement, I liked that SG-1 kept the mood of mood from time to time and was not so terribly serious. That's how I enjoyed much more than BABYLON 5. Jack O'Neill was an extraordinary character with his sarcasm and Homer Simpson's love - it's really sorry he has slowly disappeared from the series in later seasons. <br /> To really appreciate SG-1, you have to watch it from the beginning and see how complicated the parcels are. This consistency gives the show an exceptional power to stay. And if you do not like SG-1 after giving it a good chance, then sci-fi is probably not the kind for you.
