At this point it seems almost useless to say that Jon Bon Jovi offers a firm, solid and flawless performance like Derek Bliss. His actor capacity was previously determined by his critical appreciation in other films (The Leading Man, No Looking Back). But if anyone asks, yes, Jon Bon Jovi can act. He can behave well and that's what he's expecting. It's easy to separate Derek from the guy who hits the VH-1. Generally, I would not watch a horror movie. I have come to expect to focus more on sensationalist gore than on dialogue and plotting. What thanked me most about this movie was that there really is a viable plot to move along. Gore is not so much to become the focal point of the film and does not have a realistic quality of higher-performing budget movies. So gore fans might be disappointed, but fans of stories will not do that. Unlike an action movie like U-571, where the dialogue takes a place behind the bomb, we have the chance to get to know the "good guys" and actually worry about what's going on with them. Several scenes are left unexplained (such as Derek's hallucinations), but you have the feeling that certain aspects were like setting the foundation for a sequel. Unfortunately, with Hollywood's lack of interest in this film, that continuation will never happen. These few cases are forgiving knowing that Vampires could have been a continuous series. Is this the best movie I've ever seen in my life? Not. Is it a good way to spend about two hours of fun? Yes. He will not let the person who feared horror movies with insomnia and will never let the horror movie lover completely disappointed. If you're somewhere between horror and lover of horror, this movie is for you. It reaches a happy environment, with effects and story balancing each other. <br /> <br />
