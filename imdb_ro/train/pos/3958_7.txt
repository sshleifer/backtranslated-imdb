Moe and Larry are new-born husbands, married to Shemp's sister's sisters. In his music studio, Shemp learns that he will inherit a fortune if he marries someone! <br /> <br /> "Husbands Beware" is a remake of "Groom Brideless" in 1947, considered by many to be one of the best Stooge films with Shemp. The remake contains most of the material in the movie. New scenes, shot on May 17, 1955, include the story of Moe and Larry who marries Shemp's sisters, along with their turkey sweet turkey cooking! Some new scenes are attached at the end of the movie (a double for Dee Green was used, if you blink, you will lose the look of the double.) "Sustained Wives" would have done for a good movie, with only the plot line that marries sisters. Budget considerations, along with fewer reservations for two-reel comedies, have influenced the decision to use older images. Although Stooges still made completely new movies, most of their 1955-56 shows were made up of older movies, with some new casts cast. "Spouses are guarding", while one of these hybrids is visible and fun; we see again most of Groom Brideless, and the new scenes are fun enough to attract the viewer through the movie. This movie is one of Stooge's latest comedies to make a new recording of Shemp and was released six weeks after his death. 7 out of 10.
