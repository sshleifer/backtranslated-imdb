Henry Fool is a better movie. But this is the perfect way to watch a movie like "Henry Fool". Take Henry very seriously, his "lies" and his mysterious aura. Even Henry Fool's opening kick, when Simon puts his ear to the ground, as Henry comes to the hill, is more evident through "Fay Grim." Superstitions that are more or less meta-jokes (about movie writing and jokes) are good, but the opening of the film is a little saturated in them. Also, Hartley's use of Dutch angles throughout the film is jarging, yes, it's the intention, but it feels forced and over-used, it goes beyond what I mean, annoying. It's a bad movie, but you have to see it on any Hartley fan or Henry Fool. <br /> <br /> And do not listen to stupid reviews, do not look at it unless you saw the first movie. The intrigue, satire and spirit of this movie are totally missed unless you've seen Henry Fool. It's a sequel. That's just stupid.
