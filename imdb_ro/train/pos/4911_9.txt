This movie has become, for the last ten years, one of my favorite pseudo noir experiences. The three story lines given by Kazan each have their unique and separate pleasures. The internal chitchat between Bel Geddes and Widmark, the movement between the chambers, the small gestures, such as the phone book that Barbara places under her son so that she gets to the table, those little intimate exchanges between husband and wife, all being well-worked and natural. More than anything else, I love the porch, the second salon where it is clear that they spend most of their summer time. The second thread is the professional relationship between many in the film, but especially among the characters of Widmark and Douglas. It may not be totally original and become a bit blustery, but overall, it happens as real, respectful and effective. The third thread, the fatty story of Blackie and the little band, helps us get closer to a world of dark and frightening noir. Palance's Blackie is as cold as an ice block. This self-proclaimed businessman, the man you have made yourself, has a complexity we can only do. For me, this film continues to be a completely satisfying experience.
