I have to admit that Tsui Hark is one of a kind, you can not top a person with a strong style of presence. A fantastic Chinese image may not be easy to present to an audience, the director has tried to bring back the classic fantasy story of Mount Zu and that's what he showed. Zu's New Legend has truly improved since 1983. From this new millennium update, I was able to see Tsui Hark's vision of the Zu Mountains. Spectacular visual designs, stunning action-fantasy epic made beautiful well. Keep me stuck in all the picture. Excellent distribution with great action. Is it really a fun movie to watch, but is it too weird? Now the bottom is that people will certainly be confused with the short story line shortened in a 95-minute movie. Plot may not have too many relationships between characters, but by resuming the film, you will have a better sense of understanding the characters themselves. Some may complain that there is not much physical fighting, in addition to characters who have supernatural powers to defeat enemies, hand-spirits should not make any sense. <br /> <br /> I appreciated this beautiful elegant image. Maybe he has a slim story, but look at Tsui Hark's "Time & Tide", we were also confused with the plot, but it was really something elegant and wonderful. Tsui Hark always attracts something different in H.K. Cinema. American audiences may have difficulty understanding while watching this movie because there is no creeping tiger, hidden dragon, this is a whole new genre. Although it can not be a masterpiece, its special effects are really better than the Storm Riders. This is worth checking out.
