I was up late flipping the cable channels one night and ran into this movie about 10 minutes from the beginning - every time I even thought to go to bed, something continued to tell me to continue to say, I was watching it, even though it was way on my way before bedtime. This movie could have been another easy-to-prevent movie, but instead chose to look at the side effects of the shooters. And even better, the movie continued with real life - only when you think they will take the easy and obviously evoked path, a turn will appear and change the whole vision of the movie. This film not only does not follow the formula but shows how other events often lead to and / or affect what happens later. I just want the directors to have explored more antidepressant drug problems - the Columnbine children who shot the shots have been on them for years, and it was terrible to watch Deanna put them every time the nightmares they started. Until recently, things have been released like candy, and they are just beginning to understand what long-term effects the drugs have. It was very refreshing to see that the appearance of the psychic illness of the story was given little by the film, having a relative suffering from a mental illness, can say that the film was impatient in every aspect of mental illness. Bravo to the director and writer who obviously have done their homework on these issues. And for those who think things could not happen in a hospital (I do not want to say details), you're wrong, and in that - I was there. The script was so real that it was amazing. Go BUY this movie and show it to your teenage children before it's too late. One day I thank you for that.
