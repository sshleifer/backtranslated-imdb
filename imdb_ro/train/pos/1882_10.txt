<br /> <br /> What can I say? This is one of the most perfect movies ever made. It's a throwback back to the romantic, glitzy 1940s comedy but with a modern touch. The scenario erupts with intelligence, charm, humor and sensitivity, the cinema is breathtaking (NYC has never been so beautiful) and of course there is no directing! Dudley Moore turns into the performance of his Loveful career, beaten by Arthur Bach. He is also dizzying and real. One of the best lines of the film is his poet: "Not all who drink is a poet ... some of us drink because we are not poets." The great Sir John Gielgud won an Oscar much deserved for his splendid interpretation as Hobson, the valet and caretaker of Arthur. Though he thought he "takes the money and run", he brings the character all the talent, the experience and the bravery of a tragic expert and a cunning comic. Support support is also outside this world, from Brad's grandmother, Geraldine Fitzgerald, to the bombing of Stephen Elliott's mafia. The score is also extremely memorable and perfectly compliments the movie. The only real problem with the movie is continued to happen in a bad way.
