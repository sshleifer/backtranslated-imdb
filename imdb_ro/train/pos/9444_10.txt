*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Packed with memorable moments (such as the above quote, immortalized by Primus), Deliverance tells the story of four guys who make a trip to wild forests to go rafting with white water and out of the big city for a while, only to find that their fun will have a bad turn. This is not a Hollywood movie. There are virtually no special effects, setting is extremely realistic and nothing is covered with sugar or made beautiful. The boys of the city look like boys from the city, and even the hard guy, Louis, precisely presented by Burt Reynolds, is clearly at the mercy of the wilderness of this journey. This is a perfect example of a movie that would be. What if some friends took the shelf in a forest area that none of them knew and desperately tried to avoid being tried and convicted for murder that they had to commit themselves to saving their own lives? > <br /> There is clearly a very strong element of the film that deals with the structure of society and the class and the relationship (or lack thereof) between rural and urban peoples. When the four guys arrive in the woods at the beginning of the movie, they obviously do not know how to interact with people who live there and speak to them as if they are sure they will understand or will be able to communicate. This block of communication is most memorably illustrated in the dueling banjoes scene, in which they try to guide the car and the truck and make someone drive the vehicles down for them. While Drew and the boy, obviously rooted, and probably the man with a mental disability on the veranda, are fighting guitar and banjo (one of the best scenes in the film), Louis has difficulty buying the gas, and Bobby does a commentary on genetic defects and how pathetic everything is. When the boy returns from Drew, who had offered to shake his hand after their amazing jam session, Bobby tells him to give his baby a few dollars, knowing that none of them is sure how to react. /> This is a kind of thing that we see in Deliverance that creates so much tension to follow. This extraordinary scene where a lot of fun has taken place (including the funniest "red dance scene" up to brother O, where are you?) It ended up with all those who do not know for sure what to do with each other. These people are apples and oranges and live by completely different rules of life. The people that Louis, Bobby, Drew, and Ed meet in the hills have grown separately from modern society and modern laws and live under the rules of nature that do not include or kill. Confused by their strange behavior, the four friends started off on the river, hoping to end the weirdness and start the adventure. (Spoilers) When they are separated briefly from one another and Ed and Bobby sneak into the hillsides near the river, which become quickly unpleasant, the uncertainty about how these people live - which has been established by the scene above - comes into play to create the greatest tension during the scene. I think a good sign of such a quality thriller is that the tragic element of the movie, namely real attacks and crimes, takes a very short time, but remains some of the most memorable parts of the film. There is no free violence here, it is all there for an obvious purpose and achieves a surprisingly powerful effect. The move is about the violent clash of two very different types of people and what can happen when they accidentally find themselves in war with each other. Traveling down the rest of the river after the assault, which occupies most of the movie, offers a spectacular tension and keeps you on the edge of the chair without bombarding you so much that you become numb. It is surprisingly efficient when we find out that Ed may well have killed the bad guy down there, and the tension in the film is not even left when the three surviving members of the team reach the bottom of the river because it gives a questionable explanation to the police about what what happened there on the river and the reason why his brother-in-law is missing. This is a very disturbing film, her success, because it is quite obvious that a movie like this is meant to shake people a little. Hillbillies are the human (ie, more realistic) version of sub-human rednecks seen in childhood movies, but quite similar to Gator Bait and Gator Bait 2, none of them can ever be compared to a long-lasting film, as would be Deliverance. When we follow these four men through their festive weekend in the forest, the natural element is so real, and we know so well men in such a subtle manner that it is almost as if we, as individuals of the public, really are Fifth member of the team. It's not often that a movie can come that way.
