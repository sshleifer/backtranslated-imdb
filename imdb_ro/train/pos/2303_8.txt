MAN'S MOON is a hot and moving drama centered around a family of farmers in the 1950s. The main story follows a 14-year-old girl (Reese Witherspoon), who develops a passion for a 17-year-old neighbor (Jason London) that ends in the fall for her big sister (Emily Warfield) and how an unexpected tragedy changes the dynamics of this families forever. The 1950's are evoked here with love, and the script gives you characters you've been interested almost immediately. Witherspoon is already starting to show his Academy Award winning talent that he will develop in this early role, and London makes him a charming man. Warfield offers a quiet maturity to the role of the older sister, which is also effective. Kudos to Sam Waterston and Tess Harper playing girls' parents and Gail Strickland, who plays Mom's London. I was unexpectedly moved by this tranquil drama that affects the powerful emotions and gives a deeper meaning to the expression "family ties".
