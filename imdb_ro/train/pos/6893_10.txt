Gerard Phillipe is absolutely perfect in this film, funny, trendy, courageous and beloved. It offers a superior dimension to a movie that is even a masterpiece, just like the other actors (Gina Lollobrigida: miaoooou !!) rhythm. I'm not bored, I always create new emotions: for me, the best French film of all time.
