I can not believe I've been waiting so long to see this movie. I've never come to look at her. Complot has nothing to interest me. I do not know anything about football (football.) I'm one of those American madmen who have no idea. I have not even seen David Beckham before this movie. I chose to ignore the noise that surrounded this movie when it was released in America. Pretty about me. <br /> <br /> The truth has been said, it was a mistake to ignore this small piece of film sky. What a fun movie. It is full of color and exuberance. I had a huge smile on my face in the whole movie. Nagra parminder is so sweet and full of love, you can only help rooting for her. No wonder why the US television show E.R. he caught it. I have a new appreciation for Indian culture. These people know to have a good time. Wedding scenes are beautiful. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had was to decipher part of the British slang and dialogue through accents. I've enabled English subtitles to make sure I did not miss anything. (This is not a criticism of the movie!) I am sure audiences around the world are having trouble understanding the changing slang and American films. <br /> <br /> This is a perfect date film. She has a great sport plot like Rocky, and a strong sense of feminism that is empowering women. I watched her with my wife and my granddaughter for sixteen years, and I loved it all. I strongly recommend it.
