When I heard that "Hammerhead" was released on DVD and eventually found it at the local DVD store, I thought "well, just another cheap monster movie from Nu Image". These guys around Boaz Davidson and Avi Lerner have produced Bhots - cheap, but very interesting in recent months, but also some very disappointing films. So I did not expect too much, especially after I saw the disappointing "Shark Area" just a few days before. But "Hammerhead" turned out to be an excellent revival of monster films in the 1950s. We have a crazy scientist, a group of people in a dangerous situation, screaming women and women in distress, plants that eat human beings and of course we have the creature, a huge combination of mutants between a man and a hammer shark. All you need for a wonderful entertainment movie. The only thing missing is the graphic sexual scenes and nudity you expect in such films, but since the movie was made for television, it is understandable why these scenes are missing. And it does not matter anyway the cause of "Hammerhead" is action and horror entertainment at its best. There are two reasons why I gave him seven out of ten points, though: First of all, the monster is not seen very often and confrontation with destroying the creature is too quick and badly done, and secondly, William Forsythe is not the right guy for the "hero" part, and because he falls in love with the superb Hunter Tylo. Besides, I can recommend this movie to any monster movie fan out there. Take some refreshments and some popcorn, watch this movie and have fun. Jasper P. Morgan
