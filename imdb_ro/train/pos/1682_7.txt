After dressing his legs in the giallo pool with "The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh" (1971), director Sergio Martino followed in the same year with what turns out to be another suspense thriller, "The Case of the Scorpion's Tail. " Like his previous effort, he sees George Hilton, who could play Martino's Satanic / giallo hybrid "All the Darkness of Darkness" the following year. Scorpio's Tail also presents actors Luigi Pistilli and Anita Strindberg, who want to present an unhappy couple (let's say gently) in "Your Witness is a Closed Chamber and I Have Only the Key" (1972). (I just like that title!) I suppose Edwige Fenech was busy with the month he shot that! However, this film boasts the elegant direction Martino's fans have been waiting for, as well as an overturned plot, some finely murdered pieces of crime, and beautiful Athenian photography. The story this time relates to an insurance investigator (Hilton) and a journalist (Strindberg, who looks like Farrah Fawcett's more beautiful and intelligent sister), who enriched herself in a series of wrongful murders as a result of a plane crash and a million dollars inheritance from a beautiful widow. I really thought we had this picture halfway, but I was wrong wrong. Although the plot has a perfect sense in this giallo, maybe I have to watch the film to fully appreciate all the subtleties. The landmarks of the image, for me, were Anita's fight with the cat and the mouse with the killer at the end, a break of the house with a special suspense, and a good fight on a roof of the tile; a lot of good action explosions in this movie! Exceptional people from No Shame need to thank them for another wonderful DVD with beautiful and extra exciting subtitles. Wotta is an excellent story, turned out to be, in continual quest to bring these lost Italian stones out of oblivion.
