This show is so incredibly funny that I could not stop watching the comedy marathon tonight (despite seeing all the previous episodes). I have always considered Silverman as a huge talent and, ultimately, it is a vehicle for that talent to enjoy a wide audience. I'm looking at this show and I laugh a very high percentage of time ... I can not say that about many TV shows ... is not it? This show is finally something new and exciting and (most important) funny! This is a show I will not miss and it is one that I will buy on DVD as soon as it goes out. You owe me for you to look at this show ... I have been predicting a long time for this series ... And just to be clear, people who are offended by this show just do not understand it ... maybe they lack the intelligence to understand ... they should no longer be crazy about themselves by attacking something they do not understand. Anyone who uses the word "bigot" as far as Silverman is concerned or who claims to have only the intention of "shock" ... is far from the mark ... It is exactly the opposite; just Google and you will quickly see that she is a huge supporter of civil rights etc. If you do not know that they ironically embrace all these scandalous views, you do not understand. And if you do not understand, make others a favor and calm you, so we can all enjoy the hilarious ...
