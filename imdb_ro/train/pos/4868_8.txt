I gave this movie 8 out of 10, reserving 10, for example, Amadeus, and 9 for the Slumdog Millionaire, most recently. This film is close to the Slumdog, but it is difficult to judge such a film without understanding the life, mentality and Balkan soul that Kusturica presents in a great way. To understand this you have to be one of the Balkans. This is an amazing, much better and more contemporary film with his previous films, which are boring at the moment, I think Kusturica is advancing with this movie. I like humor (Balkan humor), photography is an art in itself, every scene is artistic at the limit. The plot is probably a fairy tale, do not remember it now, but remember that you read my daughter to go to sleep a similar story.
