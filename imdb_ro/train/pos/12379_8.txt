I was a ushertte in an old theater in North California when this movie came out. As good as DVD, it's even more dizzying and terrifying on the big screen. Although it's been around 9 years since I saw it, it's still one of my favorites all the time. At the risk of sounding tricks, "I do not do it anymore!" If Sixth Sense scared you, this movie is for sure! Great story, incredible cast of characters, threatening setting; even the soundtrack has a haunting quality. I recommend you do not look for yourself. What you rented a brownstone apartment only in 1977 will make you breathe (it would be at least 10 times the price today).
