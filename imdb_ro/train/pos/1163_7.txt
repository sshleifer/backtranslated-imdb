This movie was released by Roger Corman, so you know that movie makers did not have much money to work with. Although, some viewers may be deprived of the subtleties of this film because of the "ordinary" killer, "there are unique differences about this film." AMANDA, as interpreted by talented talented Justine Priestley, is a complex character. I like these movies precisely because violence may seem casual, but here the ramifications of past abuse (treated in a realistic but tasty manner) form the AMANDA psychosis. Surprisingly, Amanda redeems at the end with an act of love in which most of these the movies turn into typical battles, all out to death, and the evil character dies equally badly to start. <br /> Some rough edges in this picture, but I have to give him 7 out of 10 stars on the basis of his attention and yes, originality compared to the usual ones - especially on a budget.
