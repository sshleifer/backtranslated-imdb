It's a fairly simple, but not very active, but very charming movie. There were a few moments when I can see why Cher won the Oscar for best actress, but there were other moments when I wondered why Glenn Close did not win for the Fatal Attraction. However, Oscar and the Golden Globe win, and nominated for BAFTA, Cher plays Loretta Castorini, a simple, low-wage woman who has just been asked by Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello) to marry him. He promises to come back in a month because his mother is sick, so he means that he has to get as much of his family as possible to attend the wedding. The only problem is that when he finds Johnny's brother, Ronny (Golden Globe called Nicolas Cage) begins to have a relationship, and love continues on that scene of the moon (where the title comes from). Oscar also nominated Vincent Gardenia as Cosmo Castorini, Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe, winning Olympia Dukakis as Rose Castorini and John Mahoney as Perry. It ends without a wedding for Johnny and Loretta, but she and Ronny were happy together. He won Oscars Best Screenplay, Screenwriting Screenplay and was nominated for Best Director for Norman Jewison and for Best Picture, was nominated for BAFTA Best Dick for Best and Best The original script, and was nominated Golden Globes for Best Film - Comedy / Music and Best Screenplay. It was the number 96 on 100 years, 100 quotes ("Snap out of it!"), It was number 17 on 100 years, 100 passions, and was the number 41 per 100 years, 100 laughs. Very good!
