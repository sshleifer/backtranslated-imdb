This movie is a half documentary ... and it's quite interesting .... This is a good movie ... based on the true story of how a bunch of Norwegian saboteurs have managed to stop heavy water production in Rukjan, Norway and releasing the rest of heavy water in Germany. This movie is not perfect and could have been a bit better ... the best part of the movie is that some of the sabots are played by themselves! If you are interested in the history of the Second World War and this movie is a movie worth a look!
