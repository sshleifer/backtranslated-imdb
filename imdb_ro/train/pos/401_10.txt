I just came back from Hong Kong on my summer vacation and I saw Legend ZU. I thought he kicked! It was so creative and unique. It is the dragon hidden by the tiger crouching with much less drama. Even if some thought there was too much special FX (yes, well!), You can not complain about the distribution. Zhang Ziyi and Cecilia Cheung are so good! Legend ZU ..... hits a * s !!!!!!!!
