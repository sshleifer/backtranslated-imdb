"Heartland" is a wonderful description of what it really was like to live at the border. The hard work and the individual force that were necessary to survive the hardships of the climate and the lack of medical care are mixed with the collateral and the interdependence of colonists. Drama was of great significance because the story is based on the logs of real people whose descendants still live there. It was also nice to see the West inhabited by real people. No one was full of charm and did not seem to have spent a session with the make-up or costume department. Conchatta Ferrell is just great. She is an example of the powerful and persevering people who came to Wyoming at the beginning of the twentieth century and left no difficulty standing in the path of a new life in a new earth.
