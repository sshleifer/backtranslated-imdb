I was lucky enough to see this movie many years ago in England. I've seen hundreds of movies since, but I've never forgotten this movie. Although Sinatra played a great character, he was excellent in acting. A lot of people seem to think it did not really go down to the role of "From here to eternity", but in my opinion it was magnificent in Concho. The other role I have in mind is that of William Conrad. I have never seen or heard it before this movie. Conrad plays a great role in this movie. I remember his deep and stony voice and he uses it nicely to raise a few words that he speaks with a threat that determines the tone of the character. I also remember the music that introduces both Conrad and seems to surround him whenever he appears. An excellent movie and my only disappointment was that I had never had the chance to see it again. It seems to have disappeared from the face of the earth. I see in the title that he says the movie is black and white, but when I saw it really colored, I remember Sinatra's blue shirt.
