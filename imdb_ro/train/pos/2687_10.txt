No other film made me feel like this before ... and I do not feel bad. For example, I do not want the money back or the time I waited to watch this movie (9 months) nor do I feel sorry to use two sunny summer hours to see this ______. The reason I say "_____" is because, no matter how hard they give me the brain, they just do not seem to come up with a word in any of the seven languages ​​in which the film was to sum up. I have no idea what's going on all the way through the middle of the movie, I needed a breath. No movie has ever done this to me. Never in my life did I want to be cauliflower, milk and baguette so much. Thank you. - Ed. <br /> <br /> Uh. * cleans your throat * without words. There are no thoughts. I do not know.
