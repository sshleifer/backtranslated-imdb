Unlike the abstracts of some people, the women described in the film are not geisha. They are prostitutes living outside the most famous districts of leisure, and their lives and experiences are the lives of a large number of women in the Tokugawa era. I can not say that the stories were particularly luminous, but their charm is the way they are typical. The themes are universal and everyday: love, friendship and sacrifice. I really enjoyed the direction of art and acting. I felt like I wanted to see a time and a place to never see. The actors, especially the four women who played the main role, were an emotion to look at. I would recommend this film to those who want a taste of Japanese culture or those who enjoy quiet and emotional stories. It is a good example for both.
