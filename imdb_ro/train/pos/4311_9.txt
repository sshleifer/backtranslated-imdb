This is less about the character of Steve Martin Davis than Kline (Mack) and Glover (Simon), and Kline and McDonnell (Claire), but the dialogue introduced through Davis is contemplative, contemplative, almost poetic to the most good . He is intelligent, intelligent and caring about both the distribution and content of the dialogue. Writers deserve an Oscar. The performances are light, relaxing and natural; exactly what you would expect from "A List" actors. Martin contributes to the performance that leads to her more recent Shopgirl, guiding your life, love and searching for wisdom, if not happiness. Kline is right - the costume - the film's conformist, and as such his performance is clear and refreshing. This work deals with life in all its aspects. It generates a real emotional investment in its characters and lets you think that Mankind is not doomed, after all, no matter what you think, deep down. Everything? This is delightful, with a moment or two stones, and a natural natural dialogue that draws you, helping the audience gain great joy in this work. Surely it is worth the time, although it can not be the top choice of everyone as a holiday Friday / Saturday night. I really enjoyed the intelligence that this is exposed to. It is not typical and was an unexpected surprise. Another wonderful surprise was the sincerity presented here. Couples and friends hold detailed conversations that feel and sound fully honest and (again) natural. I was very impressed with this work and will soon add it to my DVD collection. It misses 9.1 / 10 from ... Fiend :.
