This movie has some things that go for it. It's a "feel good" story. Characters and actors are pleasant, realistic and current performances. Most importantly, I think, Dennis Quaid knows how to catch and throw a baseball. Robert Redford looked good to throw and hit a bat in "The Natural," just like Kevin Costner in "For Love of the Game" and "Bull Durham." In the Major League, Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen looked as if they knew they did, but many of the others did not, and that position was a bad purity - and not too funny. So many baseball movies earlier, even where the stories might be interesting, showed such a lack in Stratton Story and Command Strategic Air, Jimmy Stewart showed as credible as a professional player (Gary Cooper as Lou Gehrig, Robald Reagan as Grover Cleveland Alexander and Dan Dailey as Dizzy Dean) also showed a baseball ability that would put them in the late rounds while " pick-up "for a game at the Sunday picnic (even if it coed, even if your uncle was involved). The scenes of Quaid's high school team, which he coached, the ones he participates in trying with the Devils' Rays, and those with him who play in two minor leagues and in the American League , all the sounds are true. Participants are credible and capable. In addition, he is an interesting actor, who always offers a talented and appropriate characterization (except, to a certain extent, some of the "top-top" scenes, and his forced focus in portraying Jerry Lee Lewis). But he is definitely targeted here, and this movie is a "9" as good or better as any of its kind except "The Natural".
