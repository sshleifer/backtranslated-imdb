The penultimate collaboration between director Anthony Mann and star James Stewart (excluding a few days when Mann worked on the Night Passage before breaking away with the star company under less friendly circumstances), The Far Country contradicts the mainstream aspect of providing a another portrait of a man fretted at his redemption, struggling with every step. This time, he is a cattle driver, whose reaction to labor problems - causing a head start to a blow at the end of the trail - leads to the cattle being seized by John McIntire's junk judge at law school and order Roy Bean. By making them back and taking them across the Canadian border, he is soon involuntarily in the growing conflict between prospectors and judge as he deceives them or kills them from their statements ... <br / While it's not a big surprise how Stewart returns to the end, it's a surprisingly expensive bracelet along the way, even using the desire to be left alone to excuse not to warn a group of prospectors of an imminent avalanche when he has a chance, because it's not his problem. For most of the film, there is only a hairline between him and McIntire, which the judge instantly recognizes, discovering in the spirit of a related spirit, even if he deliberately intends to flatter him. In many ways, the townspeople who have put their faith in it probably recognize it too - despite appeals to their dead and buried nature, there is unprecedented recognition that the only person who can rise to the judge is someone almost as good he is evil. As usual, with Mann there is an exceptional use of high country locations, although for once the final showdown takes place on a flat plane and the film is almost perfectly expressed, with strong support from Walter Brennan, Harry Morgan and Ruth Roman (though Corinne Calvert's young romantic interest sees him irritatingly). Unfortunately, the Canadian Rockies' big cinemas have made a few favors with a distinct DVD transfer, with just one extra theater trailer.
