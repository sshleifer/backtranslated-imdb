In 1990, Brad Pitt and Juiliette Lewis made a film too young to die, where both played almost the same parts they did in California. I have no doubt that this led to their casting into this big screen movie. California finds aspiring writer David Duchovny and his friend, art photographer Michelle Forbes in a rocky relationship of sorts due to Duchovny's obsession with writing a book and getting into the minds and souls of serial killers. In fact, he has an unusual planet of thought, he wants to go to the streets and visit the sites of several serial killers. But he and Forbes broke flat. Fate comes in more ways than financial, with the arrival of Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis, a pair of strange types of souls who agree to split the cost of gas in this cross country trip. It turns out that Pitt himself is a serial killer and he decides to do a little research on his own, confronting one's fascination with amorality. California is not the type of movie they usually use, but in fact Brad Pitt's acting ability and charisma make her work to a great extent. Pitt is the walking definition of a Gothic embedded refugee from Deliverance. But better than he is Juliette Lewis who again plays these types of low self-esteem that she seems to do well. Watch her scene with Forbes when she gets her hair and Lewis describes her sad and pathetic life. Lewis's dialogue and Forbes's reactions should be featured in acting classes across the country. For those who like their weak moves, they do not come better than California.
