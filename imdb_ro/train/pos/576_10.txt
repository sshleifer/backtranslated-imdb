this movie was just brilliant, cast, landscape location, story, direction, everyone really preferred the role they played and you could imagine you were there, Robert Redford's is an amazing actor and now the same director, Norman's father came from the same Scottish Island as I did, so I loved the fact that there was a real connection with this movie, the remarks full of spell throughout the movie were wonderful, it was just brilliant, so much so I bought the movie as soon as it was released for retail and I recommend it to everyone to look and the fishing was amazing, really cried at the end it was so sad and you know what they say if you cry to a movie must have been well and that certainly was also congratulations to the two boys who played Norman and Paul's role were just brilliant, the children are often left out of the list of praise, I think because the stars that they they all have such a big profile for the entire movie, these kids are amazing and should be praised for what they did, do not you think? the whole story was so wonderful because it was true and it was someone's life after being shared with us all.
