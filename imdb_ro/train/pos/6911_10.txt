While Kiss of the Spider Woman banished Raul Julia as a political prisoner in an unidentified country in Latin America, this time he works for a dictator in a fictional country in Latin America. More precisely, the dictator suddenly falls dead, so Julia replaces him with a Broadway actor (Richard Dreyfuss) who is filming a movie in the country. From there, Dreyfuss must figure out how to be a dictator, balancing him all the time with his own life. Is it appropriate to turn the tense situation in Latin America into comedy? Well, "Moon Over Parador" does a good job with that. No matter what I do in this movie, I shoot it. It seems Richard Dreyfuss is one of the greatest actors of our era and what we lost when Raul Julia died. It is definitely worth seeing. Also, with Sonia Braga (who played with Raul Julia in "TKOTSW"), Jonathan Winters and Sammy Davis Jr. <br /> <br /> I agree: the first lady is hot.
