Glacier Fox is one of the most harmless and awesome photographed wildlife ever made. The film worries every member of this fox family, from the blind to the most powerful - sometimes their hilarious and tragic adventures. Placed in an innocent rural country, the hearts of the public are warm for family members. Music score and lyrics tell the story interspersed with stories about what happens in general terms. Man remains one of the greatest predators, but we have no doubt that foxes are capable of living, not just surviving beyond human efforts.
