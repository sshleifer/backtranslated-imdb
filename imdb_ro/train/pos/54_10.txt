Home Room is dealing with Columbine-like high school shooting, but rather than hashing on the event itself, the film describes the consequences and what happened to survivors, trauma, blame and denial. * Spoilers * Filming itself is treated as a foregone conclusion, with no other action than the reaction of an almost SWAT teenage comedian after shooting the high school killer. The film has three protagonists; the detective investigating the offense that leaves no guilty and two teenage girls surviving the incident played by a very young Erika Christensen and Busy Philipps. The two girls who have nothing in common except shooting are together because of it and drama. Erika Christensen, although only 24 were around the block so much that movie viewers are pretty much familiar with its solid and reliable style of action. Busy Philipps, three years older than Christensen and totally unknown to me, broke out with her dramatic power and the presence of the screen. This girl was the part. It's a great movie and connects to you with its intimate focus on the fragile but growing relationship between the two traumatized girls. Elephant Gus van Sant (2003), though good, seems almost superficial and pale, compared to Home Room when it comes to a drama and an actor. What I can see this movie had very little screen time and exposure - so much a loss for an equally traumatized America. Ten out of ten
