"La Bête" by Walerian Borowczyk is based on the short story "Lokis" written by Prosper Merimée. Lucy Broadhurst (Lisabeth Hummel), an American heiress engaged with the son of a poor marquis, arrives at the ruined family castle and learns about the meticulous daughter of the bear pretended to trample in the nearby forest. It is a story that a former lady of the house (Sirpa Lane) once engaged in a perverse sex with the creature and Lucy finds himself consumed by the dreams of the incident. "Beast" is a combination of art-surface, an explicit pussy and a porn. It involves bestiality, assault and perversion in the priesthood, false ejaculate chest, masturbation with a rose and, most graphically, a fabulous epic that sings with incredibly great foul play. However, this truly erotic film is photographed wonderfully and tasteless. The women here are amazingly beautiful and they are naked most of the time. In general, "La Bête" is a visual feast. attention to detail or information-inspired motifs, Borowczyk's masterpiece should be viewed with care and attention. You have to see the fans of the European cinema cinema.
