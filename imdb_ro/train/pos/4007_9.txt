A fierce, shocking, intelligent work from talented British writer Hanif Kureishi, who wrote "My Beautiful Laundrette" (this is the best thing he has ever done). These are intelligent people whose lives do not add too much. They have scattered what they have been given and are largely empty ships. The only living character on the screen that is alive is the mother of the title, but she feels dead inside until a brutal artisan shows a certain affection and awakens her to the joy of sex. He has his own reasons, but Kureishi treats them with good compassion. This is a movie where people and places feel familiar, where the characters are beyond the screen boundaries. In some ways, it's kind of like "Sunday, Saturday, Sunday," but it's a whole lot more difficult. The director, Roger Michell, allows scenes to be built instinctively. And it is beautifully acted. As Anonymous mother Anne Reid betrays her lost life in every gesture. There is no false mark in her extraordinary performance, and that actor very attentive, Daniel Craig, showed shadows to his character, even though Kureishi did not come in. If the film hits a false note, it is likely in the character of the daughter's talent, caught in a dirty adventure with the man her mother seduces (or should be vice versa) and even the marital life, but she is so well played by Cathryn Bradshaw, she's around you. The film is also extremely nice to look at (DoP Alwin Kuchler) and it must be unequivocally positioned as the best British film of the year.
