A powerful pilot, this two-hour episode makes an excellent job of creating the characters and the background for "Enterprise," "prequel" in the original "Star Trek" series. It collides several times in the "Trek" convention, and clich√© - candy space pickers do not seem to go out of style, and they can already refer to T'pol as "Seven in the Vulcan" - but the ensemble looks strong, the characters are well drawn and you can already see indications that the crew will have to be more resourceful in different ways than the ones in the previous series (later?). Scott Bakula strikes the right note as a captain with Kirk's jerk and daring, but without bothering and brave, and I look forward to the way the series will include the engineer, the master of weapons and the communications officer (not just an operator of glorified phone!) as supporters. Writers seem to have taken one big mistake in "Star Trek: The Next Generation", "Deep Space 9" and "Voyager": Instead of starting out with a large distribution and offering short characters, start with a kernel fewer characters to which less variety can be added later - which I hope is happening, because after about half a dozen episodes, more variety will be needed.
