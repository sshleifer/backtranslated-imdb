Well, this was one of those movies I got out of chances and it was good enough for me to record when it came out next time ... If, like me, you're enjoying many horror movies of 80 , from the norm (that is, not just a sliding of the generic sequels), then I think you can enjoy this. When the evil one returns in person, it was certainly not what I expected to see! Overall, I would not get out of your way for that, but if you like the genre, then you'll be careful if it gets up and you have an hour and a half to kill, I guess. I would give 6.5 out of 10.
