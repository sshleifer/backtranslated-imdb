"How to lose friends and make them alien" is a fun adaptation, if free, of Toby Young's memory of the same name. It's also a great title to help fill the line requirement in IMDb reviews! The basic script is the same as the book with some dramatized incidents, but a romantic plot is added, and the end is certainly hollywoodized. Simon Pegg, despite having played an essentially irritating person, is his usual, pleasant and funny self, and he gives quite a lot of the film. Strange to think just a few years ago was just a sitcom TV guy and now rubbing his Hollywood name shoulders. There is a good support distribution and is a funny and easy watch - a sort of "Ugly Betty" male but more fun.
