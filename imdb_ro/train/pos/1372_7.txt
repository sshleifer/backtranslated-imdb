"Party Girl" exploits the extraordinary charm of Parker Posey. In fact, sometimes the film seems to be a vehicle in which Mrs Posey is allowed to play alone, as is normal in real life. The film, directed by Daisy von Scherler Mayer, is a treatment for Ms. Posey's fans. Mrs. Von Scherler Mayer takes us on a wild excursion to the lower Manhattan to show us this target-free soul whose life is dedicated to the fun in the various clubs they are constantly attending. This is an era that was still more naive than what that area became and the adjacent neighborhoods of the meat market. At least, there are no claims in movies and we see on earth people who spend their lives in a normal way if we can call it that. Parker Posey makes an amazing Mary. Because of Parker Posey we enjoy more of the movie than if another actress played Mary. She is the whole picture. The rest of the camp is good.
