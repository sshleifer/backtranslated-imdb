I suppose you've never heard of "Topper". <br /> <br /> Which, besides the two stars that could only be seen by a band member, had a dog like that. <br /> <br /> This was the kind of "No Gonna Make It" program that was also written from the first episode - it was like an arcade video game where you have to read the instructions to play; no one (well, very few of us, apparently) wants to watch a comedy program that has a basic premise that actually requires * thinking * to understand.
