Saying a movie is depressing is not necessarily a bad thing. I am very willing to look at a depressing film if there is a point and it certainly has one. It is the often unimaginable story of a Chinese man and his family, because they live for many years both in weight and in full. But I have to warn you that this could only be the most depressing film that came out of Hollywood in the 1930s - because the peasant life in China was TOUGH to say the least. Be prepared to look at segments of famine, death and disease. The only negative, other than the persistent tone of misery, is that the leadership is played by Paul Muni. While he was an exceptionally talented man, it is just a shame that Hollywood has always cast European descendants to play Asian schools in this era. If you are careful at all, it is quite obvious that Muni is wrong for the part.
