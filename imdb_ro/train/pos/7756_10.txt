I'm not sure if it's a masterpiece or a blood-filled drop, exalted by performance and visual effects. Regardless of the case, I'm sure I liked it. From a wonderfully twisted, frightening story that intertwines to the delicious and sinister performances of Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone, in the colorful and colorful color they capture, this is a great class garbage and is very entertaining. Not to mention the funny, thin and subtle sexual subtleties that penetrate the entire film, always threatening to escape the picture in dialogue, but never to do so. I would have lied if I said that the entertainment value of the film did not contribute to my love for that, but behind the unintentional comedy (or was it?) There is some kind of bizarre art and I really dug this up. I could really get into this thing with the melodrama.
