I liked this movie, maybe because I did not see any reviews, etc. It was delightful and it was a bit of "romp". I do not know why he did not do more than a splash than he did. As for the story, I might refer to some aspects of the character Paul Reiser and I could "see my father" in the character of Falk. It made me remember a lot of past times when I was a kid and listening to my grandparents. If you enjoyed movies like Grumpy Old Men or Golden Pound, this is your movie. A "bedroom", in my opinion, and one of those good stories. Peter Falk and Paul Reiser had many wonderful verbal attempts, but nothing was overcome. I'd say it's at least 8 times bigger.
