I was a young student in 1979 when the Union of Soviet Filmmakers came to Sofia, Bulgaria and premiered "Siberiade" by Konchalovski; Tarkoski "Stalker" and Danelia'a "Autumn Marathon". I was amazed at the cosmopolitan dimension of the art form. Then and only then, I saw "Siberiade" 4 and 1/2 hours epic and was speechless. Better than Bertolucci's "1900". Far! We hope that Andron will somehow get to the negative and will make "the director have restored the full version version" someday! On DVD, of course! I also fought to defend this cinema against most of my colleagues who equaled the Soviet movie with a bad taste! Time is on my side.
