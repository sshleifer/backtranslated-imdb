I saw this kung fu movie when I was a kid and I thought it was so cool! I am 26 years old now and my friend has it on DVD !!! <br /> <br /> We have a cooking case and we have watched this classic! Lost NO from the original cool kung fu! If you are a fan of kung fu / karate movies, you must see ... The DVD is available. I think this movie is also called "Choose Your Poison". Check it out soon!
