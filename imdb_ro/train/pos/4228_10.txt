Columbo from beginning to end. I really like the interaction between Columbo and the killer, Ruth Gordon. Like an avid Columbo fan, I can not remember another in which he did not set up the killer at the end of him as he did in other episodes. In this, while trying to determine the correct sequence of the boxes and the "message" that the nephew left behind, eventually he gives birth. The music of this episode is very good, as is the case in many other.
