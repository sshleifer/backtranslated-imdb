Romantic comedies can really go in some way, you know? You will see one that is very septic and you think you want something more realistic. Then you will see one that is realistic, but it could be too boring to worry. Or maybe you will see one who does everything well but fails to make you smile. Romantic comedies are harsh movies. Get into it with a lot of expectations and usually if you like it's just a matter of whether the filmmakes anticipate your expectations or those of the guy or guy next to you. , if you have a girl next to you and you are a guy like me, probably does not matter much if the movie has any good, you have other things in your mind. For you, I say, "Go, take it, Tiger!" For the rest of us, I say, "See a Guy Thing." It's very funny. Because _A Guy Thing_ knows you're going to this movie with expectations, so do not pretend that "Guy about to marry meets the woman of his dreams, and not his wife!" The plot will make everyone happy. Sure, maybe you like it, but maybe it does not sound right or you think it's cruel. Guy Thing_ covers that. What Guy Thing_ does is fill the screen with the best support distribution I've seen in a long time, so if you do not have the main line, you still have something to make to smile. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If we are talking about big and small screen veterans, such as Larry Miller (Pretty Woman, Best in Show), James Brolin (Traffic), Julie Hagerty (Avion!), David Koechner O'Brien regular Dirty Work, Austin Powers II) or Thomas Lennon (State and Viva Variety), or new faces like Shawn Hatosy (Faculty) or Colin Foo (Saving Silverman), are talking about a bunch of very talented and skilled actors who know exactly how take advantage of the inspirational film characterization, steal the show several times and frame the play with an energy and joy rarely seen in romantic comedies nowadays. <br /> <br /> And that does not mean to distract from the current romantic direction and from the stars that carry it, because it is very sweet and terribly well done. Jason Lee (Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma, etc.) touches as a young professional whose life may be out of control, and Selma Blair shows an undervalued glare in the portrayal of the social aspiring and sophisticated career woman that every guy wants marry for the guy who actually is. Much of the film's success, however, falls on Julia Stiles, the right girl in the right place at the wrong time, and she does her well. Not since, boys, I do not know when, I saw an actress in a romantic comedy that fell in love with her so easily. Of course, it's about the neighbor, the voice and the subtle smiles, but it's magic and it's one of the great reasons why we're going to the movies first. But Julie Stiles would have lost too little sophistication if it were not the rest of the cast that incredibly dead in classical simplicity. This is a movie that paints a broken world of irreconcilable stock types, makes them fall over each other to make you laugh and then make a really big heart. A Guy Thing is a movie you just saw before, and the directors knew clearly when they started to do it. We have not seen new romantic comedies from Shakespeare; the relative success of this or that one is entirely dependent on the execution of the classic boy story encounter girl. A Guy Thing embraces this with a little bit of a metacinematic edge, often taking scenes in absurd, to give the audience the chance to recognize the powerful emotions and anti-plot devices they play. <br /> <br /> For the record, she even manages to have fun with the traditional gender and gender structural notions that form the center of every romantic comedy, so even the feminists there could get a shot of it. <br /> <br /> And boys, I think we all agree that we want our friends to be as cool as Jason Lee's friends in this movie. I will not hurt her for you, but when you try to explain to your friend why the pharmacist and clerk of the clothing store is one of the best boys in cinema, I suggest you just say, "It's a Guy thing" about that.
