This starred Alec Guinness is a very enjoyable political satire of the corporate industry and a study of the eccentric character of the world. Pacing is a bit slow for a comedy and none of them is funny-looking floor, with the exception of likely sound effects for experiments. But it has funny moments and is very funny in its execution. The large explosion segment is probably the most farcical element. The syndicate procedures are quite droll, very reminiscent of being JACK ALL RIGHT; especially the female socialist, with a slight romantic passion on the character of Guinness. Political mechanisms are actually the story. Ernest Thesigner is very notable as a heavy one. I do not think this works just as well as LADYKILLERS, or hearts and CORONETS; but even Ealing light comedy is better than nothing.
