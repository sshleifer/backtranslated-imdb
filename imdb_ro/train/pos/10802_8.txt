I am at the opposite end of the previous comment. First of all, I do not think this was meant to be a direct sequel to "The Jerk." I mean, it's not called "Jerk 2" ... it's "The Jerk, Too", which makes me think that while many character names are the same, it's spinning around a completely different person. /> <br /> Think about it: basically there is nothing to do with the previous movie, except for the character names; a completely different story; diffuse diffusion; and the fact that it is a partial musical. I say I give this film some credit. He has a lot of laughs in him. Mark Blankfield at his tip.
