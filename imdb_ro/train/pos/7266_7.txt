I remember that I had a pretty low opinion about such a business when it was first launched. James "No Jim" Belushi, a male actress and a cheesy title in John Hughes formula. You could not have paid me to see it 15 years ago. But I caught myself looking at myself as I lost an afternoon on Sunday and hit me on several levels. The Pretty Woman part, the extremely vulnerable show, Elizabeth_Perkins_in_Miracle_On_42nd_Street, similar to Kelly Lynch's escapism. Everywhere, shoot some very beautiful rows. It's hard not to get into the story, to develop a passion for Kelly Lynch, to identify with James Belushi, not to like your tough friend and laugh at the Curley Sue lines. It has all the ups and downs, with a happy ending and the type of message you want to hear. Let go, you waste your time on this movie, it's worth it.
