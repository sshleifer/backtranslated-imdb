Just a commentary on the accents in New Orleans ... An earlier commentator noted the following: "This movie could have been shot in New York City or in another large northern city because it features characters that speak more than "broklynnes" than a southern accent he could hear in that part of the country. " There was another comment in this respect from an English commentator. Many people in New Orleans actually make the sound of "broklynese". I did not find out why. (It's mentioned in "A Dock Confederation" by John Kennedy Toole.) I always appreciate the films taking place in New Orleans that include this detail, as it did. Too many times is just the Hollywood version of the standard Southern accent.
