This is the first in the Guinea Pig series and is one of the most fabulous films in the collection. It took me a long time to finally kill myself and get my hands on a copy of this notorious group of films. I bought the Guine Pig Box Set and decided to track the collection in order after the release date. So I pulled this sucker up and sat down. From what I read on the web and realizing the content involved in this movie, I expected to test my nerves with all my strength. This was not the case. The film focuses on a group of men who kidnap a woman and start torturing her with the hope of discovering the point of human rupture and how long a man can tolerate the pain Sounds like a bad blow ? Wrong. The movie fails to shock. This may be due to the fact that I became desensitized over the years, my horror obsession, but I think it's safe to say that any true gorehound could sit easily here. On the other hand, the individual who does not have a good knowledge of this type of film will most likely be overwhelmed and disgusted by the images they see on the screen. Although she did not manage to shock me, the movie contains some pretty scenes full of violence and graphics. Including nail rupture, guts thrown to an unconscious woman and a needle through the eye. Generally, I think for most of the gorehounds on this forum, you have to get a copy of this movie for his novelty, but I suggest that for any newcomer to these types of movies you should move until this.
