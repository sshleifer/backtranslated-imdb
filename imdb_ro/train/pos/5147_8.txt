The first week of May brings the Holocaust memories every year through movies on television. Among the many movies they showed, it was the one I did not see. The story is about Hilter's life and how he came to power. It begins with his childhood and ends with the highest power position in Germany. The movie was presented earlier as a series of television and later converted into a movie format. Austrian actor Robert Carlyle interprets Adolf Hitler with much courage, conviction and appearance to give a real picture of this man. It is a good and narrative scenario that educates the public about the main events that lead Hitler to power, and also tries to show the probability of Hitler's psychological formation. The film is a biased view of director Christian Duguay? which shows Hitler as one way, threatening, angry and shouting? who had so strong the Germans and the people around him. Hitler is not portrayed as someone who has charishma and attraction and there the film fails to convince Hitler's portrait. Even if the adventure was for television, all the ingredients of production are first class and on par with any main film. Production value, sets, costumes, etc. were perfect. There are many critics of this film in the authenticity of the historical events presented. But still the film collapses, each of which is appealing and fun. Robert Carlyle survives and dominates the screen, like no one else does. Is he amazingly good? Brilliant! I would like a more balanced view of Hitler's life because I think Hitler has been able to highlight the latent feelings of millions of Germans and not only should he be accused of the Holocaust. Like I said many times, that? very sad - our society loves to garland or judge a person as a representative of the good or the evil of society.
