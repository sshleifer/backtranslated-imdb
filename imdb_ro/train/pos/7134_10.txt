John Thaw is an excellent actor. I have to admit that I was impressed by his role as an old-timer who freely agrees to take in an evacuation from the streets of London (World War II). However, the film is also excellent. A very moving story with a satisfying ending. Some characters are a little underdeveloped (especially the school teacher), but none of them is essential to the plot. Basically, the story relates to the old man and the boy, and the film needs something else.
