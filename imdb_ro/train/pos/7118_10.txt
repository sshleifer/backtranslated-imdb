This is a great Classic movie from the '40s and well produced. There are very dramatic scenes in this film with John Garfield, Al Dams, Force of Evil, Dane Clark, Lee Diamond, Last Rites, 88, fighting against the Japanese during the Second World War being completely surrounded by a single machine gun. When Al Schmid managed to return home after being injured with a terrible injury, his problems began to start with his family and his boyfriend. Dane Clark played a key role in helping Lee Diamond, who did everything to help Al's girlfriend revive her life. There is never a complete victory of the War, and it does not allow us to forget all the members of the military personnel wounded from the Spells of all our wars and our veterans in Iraq!
