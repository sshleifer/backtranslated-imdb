Deliciously, almost without a plot of mood and if there is more LSD inspired than the devil, then we have to remember when it was done! After a stunning SM opening (which even herself is not what she seems), we are heading towards soft focus and dream, imaginations or memories? A lot of literary and cinematic references and indeed this Franco film, which Lang has mastered. Beautiful and fascinating, the movie unfolds at a dizzying pace, but has a wealth in every fold. A rare movie that goes crazy inside. Old Jess could do it when he tried. And Jack's central performances include the indisputable Jack Taylor and Howard Vernon. I have not even mentioned the Lisbon locations - ah!
