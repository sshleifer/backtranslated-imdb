I think the film is educational. However, he fails to address the issue that has caused so many controversies: plural marriage. The film also fails to reveal what the LDS church enjoys. A great opportunity was missed to tell the world what I believe. I was unable to give a clear idea of ​​what the LDS visions are about the central themes of religion. I have many LDS friends and are good people. It would have been nice to get a clearer picture of how they see the controversial statements of their prophet. Perhaps these statements are too controversial to be treated in a movie format, but it would have been great to hear the whole story of Joseph Smith's truly interesting life. After all, it provides an insight into American thinking about religion in the 18th century. I hope to do some documentation on this fascinating subject, allowing historians to comment on Smith's life. We might have a Mormon president one day. After all, Smith ran for president.
