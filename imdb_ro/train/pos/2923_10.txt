Eddie Murphy really made me laugh at my ass on this HBO comedy show. I like the impressions of Mr. T, Ed Norton and Ralph Cramden about "The Honeymooners", Elvis Presley and Michael Jackson too. Ice Cream Man, Goony Goo Goo, is also funny. I saw this for the first time when it came out in 1984. I laughed so hard that I almost fell from my chair. I still think it's very funny. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy, when he was on Saturday Night Live, made me laugh so much, is one of the best out of Saturday Night Live. "Eddie Murphy Delirious" is the best performance of "Eddie Murphy Raw". I give "Eddie Murphy Delirious" 2 fingers and 10/10 stars.
