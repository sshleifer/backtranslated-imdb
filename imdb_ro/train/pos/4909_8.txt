Most of the movies about New Orleans, which take place in New Orleans, have proven to be bad laughs and have been inexplicable (Example: Remember "Wild Bees," but I'll make an exception for "Tightrope"). <br /> <br /> Here's one that does not inevitably make a mistake. The emphasis is not too bad (yes, the emphasis is "yat" here is more Brooklynese than the South), the 1950s city is shown as it is / no, no binding "tourist" photographs and understand a good drama without trying to make the whole the world a "strange welder". <br /> <br /> One of the few movies to make this town right, and a good boot movie.
