This is the best version of Dicken's classic story. I've always seen it on VHS and I recently purchased the DVD version, which is formatted for the TV (not on the widescreen). What I find interesting about this teleplay is the distribution of English actors, who are now recognized as many have appeared in other films / shows in North America since 1984. The biggest surprise is Edward Woodward, the "Equalizer," as the Present Spirit of Christmas .
