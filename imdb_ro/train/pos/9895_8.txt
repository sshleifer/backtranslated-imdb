A bunch of popular high school students play a cruel joke on Marty (a sympathetic show by Simon Scuddamore), which leaves him despised in secret. Five years later, the gang returns to the collapsing high school and abandons it for a reunion. Of course, an angry and revengeful Marty appears clothed in the costume of a shit to take revenge on his wicked men. Writers / directors Mark Ezra, Peter Litten and George Dugdale leave from all the courageous clich√©s that make the number of fifty-five years fall as much raw fun: fear of false snow, Steadican shooting, a fierce, hard storm rock rock rock, a beautiful smattering of female nudity free, a total ridiculous "what the hell?" the supernatural top, the sticky make-up f / x and one of those with so much gentleness "was just a terrible dream," false misconceptions. Moreover, the crime-ridden pieces give the horrible goods: Gory points out the stomach of a man who explodes after drinking poisoned beer, a lady who takes an acid bath, a guy crushed under a huge tractor, and two people electrocuted while is in the middle of wildly passionate sex. Thirty British horror sirens, Caroline Munro, is hazliu miscast as the American teenager in the first third of the film. They all have solid performances with a special work from Carmine Iannaccone, as smartaleck engineer Skip Pollack, Billy Hartman as Frank and Donna Yeager fake make-up as a Stella slut. Co-producer Dick Randall has a funny cameo as Manro's unpleasant agent, Manny. Harry Manfredini's music, indulgently indulging, recirculates the scores in his "Friday 13" scores. Alan Pudney, the angle cinema, is tricking. Good fun, fun.
