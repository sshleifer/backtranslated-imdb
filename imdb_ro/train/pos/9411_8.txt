Sidney Stratton has difficulties in keeping jobs at different textile factories, mainly because of his experiments in textile laboratories. Stratton experiments a formula for a new fabric that would create the final fabric, one that never gets dirty, does not get up or breaks. When Stratton creates the fabric, he creates enemies in all textile workers (who will lose their jobs) and the owners (who will lose money when a mill has exclusive rights), so Stratton, in his white suit, becomes the most hunted England. The film is ideal and only Ealing could have done it. Guinness's performance (and a support cast, such as Greenwood, Thesiger and Parker) and Mackendrick's direction make the film delightful, but the real hero is the story itself, a beautiful satire in business and industry with extra elements of drama, romance and suspense. Rating, 8.
