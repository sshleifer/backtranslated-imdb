I thought this movie was excellent, because Corrine and Sean are newcomers to business. It was full of action and a little love, but there were a few points when Corrine did not speak very clearly (when she threatened Sean with the gun) and she ended her teeth ... maybe she should have believed it? I think the role of Joseph and Sonny was portrayed very well and there is a clear contrast. Also, because I saw the next star of action, I'm sure Corrine and Sean have done their own stunts, which have performed very well. I look forward to another film by the pair because they make a great team or maybe a continuation of your life betting - possibly called "doing great in the sea", could be this time about Carmen ..Bet your life is Excellent!
