Okay, the movie will not win any prize and it's pure bubblegum and it's a modern update on "It's a wonderful life." But it just comes out as a cheap DVD release and there are many more ways to blow $ 13. You will get a movie that has a surprisingly strong performance, but for most of those who have just been a year or two since they became list B celebrities. However, it's a good way to get an hour and a half, just do not believe too much in it.
