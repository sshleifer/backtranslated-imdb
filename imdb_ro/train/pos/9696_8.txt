I'm not a fan of newer movies, but it was a real pleasure to watch. Adults and children could see together - how unusual! My aunt liked her too. He had laughter, tears, love, adventure, special effects, good actors and a parrot talking. He reminded me of a favorite, The Wizard of Oz. The hero, Paulie, a smart parrot, is separated from his home and family and goes through many adventures, temptations and disappointments, always taking into account his resolution of finding his friend, Marie. Highly recommended.
