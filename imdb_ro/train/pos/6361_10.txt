We anticipated the opening of this film for several months. Being a huge fan of Jim Carrey, I could easily see how he can turn into Seuss's Grinch and make him a character. I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> This movie was a pure magic. Carrey is a master of his trade and no one could have played this role to perfection as he did. It was a lot to enjoy for both adults and children alike and this movie is sure to become a timeless classic for everyone to enjoy in the coming years. I already have visions of my young daughter a year to watch this remake on the video and no doubt I'll look at her and laugh as I did the first time I saw her. the film writes Jim Carrey everywhere, and I do not think he would have met without him. However, the support distribution was charming and fun in itself, especially adorable Taylor Momsen, which was a perfect foil for Carrey's antics. The set design, the musical scores and the costumes have given them a magic and fabulous finite product and I think everyone involved can be proud. <br /> <br /> It's not an easy work to turn a 22-minute classic cartoon into a live action movie, but Howard did with flying colors. For those critics who disagree, maybe your hearts are two too small.
