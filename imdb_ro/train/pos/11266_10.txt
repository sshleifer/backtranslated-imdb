I recently looked at this, but when I started I had no idea what the concept was, what was the subject ..... in short - I did not know what it was. It was a documentary, it was a routine comedy ..... Well, it was so. It started a little, but I think because I had absolutely no idea what kind of program I was watching. But he got up quickly. The episode I was looking at had Robert Wuhl talking about fact and fiction in history. First of all how we (the Americans) learn history that is not really true - and how we have to learn what we did. He did so in order to keep the spectator completely entertaining and interested. I learned a few things and is a true indicator of the effectiveness of this type of program. <br /> <br /> I would love to see this as a series for HBO. I think it can be as fun and effective with a variety of topics - especially if they are "taught" in the same way as this episode.
