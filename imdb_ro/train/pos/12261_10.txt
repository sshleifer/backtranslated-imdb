Tintin and I recently broadcast as an episode of P.O.V. series. It is based on an interview by Georges Remi, which was created by Herge, Tintin in 1971, where he discusses his various experiences by publishing his popular character, first in a Catholic newspaper, then in his own series of books comics. Wonderful wonderful views of the various comic stripes and the surreal images of Herge's dreams. I met Tintin on Digest pages for kids at my elementary school library, reading the Unicorn Secrets. My mother later received a CD subscription and read Red Rackham's entire treasure every month in 1978. I remember seeing a few Tintin comic books in a local bookshop afterwards but from for some reasons I did not get any reason because I was 12 years old and I thought I was over. I'm Breaking Free, a book written and written by J. Daniels, published in 1989, six years after Herge's death. You have not read it yet. This film also covers the artist's personal life as if he left his first wife after his adventure with a colorist in his engagement (whom he married later). Her name is Fanny and she is interviewed here. If you love Tintin and his creator, this film definitely deserves a look. Update: 9/4/07 - I read now Breaking Free. Tintin and the Captain are the only common characters that appear here and are adapted to Mr Daniels's anti-capitalist views, with Tintin portrayed as a ribbon with a chip on his shoulder, who still cares about the Captain he is with. The captain tries only to meet a wife and a daughter whom she loves very much. These and other construction workers promise to strike after a hired employee dies from a defective equipment accident. The whole thing takes place in England with the intact working cockroach accents. It's not the sort of thing that Herge would approve, but an interesting reading, though. Oh, yeah, the Snowy dog ​​only appears in the upper left corner of the cover (which has Tintin running over the police!) And the dedication page.
