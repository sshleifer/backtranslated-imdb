Classical worship is almost impossible to predict. Who could guess that Vision Quest, the Fighting Club and 2001: A Space Oddysey, movies that have been criticized and made public by both their release, would become extremely popular? Like many IMDBers, I consider myself a film expert. Unlike most of those who hate Envy (highlighted by a categorical rating of 4.4), I found that Envy is one of the funniest movies in the last decade. The film is ridiculous. Dialogue is not smart, scenes have little continuity and the script seems to be written by a fourth student. But that's why the movie is so hilarious. You see, to appreciate Envy's accidental genius, you must enjoy the film from an ironically-detached point of view. Why do I like Envy? Because the movie is bad to the point where it gets good. This is the recipe for a classic worship, and Envy surely fits the bill.
