Visconti's first film has all of his visual flair and immaculate technique, accompanied by the appealing performances of Massimo Girotti as a beautiful rider and, above all, Clara Calamai as a fabulous and frenzied Giovanna. Fixed multiple times like "The postal ring twice", but never improved. I can not believe it was the first movie of man! It shows someone's trust at the career zenith.
