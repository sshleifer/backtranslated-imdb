Many things have already been said about this film and I would like to join those who praised it. It's an extremely unique film that uses elements of different genres: drama, comedy, gangster film without making a mess. In the points you just laugh out loud, at other points you feel about the characters whose mistakes and failures you look at. Sabu's genius can be shown on some of the sequences of the film. One is where all three men watching each other have an erotic dream about a young woman they just walked to on the street. This sequence is beautiful and illustrates the characters of the three runners very well. It's erotic and funny at the same time. Another example of Sabu's genius is the part of the film in which the runners get tired. The first of them, the typical loser of the three guys, hallucinated the fact that the woman who left him for somebody else is coming back and seeing them dance with each other and in the next blow they dance with him, moving deeply. All runners arrive to this point where they think they have something back lost or are on the right track. And in one part of the movie, they stop increasingly wandering, running in line, laughing. That's the beauty and the weakness of what we call the life that Sabu manages to show throughout the movie. Its characters do not succeed (not at the end of them?), But do not rob them of their dignity. "Monday" and "Postman Blues", which justifies Sabu's statement that he is a genius. Go to follow them! <br /> <br />
