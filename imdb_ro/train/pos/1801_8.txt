I saw this movie when it was first released in 1989. I liked it then and still do that. But what I realize now is that this is quite "adult" for a G rating movie, especially the notion of dying and going to Heaven. Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise work awesome together, and Reynolds's voice is suited to a shit dog. There are some good songs, from optimal ("Let's do music together"), to emotional ("Home to My Heart"). We've found the entire plot well, although it does not work a tangent once or twice. The final scene of the movie with Charlie and Anne-Marie is one of the saddest I've ever seen in animation. A movie worth experimenting.
