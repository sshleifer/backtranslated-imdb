What starts out as an extremely predictable and a little dear business is finally quite hilarious and fun. "The right to die" is not very suspenseful, but more than doing it with some strange pieces and gore. <br /> <br /> Spoilers here: <br /> <br /> Top credits also go to the dead show from Martin Donovan as one of the most daring characters ever to grab the screen. If you play the character in a very "aloof" manner, you almost feel sorry for the guy eventually when his big plan fails in the end. Corbin Bernsen also chews the landscape playing a not-so-good guy who just gets his desserts. The End of the Spoiler. As a dead-film revenge, "The Right to Die" benefits greatly from performers and is more than just a way to spend less than an hour.
