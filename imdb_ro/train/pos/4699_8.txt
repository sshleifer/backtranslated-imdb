This has done for murder what "there was another Teen movie" did for school. I laughed all the way until two dishonest gangs fought between them and between them. An unstoppable comedy that used open jokes and gags that made me roll all the way. I suppose the biggest gag in the movie was that time did not seem to go ahead, leaving the characters caught in the 1930s.
