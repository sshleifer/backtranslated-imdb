Bruce Almighty is the story of Bruce Nolan, an ordinary man who feels that God is messing up his life. God confronts him and shows Bruce the error of his ways. Of course, by giving somebody the powers of God might take revenge. Bruce Almighty is a good comedy, Jim Carrey is good, as always Morgan Freeman is first-class and seems to be at home because God and distribution brings a good plot. Banknotes are almost always on target, though they sometimes recover too much Carrey's facial expressions. I liked the fact that the film actually portrayed God, not only, but also black. I've been thinking pretty well, especially with the brilliant Freeman. There are some scary scenes, for example, the scene of opening cookies, others miss the target slightly but still a good movie. 6/7 of 10
