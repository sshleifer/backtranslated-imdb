I have zero interest in the ghetto culture, I'm white and like classic rock, however, that did not stop me from appreciating this fantastic comedy. It's pretty much a sequel to This Is Spinal Tap in the sense that it's the same movie, just about rap or rock. Still, it's hilarious. There are many funny jokes, but not without a few jokes that just fall. The characters are very funny and credible. I just looked for making me laugh at 3am and any movie that can do that justifies at least one screening test. One of the reasons why these movies were so funny was that it makes fun rap from another. Today's rap is concerned about the wrong things and is approaching the sound of the studio and the little talent. This film comes at a time when rappers deserve more credit. Generally, it's a funny movie, with lots of jokes about racism, sex, and music culture among the more obvious humorous themes. This is highly recommended for any fan of this is Spinal Tap. They are, in essence, the same movie, about different worlds, and yes, the same jokes work in both films.
