When I was told about this movie, I thought it would be another chicken blow. I was wrong. This movie sends a strong message about judging others. I was deeply moved. Everyone I met, I recommended this movie. No one has come back saying it's bad. Busy also did a great job with his role in this film. I do not know much about her acting career, but wow, the way she pulled out the end of the filing was great. At first it was a little sluggish. But after going to the hospital ... wow, the movie resumes again. I have no idea why this movie was not spoken in the movie world. My wish would be to release this movie again and advertise more ... because it sends a strong message in just one and a half hours.
