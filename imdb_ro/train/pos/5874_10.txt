this movement was hilarious friggin! the funny one I've seen for a moment, acshay and John kicking the ass as always, and the chickens are hot too. the story is great, a lot of big jokes and anyone who has analyzed this before me is an idiot. to tell him that u are not an Indian background, so u would not understand humor u moron. do not miss movies u do not understand. what did you watch, the subtitled version where most jokes are lost in translation? that's what Jackass thought. Akshay Kumar is the best actor ever and proves once again his versatility, he can not only make an action, but also a comedy, and he is excellent in this. John also proved, this is his first comedy role and he was also excellent at him.
