First of all, this movie was not released in theaters (TESTED POORLY THEY SAY), they say they thought the story of crooked policemen, politicians and dedicated newspapers were killed, send them DVD & cable TV and get money & run . <br /> <br /> Having said that, I usually like this type of movie, especially with this distribution called. Morgan Freeman, Justin Timberlake, Kevin Spacey, LLCool J, Cary Elways, John Heard, and Piper Perabo & Roslyn Sanchez on the distaff side. were made to death, but the above distribution brings life to this violent movie & is actually watchable. Justin Timberlake It's good as a young reporter dedicated to a newspaper-cast away, edited by Morgan Freeman, The rest are either tight policemen or politicians or some pretty cute guys. The two ladies are LL COOL's friends J & JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE & doing what's necessary, it's pretty violent, many murders, not kids. It's certainly not a great movie, but for what it is and distribution is certainly good, Evaluations *** (out of 4) 86 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)
