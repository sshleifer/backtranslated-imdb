I've seen for the third time the Frank Loesser, Guys and Dolls movie version, with my mother never seen before. He was pleasantly surprised by the voices singing by Jean Simmons and Marlon Brando. And he thought the sequences in Havana where Simmons and Brando danced a storm were excellent. They were pretty impressive for me and they were usually the most important moments of the movie. Directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, this movie, which appeared as a story by Damon Runyon, takes a while with the slow rhythm of non-musical scenes at first, but it pulls you up after a while. The other story with Frank Sinatra and Vivian Blaine was not as compelling for me, but they still had their charm, especially during the "Sue Me". He also loved Stubby Kaye's "Sit Down, You're Rocking the Boat" and the performance of Sheldon Leonard and B. S. Pully. With a theatrical appearance over the years, Guys and Dolls is not a great musical movie, but certainly a very good one.
