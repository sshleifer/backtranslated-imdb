I may well be one of the few who really got stuck in this movie. I also saw this movie when it came out, and I agree with the last post that Up The Acedemy was long before its time. Humor in the movie itself is pure MAD magazine. I do not see why MAD is behind this feature. It was also one of the few films of the early '80s to have a killer who accompanied the soundtrack with the punks and the new wave bands that had appeared at that time from L.A. I have the soundtrack and I play constantly on this day. What can I say? There are certainly the worst movies out there. I do not think Porky will be as fun as the Upper Academy, there are some very good laughs throughout the movie, and the jokes fall either on stereotypes or on others. Hey, nobody said it would be the Maltese Falcon.
