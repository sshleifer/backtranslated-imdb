I bought it some time ago, but I neglected to watch her until last night. I like Juliette Lewis, though I'm indifferent to Brad Pitt. After this view I must admit that he is a perfect actor - his character was completely credible and I did not think of Brad Pitt at all. Unfortunately, I can not say the same for David Duchovny. I am a fan of X-Files and I have to look twice to confirm the date of this movie, as I thought it was a few years later. I like Duchovny, but I found my character in two dimensions, unless she makes voices. The part was strong, it looked like character, good intonation, etc. Otherwise, I always thought of Agent Mulder, which is a shame. Michelle Forbes was a treatment. Why have not I seen her before? (I'll look up to see what other roles she has done and to see the most awaited ones) I'm a little worried about Lewis' stereotypes, this movie and "Natural Born Killers" (a firm favorite). Interestingly, though to see a character contrast - in NBK she is a willing accomplice, while here she upsets violence and tries very hard not to recognize Early's dark side until she is pushed in front of her. I loved this film almost unreservedly. Apart from the character of Duchovny, which did not seem completely formed (and may have been "somewhat" washed by Pitt), it was perfect. I was also happy with the end - glad that the innocent heroes did not die, yet they had to suffer first. It was realistic, tense, disturbing. If you like NBK, you like this movie and vice versa.
