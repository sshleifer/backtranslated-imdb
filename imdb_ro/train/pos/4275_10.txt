In fact, I'm surprised that there have been so many comments about this movie. I saw it as part of a Slavic film festival at a great American university. But nobody in the US has heard of it, which is a shame! Dynamics among people is what makes both funny and sad. They are stuck together on a long bus trip - somewhere most of us have been! But I never had that! <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is where I stop for the funeral. Then the man and the woman sneak in for some lovers in the forest, but everybody keeps watching them without knowing it! As she raises her skirt and enters her all the way - the consumer starts hacking and realizes that everyone is watching! Talk about surprised! But ... you have to really feel for them, even if it's funny hilarious! When you see the end it's ironic that they enjoyed while they did it! The feast of humor is the best!
