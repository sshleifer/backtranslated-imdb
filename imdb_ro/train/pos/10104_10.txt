Om Puri's show, Smita Patil and Sadashiv Amrapurkar, as well as the whole chemistry, is beautiful, along with the minimalist approach of the story and direction of Govind Nihlani. Dialogues of Vijay Tendulkar are also wonderful. <br /> <br /> I have not seen another movie like this one. It's a whole, every piece so beautiful fits into the plot. You can not be impressed with this movie. <br /> <br /> Amrish Puri comes as Om Puri's chief husband and baap. Man Puri is the young man caught between his sense of duty and his inability to fight the system. Sadhashiv as Rama Shetty just gives the correct touch of the movie with his noisy smile and soft talk. Anand Velankar's first meeting with Rama Shetty's at Sadhashiv is unbelievably amazing. Smita Patil does not play a leading role, but her part does not distract attention from the main plot. In addition, Kafi Inamdar plays the role of a policeman who understands the system and its functioning. Saying the right things in the right places and knowing how to keep yourself away from trouble. He is also Om Puri's "guru" and helps him whenever he is in trouble. The film not only focuses on the difficulties faced by a policeman who is trying to fulfill his duty, but also the other part of the brutality in police custody. Puri Puri surprises the lack of hope and the burning desire to break into this exceptional performance in Ardh Satya. <br /> <br /> A treatment for all fans of the Indian cinema.
