I was absolutely amazed at the opening night of John Cassavetes. It's his first film that I've seen, which seems to be on a bigger scale, so he feels more, but still does not feel as if he's been more than he had in his movies earlier. This is probably what makes it so intense. There is also, undoubtedly, something cathartic about watching this movie. It is about what Cassavetes has actually made a career career, an ideal that he has expressed behind the camera throughout his career as a director and here in front of him. Rowlands's character, Middle Age Scene Actress Myrtle Gordon can not bring her role in future production as she is written, so she does not follow impulse after impulse, resulting in what appears to be chaos on stage, until she finds the right one. It is a bold premise of abstract. This is a film that fails to capture the inborn direction it goes through during emotional cleansing. No one understands why Myrtle does many of the things she does and is seen and even portrayed as something destroying, though it might be the best thing for her. It can be a cleanup rather than a breakdown. A retreat, a cocoon, a rebellion, culminates in a collapse. Cassavetes gives the character a real brutal touch, that, from the beginning, she firmly maintains that she has nothing in common with her character, yet she is in a quiet, but emotionally corroding fear, that the opposite is true. <br /> <br /> The last scene, the climate show Myrtle shares with a painfully alienated character by the actress, is one of the most exciting, hilarious, painful, bright and pleasant moments that I have ever seen in a movie.
