This movie was recommended by a friend. I have never seen an ad or a trailer, so I did not know that Clooney was in it and was not disturbed by the fact that his role was so small. I thought all the distribution was right and found the movie pretty good, totally. The opening scene, with the small crew of bandits standing by the side of the road, showing whipped and haggard, caught my attention immediately. He had a way of telling you, "do not go away, it will not be boring" and it really was not. It turned out to be an interesting, light-hearted comedy with enough twists and twists that kept you at your side all the way, but when it came to the end, I felt a little cheated ... just a little. Events have continued to grow so you can expect to continue building, but at a point I can not define it is a kind of level, which makes the conclusion a slight disappointment. I think I expected a bigger climate, but it turned out to be a kind of key. If you watch the movie with this in mind and you can live without big doses of George Clooney, you should find this movie really fun and worth watching. Now I'd like to see the original (Big Deal on Madonna Street), but it's probably a rare find in the United States.
