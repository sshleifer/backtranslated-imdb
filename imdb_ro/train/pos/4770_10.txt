The only show I watched from 90210! Why did they stop it? It was the only show that captured the essence of Hawaii and made you feel like you were part of all this! The least you should do is release it on DVD! <br /> <br /> I checked similar shows, but nothing came close. The cast had incredible chemistry and I was looking forward to each episode with much anticipation. <br /> <br /> They made a big mistake by pulling that show. If anyone has information about where to get a North Shore DVD, please post a few lines here. Thanks! Aloha!
