I break my heart that this movie is not appreciated as it should be. highly underestimated. people have forgotten what movies are really, nowadays they are thinking only of the bum bum movies that can be quite amusing watching with popcorn and friends as transformers, oriented films with hyper mega big budget of 300ml or even bigger, on special effects only and which are bad films without a story. It is the kind of film that, despite most. Of course, it's fun to forget CGIs, but we do not really get anything of that kind. I honestly believe the performance was excellent. Especially Philipps busy, along with Erika Christensen and Victor Garber (whom I respect), made this film an Oscar worth it. Busy Philipps's emotional performance was amazing, such a shame that we will not see the Oscar in her hands that they deserve.
