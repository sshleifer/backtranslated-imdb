Charles McDougall's magazine includes "Sex and the City", "Disperate Housewives," "Queer as Folk," "Big Love," "The Office," so it comes with all the accreditations to make TV version Meg Wolitzer, the novel SURRENDER, DOROTHY, a success. And for the most part, he manages to keep this potentially blood-filled story about the sudden death of a loved one, and than how people in her life react on the waterline. Sara (Alexa Davalos), a beautiful young unmarried woman, accompanies her best friends - Adam (Tom Everett Scott), actress Adam Shawn (Chris Pine) and married couple Maddy (Lauren German) and Peter (Josh Hopkins ) for a summer holiday. The group looks cheerful until a trip to Adam and Sara's local ice cream) results in a car accident that kills Sara. Meanwhile, Sara's mother, Natalie Swedlow (Diane Keaton), who has an active social life, but who naturally calls her daughter constantly with her mutual greeting "Surrender, Dorothy," plays it elsewhere: when receives the phone at Hamptons, where her personality and her pain created a friction among Sara's friends. Slowly but surely, Natalie discovers secrets about each of her, flourishing talking about Sara, as if to make her come alive. Natalie's thirst for truth, at all costs, leads to major changes among the group and only through the obligatory love of Sara gone that they all eventually come together. Diane Keaton is at her best in these roles strolling the line between drama and comedy and her presence keeps the story together. The script has good moments for good lines, but it also has a lot of stuff that gets a bit heavy and dull, making the actors obviously uncomfortable with the lines they give. Yes, this story has been told many times - the impact of sudden death on the lives of those whose privacy is changed by revelations - but the movie moves with the pounding rhythm and has enough authentic entertainment to make it worth watching.
