This is a good movie and nothing. And for that it's really fun to look. Of course he is changing political issues. But what? I'm sure he did not try to do "Good night and luck" here. Let's not try to do anything other than what it is ... the light tariff. <br /> <br /> And very nice to this! Do we remember 1984? We have become very sophisticated by the media as to what we look at or not. I tend to differ in this regard. Goldie knew this was fun, and she went ahead and did it. Just like the easiest fare: Protocol, Overboard, Houseitter, Wildcats, Private Benjamin, Same as Old Times, First Wives Club and Out-of-Towners remake, GOLDIE knows what he does ... for the camp that you can get out of it! Goldie knows very well and knows what he can do very well. It always made me laugh joyfully and innocently. I loved her in "Laugh-In" and in every thing she ever was. She never tried to be anything but who she is ... and that's that barbita, giggle to the side that happens to be very beautiful and has a smile and a laugh that will always love me and will remind me that life is short and that you have to relieve yourself, because before you know it ... you are old, wrinkled and suffer from one of the inevitable diseases of life. If it comes so late. I appreciate Goldie for what she is: a loving, comic actress.
