This entertaining entertaining fun fun, "Death Wish," plays the gorgeous and well-equipped Karin Mani, like Billie Clark, a first-martial arts warrior and a team that destroys a woman who opens a gigantic ten-gallon drum charmers who did not talk to sharp moguls, slaves, rapists, drug dealers and street band members, after some criminals lead to very minor offenses and attacked her good parents. Mrs. Mani, stunningly voluptuous, sank her teeth into a tough chicken, with big traps, with a winning aplomb, wandering wandering boys with infectious joy, and stinking her hot point of smoking in some extremely free nudes, but much appreciated. Unfortunately, Mani has an extremely irritating chewing and marble voice, which is a pure crime on my ears (my favorite moment regarding the dubious diffusion of Mani's dialogue appears when she asks, "Do not rush with the girls in Park, after making a few hateful hooligans. Karin's only film role was later in "Avenging Angel," in which he makes a boring scene with entirely frontal nodes but has no lines.) One single sequence The sensationally unpleasant one appears when Mani becomes briefly incarcerated for contempt for the charge of the court and shows him considerable things in a shower scene with shower groups. Of course, Mani's celibate lesbian celibacy tries to seduce her just to -and makes the unwanted advances rejected with a severe beating! Strangely enough, the lesbian forgives Mani and becomes her best friend while she is behind the bars. In view of an additional blow of galvanizing in the viguously brut'n'ready arm by Edward Victor's pumnish direction, a funky-rockin "score, a cuddly creepy acting through a play (if lame) expressed, a constant, fast, numerous rhythm pull-out - stops the exciting battle scenes and the hard shot of Howard Anderson III, this extraordinary pleasure explosion is an essential view for hardcore fans of a low-budget, low-budget, low-budget cinema.
