Believe it in the winning column, it was a superb movie. The performances that acted were great and the script was just as great. Helen Hunt was magnificent as the Riverside police officer, Gina Pulasky. Gina was a complex character. She was a rookie policeman at the Riverside Police Department. She got into an adventure with a colleague she knew she had a wife and children, though she took the dangerous task of going undercover to get a serial killer. <br /> <br /> Jeff Fahey (Ray Liotta looked alike) made a bang to the job as a confused, often stommering, police officer who had an affair with Gina. He was stoic as an officer, but he was exactly the opposite when he came to deal with his feelings and his extramarital business. Steven Weber, the most important of the Wings sitcom, is a beautiful job as a quiet, gentle and wonderful sociopath. On the surface, he was an innocent loser, but a cold-hearted killer lied beneath the surface. Weber really took the character of a young adult child with an unborn thirst to kill the young boys. The whole movie was spectacular. Every scene, every verbal exchange informs us more and more about the characters. The production team did a phenomenal job with condensation days, if not weeks worth of events in a 90-minute film. This movie was a good example of doing a lot with little.
