May be biased, I am the author of The Hungry Bachelors Club, self-published in 1994. The script was written by my good and hungry friend Fred Dresch, who was the inspiration for Marlon's character in the film. I could not be more satisfied with the trailer, I hope to see the movie in full and I will comment further. But Jorja Fox, who plays the role of Delmar Youngblood, is a star. It carries most of the emotional vehicles in fine form. I could not have done better! This looks like real people, hard-pressed by the formula, and fortunately leads my claim against racial, domestic, graceful, and sincere prejudices.
