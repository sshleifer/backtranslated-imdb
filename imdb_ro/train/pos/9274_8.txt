Another fantastic film in a country where, due to decades of oppression from fundamentalist regimes, it has no problems in creating passionate subjects. Panahi has a different approach this time, with a combination of ironic comedy and an amorous and unprofessional distribution. As he continues his message about what he sees as inherently wrong in his country, he does it without the need for a tough story. It is a positive result for a country, especially its people, which the Iranian population is desperate for. The greatest pity is that it will not be released internally. Iran's insular, paranoid government says that this exceptional film producer only fails abroad because it is part of a global conspiracy that makes them shame. After growing up in the midst of the revolution and pursuing academic cadres, artists and educators "disappear" in the last 25 years, he shows a great bravery in continuing his work there. The realism achieved by pulling to the real World Cup qualifier really transfers you to the event. The fact that he shot 35mm is amazing, because most would just try this project using a digital format. It looks fantastic. His insistence on using only non-professional actors also really works in this movie. Perfect performance all the time. After watching many movies showing Iran's problems and also the media reporting the facts, we can tempt to demonize both the people and the government. This film has exactly the opposite. It shows us that they still love the same things and that, laughing at themselves and the absurd rules of sharia law, maybe a change for the better is not too far. Some call Panahi a feminist film producer, but I think he only fights for the most oppressed demographers in Iran. Young women, independent women.
