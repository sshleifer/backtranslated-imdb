Almost 30 years later, I remember this original PBS movie as an almost unbearable auction. Periodically, I checked here at IMDb in the hope that someone had the common sense to buy the rights and put it on a DVD. It is September 2004 and I have all hope - a deep sigh. One of the two main actors went to a small career, primarily in a first-class evening soap; the other, Frances Lee McCain, has been seen in small roles here and there for a few years. But they did not do anything before or after they ever matched this small film that was produced, as I recall, to a short PBS series that featured original scripts by new and up-and-coming playwrights. I looked every time she was shown on PBS, maybe 2 or 3 times. That was before the VCR era, so I have no record of it except the eye of my mind. <br /> <br /> 12/31/2006 in addition to the above: Happy New Year, ladies! This wonderful movie is finally available on DVD at ladyslipper.org. My understanding is that the DVDs are burned from the writer's personal copy.
