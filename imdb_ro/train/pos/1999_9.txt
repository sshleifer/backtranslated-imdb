Oliver! the music is my favorite. Music, characters, story. Everything looks perfect. In this interpretation of the classic novel, it became a musical scene, director Carol Reed brings the Broadway hit on the cinema screen. Switching from music to music is not easy. You have to have the right voices, the right set, the right script, and the right game. All the signs show that they give this piece. It looks like it was written for the screen! Our story takes place in old cheerful England where a boy named Oliver manages to make his way out of the orphanage. He cuts his way across the country to London, where he meets a group of juvenile delinquents headed by Dodger, his smart and fast-pocketed pocket. The leader of this gang is called Fagin, an older man who sells all the stolen goods. But it's not good in London when Bill Sykes, played by Oliver Reed and Nancy's loving girlfriend, gets confused with Oliver, Fagin and his young bands and the law. The following is a wonderful story of love, affection, and extraordinary musical numbers. Whether you like music or not, somebody listens to these songs and you cough them all day. Oliver! is a triumph on and off the stage and is a timeless artwork.
