In 1979, I was a 12-year-old boy, my parents just had the cashier house that was quite new in our neighborhood. Like a 12-year-old boy, this was the first time I saw boobs on television. I will never forget the joy of those times. Racing motorcycles, total wiping with the worst van, water bed, herb smoking, 70 year old chicks, love in my Chevy van, everything was so new to me. A complete movie with all the memories you can hope for. I hold it and enjoy it once a year. When I look at this movie, it makes me want to take my skates with four wheels, not in a tight line, go to the park and hunt some babies with feather hair. truly wonderful memories of young adolescence!
