I found it very intellectual and artistic in all respects! I felt that the script carries all the things that I feel physically and emotionally when I got home from work and looked at it. this is a tribute to cinema in the highest form and format. holy guacamole! how I would like those days to come again. I tried to put a bubble window on the side of my car (honda civic 1984), but the vacuum-formed muffin trays did not cut it. also in my civic, sexual positions are limited and are not supported by the bed of water as it is wonderfully described in "van". "van" is on the farthest side dividing hilarity and maybe even replacing porn if you look at some private scenes. I have very anticipated that Sam Grossman (the director) has reached the opposite. <br /> <br /> Evaluations john: **** 1/2 Sam: *****
