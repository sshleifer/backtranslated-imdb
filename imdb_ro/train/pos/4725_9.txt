Despite the lack of logic in the story, Kill Shot is a very enjoyable film. Through a moving performance, Kasper Van Dien brilliantly describes the emotional rupture between a rich father who works hard and his wrong son. Each member of the supporting piece supports a solid performance, highlighted by the living action of an Asian couple, whose name they can not remember. A tragic final shocking may reveal some younger viewers, but overall Kill Shot really offers a death blow.
