Sammy, Curr a metal metal god, tried to stop him, tried to forbid him, tried to censor his music! (like real life Dee Snider, from Twisted Sister, [Tipper Gore] or Ozzy Osborne) Killed in a fire, Sammi Cure would have had to play Halloween at his old high school for a dance. Now Eddie Weinbauer, 1 fan, and the only one who knew how Sammy was and what he felt (or did?) Nuke, the dj at the local radio station (Gene Simmons) has the only copy of Sammy Eddie's latest record. But when Eddie tries to play back, he finds Sammy talking to him from the dead and telling him what to do to get back to his school hunters who hate him and his music. It all works until Sammi starts to kill! A great movie and you have to watch for heavy metal fans with a great soundtrack at Fastway and just in case you do not know what the songs sounded or if they know how it happens with the Fastway and they do not like it, , and to sound like Cinderella more known, or Ratt .. Is the movie a true horror movie? Well, that depends on what you call a horror movie. For me, a real horror movie is a slasher, with a lot of killing, or just scary. This movie is not enough death, but it can not be called action, comedy, drama, suspense, or thriller, so I would have guessed that there must be a horror. So if you want to "Rock N 'Roll, Rockin 'In the middle of the night steel your soul!' Thom Sammy Curr and Trick or Treat is for you .. I mean "why are you afraid? It's just Rock 'n' Roll !?"
