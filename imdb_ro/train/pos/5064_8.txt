This movie is great in all the ways in which modern adventure actions are not. Take some time. Relax, rejoice. Think. People who see this movie as slow or frustrating or boring really have to take a week and follow it several times until their tiny span attention faces the possibility of being involved in a cause or even a beautiful story in a beautiful place for no other reason than because it does not rush to make the points you have to accomplish in the shortest time. At first I was worried that Brosnan played a native American. Given the story, however, I think it was right. Now, go back to my espionage. -Jahfre
