Screwball comedy about romantic inconsistencies in New York City. Peter Bogdanovich is obviously in love with all the women in his painting - he respects them - but Audrey Hepburn is (naturally) put a note above the others, because after all, Princess Bogdanovici is probably in love with films years ago. He shoots her into a wonderful girl, is right in the sheets between her and Ben Gazzara, hot and hot, hot and hot, and allows her to shine her room. The love ties made during the movie are quick and fun, though I made a tire for John Ritter's noise. The Colleen Championship, Dorothy Stratten, and the earth-sensual land Patti Hansen are interesting to look at. But it really is Valentine's to Hepburn and it shines absolutely. *** from ****
