PLAYTHING DEVILOR is Joseph Sarno's second production attempt, and though I say he is much more enjoyable than the painful and unerotic Swedish WILDCATS, it's still a bit slow and un-explicit for my taste. <br /> <br /> It focuses around a group of vampire girls living in a castle who want to revive their "leader" previously killed. To do this, girls have to dance around naked and kiss each other and sing strange things - and of course to drink blood. When a doctor and her brother's car break down and have to stop at the castle to be housed - they offer the ideal blood boy for vicious excited vampires ... but maybe they're not as helpless as it seems ... <br / > <b> PLAYSTATION DEVILOR is a pretty good example from the early 1970s. A lot of nudity - including some full-fledged, some unhealthy subtleties - including incest and, of course, lesbian-blood ... but these scenes are still quite hungry for current standards. Some hot women in this case would benefit from a more explicit sex, but I think you can not have everything. Also, he would have benefited from a more serious violence / gore, because it is a vampire movie, but I think the purpose of DEVIL'S was more to present the skin, not the blood. Still a bit slow - and most of the play is absolutely wooden - but that can be expected from something in this era and this budget. You should take a look at fan exploitation - others might find it a bit too boring to like them. 7/10
