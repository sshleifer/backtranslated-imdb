After seeing more films from Villaronga, I had a pretty clear opinion about him - he focuses too much on the personality of the characters, forgetting the rhythm of the film. That's why, despite good criticism, his films have not caught the attention of the general public. In ARo, he follows the same line, but the rhythm really improved, especially at the end of the movie. Frankly speaking, I slept through the first part, because although the first part provides the necessary information, it is very slow. However, the second part is absolutely awesome and makes the whole movie the best movie ever made by Villaronga. Recommended.
