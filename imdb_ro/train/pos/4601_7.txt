Story Police is a stunning series of pieces for Jackie Chan to show her unique talents and bravery. Some of the stunts here are Jackie's best and most dangerous, the whole battle of the final of battle is probably Jackie's most brutal and less comic battle sequence, then tell Project A or Drunken Master at the end of the battle. the impact. But unfortunately, the rest of the movie does not support this quality, as it is a political coples thriller with some comedy elements. I always prefer JC in movies like Project A, where its comic natural talent shines. Within the serious limits of some elements of Story of Police, it just does not work for me. He said that although this is still there with Jackies the best movies thanks to incredible stunt work and pure show. As usual, with Hong Kong movies avoid the double DVD DVD version as it is a really horrible stick with the subtitles. Great stunts, the OK movie is a great starting point if you have never seen a JC movie before and you really deserve a watch for any 7/10 movie fan
