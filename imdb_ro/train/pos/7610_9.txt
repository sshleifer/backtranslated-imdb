He only saw season 1 so far, but this is very good! A great variety of people have stayed on an island. No one seems to be and everyone seems to have a lot of skeletons in their closets ... it looks like Melrose Place meets the Crusoe family and why is it so great? Probably not, but then a spoon full of X files, a dose of "what"? and a big "hey" and an island that's all you've ever dreamed of - in your freaking nightmares and you'll be lost. The story has received so many twists and turns that it is unbelievable. Great organized, solid, acting with a liberating acceptance that at the end of each is a man (with almost everyone ... I think ...) with good and bad parts. But strange oh so strange ...
