Master of the Cecil B. De Mille film show goes west. Using three legends of the old West as protagonists (perhaps they have not met), Gary Cooper portrays Wild Bill Hickock, James Ellison as Buffalo Bill and Jean Arthur makes a beautiful Calamity Jane. The story serves only De Mille to put in motion some wonderful action sequences, such as the great Indian attack. Excuses like this are extremely well done. If you do not mind the somewhat superior performance of the tracks, this is very Western fun. Watch a very young Anthony Quinn, playing the role of a brave Indian who participated in the Battle of Little Big Horn. This part has reached at least Hollywood.
