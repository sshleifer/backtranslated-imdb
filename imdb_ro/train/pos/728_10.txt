Ramones, whom I consider the founders of modern punk rock, give their unique sounds in a terrible movie about a rock fan (PJ Soles) who faces a merciless, merciless director (Mary Woronov) for right to rock. <br /> <br /> With an incredible soundtrack, RRHS is fascinating in design and execution. It is full of good sounds (such as mouse experiments), adolescent spirit (perhaps the opening of your favorite movie over time) and bizarre moments on the wall (straitjacket scenes). If you are looking for a movie that seems to be done purely at the molecular level, do not look anymore. But if you are looking for a beautiful, worthy, dramatic epic, maybe you should look a little further. <br /> <br /> "Hi everyone, I'm Riff Randell, and this is Rock & Roll High School!"
