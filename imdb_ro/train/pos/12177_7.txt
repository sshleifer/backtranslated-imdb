Review: In the morning after the bachelor party, Paul wakes up with his wife and discovers that there is a woman sleeping next to him. Unfortunately, he's a waitress at the bar, not his fianc√©. And suddenly he's coming back all over ... the toll-booth and the parents-in-law dinner. And it's hard to keep a secret when his former jealous friend watched and photographed him. It's not just about saving his wedding ... it's about survival. Comments: Actually much better than expected. Not the nice romantic comedy I was expecting, but something much more fun, something with a little edge. This movie was not afraid to take the jokes again. And Jason Lee is doing now how to deliver comedy, especially when his character is half panicked and profound in trouble, as he is here. And she received beautiful support from beautiful ladies Julia Stiles and Selma Blair. And in fact, I thought Lochlyn Munro made a beautiful part like the former. So, more emphasis on comedy than romance, and the final result was good. I liked very much. <br /> <br /> 7/10
