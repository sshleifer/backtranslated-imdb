Everything is idyllic in the Suburbs when the little family moves, as the father has a new job in a computer company there. But no paradise would be complete without his snake. Strange things happen when the family joins the local country club without a husband, because he certainly holds secrets. The father is not a carpenter, but pressure on him to join, because all the members who are in the neighborhood and in the workplace are members. The good part of Robert Urich is a bit hot, but Joanna Cassidy is a good housewife who turns ugly sizzles. Chiller suspicious and well prepared, with Susan Lucci as club president. Look for your favorite cult Michael Berryman in a small part as a valet. The film captures the feeling of paranoia, and the end of the special effects is worthwhile. I've seen this movie several times.
