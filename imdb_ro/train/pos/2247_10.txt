I am disappointed with the lack of posts on this surprising and effective film. Jordi Mollà, perhaps best known for his role as Diego in Ted Demme's "Blow", writes, directs and sees. I will not give any plot, that the movie (at least for me) was very interesting without knowing anything about it. If you have a netflix account or you have access to a video store that will carry it ... I recommend very much. It is a crazy, fun, and sometimes very thought-provoking creation. Mollà's direction is * quite impressive and shows many promises. Unpredictable, with amazing images and lead-like performance spoken in beautiful Spanish "No somos nadie" (God is on Air) is an amazing film you can express to your friends.
