He never heard of this movie, he saw it on the DVD movie. Great, the perfect example of a movie that took every member of the band to make it work. He did not survive the typical Hollywood movie with the same old over-charged actors. Not current Quote "A" withdrew any show in this movie. Remind me memories of my own military post-war military experience in Vietnam. He focused on people who were sent to battle. As portrayed by characters with fears and emotions, even if some volunteered for service. They were ordinary people, some were simply not cut for military life, I remember some of my experience - to say that they can not adapt to military life - but I will never forget them - they should have stayed in touch I recommend it a lot and then think of those who are serving in Afghanistan today. Basic training is a journey, you notice that drilling sergeants are not people in the morning and may need "HA sensitivity training"! HA! HA!
