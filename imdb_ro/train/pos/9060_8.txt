He saw this at the age of eight. I thought he was cute. I agree with the other poster that it was not something like the book I remember, but we still liked it. All the kids are pretty good and all in all fun. Billy is the new kid who accepts a bold guy from school to eat 10 worms one day. If he loses, he has to go to the hallway with worms in his pants. The beginning of the movie is set to show that Billy has a very weak stomach and knocks on almost anything. Ranging comes with a bunch of different ways to cook worms. Good message about getting up to the thugs and, of course, a happy and happy ending.
