This movie was great, a little scary, but great at it. For those who have heard of columbine and you know the story, it gives you an idea of ​​what and why these children did what they did. Behind your mind you know people are thinking about these things, but you never realize how bad it is and this movie makes you realize. It's so good. It makes you think twice before having some fun for sure. I read a book about the columbine massacre and made me think that this movie makes me worry and scares me to death. On the bottom is like a way to kill someone guy for serial killers. I recently got a threat and exploded without thinking about anything, but after this movie I think you should take everything seriously. Some people are crazy and you never really know what they are, so take it seriously and do not estimate anyone.
