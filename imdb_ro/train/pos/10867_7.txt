I saw in the guide for the movie list for the Santa Barbara Film Festival, where we went when we were at Hollywood, that the movie was screening. In fact, there is a choice for Hong Kong Wo Sing's new president of the Trio Society, so you can imagine how much violence will take place during this period. The fight is between "candidates" Lam Lok (Simon Yam) and Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai) to control the oldest and most powerful parts of the triad of society. He also starred with Louis Koo as Jimmy Lee, Nick Cheung as Jet, Cheung Siu Fai as Mr So, Lam Suet as Big Head and Lam Ka Tung as Kun. There are some realistic real-world real-life themes and moments, just about enough action, unless the cops get involved, but it's a sequel, so it's a pretty useful thriller. Very good!
