Ti% s and As *, a lot of boobies. Some awesome characters, joyful fun and well together put the action of the teenager in this spin of the Amercan Pie franchise. This feels like a very old school. He feels a bit like Porkys for the 2000s. Some funny characters, combined with some humorous situations, make this a real surprise to me. While the original cast is quite different from one, this movie really has fun. Do not feel too excited, you have to take it for the teenage comedy, which is, but for what it is, it excels. The characters are fun and fun, the girls are stronger than hell. Fun and games are hilarious, with some things I've never seen before in comedies, make me eat but laugh at the same time. So, ignore haterii and give it a run and see what you think. Do not expect the classic American song, but you expect something that should make you laugh and draw your attention for about an hour.
