Just like Peckinpah with STRAW DOGS and KUBRICK with ORANGE DE CLOCKWORK, director John Boorman offers an effective film about Man's violent part in DELIVERANCE, a definitive horror movie from the 1970s. Burt Reynolds, Jon Voight, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox portrays four businessmen from Atlanta who decide to make a canoe trip on the wild Cahulawassee in northern Georgia before being stuck in what he calls Reynolds "a great dead lake". <br /> <br /> But the local mountain people take a painfully obvious vision of these "city boys" carousing through their forests. And the next day, going on bad, Beatty and Voight are accused and sexually assaulted (the movie is infamous "SQUEAL!") By two vicious mountain people (Bill McKinney, Herbert "Cowboy" Coward). So what began as a charlat through Appalachians has now turned into a nightmare where our four protagonists come to see the thin line that exists between what we think of as civilization and what we believe to be barbarism. /> <br /> James Dickey adapted the script from his own best-selling book, and the result is often a pungent and disturbing shock. Often known for "SQUEAL!" and the "Dueling Banjos" sequences, DELIVERANCE is also an impulse, with the four best men in their role, and McKinney and Coward are the best of the most scary offenders of all time. You have to watch the movie for those who want to have the chance.
