He has seen this film at IFF Rotterdam. You can question some manufacturer decisions - such as choosing a mockumentary form for such a sensitive and horrible subject - but this movie will surely hit you in the gut. Especially the last scenes were almost painful. I hope that is the distribution they deserve.
