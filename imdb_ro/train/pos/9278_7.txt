In the White Balm and Crimson Gold, the other two films of Jafar Panahi I have seen, the director explores surprising sources of depth to subjects that appear light on the surface. In Offside, Panahi's seriocomial tribute to Iranian women who stand up for their rights, I do not think it's as successful. Not that what he says is not important, of course (and it's too bad that, like any other Panahi movie, the Iranians can not see it). But after a while, the movie feels tardy and feels long for just 90 minutes. I'm not saying I did not like it, though. The actors are all fantastic, and the celebration at the end of the film is infectious. But it is not an important work, in my opinion.
