I did not laugh hard for a movie in a very long time. The garbage that Hollywood has put in lately leads me to a wall! It was freshly defined and full of witchcraft. If you look at the demographics of ratings, only a few women voted! I do not want to destroy the movie for you, but I'm sure every guy who saw this ran to their computers to evaluate it and gave a poor score, why? Because the film puts men in their place, that's why. If more women vote for this movie because of real humor and not because it is harmful to men ... it could easily be a "7" movie!
