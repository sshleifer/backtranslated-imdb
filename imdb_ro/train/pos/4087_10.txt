I have to say, I thought I saw everything. I'm a very bad movie boy. This movie did not shock me by any means. I'm about that time. But it took me to some emotional places I did not know I could go. I had no idea that I could find (ick) the idea of ​​erotic beast. Never ever. Ever. Ever. But you go there. He did. I have to give the director credit. He pulled it out. <br /> <br /> For the first 40 minutes this movie is a TOTAL feature. We start with a very explicit record of two horses that have sex. After five minutes, I started to wonder if the purchase of this movie was not a mistake. Then an old guy in a wheelchair talks to another old guy about two people who get married. Then a nervous man laughs. Then we will see (in short) a hot chicken that does it with a butler (but this is very short). At this moment, I cursed the movie while I was trying to stay awake. Actually, I fell asleep in about 40 minutes and I forced myself to finish it the following night. Finally, we get the good things when a girl (who knows who he is or who is in this movie) has a dream about a Victorian gala being destroyed by a beast in the forest. The scene has been going on for some time and it's really the hen-heh of the whole deal. He is beautifully shot, edited superbly, and delivers the goods. They try to close the plot at the end and make sense, but none of them. Good. I would definitely recommend this movie. The first 40 minutes made me want to shoot (and my TV), but the last 50 minutes I totally redeemed.
