enjoyed film and an effective drama of Confucian crime, the old order survives the threat posed by a greedy young man who undoubtedly represents modern society. I thought the final scenario was weird and could not understand if we thought the great D was punished because he was greedy or was part of the long plan. I liked the scene and for once in a Chinese movie, violence was not a choreographic martial art. What always amuses me about HK movies is that the main influence that the British seem to have is to introduce "yes sir" and "I'm sorry" in the local and funny language that long after I left, I'm still there.
