Man man ... I was silly stupid (not the right term, there is a long list!) To watch this movie and finally had the chance to do so. And "news" are: The extraordinary spectacle of the labyrinth! For any "survivor" of Von Trier: both Rigets, Element of Crime, Dogville, Dancer in the Dark, Five obstacles, etc. perhaps the difference for his magnificence in visual terms. Everything is nicely sleepy and claustrofob! You really have the feeling that you are inside this "imaginary" warp of nightmare. Taking the surrealistic cinema masters like Bunuel, Bergman, to the noir, the films of the 1940s, with avant-garde acid drops Von Trier, lead the art scene as a cinematic "well-intentioned totalitarian" cinematographer today. Its authoritarian way of dealing with very complex problems, without being irrational, strikes the viewer's nerve with the intention of healing some of the deepest wounds we feed in our hypocritical world. As it seems utopian, I think people like Von Trier could help society in many respects in a broader sense. Day movies and directors with this kind of power are no longer needed as a reflection tool, perhaps it may be the beginning of a new era: "The Age of Emotional Control over Our Fears." This is what he constantly offers us through his work over and over. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
