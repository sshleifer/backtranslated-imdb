I first saw this movie about 20 years ago and never forgot. The movie is beautifully shot, and the story keeps an interrupted one all the time. It is hard to believe that this was done in 1946, because the story is still fresh today and really makes you think. I am not very well informed about the film technique, however the special effects in this movie are terribly considered when it was done. In addition, the acting is superb, and the use of English and American actors is quite amazing. I recently bought the DVD, so now I can watch whenever I want. I recommend someone interested in post-war British movies to follow this.
