In any number of films, you can find Nicholas Cage as a powerful, silent hero, Dennis Hopper as a dead maniac, Lara Flynn Boyle as a vamp / tramp, and the late, demented J.T. Walsh as heavy. These are the types of roles that these four can play in their sleep, and they have done so often to see them play again on the edge of the clich√©. So relief, therefore, that John Dahl, a master of getting a lot of mood out of a small action, has directed this noirish thriller tinted. Hopper succeeds not to overtake the tip, Cage showing a lesser depth than the usually shallow action heroes, Boyle is, from time to time, full of feelings, innocent and scheming, and has a feeling of the hard core of the soul that is central to his character, Wayne. Dahl's direction gives a sense of emptiness to the Big Sky shore, where the story goes, but also intimately enough to show how a crooked forehead can indicate a radical change of plot in the store. The overturning of the plot is of paramount importance, and one of the other big crimes in this film is that some of the supporting characters behave as if they had brains. It's not often that minor characters, such as deputy serfs, have more brains than their superiors. But with such a smart director as Dahl, you should not be surprised by the intelligence of anything related to this movie. An excellent movie.
