Of the three remakes of this plot, I like everyone, I have all three on VHS and in addition I have a copy of it on DVD. There are only enough variations in the scenarios to make all three fun and re-watchable. In addition, any other movie has been remade three times in all casts? Of course the main stars in this movie are great, but the supporting actors are also great. He especially likes William Tracy as Pepi. He was such a theft for the scene I've been looking for to find other movies he's in. It has appeared in many, but most are not available. Just like the other comments, I also say - buy it.
