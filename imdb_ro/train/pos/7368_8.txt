I think the team behind this movie did a very good job with the limitations they had. just 300,000 pounds and 7 weeks to write, film and edit the whole thing that I think is an accomplishment itself. although this movie is not for the masses (as a young teenager innocent is killed and there is a homo-eroticism involved in the story) I think this movie is a wandering tragedy heart and the deeper you get involved in the story, the more sadness that feel. more to Heaton because of the love he feels, but he is not returned. this is one of my favorite British movies that I liked very much and I would look again. I think it's a shame that the movie is not very well heard at all.
