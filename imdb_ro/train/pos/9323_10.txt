For me this movie was strong. I do not want to be a spoiler, but I had a friend years ago; I was like the brothers. This film has brought some lively memories. For some reasons, I could not vote for this movie, which would have been 10. I received a message saying "No votes were cast ... And yet I saw in the statistics that they existed. It's been the relationship between the characters who took me in. Beautiful and real situations, I was in some of them, a little jewel of a movie. I'm very glad that such movies are still being done, about the relationships between people, well written, sensitively deployed with action and first-class direction. After all, is not this about it?
