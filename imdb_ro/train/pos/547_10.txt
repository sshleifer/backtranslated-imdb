I do not know if I'm weird, but I enjoyed this movie very much. <br /> <br /> Return to Cabin by the Lake is, of course, continuing with another of my favorite Cabin by Lake movies. In fact, I think I liked this movie even more than the first one. I also thought the distribution in this movie was great, Judd Nelson is always the best! I also liked the plot as a whole. I liked the fact that this second film focused on Stanley Cabin by the Lake's screenplay - it was not Stanley's completely redundant film, shooting other girls and drowning them. - If you are looking for a deep sense, then this movie is probably not the one for you. However, if you are looking for a fun way to spend two hours, then go ahead and watch it. I've probably killed at least ten hours watching this movie. :)
