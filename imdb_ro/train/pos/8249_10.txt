Dear good. This film really shows the talents of the actors. Billy Connelly flexes his muscles by acting. Really an astonishing man, if you look at him in Absolution as a rebel, Boondock Saints as a madman / killer, and then finally into Fido as a zombie! His character in Fido looks from cute to scary, absolutely fabulous! Ann Moss cary is no hack! Jumping in career from Matrix and Momento as a darker character to a heart conservative domestic warming of the 1950s! Rare these days to see the actors being able not to be so tip-castted. Now on the story (no Spoilers, do not worry). This movie would make Max Brooks (author of the Zombie Survival Guide and Z World War) happy with joy! Finally a good twist of zombie and comedy. If you like zombies, if you do not like zombies, if you're just bored, or if you're too busy, go see this movie!
