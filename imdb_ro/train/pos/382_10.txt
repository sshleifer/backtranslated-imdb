One of the best movies ever made! Why only a 7.6 rating is a mystery. This movie is a window in the world of black experience in America. It should be mandatory viewing for all white children and all children over the age of 10. We recommend that you watch it with "The Long Walk Home" as a play. If you think Whoopi Goldberg's work is about "Homer and Eddie" or "Hollywood Squares," think again. Do not miss this movie, which should have won the Oscar. (And read the book!)
