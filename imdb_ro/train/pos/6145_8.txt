Mary Poppins is certainly much better, but this is a great movie, though. Angela Lansbury is splendidly subtle as Engletine Price, and David Tomlinson has a lot of fun like Mr. Brown. Their chemistry was brilliant. The children did not have the same sparkle though Paul is very funny and funny. The songs were not as bad as people say, "Beautiful Briny Sea" is the best, in fact all the songs are remarkable. The special effects were wonderful, they had a lot of magic, and the story is sufficiently original. The major elements, though, like Mary Poppins, were the animated sequences. The underwater sequence was beautiful, but my favorite was the football match, which was absolutely hilarious. The only criticism was that we did not end long enough to see him for the first time. Overall, a great movie that never happens again. 8/10 Bethany Cox
