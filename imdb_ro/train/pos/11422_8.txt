Clacel Denis Chocolat is a wonderful but frustrating movie. The film presents a very interesting look at the homeland of a European colonial family living in Cameroon, giving the viewer an informative insight into the lives of many characters and their interaction. However, the development of these characters is often insufficient. For example, a central theme in the story is the inability of young France to form strong relationships with others. Although this portrait is blatantly executed, especially as Denis fits the story of scenes from the return of France to her childhood home, the lack of intimacy of the face with the other characters of the film makes it difficult for a spectator to invest a great interest in his development or lack thereof) as a protagonist. The general stagnation of film character development makes it difficult to engage in a poorly organized plot. The film raises great tension between the characters, especially between Aimee and the men in his life, but never fully addresses this social friction, leaving the viewer dissatisfied. The last few scenes are powerful but depressing. Denis' work is certainly interesting from an intellectual and historical point of view, but if you are looking for a movie with adventure or drama, Chocolat is certainly not the best choice.
