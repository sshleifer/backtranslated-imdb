With a partial reconstruction and a direct shot, the directors made a formidable documentary about a coup against President Chavez in Venezuela, organized by a foreign secret service and fully supported by the rich Venezuelan minority, the political opposition, the cynical warrior church) and the US government. This was another chapter in the history of US foreign policy, which Steven Kinzer calls "overturn" or "resembles the style of American democracy." In fact, this foreign-backed intervention was not just a coup against President Chavez, but against the democratic majority who chose him. <br /> <br /> This is a brilliant documentary is strongly confirmed by the violent reactions to and against the Internet. As St. Augustine said: "Men love the truth when they beat them in their light, they hate it when it proves them wrong." This film is a must-see for all who want to understand the world we live in.
