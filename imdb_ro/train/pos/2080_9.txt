The quote I used for my summary appears about halfway through the BEST COUNTRY, as the captain of a Chinese Revolutionary Army (played by Philip Ahn), is apologized to a crowd for not having the time to shoot MORE of those who struggles between them, has just been called back to the front lines. Of course, the next character to be found and shot is the main character of the movie, the former O-Lan kitchen slave (whose portrayal Luise Rainer, now 99, won for the second consecutive time the best actress Oscar) The next scene finds that O-Lan carefully cares for her jeweled bag of jeweled husband, farmer Wang Lung (Paul Muni), setting in motion that classical dichotomy of man's financial growth, the mobility being the direct inversion of his moral decline. For a movie that deals with the subject, including slavery, false accusations, misogynism, starvation, home invasion, pet food, mental retardation, infanticide, exploited refugees, riots, civil war, massive street executions, bigami, beatings child, adultery, incest and insect bites of Biblical proportions, BIG SIN is a surprising film of heater of the heart. in the form of another classic quotation, even from O-Lan (while we put a precious soup, her son has just admitted that she stole an old woman back into the cooking utensil after Wang Lung's husband furiously threw him on the dirt floor from the other side of the hut): "Meat is flesh".
