Michael Kallio gives a strong and convincing interpretation of Eric Seaver, a troubled young man who was terribly maltreated as a boy by his abusive, abusive, abusive father, Barry (a truly terrifying portrayal of Gunnar Hansen). Eric has a compassionate fianc√© (sweetly played by the wonderful Tracee Newberry) and a transcript of autopsy reports to a local morgue. Haunted by his gloomy past, lit by baldness, illuminating Jack the demon (a really awesome Michael Robert Brandon), and sent over the edge of his mother's recent death, Eric quits at the end and embarks on a brutal spying killing. Capable of being directed by Kallio (who also wrote a tight script, too) with a uniform action in the form of a sound that has no names (Jeff Steiger is especially good as an angry Angel Michael, Eric's caretaker), cynically, Lieber , true real characters in life, overturning brutal, shocking and fierce violent outbursts, a moody scary, scared by Dan Kolton, a compromise place, endless compromise, terrible locations in Detroit, Michigan, a grave and serious tantalizing narrative which remains on a firm path throughout, this extremely powerful and horror thriller psychological horror makes for often absorbent and disturbing viewing. A real bedroom.
