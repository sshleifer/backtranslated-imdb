Since Siskel's death and Ebert's absence, the show has been left in the useless hands of Richard Roeper. Roeper is not a film critic who just criticizes him for anything he does not like personally, that is, movies with country music because I do not like country music! and children's videos get a standard "Do not see it now, wait until it comes out on DVD and rent it for your kids!" The captain can be an idiot scholar, but in another field. Weekly invitations to Ebert are better, but who wants to choose a daisy in the middle of a cow bed? All he said was the only show in town, and that's just worth watching. As for Roger Ebert, if Stephen Hawking can talk, you can do it! It's our mind and thoughts that we want. Do whatever it takes to get the killer out of his self-declared throne.
