I have to say in spite of Angels' reviews in the movie Outfield was a pretty good movie. I like the fact that she teaches the children to always have faith and never give up because miracles can happen. Unlike other baseball movies, this particular movie was remarkable due to the amazing hits of special effects and the well-orchestrated soundtrack that was very exciting. Although I liked this film they had some flaws, such as some irrelevance (that is, towards the end of the year when Ray Mitchell hits a homer that does not go on the plate and that's why it would not be a score. truly impressed by the presence and the morale of this film: Just have faith, do not give up.
