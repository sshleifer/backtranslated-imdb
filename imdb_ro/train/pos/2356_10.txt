Pushing Daisies was a great show. Like Dead Like Me and Wonderfalls, you can say it was created by Bryan Fuller. I can understand how people who do not really love theater, cinema, musicians and others would be upset. This is not a typical television program, and fantastic is too much for some. These people seem to need a more linear and quieter tone to keep them happy. This program explodes with colors, looks at old movie scenes, humming with incredible music and talented performance. There is nothing random about the choices made from the costume to the leitmotif. The story takes many twists and turns, but they are all very affordable because conversations concern love, honesty, courage, loss and many other things we face every day. The only unfortunate aspect was the end of the show and was rushed because Pushing Daisies was canceled. Do not get close to this as a typical television show. Think of it as one evening at the theater, then stay calm and enjoy yourself!
