This could be the most underestimated film of his genre. I do not remember to see advertisements or advertisements for that, which might be the reason why she did not do so well at the box office. However, Frailty is an excellent and truly original horror movie. It ranks me in the top 10 top horror films on my list. The film starts with snapshots of photos and news articles that tell us about a killer who is called "the hand of God." Then a man enters a police station and tells the chief officer he knows the killer is his brother. Two of them leave together to go to a location where victims are buried that could help resolve the case. During the journey, the man begins to tell about his brother and we turn back when the events started. Fenton and Adam are two young brothers who live with their strict and religious father, who one day claims to have received a divine message from God, asking them to kill demons who seem to be ordinary people. He receives from God a list of names of demons to be destroyed and asks his sons to help him accomplish this divine mission. This is an absolutely awesome movie and suspense that will keep you at the edge of your chair. The tension persists, innocent people (or demons?) Are killed and religious experiences are questioned. There is none, but few very smart twists at the end. If you like this genre, I highly recommend Frailty to you. I own the DVD and it's one of my favorite horror thrillers.
