This movie was great - the emotional power of Tom Hulce and Ray Liotta's shows brought me tears and joy of heart - this film shows that there is still hope in the world. If this movie came out at the end of 1988, instead of Rain Man, Hulce would have been at least nominated for an Oscar for best actor. You must definitely see!
