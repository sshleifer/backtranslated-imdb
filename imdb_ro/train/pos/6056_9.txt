Super Speedway makes a great demonstration of your new DVD / bigscreen / 5.1 channel sound system. The IMAX camera puts you in a racing car, where you navigate around multiple high-speed tracks that recall the Grand Prix driving sequences (if only they would appear on DVD!). I like to see him again and again. The only minus, and why I did not give it a 10, is that some of the leadership sequences were suspicious that the movie was accelerating. The soundtrack also requires a little suspense of unbelief - everything you hear in a real car is the engine. You will not hear the vagabonds when you go under the bridges.
