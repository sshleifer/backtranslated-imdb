... but anyway I liked the show. I read some of the comments that previous reviewers had to say about this show and I have a hard time eliminating the criticism completely in my own head (except one: that the show was outdated, this program was ANYTHING but outdated). A lot of things people are discussing about this show are money: pretentious; forced; blunt; desperate for attention; Complacent; annoying, ever born. But you know what? I really liked it. It was different, it was original, indeed, really TRIED; and that's done for all the minuses. The show was bright, verbal, fast, sorcerer, exciting, fun to watch ... you know, it was only once a week, I could take it once a week and look forward to enjoying it. I'm going to cry my passage. But I think no one will bring this to life.
