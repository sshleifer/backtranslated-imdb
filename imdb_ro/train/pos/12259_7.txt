"A family business" takes us back in a less complicated time in America. It's sobering to see how different it was then. It was a more innocent age in our country, and we look at a "functional" family that deals with things together. The film also marks the beginning of the series with the Hardy family. The film, directed by George Seitz, is based on a successful piece. Judge James Hardy and his wife Emmily face an internal crisis that needs to be resolved. The married daughter Joan returns home after committing a social mistake and her husband is held responsible. At the same time, another daughter, Marion, brings home a drink that will collide with her father. Happy Andy Adolescent seems to be the only one without trouble until his mother makes him escort Polly to dance, which he does not want to do. Hardly Judge Hardy will prove why he knows best as he puts a plan in action to bring everyone together again. After all, he is a man who understands not only the law, but how to deal with those external forces that threaten his position in the community and what will make his family happy. Lionel Barrymore plays the role of Judge Hardy with conviction. He is the adhesive that keeps everything together. Spring Byington is seen as Emily, Mom. Mickey Rooney has a small part in this movie, but it's always fun to watch. Cecilia Parker and Julie Haydon appeared as daughters, Marion and Joan. Sara Hayden and Margaret Marquis are also featured in the film as Aunt Milly and Polly, the girl who surprises Andy with her beauty. "A Affair Family" is a good way to see our past through a positive image painted by an American family.
