Overall, the movie is OK. I think it's better than Sepet and much better than Gubra in terms of his story, his sentimental value. There are some scenes that make me touch me. Yes, I agree that the boy (Mukhsin) did very well his action. Brilliant. I can say that his action is almost natural. However, Nina Simone's song "Ne Me Quitte Pas" is really "menaikkan" my "bulu" 'roma. "I love the song Both songs" Ne Me Quitte Pas " and "Hujan." I just downloaded the song, "Beautiful," and Yasmin greets me, "The final credit of the movie makes me touched again." We can see Yasmin truly appreciating her parents in a unique way. of the international jury at the Berlin Film Festival.
