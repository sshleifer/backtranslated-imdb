Al's alcoholic drummer Keith Moon's father was named Arthur. We found so many similarities between Dudley Moore and Keith Moon in this film. Liza Minelli, who usually OVERACTS, has done a pretty good job in this area and managed to turn Dudley Moore's face to every step. Yes, I agree, Sir John stole absolutely every scene. It was a very "different" film, allowing the spectator to look at another life. We often try to catch a resumption of this film on satellite. God rests Dudley Moore; it was such a nice movie. A lot of satire and fingers to the rich and snobs / rich. The close friendship between Moore and Sir John is pretty bold.
