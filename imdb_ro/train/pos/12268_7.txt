Seven young men go to the woods looking for a bear. Now everyone is watched and killed by a crazy veteran of Vietnam. "Infernal Tramp" is a very entertaining Mexican fun that reminds me of the "Zero Boys" very much. with fast rhythms and there are some good death scenes such as the cut neck or the ax in the neck. Unfortunately, there is not much gore, so fans of grand-guignol will be disappointed. However, if you are a fan of movies with slasher give this rarity an aspect. The horror movements in Mexico are quite obscure (I just saw "Alucarda" and "Do not Panic"), so this should be another reason to see this slasher pleasing. My Rating: 7 out of 10.Highly recommended.
