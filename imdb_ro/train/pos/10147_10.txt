Does anyone know the exact quote about "time and love" by George Ede, did Father Fitzpatrick fall, should you be? Was she talking to Charlie and Annna in the church while they were leaving? If not, I'll have to rent the movie. It was a great movie. I also loved Serendipity! The Great Love Story for the Soul! <br /> <br /> I met a real love (my Soulmate) and although I had the experience of meeting him when I was expecting him at least, I was not ready for this type of emotional relationship. <br /> <br /> Other, we're married, I was not mature enough to give as much as I thought. I fell in love and took my love and resisted for 7 years. Eventually he left with resentment, but we are still injured and angry and disbelieving in the way it turned out. I had some very difficult lessons to learn and now I've been out for 3 years. This movie was a lot because I still await reconciliation with my only true love. I can now appreciate that distinct feeling inside of me and the quote from Father Fitzpatrick was true to me. I know when he cured enough to trust me, we will remarry. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> It was the best lesson in my life. <br /> <br /> Also, the music in this movie is EXCELLENT and MINIMUM! This film is DEEP and spiritual uplifting. TRUE LOVE is worth waiting, if it is to be, it will be no matter what, it will happen! Nothing is impossible, even when it's the second time around! Thanks!
