Normally, the best way to mourn me in a movie is to include a reference to Orson Welles. But here is a sci-fi comedy that cites the World War II show ... and it's gold! The simple concept of a small bouquet of diminutive, aggressive and stupid aliens being misleading as the children in the Halloween dress is magnificent. Do not be fooled by the idea that because it looks like a movie for children is unsophisticated - it is not, there are a lot of hidden treasures ... A jewel!
