If you've never seen this movie and you like veteran time actors, this is the movie for you. Seeing Frank Sinatra when he was very young and extremely thin, licked in his cheeks and a wonderful voice that sang old old songs. Michele Morgan, (Millie Pico) gave remarkable performance with numerous dances and musical numbers. Leon Errol (Cyrus Drake) played an important role in supporting Victor Borge (Sir Victor Fitzroy Victor), who played the classic piano and had no slap-like comedy in his career. This is not a great music, but Frank Sinatra was a great joy to see at the beginning of his career in the 1940s.
