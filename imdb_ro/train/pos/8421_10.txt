Josef von Sternberg leads this silent film about silent Hollywood and the former imperial general for the Russian Tsar who was there. Emil Jannings earned a well-deserved Oscar, in part, for his role as a general, which is ironically expressed in a small part in a silent image as a general of Russia. The film is back in his days in Russia, leading to the country's fall to the revolutionaries. William Powell makes his screen debut as a Hollywood director, who casts Jannings in his film. The film serves as an interesting sight to Russia's fall and an imitation of the scenes behind the Tinseltown scene in the early days. Von Sternberg offers yet another classic and one full of elements of great love, intrigue and tragedy.
