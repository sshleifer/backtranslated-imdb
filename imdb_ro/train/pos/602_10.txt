I never danced flamenco before, but in a way I feel like this movie was perfect. The colors, how blatant were the dances, the Gypsies, and the rivals who did it together made a movie that seemed to end too soon. I have seen other movies by Carlos Saura and I agree that this movie may be the best production. I think the best features of his previous films have been put together and aligned to make Iberia. I appreciate the use of mirrors in the disclosure of the activity behind the cameras. While watching this movie, I felt like sitting in a small Madrid restaurant, looking comfortably at the dancers, on a wooden sheet, on a delicious fruit cocktail. For me, this movie fits like a glove. I do not know how I can get a copy of this movie in the US over the next few years. I recommend this film to anyone who is attracted to the livelihood of other cultures. It's safe to say that this movie is definitely on my favorite list.
