Tom cat, Jerry mouse and Spike Dog (named here Butch, his third name, the second being Killer), decide to sign a peace treaty to love all. It's weird and a little unnatural to see all of the friends like this, and their boyfriend seems to think about it too. But eventually, due to a disagreement over a steak, everything returns to normal and everything should be so. This short is the second of the three on the new Spotlight DVD to be edited and I have no idea why it was. This cartoon can be found on the disk in the Spotlight DVD collection of "Tom & Jerry" My class: B
