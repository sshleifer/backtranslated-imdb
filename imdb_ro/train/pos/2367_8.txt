I could not take my eyes off this movie when it came out on the cable. Dialogue and costumes are of a very easy quality associated with soft pornography. In this case, useful ground serves as a vehicle not for sex, but for serial thrashings with nunchuks. (Maybe for sex, but not for Indian television anyway). Without being a fan of the genre, I could not place Jeff Wincott and there was no place to look for. Only once when Brigitte Nielsen traded in her futurist coat (so the mayor!) For the top spot that we remember in Beverly Hills Cop II, we made a positive ID on it. I doubt any admirer of the 90s couture or sketch at the end of Paul Verhoeven. Can we add a "so-bad-is-good" gender label?
