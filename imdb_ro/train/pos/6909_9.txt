... and if you are very, very good, it will resemble Moon Over Parador. This movie had a little foolish story, but it was still a fantasy, and casting and act was absolutely right! Dreyfuss was perfect as an actor / impostor, full of all the wives and vanities you imagine the actors to have. You've seen what actors are behind the scenes. This was one of Dreyfuss's best roles, just like his character, the best role played by the dead dictator! And the scene of the party: like something in Casablanca, indeed! <br /> <br /> Raul Julia was great as Paradoran secret police chief. It has some funny lines, some of which are being celebrated in other movies, such as "Spur ordinary suspects!" <br /> <br /> And Sonia Braga was great as a girl friend - besides being a very hot number: "You should get an Oscar for tonight!" <br /> <br /> Let's not forget that Johnny Winters is the CIA agent and some of the stars are playing: Sammy Davis Jr., Ike Pappas, Dick Cavett - all perfectly accomplished. <br /> <br /> As a whole, a memorable story under the Paradorian Moon. <br /> <br />
