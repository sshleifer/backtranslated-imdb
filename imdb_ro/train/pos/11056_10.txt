Monty Berman and Dennis Spooner followed The Baron with a series of fantasies about three superhuman spies who preyed The Six Million Dollar Man. He was a favorite of me when I was a young man and I like to see him yet. Stuart Damon and William Gaunt had unmistakable chemistry on the screen, such as Craig Stirling and Richard Barrett, while Alexandra Bastedo, full of love, ended the role of Sharron Macready. The last Anthony Nicholls made a tremayne awesome. By far, the best episodes were those written by Tony Williamson, Terry Nation and Brian Clemens, while Spooner's own "Interrogation" was compared favorably with the "Prisoner". I regret that there has never been a second series; the concept has left so much life in it. Craig and Richard were competing for Sharron's affections? If Tremayne had learned about the powers of the champions? Do the champions have other abilities than the ones I've seen? I have never found out, unfortunately.
