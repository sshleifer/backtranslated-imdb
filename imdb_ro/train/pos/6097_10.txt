I do not see how you can say that Freddy's nightmares are a feast and a rupture. Obviously, you do not know a good TV when you see it. Episodes are full of drama and blood. Freddy is creative in the way he kills people. I like Freddy's nightmares and I hope to get all the 44 episodes on DVD. The best episodes are: Saturday Night Special, School Daze and Love Stinks. If you think this series sucks, then you are entitled to your opinion, but remember that it is just your opinion and does not mean anything. Freddy's nightmares will always be one of the best series ever and you'll get to accept that pretty soon. If you do not like it, then you do not look at it, but it does not deny its shine.
