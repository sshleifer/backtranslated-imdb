"Jake Speed" is a great movie with a wonderful message. Of course he has his own faults. Sometimes it's a little sluggish. She introduces his character too much into the story. The action is stimulated at the pace of the heartbeat of a snail. It has a Z distribution (although I have always admired the work of Karen Kopins, which has the look of Sandra Bullock). Yet, by running against her, Jake Speed ​​is really inspired, thanks to the charming script of Wayne Crawford (who plays the lead role) and Andrew Lane. Why does it seem so inspired to me? Because he says to me "Hey, why not try to be a good person." The story is, in essence, a premise "strange in a strange country", that is, good and heroic. Jake Speed ​​is placed in the real world where bad things happen with good people. Jake is more than a scout. He's more than a knight in shining armor. Jake Speed ​​is the patron saint of optimism in a dirty, mean and evil world. For this reason, "Jake Speed" was supposed to be a real blow. He has a wonderful message that should have come to Hollywood and then to the rest of the world. Imagine a cinematic industry that really pushed you to describe good and decent people. I'm not saying we should look at Waltons in every theater at cineplex, but it would be nice if more movies, like Jake Speed, had a chance. ("Due South", a TV show about a Canadian mountain, is a good comparison of what can be done to illuminate American entertainment.) Of course, "Jake Speed" has violence, blood and weapons, but the overall message is that if you are trying hard enough to be a good person, you will beat the forces of evil every time. 10/14/99
