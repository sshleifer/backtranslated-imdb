It's not my favorite WIP ("Women in Prison"), but it's one of the most popular sub-genres. It was produced by Roger Corman, who has already produced several WIPs. It is obvious that the film is trying to play with the set formula. The film takes place in a US prison, not in a "banana republic" like most WIP films. I'm not sure if it was a wise move, but it's an acceptable change of pace. Writer-director Demme really gets into his job, always digging new ways to present a familiar script. In fact, he is a bit too ambitious for his good. The developer creates some surrealist dream sequences that are demanding at the limit, but it's fun to see how hard he is trying to put this film over the medium chain chicken. But do not worry, Demme still works in sub-gender parameters. There is a lot of nudity and violence, which will satisfy hardcore fans. The movie is a little slow, but it's really fun. The distribution is good. Roberta Collins is a WIP veteran, so he does not need an introduction, and Barbara Steel is a crazy guy as a wheelchair guy. Pam Grier is missed, though.
