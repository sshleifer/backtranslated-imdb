I thought this movie was amazing, with remarkable performances by Valentina Cervi (Artemisia Gentileschi). Cervi portrays Artemisia so beautiful, in a tentative manner and confident, her hands mapping an idea before moving her models instead. The passion that Artemisia attaches to his art is just spectacular to follow. Although not every character was beautiful, this movie became more realistic because the hair and the facial dress were perfect for that moment in time. Overall, I thought this movie was fantastic.
