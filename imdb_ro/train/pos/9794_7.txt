I thought the movie could be a bit more complex, probably in a psychological sense, but the action and the voice that acted were top. The animation was heavy CG in many scenarios, but very good at it. This is one of the Batman Returns / Forever movies, which includes romanticism, Wayne's conflicts and the reasons for meetings. 007 fans would like this, and just like females, great theme song! Wayne was portrayed very well in this film, and Penquin returned to his true form without mutating genes in him this time! I liked the fact that Robin was not used too much, Tim Drake was just a good computer boy, somewhat an indigo or mind of the future. The support gallery was made up of a series of telenovela stars, decent talents and the characters were drawn to look like the actors of the voice. Kelly Ripa was hilarious in this movie. I rate this below Phantasm, Return of the Joker and Batman vs. Dracula, but I liked the script smarter better than I liked Subzero. 7/10
