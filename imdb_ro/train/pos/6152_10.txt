Fantastic, fantastic, probably Disney's best musical adventure. I've loved this movie for over 35 years because it's so imaginative, smart and fun. Even in spite of the stupid scenes of "flying bed," the other scenes and dialogues are magical and fun. Could she choose someone better than Angela Lansbury to play Eglantine? I can not think of someone more suitable for the role. The remake of this classic would be as bad as the remodeling of Mary Poppins. David Tomlinson, though having some quality roles, is absolutely shining in this adventure. He was a comic genius, who is often forgotten today. Blustering, the primary and the good English - no one could really make the hammer and shoot him as gracefully as he did. It would be tragic to remake this movie because Tomlinson had died for a few years and nobody could walk into his shoes and make himself a judge. Night dances and armor have a magical aura about her other witch movies just do not capture. I am especially glad of the parts where the Germans invade Eglantine's house and she has to defend her in any way maybe. Bobbing along the coast, along the wonderful coast of the sea. Richard and Robert Sherman broke up with the musical numbers. All this is fantastic and it is worth remembering, Portobello Road being one of my favorites. A wonderful movie that still holds today!
