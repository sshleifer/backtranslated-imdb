Good story. Good script. Good casting. Good action. Good direction. Good direction of art. Good picture. Good sound. Good editing. Everything good. Put it all together and get to the fun. The shame is that there are not enough films of this caliber made these days. We may find it lucky that writers / directors like John Hughes can occasionally make their creative voice. Whenever I see that I watch a movie for the third or fourth time and still find it satisfactorily satisfactory, I have to conclude that something about this movie is right.
