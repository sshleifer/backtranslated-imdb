It's a little easier. It's about that. The graphics are clean and realistic, except that some of the fences are 2d, but that's forgiving. The rest of the graphics are cleaner than GoldenEye and many other N64 games. The sounds are magnificent. Everything from talking to SFX is enjoyable and realistic. The angle of the room is sometimes frustrating, but it is the same for any platform game like Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64. <br /> <br /> We received this game as a Christmas gift in 1997, and since then typically obtained 120 stars over 10 times.
