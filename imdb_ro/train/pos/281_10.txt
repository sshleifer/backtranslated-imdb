This game was really a great challenge. It has an extraordinary line of stories, and graphics are also very good. I would recommend this game to all Horror fans and it collapses greatly from start to finish. The only problem with this game is that I would like more weapons, but that's just me. A truly awesome game for RPG and Shoot'em'up fans. <br /> <br />
