I'll walk out and defend Shades of Gray as a good clip-on episode that went into the battle of the life and death of Commander William Thomas Riker, who was struggling with a deadly terminal disease. > <br /> <br /> The scenes from the retrospective sequences have been implemented quite well with Riker's mood when he resumed romantic episodes such as "11001001", "Angel One" and "Up the Ladder". Tragic moments such as Tasha's death in "Skin of Evil," as well as elements of the danger of the pulse in "The Heart of Glory," "Conspiracy," and "Skin of Evil." Riker also showed the courage under fire, saying humorous jokes such as: "An ancestor of mine was bitten by a rattlen once ... after three days of intense pain, the serpent died." This episode highlighted Will Riker's psychological slander under extreme pressure. And, YES, I am biased in my opinion, proclaiming "Grays of Gray" as a solid episode, because during my original broadcast my face was sweat-covered, wondering if Riker had withdrawn from life or not see extra extraordinary, galactic adventures, outerspace beyond the final boundary ... Of course, in the years to come, it seems to me that I have formed a single opinion about this episode ... but if a prize should go for "the best episode of clip-show in the history of television, "then I think this episode should be highly appreciated in this respect.
