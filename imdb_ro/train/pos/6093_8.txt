I just saw this movie at a preview of sneak and all I can say is ... "What did I see?" And I mean in a good and bad way. The land is very simple. Stiller and Black play friends / neighbors. Stiller is the focused one, while Black is a dreamer. Black invented this idea to create a spray that wipes poo. The idea becomes very popular, and black becomes very rich. The extravagant lifestyle that Black earns and the fact that he is still trying to make his best friends with Stiller makes Stiller become envious of envy. As I said, the plot is simple. Everything is simply weird. The direction is strange, with a strange chance of rotation in urgent sequences. Dialogue and acting are very strange; strange in a strange way. And the soundtrack is the oddest thing in the movie, from the weird song "Envy" that continues to re-appear at the scene where you think you will hear a classic 80-year-old song but suddenly it's in Japanese. <br /> <br /> So the real question is this ... is it funny funny? That depends only on the individual. I did the strange shear of the movie. After watching, I heard people call her terribly unpleasant and happy that she was free. I really understood my point. There are no jokes, so if you are not attracted to the uniqueness of everyone, you will hate this movie. I absolutely hate this movie. This movie is meant to lose a lot of money at the box office and become a classic DVD cult. If you can laugh at a movie without real jokes, such as Cable Guy or Punch Drunk Love, then I suggest you see it. If not, run away from this movie. It'll just make you angry.
