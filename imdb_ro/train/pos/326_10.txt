"Jag är nyfiken" Yellow is a lot of fun. Like at least one other commentator, I was, many times, laughing loudly. Yellow is energetic, playful, self-conscious, exploratory. Do not expect Bergman here. This film is about a young man from the early 1960s to the mid-60s in Sweden and about the problems, the reading of the * contradictions * that the nation and the world had to do. Sometimes Yellow seems to be a serious social-political documentary, with Lena, the main character, and others interviewing both ordinary people and politicians (for example, Olaf Palme at home). Sometimes, Yellow seems to parody this kind of documentary. All this time, Yellow acts as a personal documentary exploring Lena's life - her home life, her love, her political views, her vision of her. Is she a complete person? complex, defective, contradictory, happy, sad, curious. And placed above all this is the wonderful extra dimension of the director, Sjöman, and his crew documented documenting Lena. This is, for me, really gives yellow wings. Not only do they appear suddenly in fun and funny times, reminding the viewer that this is fiction and artifice, but their presence is another layer of the film; they are filming themselves. Do I remember a Bjork music video of the same quality? a video about making a music video, ad infinitum, each iteration becoming stranger and more animated. I think Sjöman had something in mind. While "Jag är nyfiken Yellow" may not be the whole cup of tea, it is certainly intelligent, intelligent, refreshing, ebullient and authentic.
