Most people miss the Hollywood idea. If a hero can stimulate heroic deeds in a child's mind, within the limits of the law, then I accept the approval of the lessons learned by Doc Savage. At any time of conflict or war, the public and the government are looking for heroes to decorate. The cinema industry brings screen heroes to identify people - such as Doc Savage, James Bond, Superman, Batman, Spiderman and others. Doc Savage is remembered by more than one generation as "the best of the best" before James Bond, Superman or any other. All the others who follow Doc Savage are just part of the character, not the "Man of the Bronze."
