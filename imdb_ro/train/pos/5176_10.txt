You have to watch the movie for anyone who ever went to the camp or wanted to. This film captures the absolute essence of the summer camp. It's funny, it's full of compassion makes you want to look more about the characters once the credits start playing the role. If you have not seen this movie ... what are you doing? Get out of your head and run the video store. Have a nice summer :)
