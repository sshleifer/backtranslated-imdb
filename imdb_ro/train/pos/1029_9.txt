I would have rated the perfect 10 series for a remarkable and consistent high-quality story and character development if it had not been for the last episode of Season 10! <br /> <br /> The final episode of the 10th Infinity Season, where (surely) the Asgard was killed in a very urgent, unconvincing and very incessant manner, left me incredulous! <br /> <br /> From the extremely hurried end of the series, it is obvious that many of the story springs were originally scheduled to appear in at least another season. I think they quickly accelerated these stories to position the Stargate SG-1 franchise for the two direct DVD moves! If Asgard does not return to a future SG-1 movie (with a very good explanation of the "apparent" disappearance), I think fans have been deceived by inadequate cleaning of weak terminals! The weak end of a sci-fi series, otherwise bright.
