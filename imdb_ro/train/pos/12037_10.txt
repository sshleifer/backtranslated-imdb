The Black Woman was a British movie made for television, which was first broadcast on the BBC on Christmave Eve in '89, and again in '92. I think he made a US television round on A & E. He was released on VHS in the UK in the early 1990s, but he got out of print. A U.S. company released it on DVD later, but that version also sold it. According to the author's website, film rights are currently owned by somebody else and will not be released anymore, and unofficial healing is being sold on eBay. <br /> <br /> I first heard about this movie just recently on a message and I had to check it out. I found a copy on ebay for about $ 28. It's safe to be a counterfeit from a Far East seller, even if the DVD says "made in Canada," ha ha. But it is a good copy and you can not really blame the bootleg tags to release rare things without printing and lost in legal disputes. I like the movie. It's a timepiece set in the 1920s, with all the very authentic and strange settings of those British times. The black woman is very atmospheric and dark. For the most part, the film is very low, but effective and frightening. There is no gore of self-indulgence, violence, or not at all in special effects, but The Woman In Black is still capable of creating absolutely frozen moments. It's a fantasy ghost movie. The film itself looks as if it could have been made in the 1930s, except for color. Without all the flash of all modern horror movies, I'm afraid this movie will always be just a lost gem. For me, he places himself as one of my favorites.
