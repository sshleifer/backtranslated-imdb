I remember seeing the movie as a child in 1977 or 1978. HBO would look late at night when there was one channel of existing movie payments. At that time, he was NELAT and was the only film of his kind ever shown on pay-TV ... especially then. I would love to see her now as an adult where I would better understand the adult theme. It was probably the closest thing I've ever seen in pornography at the age of 7 or 8. Luckily, we had the dumb carers and the parents spent on the weekend. Most of my memory of this movie was the completely erratic sexual behavior of these two guys. Breaking into the houses to pull out lingerie, feeding on a stranger's breast milk on a public bus and drinking in a taxi at the request of one of their female subjects, there were only a few of the escapades these guys gave . A very racist film for the early 1970s. Until we checked IMDb, I had no idea this movie had such a result. Most people I'm talking about have never heard of it.
