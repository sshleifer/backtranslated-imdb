Domestic import was a great movie. I laughed all the time. It was fun on so many levels, ranging from insanity to hilarious situations. The act was great. Alla Korot, Larry Dorf, Howard Hesseman and everyone else did a great job. Because it is an independent movie written by a writer for the first time, it does not have the cliches that are expected by other comedies, which was such a relief. It was unique and interesting, and you are in love with the characters and the story of the warmth of the heart. Did I hear it was based on a true story? If so, then it is hilarious (and amazing!). I recommend this film.
