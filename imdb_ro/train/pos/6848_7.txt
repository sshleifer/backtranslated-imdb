A very foolish movie, starts with a soft pornographic sequence, ventures into the farce comedy in the art gallery, adds a breakthrough to the hotel room, then introduces a random crime for no obvious reason. The next thing is bizarre and surreal (in particular, the scene of the timer is extremely useless), culminating in a revealing "twist" end that is as obvious as unfair to the viewer (see the trivia section of the due to the fact that it is deliberately unfair). <The film goes out of its way to be as offensive as possible for many groups - transsexuals, madmen, and the wonderful "Huggie Bear" racial stereotypes on the subway - and condescendingly treats the viewer as an idiot in closing scenes, while the characters are explained without interruption to each other in detail and again and again what happened in the film. Although the female backgrounds of the restaurant scene at the end of the year are a joy to watch. In fact, the whole movie is a joy to watch: despite its many flaws, the whole package, well, works.
