According to the director, this film was popular in Asia. It is somewhat difficult to take seriously these Mats Helge movies because most of his films are shot in a very tight budget. Almost no dollar at all. But it is fascinating to find out that Mats Helge eventually finishes something that can be called a action movie. Ninja's mission is - I think - the best of all the movies directed by him. Some special effects are quite pleasant. This is not a "B" or "C" movie. It's a "Z" movie - but a nice and fun "Z" movie!
