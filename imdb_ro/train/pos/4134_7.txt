Laurence Olivier, Merle Oberon, Ralph Richardson and Binnie Barnes play in "Divorce Lady X", a comedy from 1938 based on a play. Olivier plays a young barrister, Everard Logan, who allows Oberon to spend the night in his hotel room when the mist in London is too dense for guests to wear a costume ball to go home. The next day, a friend of his, Lord Mere (Richardson), announces that his wife (Barnes) spent the night with another man at the same hotel and wants to divorce her. Believing that the woman is Oberon, Olivier is panic. Oberon, who is unique and the granddaughter of a judge, claims she is the lady in question, Lady Mere, when she is really Leslie Steele. I have seen this plot or variations of it for dozens of times. With this cast, it's delightful. I mean, Richardson and Olivier? Olivier and Oberon, that awesome team in Wuthering Heights? Quite special. Olivier is devastatingly beautiful and does a great job in comedy, while portraying his nervous, nervous lawyer. Oberon gives the role a slight touch. She looks extremely young here, more full in front, with Jean Harlow's eyebrows and a very different hairstyle for her. She wears some beautiful street clothes, though her first dress looks like a birthday cake, and in a dress she tries with that hairstyle, she's ready to play Snow White. Binnie Barnes is delightful like the real Lady Mere. The color of this is a mess, and, as others have said, could really use a restoration. It is definitely worth seeing.
