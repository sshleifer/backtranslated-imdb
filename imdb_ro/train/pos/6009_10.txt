Mark Frechette plays Mark, a radical radical left. Mark is accused of killing a cop during a camp revolt, and he runs all the way to the desert. He does this by taking a small plane to the local airport and flying himself. <br /> <br /> Once you fly over the desert, Mark marks a car in the air. A young woman named Daria comes out and sees Mark strolling on the plane. Mark marks the plane very low several times, causing Daria to wander or be hit. When he arrives, he gets acquainted with Daria, who is strangely enchanted by Mark's aerial altitudes. <br /> <br /> After having spent hours full of soulful conversation, Mark and Daria are stripped and loved in the sand. But when Mark avoids the law, he realizes he must continue to run. Consequently, Mark and Daria's concert is quite painful, because he does not develop into a love-filled story. Zabriski Point was the Eraserhead in the early 70's. Both films are vague, vague, along with complicated meanings and characters. Frechette was just as reckless in person as his character was in this movie. Several years after Zabriski Point made Frechette robbing a bench in real life. During the execution of the prison sentence, Mark died in terrible death. He was killed with a weight of 150 kilograms, which fell on him when he was weightlifter. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie was splendid cinema and special visual effects. The incredible and slow scenes of debris floating in the air after an explosion were a genius accident. Although it was not a movie as simple as an Easy Rider, Zabriski Point still resonates with the contractile of the 1970s. I recommend it to those who like the avant-garde films that show disorderly youth revolt in the early 1970s.
