I have a second move to do this in a movie, it would be great! I was also amazed by the story and the character built in this game. I played it again and again (over 20 times) just to try something different and it gets more interesting every time. Final Fantasy Eats Your Heart! THIS should be done in a movie !!!!! If someone there wants help to start a petition to do it in a movie, please contact me. I'd love to help with this project any day. The graphics are excellent for PS1 and even make you forget that it's PS1 most of the time. The multitude of side quests make it different every time you play.
