It was an extremely good historical drama. John Turturro is excellent as the tortured genius Luzhin and shines brightly with the maniacal attributes of the character, such as his strange dance. Emily Watson is doing well in her role as a Natalia sense lover. The relationship between chess and madness is well explored by Gorris and Nabokov's familiar concerns, such as "eternal innocence" (that is, "Lolita"), are evident in this film. I think I will continue to read the novel now. It was a nice and tragic end and it was hard to keep the eye dry. Brilliant film!
