Ruth Gordon is one of the most aggressive criminals Columbo has ever had to do. And, the plot is clever all the way. This is one of the best Columbo episodes ever. Mariette Hartley and G.D. Spradlin are excellent in their supporting roles. And Peter Falk offers a little more in his scenes with Gordon.
