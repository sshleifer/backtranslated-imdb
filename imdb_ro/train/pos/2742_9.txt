Richard Brooks The excellent 1967 film of Truman Capote's novel in "COLD BLOOD" is a perfect piece of performance with the Oscar winning performance of Philip Seymour Hoffman in the 2005 CAPOTE. They even play well together (try on separate nights). It's unusual to find 38-year-old films that fit so well. These two really improve each other. Even though different actors play the roles of criminals Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, the two tracks mix well. Only the part of the writer (interpreted by Paul Stewart) in the Brooks movies is weaker, because I give him a different name from Capote. I would suggest to see CAPOTE first, followed by COLD SUN. It makes for a strong experience!
