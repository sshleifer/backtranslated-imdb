This was Panahi's first film that I saw and saw at the Melbourne film festival. I have been completely absorbed by the different characters they create and how differently they react and behave in comparison with Aussie children and yet on other similar levels. I think that if more people could see movies like this, they could see people as individuals and avoid racism that can often be fueled by fear of the unknown. There are obvious differences between the Oz culture and the Iranian culture, but we find the more subtle differences between the characters, that this movie performs successfully on the screen, extremely fascinating. There are idiosyncrasies in the characters I find so unique. I found that the characters made the convincing viewing.
