Yes, I will say before I start commenting, this movie is incredibly undervalued. Sharon Stone is great in her role as Catherine Trammell as Morrissey as Dr Glass. He is an analyst sent to evaluate it after the death of a sports star. Glass is attracted to a seductive game that Trammel uses to manipulate his mind. The act was good (except Thewlis) Stone really has a talent with this role. She is slick, naughty and seductive and does not look older one day than she did in the first. He really impressed me (as in the Casino). Morrisey was also good. He showed a lot of vagabondity in a role he needed. Thewlis, however, was blades. He ruined his character and was all over. He really breathed. Overall, this movie is not as good first, but Stone is a hoot to watch. Just ignore Thewlis.
