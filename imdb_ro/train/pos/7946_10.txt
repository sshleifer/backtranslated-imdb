This movie is a true masterpiece, it is indeed. It's rare to see such a heart full of fun, laughter, pain, and a little drama that keeps you on your toes. A true family film, Homeward Bound, tells the story of three domestic animals that strive to cross the Rocky Mountains in an attempt to find their owners as a result of the changes they make and the obstacles they face along the way. One of the really amazing things about this movie is its ability to give human beings personalities - the voice acting is so good. Shadow is a wonderful, old, wise and courageous character, and seeing that trying to save Sassy in the river was a very moving moment. Chance - who would not love a dog like Chance? It must be the worst and loving chicken ever shown on the big screen. And Sassy is very full of witchcraft for a cat - he had me in the stitches when he played the goalie; - Here's a kitten kitten ... not your life, you bastard. <br /> <br /> There have also been a lot of well-made emotional scenes such as Sassy going over the waterfall (I was really scared for her), The shadow that falls into the trench (almost in tears) and then the fantastic end, when all three pets are back home ... including old good shadow! <br /> <br /> A favorite forever - anyone who does not like this movie should not like animals. Hire it or buy it now and leave you with happy memories that will last a lifetime.
