This movie is not great, but it's a good and enjoyable one. It feels like an indie film made out of a game scenario. Morgan Freeman is playing, though the director swears the script has not been written for him. And there's a little irony about the actor who goes to a supermarket to do research for a movie he has not yet hired. I mean, he finally made the movie and we see him :) I found the dialogue a bit too positive for my taste, but refreshing though. This is a movie that inspires the viewer to look at his own life and choose the direction in which to walk. A little too much emphasis on appearance if you ask me. The Bottom Line: A small, two-week film with two actors and a few extra, dialogues, makes Morgan Freeman good :)
