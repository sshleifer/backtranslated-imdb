I've seen this movie several times. It was on par with many scary things that were featured in the television movies ever since. The only problem I had was with the title for obvious reasons ... One immediately thinks about the famous Drake's cake! Leaving the first part, "Hound of Hell" would have been enough. Richard Crenna always succeeds in bringing a sense of seriousness to everything he does, anyway - if the intrigue is good or bad. But this was a nice Halloween rate offered by the CBS network. I liked the part where Crenna goes to an obscure country to find the mystic to help him conquer the evil beast. She asks the cab driver how to find this guy. The excellent dialogue between the driver of the native cabin and Crenna regarding the taxi to reveal his ethnic beliefs. "Aw, Mr. Barry, we left this thing down when we got out of the mountains ..." - referring to the mystic who seldom sees or advices people and no one knows how to really contact him. <br /> <br /> As far as the supernatural tariff is concerned, this movie is still enjoyable.
