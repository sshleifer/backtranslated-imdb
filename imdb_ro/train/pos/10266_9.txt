The gaming house has a strong story in which obsession and illusion play an important role. A psychologist offers to help a patient with gambling debts and is caught in the game. Have you ever felt the fascination for something both dangerous and wrong? Watch what happens if you follow this desire and you will go all the way. Stay on the edge of the chair, the traitors pull and the victims become perpetrators. You're never sure who is exactly who in this movie. This is a quality and a disadvantage of the scenario. As the movie ends, you feel the story is not consistency. But all of this is largely offset by excellent psychological development. This is certainly one of the best gambling movies.
