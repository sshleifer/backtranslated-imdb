I do not think I need to tell you the story. Because it has been said for years and years. So I will share my feelings. I first saw the Cinderella when I was five years old. Since then I have been a Disney child in a good way. The animation looks now childish and old-fashioned, but that's part of her charm now. Now, in the age of high school music and computer-generated images, people seem to have forgotten the genius and magical essence of Disney's early movies. Luckily I was born before that, so I was introduced to this classic. And it seems that, no matter what age I am, I'm back at that age of five, watching the VHS. What is Disney's true magic?
