"The Ladies Man" suffers a common problem among Saturday Night Live-based movies. And that is, a sketch that usually succeeds in five minutes will not do so well in ninety minutes. Although this film laughs like Tim Meadows as Leon Phelps, a direct sex maniac from the 1970s, and Will Ferrell as a obsessed wife fighting Leon. So this movie is pretty funny, but it's not "Wayne's World"!
