Surprisingly good. The actor was fun, the script was fun, the music was fun cheesy, the intrigue was fun. It was a fun movie to watch and give your brain a rest. Parts of the plot and quotes It seemed very creative to me. 7 out of 10. In fact, for what it was, it would be worth 10 out of 10. You do not have to compare this to an artistic movie or a bloody movie.
