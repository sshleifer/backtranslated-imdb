The first director, Tom Kiesche, turns into a winning film in the spirit of dark, dark comedy. Shooted on a charming budget, he still had the flavor of Coen Blood Simple's early brother's movie ... and threw some of Monty Python's flavors at the boot! I have to see more than once to appreciate all the elements that lead one scene to another. Wait for more good things from this writer-director-actor.
