While initially reluctant to jump on bandwagon by watching "Lost," we accidentally caught an episode at the beginning of season 1? the polar bear? and it took all my attention then. The show, that is. Not the polar bear. So bear (he) with me while I throw as much incoherent, semi-coherent praise as I can gather. <br /> <br /> "Lost" has a simple idea of ​​a crowd-filled passenger flight on a desert crashing island, and gradually adds an extraordinary depth to its premises, exploring each character profoundly and fearlessly, which leads them, who are they? Where did they come from? It soon becomes clear that the island on which they are locked acts as a common denominator for many things in their lives, whether they are running away from something (Sawyer and Kate, among others) or to get in touch with spirituality (Locke, Claire ). But "Lost" will also zoom on the island itself and the mysterious horrors it shelters ... and all this seems to be strangely connected. <br /> <br /> While television actors are not exactly known for their subtlety or dazzling, most of the "Lost" pieces are in fact spectacular actors for their respective parts, promising heart and humor in performance their. There are also a multitude of meshes, but not generally Hollywood-like plastic like most TV shows. The characters feel very real and they are extremely convincing to follow them. their interactions are rarely predictable sappiness, small arguments or melodramatic branzos (although they are upsetting secrets) ?? these people are primarily trying to survive and any relationship emerges is treated as a secondary to action. The realism of these characters facilitates a well-carved plot. <br /> <br /> About this plot ... Imagine a tree as a template plot, then the branches as subplots (in this case, a branch for each character) ?? well, Lost adds branches to each branch and then small branches to those branches as other story lines. If you are a brother / sister of one of the main characters in flashbacks, you will get your own story. If you are a DOG you will have your own story. If writers do not manage to weave them all together in a glorious culmination, they are finally installed. I'm more than a bit worried that it will be an overwhelming disappointment at this show, as I'm sure most people are. But supposing the writers do that, "Lost" is probably the best show ever to hit the TV. <br /> <br /> 9/10
