This is my favorite of the three nasty movies. Once again I enjoyed all the songs. The big problem, however, as most people have pointed out, was that this story contradicts the original. For those who saw the first film they remember, the bears met the "cousins" they apparently never knew. Of course, it was not until the end that the bellies were given the belly symbols after they showed how much they cared about. In this story, however, the crutches grow up with bears of care and have belly symbols throughout their lives. That being said, this is not a bad movie as long as you keep it separate from the first. I thought the Darkheart character was far worse than Nicholas of the first. But, at the same time, I felt it added some kind of balance to the sweetness of the bear bearers. I also liked that we care about our side at the end, though I know that other people have mixed feelings about that scene. And, of course, I loved the songs. My favorites are to grow up and be forever. Caring bears movies have always had such good songs. Ten stars for a very good movie.
