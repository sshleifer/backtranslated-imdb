from the point of view of a NASCAR Maniac like me, the movie is interesting. You can see many racing cars since 1983. Even hard, racing scenes are not so realistic. But I have to admit I did not see a race before 1995, because before that time they did not show any NASCAR contest in Germany) from the point of view of a fan of Burt Reynolds I am, the film is what we are accustomed to we see from Reynolds in the 1980s: Burt behind the wheel of a fast car, as in Bandit's films. If you like NASCAR and Burt Reynolds, this movie is a must-see. If you only love one of these 2 things, I also recommend watching it. If you do not like NASCAR or Burt Reynolds, you should still give it a chance, but remember, this movie was far from winning an Oscar Oscar. It is the typical humor of the '80s. If you like movies such as Cannonball Movies and Police Academy, you will also like that.
