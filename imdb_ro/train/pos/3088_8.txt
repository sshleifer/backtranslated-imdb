Unfortunately for me - I've come across this show late in his life. I caught a few episodes (about three) before being canceled by ABC. I liked the characters and the story - but above all, the actors GREAT! I was a fan of Sex and the City, so I saw two characters I recognized (Bridget Moynahan was & The Character "Todd" was "Smith Jared"), and Jay Hernandez (From Carlito's Way: Rise To Power) Christensen (Swimfan). I like to see the young actors pay their debt and feel that this show would further propel their career. I hope this will at least be played on DVD, and maybe WB will take it for a second season sometime? Meanwhile, I see it on the ABC site from the beginning.
