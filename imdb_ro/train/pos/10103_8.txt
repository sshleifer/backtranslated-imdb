I spent years looking for a copy of this movie (16mm, dvd, vhs), so I was able to show it to my children. The film is funny, and Spike and his band members show why they were the best musicians in the field. They had to be so good to play that dementia. I like and recommend it to film lovers of all ages. The film is about a turn of the century fire, with a team of firefighters who are firefighters and the band of the department (when not fighting fires). They're the usual bouts, plus Spike Jones's chaos and his orchestra. Also, comedy excuses offered by comedian Buddy Hackett and Hugh O'Brien.
