This is obviously the same market as Monsters Inc and Shrek, but it is different in terms of less cartoon (despite the deliberate caricature features of lead creatures). The story is not one that has had a massive front of you at the end of it (more like a sleeveless shirt) but just chooses to tell a story about relationships between different "animals." You know the outcome, but you can not help attracting yourself. The characters themselves are far more than their voices (the advantage of the less famous actors who make the voices), unlike most Disney movies. They are well rounded and completely credible, weird. Group dynamics are brilliantly well presented, and character revelations and strangeness are subtle and enjoyable. You will find rooting for them much faster than you would want. <br /> <br /> Animation is brilliant, as you would expect, and you will pray for the opportunity to go on the ice slide in the movie. You will fall in love with the characters, especially the comic relief of the prehistoric squirrel and her desperate attempts to bury your walnuts. I went out to want my goods, especially lazy, just to be disappointed the next day when I could not find anything vaguely bound. Which, strangely, makes the movie the cleaner. <br /> <br /> Better than Monsters Inc. or Shrek.
