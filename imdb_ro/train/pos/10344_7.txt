Melvyn Douglas and Joan Blondell collaborate in "The Amazing Mr. Williams," a 1939 mystery / comedy that is pretty good though forgotten, probably because of the number of incredible movies that came out in 1939. <br /> <br /> Douglas plays a talented police detective married to his job, while his girlfriend is waiting for a wedding that is constantly postponed. What is happening in this movie is no exception - he is called in a murder scene just as he is going to go back to the aisle again. Both stars have been excellent at comedy, have worked well (and often) and helped to distract this battle of genders. Edward Brophy and Donald McBride are at hand for excellent support. As you can read in other reviews, Melvyn Douglas does not make much of a woman. a little on the long side. One of the comments here drew Melvyn Douglas, one of our biggest actors. He literally floated effortlessly through dozens of films like the other man and best friend before entering his own movies as an old man. He was not lazy, but rather a very hardworking actor (who seemed to think slightly) who had a career at Broadway at the same time as his film career. He was not cast as a leading man in the movies or gave very challenging roles within the studio system. It provokes anyone to see his devastating performances in "Hud" and "I never sang for my Father" and call him lazy or I mean his astonishment.
