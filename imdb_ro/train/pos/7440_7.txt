I just saw the movie, and the scary things were, the people who were talking during the movie sounded like the actors. The movie had moments, but it remained and remained pretty bad. Everything was meant to be a hoax, but once you see the pathetic life of the people in the movie, think about yourself "People like this are around us" All attempts to get public sympathy are destroyed, one stupid thing after another . In addition, there are some wonderful (and funny) insults. I think I'd wait for the movie - but it was a good laugh. WARNING - Jerry takes off his shirt during the movie! (not a beautiful view!)
