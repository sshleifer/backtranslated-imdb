This is a typical typical Tom and Jerry short - a situation is projected, conflicts appear and chaos appears. Characters behave appropriately, the natural tensions between different characters lead to general chaos. The best (and funniest) part is when the peace treaty is in place and respected - all sorts of strange wonders appear before your eyes. A warning word - it's wiser to allow Tom to help you perform the morning cleaning routine! Highly recommended.
