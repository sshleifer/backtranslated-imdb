The thriller is starring with Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis, who joins David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes on the west road. The last couple explores notable crime sites for a future book; Pitt is a serial killer on LÃ¢m (unknown to Dave), and Juliette is the poor comrade, not exactly there. This is a good distribution and the story moves along it, but Pitt is not scary scary as a serial killer, though it is one of his better past roles. The best thing is here is Michelle Forbes, who manages to always shine, either in his roles on "Homicide: Life on the Streets" or in the short series "Wonderland".
