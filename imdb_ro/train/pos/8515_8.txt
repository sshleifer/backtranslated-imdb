The distribution was good and I thought it was a good performance from Christopher Lloyd, which I like the previous films. The film was a great family movie, nothing that would make you worry about showing younger children, a good story line, a lot of laughs, light and pleasant. If you want to have fun without tears, this fits with the bill. Kid pleased, not hard for a parent to look either.
