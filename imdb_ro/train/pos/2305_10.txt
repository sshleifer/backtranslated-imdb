I thought it was a great movie. It would have been nice to have seen a little more in the movie about the two sisters knowing each boy like that before he was killed off. I'm sure if the movie had been done this way, it would have been a very different ending, so it did so to make such a good movie. She shows that no matter what happens in your life with your brothers you can always go through it and that if there are two sisters dealing with a boy (the same boy), which makes the pain and wounds pass makes things look better and easier to work between the two. It's nice to see love stories that have a terrible thing to happen in someone's life that you can still make to become even closer to the end. I really enjoyed watching this movie and still do it now when it comes to it. It seems to me that I look at her every time it happens. It would have been nice if it had been part 2 for this movie, maybe the older sister would come to have her baby, that would have really made a great story ever since she died alive even if she's dead .
