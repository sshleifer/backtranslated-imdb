This is an excellent DVD stand-up! Eddie Izzard is the funniest person I've ever seen over the years. His routine is hilarious and makes an extraordinary conversation with others who have seen it. I strongly recommend this. Part of Europe's history is a bit slow, but jokes ending in French are pretty good, because you do not have to speak French to get it (though if you do, it's still hilarious). Also, the parties about transvestite are pretty good. The first scene (about San Francisco) is not great, but fun for the first time. Skip over if you can. It's almost not worth watching. However, this is indeed a fun, funny stand-up show that everyone should see. "I was dead at that moment!"
