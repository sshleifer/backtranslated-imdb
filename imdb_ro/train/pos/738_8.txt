And this is a great rock'n'roll movie in itself. No matter how it evolved (at the point of being a movie about disco), it has become one of the final movies in which children want to rotate, but the main one stands in their way. Think of those rock'n'roll movies from the 1950s where the day is saved when Alan Freed comes to town with Chuck Berry to prove that Rock & Roll Music is very cool and safe for children and Tuesday Weld receives a new sweater for dancing. Before 1979, repeat the same plot, but throw in DA RAMONES, which no one realized he would become one of the most influential bands of the next century (and then for the obligatory film of DJ, "The Real" Don Steele). Include all the elements of Roger Corman's comedy exploitation film, with the exception of the two-day shooting program, some of Corman's most renowned repertoire players such as Clint Howard, Mary Wournow and Dick Miller (since then "Bucket of Blood "), and you have one of the great stoop movies of the day. One of the few movies that uses the deliberate cheese and moves away from it. I showed the new DVD to a friend who only remembered seeing parts of it through a stoner-induced mist at the entrance of the car and agreed that this is one of the wonderful movies that look at drinking, not in the last row for wonderful ladies and great Ramones images.
