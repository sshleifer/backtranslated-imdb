What are you doing with a 14-inch-high porn star, who was involved in drugs and murder, and then died of AIDS? Make a movie, of course. The probable reason why it was not done earlier is that Eddie Nash was in the way of his production. So it's not a coincidence that the film was made just after Nash was sent to prison. The best thing about the film is its fast pace. There is no time spent on unnecessary crap. And why would it be? There's too much good stuff here to ask for filler scenes. The tower is good. Kilmer was mediocre in a series of films, so here was finally a pretty good role for him. Bosworth is cute, so it's irrelevant how it works (it's solid), and McDermott, which is quite annoying, is pretty good, because she's so much wearing so much facial hair I have not recognized at first. (I would have liked Cruise to do it in every movie, so I should not have looked at his simple face.) I could not recognize Christina Applegate and did not know she was in it, if not I saw his name in the final credits. Kudrow is charming as ever, a little unusual to see her in a dramatic role. (Btw, "Friends" is the worst TV sitcom of all time.) The only casting choices that were debatable were a time close to Carrie Fischer and the totally absurd inclusion of the moron of the 90s, Janeane Garofalo. You thought it would include Paris Hilton, did not you? No, I think Hilton is the ideal choice in her 10-second appearance as a bad slut. Because the film is about decadence, among others? and about a porn star? It fits perfectly.
