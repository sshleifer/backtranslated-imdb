While it was pretty musical, what was left to me about this film was the unexpected chemistry of comedy between Basil Rathbone, composer and Oscar Levant as assistant. Playing a great, entertaining artistic type (a cry from his more familiar roles, be it the threatening villains or the bad guys Sherlock Holmes), Rathbone's character seems to find his way without a bed. And this helper is Starbuck, played with his usual humor by Oscar Levant. After hiring Crosby's character as a ghost song writer, Rathbone introduces him to Starbuck, saying, "He's thinking of me," to which Levant responds, "Ah, it's just a part-time job." Of course, this goes even past (or over) Rathbone, who is too busy fretting about where the next hit song will come from. As another commentator said, who knew that Rathbone could be so funny! Too bad he did not have more opportunities to display his comedy talent.
