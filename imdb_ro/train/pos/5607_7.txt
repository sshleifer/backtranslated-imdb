Once we watched The Tenant and interpreted it as a horror movie. She uses many of the genre's troops: the sinister apartment, suspicious neighbors, appearances, mysteries, hallucinations. The hero's life, Trelkovsky, seemed surrounded by evil forces, trying to make him mad. The last time I looked at him I challenged this initial interpretation. If this movie is a horror movie, it is just horror that a novel Kafka is horror. In fact, this film can be understood at a literal level as a lonely man who becomes more and more crazy without external influence. Polanski has made three movies in his career, dealing with madness: repulsion, which I do not particularly know as if the development of madness in heroin never convinced me; Rosemary's child, where the heroine is maddened by the forces of evil; and Tenant, which may be the best study of paranoia ever made in cinema. Trelkovsky is a young man renting an apartment in which a woman committed suicide. He becomes obsessed with her and slowly begins to become her: she wears her clothes, puts on makeup, speaks like her. But is he possessed by a spirit, or just leaves his wild imagination to enjoy it? It is this hesitation between what is real and imaginary and which Polanski never solves, which makes this movie so fascinating. Many events in the movie can be attributed to the supernatural as easily as in the case of normal causes, and viewers have to decide what to believe. Although this film is not Polanski's favorite, it is still a good example of his ability to create suspense and to interpret insanity in very convincing terms. And from a technical point of view, it's a miracle. Suffice it to say that he collaborates with film composer Philippe Sarde and legendary photography director Sven Nykvist (DP Bergman) in making this film. A slow rhythm and sometimes uninteresting sequence can make this movie difficult to do, but it's nevertheless an experience.
