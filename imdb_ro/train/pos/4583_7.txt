I have seen this on a Cantonese VCD with subtitles in English. I thought the story was good, but there were times when some of the subclasses were extremely over-acting. This has escaped the movie, just like the pretty blade music score that bothers me throughout the movie. If the musical score has been improved, we could overlook some outdated scenarios. Then the movie would be much, much better.
