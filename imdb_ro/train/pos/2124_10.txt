This is a truly classic film in his story, acting and film presentation. The wonderful actors are full of the movie, Miss Sullivan and Jimmy Stewart being the main characters. In real life, she admired a lot and liked Jimmy and indeed gave her his main roles and helped them to be more calm with his appearance on the stage. The "chemistry" between the two was always apparent and so warm and pleasant to look at. She was such a beautiful woman, so sweet in her portraits of personality. The story of these two young people and how they will eventually reunite is charming pursuit and pure magic entertainment. Heart warmth presentations are also offered by other actors who support this wonderful story / film. I give with all enthusiasm to Miss Sullivan a perfect 10 in this Golden Age Cinema Classic, which has a special appeal for all generations. I have to see for all!
