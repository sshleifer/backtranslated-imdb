The beginning of this movie is a bit strange and also confusing, but stay tight because you are in the walk for your life. The concept is convincing, with exciting devices used to tell the story. There are excellent performances around all, Phillip Seymour Hoffman being the best cast-no surprise there. Ethan Hawke also deserves credit for a very strong performance. Mr. Lumet's direction is remarkable. The film has a seventy year feel that the risks are taken in the story of this story, but unlike most trifling films that populate the landscape today, it is a thriller that relies heavily on relationships rather than on effects special or product sockets. You will be very rewarded for the time invested in this movie.
