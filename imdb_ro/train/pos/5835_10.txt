Stan & Ollie become SAPS at the seafront when their small ship is commemorated by a vicious killer. Boys are wonderful in this feature, which begins with one of their most hilarious pieces, the horn factory. Always a few steps away from sync with the rest of Creation, Laurel & Hardy live in a world where frozen radii and beaten goats are the rule and not the exception. With a short length, the film is more in style with their classical short subjects, which explains its episodic nature. Only boys get credit on the screen, but the mavens will recognize other familiar faces: James Finlayson appears as a goddamn doctor, Richard Cramer enjoys all the justice of his evil role, sweet Mary Gordon plays the fearless neighbor of the boys. This is Charlie Hall as office desk desk desk office and comic silent Ben Turpin portrays a strange plumber. One of the scene's writers was silent comedian Harry Langdon. <br /> <br /> Stan & Ollie are still the main goal. Watching Hardy berserk to the sound of a horn, or Banner's Laurel's antics, for example, reminds the viewer why these boys remain absolute giant cinemas.
