I could not find anyone to look at DiG! with me, because I did not know he was a fan of any of the troops. Of course, everyone assumed you could enjoy this movie only if you enjoy the music of either Dandy Warhols or the Brian Jonestown massacre, but that is so far from the truth. The only requirement is that you have an interest in music and / or pop culture in general. The way in which the two groups' careers are parallel is a perfect representation of the ways a band can take and observing that the audience is eating and spitting Dandy Warhols is fascinating. I agree with other reviews that mention that it would be nice to get a last word from Anton himself because he is clearly described as his worst enemy and the screen for the band's ability to stay. to me is Dandys' respect for BJM (despite their lack or reciprocity) and for Anton (despite his irregular behavior). Dandy Warhols respects the art the group produces, even if the group hates everything that Dandy Warhols now holds (though it is questionable). The best line is when the drummer for Dandy's says "I will never have it again" and the guitarist unconsciously wipes "I'm still going to buy my records." For me, it only shows how strong the good music is. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, even if you know nothing about any of the bands. It's more about the themes of rock music and how it's developing what makes this movie so exciting. It's rare to follow a group so closely for so long.
