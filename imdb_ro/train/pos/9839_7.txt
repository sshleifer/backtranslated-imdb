Hmmm, yes this episode is extremely underestimated. Even if there is a lot of bad writing and acting in parts. I think good wins the bad one. <br /> <br /> I love origami and big 'twist' pieces at the end of the year. I really like that scene when Michelle faces Tony. It's actually one of my favorite scenes in Season 1. For some reason, people have always hated Reincarnation episodes, but I always enjoyed them. They are not the best in terms of writing. but the subject really interests me, I'll give it a THREE star, but if the writing would be a bit more consistent, I would give it FOUR.
