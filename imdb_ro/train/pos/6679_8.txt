I'm just an excuse for this movie: there are too many, too many panoramic angles, and if you irritate beyond resistance, quite fair. They led Marmui for the first ten minutes or so. But afterwards, I did some kind of armistice with the terrible cinema; and long before the end of the movie, I ceased to care. It's a too rich comedy that has to be destroyed so easily. It's hilarious, it's full of joy, the comical delivery of ALL cast is flawless, and no matter how much Usher's colleagues will be his characters through a cool fish-eye lens - maybe he does not care too much he - manages to present them with warmth. "Mystery Men" is, in fact, not only more fun, not just smarter, but even deeper than anyone seems to have given her credit to be. For example, the jokes in Austin Powers movies, as well as the fact that they are less fun than the jokes here, are also more without teeth. Sahara bites "Mystery Men" when there is something worth biting and gnaws gently when it does not exist. I do not knock on anything old. This is the reason why, contrary to what some (I must see them as unseen), critics have said that ideas never end. Super heroes are an attractive heap. Sure, they're different, but they're not just the second rate. Blue Rajah, for example, does nothing but to throw cutlery in people, and he's not good at it. On the other hand, it is not bad comic. He is better in his field than most people, and he strives diligently. He's not a buffoon, which makes him a more funny character than he would have been. If Superman is Christ in a goat, the Mystery Men are all minor demigods at the foot of Mount Olympus in the head. Much more fun; also more bold.
