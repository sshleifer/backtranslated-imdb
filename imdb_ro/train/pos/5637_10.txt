I would like to say that I have seen this movie twice now and I love it! The actor is great, and even if it's a plot like "Lift up your voice," I think the plot never gets boring for people who enjoy this kind of thing. She has some wonderful lessons in it and shows that we can do anything if we try. An incredible movie. I'm sure this is one that I will pursue for a long time. Even if Britney Spears writes the book, it's a pretty realistic plot, maybe not about the part that falls in love, but the part about being different and frightening, but getting better in the end is really true for real life. The only minor criticism is why the main girl in these movies is always beautiful? Do you really think that Holly would have met the perfect guy of her dreams if she was ugly or mean? I doubt it..
