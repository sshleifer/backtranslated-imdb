I thought the original of this movie was strange and charming, as if I was sitting on the edge of the chair trying to figure it out. Because I've already seen the original when I saw this Sci Fi Channel - I do not know if this remake was deliberately done for Sci Fi - I knew what it was in the first few minutes. Since I like Richard Burgi as a character actor, I wanted to see how he would shoot him. Producers / producers, etc., have modernized the film, trying to explain the situation of "aliens" "(They could no longer reproduce their own kind and needed help) using the same pseudo-science that was crammed into our ears in the 1990s. that he added a bit of Polish to the film or not.This film.Film This production has a more sinister edge than the original one.The original ended with a confrontation between the young and the stranger and an understanding of the sort took place, I'm reminded that in this remake, the woman has become rather hostile to Burgi / Alien - I think it might have been better, but the end is just the end, and the threads are a clogged thread, being the Science Fiction Pulp Science Base of 1958. Many science-fiction stories were written in the 1950s, and some of them even made the film. it is something that can swell like a rainy day or something like that. I've missed a lot of all of Sci Fa's 50-year remakes, that's good. I really enjoyed this. But if anyone really wants to see this story said well, I suggest the original version of 1958 with Tom Tyron and Gloria Talbott, directed by Gene Fowler Jr.
