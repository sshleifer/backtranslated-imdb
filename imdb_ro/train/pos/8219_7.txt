The Dirty Harry series began with a very aggressive police action and was almost immediately illuminated for "Magnum Force". The moment the "The Enforcer" overturned, Dirty Harry was a little more than a television police show (only saved by Tyne Daly). After a seven-year break, Dirty Harry returned to the roots. Perhaps he has been gone for too long this time. Clint Eastwood makes Harry's first well-directed Harry Don Siegel film made first, which helps considerably. Harry is again a darker character, not the beautiful policeman he had become. He can say things like "Continue, do my day" again and tell her really. "Sudden Impact" is a really dirty Harry sequel. The Enforcer should never have done. <br /> <br /> 7.2 out of 10
