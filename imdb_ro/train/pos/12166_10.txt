A very strange and convincing film. This is a very wounded man who is hurt, trying to sail his life as a door-to-door collector / seller. The director managed to capture a very unpleasant tone that really served the story. Original and anxious, while we also find a lot of humor in the pain that accompanies life. There is a sequence to a test unit that really got up and made me laugh out loud, which is not something they do as often as they should. One of the most memorable movies I've seen for a long time. He has not left my mind and I am looking forward to Bronstein's future efforts. Fantastic spectacles around. Simple line "I really appreciate". is now iconic for me.
