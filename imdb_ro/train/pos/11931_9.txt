This was a top-notch movie with a top-notch score. Danny Glover, Tony Danza, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Christopher Lloyd in particular are well distributed in this charming movie about real-life angels that help the Angels baseball team. You never know, it can happen. I liked Lloyd's role in him. He was hilarious. The story is about transforming your life around, because the Angels' beliefs helped return the angry, uptight and terrified manager Glover to see the best of the people. The movie has been well done and also about seeing the best of people and reaching your dreams. It was funny, charming, moving and sad, very well done. You will want (or love it). I guarantee it. <br /> <br /> *** from ****
