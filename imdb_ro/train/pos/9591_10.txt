Excellent documentation. I personally remember this growth in NYC in the early 1980s. This movie is for anyone who was not around in this time period. This shows an African American gay Underclass thing felt was theirs and the love and shyness you see is real. People are real and, unfortunately, few are still alive, because this is written. Balls are still kept, but not as far as they were in the '80s. That time has gone forever. This is a good movie for homo thug. When Queens were really proud to be extrovert. Goodbye to Storyville this is another era left but very documented by all the hail!
