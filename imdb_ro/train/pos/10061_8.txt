One of the most innovative foreign movies I've ever seen. The young man is an amazing talent. Starring by her (Doggie), the old man (king of the masks) and Liang (live Boddhisattva). (SPOILER) The deplorable treatment of children, especially women, is disturbing. /> <br /> I liked music. The original Chinese dialogue intensifies the emotional intensity of the performances and the story. This is a MUST HAVE - a pleasant family film, though not for very young children. It would have evaluated the even higher DVD release if the soundtrack had been better transferred to the DVD and the transfer included the widescreen version.
