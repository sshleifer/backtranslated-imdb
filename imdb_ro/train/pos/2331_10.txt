At first I was weird that a main character of the TV show could bring the dead to life, but then I thought I was going to make a shot. Guess what? I love "Pushing Daisies" and look forward to Wednesday nights just to watch, then for the next week I track several times on my DVR. The colorful characters, the banter wizard, the fast-paced dialogue and the new unique situations attract and captivate me from the beginning to the end. Ned and Chuck Charles, "is interesting to watch because they make their love story about the fact they can not have physical contact." Even the character of Detective Emerson Cod has continued to grow in complexity, and Olive Snook Jiminy Crispies! The narrator's voice is fun to listen to, and the cinema gives me the impression that I'm watching a movie instead of a TV show. I recommended to family and friends to start "Pushing Daisies" and they are also engaged! new episode and if you have not seen "PD", we recommend watching it!
