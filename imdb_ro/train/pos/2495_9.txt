A strange, awesome and wonderful representation of family life! Writer Andrew Marshall wrote something that is fun, challenging, and sometimes scary! Yes, do not be fooled by the cheerful song and the bubbles of the children; the show has a dark side, and sometimes it can be quite refreshing. And that's so good about the show, it's not just a simplistic sitcom in which each character is a 2D comic device (my family case). Instead, the characters are completely rounded, showing the complete cohort of human emotions. Dark moments from time to time, such as Bill being struck by a curse and Ben waking up in a bizarre village, are two examples of the show that have a dark, surreal tower that helps them to a small depth. Of course, the show is also incredibly funny, and it is a guarantee to make you smile. It's a real shame Eureka Video has stopped releasing this comic gold on DVD. Veoh.com is your last hope of getting the wrong episodes in stores.
