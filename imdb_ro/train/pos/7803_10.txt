I just finished watching this movie in my GCSE history class. was thrilling and it was a brilliant understanding of what actually happened to Steve Biko during the apartheid law. How can anyone say that this movie was the most boring or boring two and a half hours of their life, I do not know, because I got from the beginning to the end. it was great as Denzel Washington presented it and showed how to fight the apartheid law and to get equal rights for blacks. On the one hand, Steve Biko tells a policeman that we're just as weak and human as you are, that's to show them that he and all the other blacks in South Africa did not differ from whites. Donald Woods inspired me because he created what he believed and did not fully believe in apartheid. He and Steve Biko formed a very strong friendship that shook South Africa and continued to awaken the world. I really enjoyed this movie and I recommend it to people. helped me to see that racism is not fair and that everyone is equal, their fate must not be determined by the color of one's skin. n
