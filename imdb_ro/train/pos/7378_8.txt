After watching this movie last Sundance, I realized that much of Nakata's style was made for the first time in this movie. Here we have many of the same elements in the RINGU series, especially the idea that the media is the source of the supernatural. Instead of the cursed movie, we have instead a haunted studio and weird pictures appearing on the film. In fact, strange pictures appearing on the film immediately bring to mind the cursed movie in RINGU. The only thing missing was obsession with the water flowing through Nakata's films. The final scenes are quite frozen, with a bit of a sign to Murnau, which with the doors open to itself and the ghost that enters the room, reminds me immediately of NOSFERATU. A refreshing film that will make you think twice to climb a podium.
