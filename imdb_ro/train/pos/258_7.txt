Bound between San Francisco and the brave Captains, two of the most important parts of Spencer Tracy are this very curious film about the war and the effects it has on some people. They gave Spencer Tracy and Franchot Tone a gun star in the only movie they ever made together and Gladys George as the woman who loves both of them. Tracy and Tone are warlords from World War I, Tone is a poor man who almost goes over the hill in the luggage camp, but Tracy stops him. Tracy continues to play the beloved role, the young guy Wallace Beery whom MGM conceived when signing him away from Fox. <br /> <br /> Over the front Tone receives an opportunity and takes it during a battle, managing to reach a church tower heading for a German machine gun nest. He learned to shoot now and make a York sergeant. But Alvin C. York was never changed by war as Tone had. <br /> <br /> Wounded in the fight Tone goes to a hospital with Gladys George looking for him. Tracy goes to AWOL himself to visit his friend and he and George to do something. Later, when Tracy is reported missing in action, Tone and George get married. Tracy is disgusted when he returns and learns marriage, but he does it for a moment. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film deals with tone by applying the skills of the war taught to the gangster trade. There's a man who hit her now and George does not really know what he's doing to live his life. I think you can imagine the rest. Part of the movie that has given me trouble is that I can not believe Gladys George has failed to figure it out. She's a clever street girl, her side is very much like she played in The Roaring Twenties alongside James Cagney. <br /> <br /> Speaking of the leaping decade, Humphrey Bogart's character development is similar to Tone, although he was not the central character of the film. In fact, there are elements of Gave Him A Gun, which are found in Taxi Driver and the classic Clint Eastwood, The Unforgiven. <br /> <br /> World War I battle sequences are well set up by director Woody Van Dyke. For some reason, Leonard Maltin shot this movie, I think he is much better than he gave credit.
