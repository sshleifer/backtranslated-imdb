A well-done ghost story that will give you creeps and quite a few fairly frightful spirits along the way. The story unfolds slowly, building the atmosphere until you're ready to see the woman in black. You will not forget her once you see her. No gore, no knife, no hockey masks - just a well-built story that's best seen at night with the outside light.
