The "second beginning," as the title explains, shows the beginning of the end for the human race. Established long before the matrix exists, this short anime written by Wachowski shows us the world that could face us in the distant future, established at the beginning of the 21st century; the second rebirth is moving towards common aspects with human behavior; greed, power, control, vanity, etc. The use of robots or artificial intelligence as slaves or servants is common among sci-fi / fantasy stories. The second rebirth is no exception to this concept, but instead of a simple man to the look of the car, this story explains the struggle that machines solve, the struggle for acceptance in a world led by people. If matrix movies show us the human perspective, these short animations say both sides of the story. The second part rebirth 1 + 2 answers many of the questions asked by the original Matrix film, such as how the war broke out, like the black sky, which led to the use of people as batteries and also introduced us into the city called 01, which may be relevant to Matrix Revolutions. > I will not give much of the story, because I do not want to destroy the viewer's perspective from the perspective, but I will recommend it to anyone interested in the matrix world or simply to anyone interested in the Japanese animation (anime). <br /> <br /> 9 / 10.
