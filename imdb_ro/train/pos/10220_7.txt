This hilarious line is typical of what these nasty sisters say. (It's funny on its terms and quite funny and unintentional.) Only two of the sisters are very bad. Boys, they're bad too! One is given pinup poses and salacious comments where it's going. The other rises to resemble Marilyn Monroe. She has those sensual lips, easily separated. And, in order not to give anything away, she is even worse than the other. All three sisters are played by starlets. The man who stumbles in their lives is interpreted by John Bromfield. He had some career. It shows today that perhaps the first basic mainstream porn ever sold. Of course it is not the first, but the most racial at that time. The girls wore as little as possible and not to forget the female audience members: Bromfield is shaved with a shaving machine - whose fetish was that? - Chest empty. He is also shown wet filled in a bathing suit. There is also a real plot here: The girls' family, see, is cursed. They are prone to suicide - or dramatic death that can be made to be suicidal. The movie is not bad. I really do not know where it was. Maybe it was done for drive-ins. Somehow, and I was wrong, I felt that the typical male audience was not the primary target here. Women are dressed a little. They often resemble vague covers of magicians, such as the police detective or the Dime-type Roman jackets. But the guy seems to be the focus of attention. Not everyone in the movie likes, but all the girls love him. And I think the audience is also intended. <br /> <br /> It's a lot of fun - and in its terms as well.
