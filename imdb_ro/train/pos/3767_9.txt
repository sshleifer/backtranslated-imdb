Go back to page ten of this review section and make your way back. Go ahead; I will wait. <br /> <br /> Finish? Well, you probably noticed the same trend I have. You could play all day about the jokes of the blade, the dated calendar, and obviously derived from plot points and shtick in "Bogus," but this movie seems to be one of those who hate me now, loves me later " The biggest problem with Bill and Ted was that the original turned to those 80 children who followed the trends and considered themselves on the edge of fashion. This worked well for the original but was clearly bombed in 1991, when no weak would have been caught dead by anything other than the flannel, admitting he liked something about the 80s. How Ted would say, "Man, that's a deep hole. Do you want to play 20 questions? "" They say that nostalgia goes in cycles for 20 years, and this seems to be the case here. Here in 2010, those who grew up with Cindi Lauper and Megadeth are starting to look back to appreciate some of those pivotal movies that have made us to be. If you are one of those who look at the "Bogus" as if it were an outdated reward ("Fa gs!") Then you miss the point and you probably spent six years growing facial hair wearing flannel and showing you dragged yourself out of bed. In the self-referencing of his own origin (Star Trek episode and while traveling with a telephone booth), B & T does not try to conceal the creator's love for tribute Quentin Tarantino, whoever does not say that "Bogus" is "The True love, "but I think it must be appreciated for what it is: a fun of our society at a time before child psychology, Ritalin, announcements against smoking, terrorist paranoia, and proliferation of media trust. <br /> <br /> So for all those who feed you on B & T there ... stop the Screaming Trees CD, pull out your hair, go to the beach and leave it easier. Narcotic Depression and Intellectual Intelligence are so corporate.
