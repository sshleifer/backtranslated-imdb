This movie was like any Jimmy Stewart movie, full of spell, charming and very pleasant. Kim Novak's performance as Gillian, the beautiful witch that wants to be human, is splendid, her subtle expressions, every movement and gesture all create Gillian unique and somewhat letting her hang each word. I should not mention the highly commendable performances of Ernie Kovacs and Elsa Lanchester, the magical world-loving Scottish-loving writer (Kovacs), and the latter as a loving aunt who may not seem to stop using magic even when it is forbidden . The romantic scenes between Stewart and Novak are beautiful and the chemistry of them is wonderful, but when it's chemistry between Jimmy Stewart and any pretty cute lady!
