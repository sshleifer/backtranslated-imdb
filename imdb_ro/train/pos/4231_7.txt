While returning from a Christmas shopping trip, an abused housewife (Basinger) finds herself in a struggle for survival after a disagreement with a group of young delinquents returns violently. directly to DVD release here in the UK, Susan Montford's directorial debut will probably not get the recognition he deserves. This is a shame because the standard of writing, the director and the actor is really very good and certainly exceeds the quality of your average movie on DVD. <br /> <br /> Kim Basinger gives her best performances at a certain time as a broken wife of an abusive husband (Craig Sheffer). While Sheffer has nothing to do but be a threat, in their short scenes, Basinger binds - showing a painful vulnerability, still suggesting the anger that will eventually melt in the face of the young. It's a really great, undervalued performance, its transformation from victim to aggressor is simply played. Lukas Haas I originally thought it was mistakast, because he (along with the other three young people) simply did not seem to be too much a threat. However, if all four were physically more imposing, the subsequent scenes in which Basinger turned the tables against them would not work at all. The fact that these are four ordinary men, though a little frightened, is the key to why the movie works as well as it does. Apart from some aspects of the pace of peace during the second half of the movie and some lines of cheese here and there, what we have here is a great thriller that lets the viewer have something to think about when the movie is over. Some may be stopped by the slow nature of the opening scenes or the sudden ending. Other, sometimes violent, brutal. I say give him a chance, certainly worth more time than Saw V.
