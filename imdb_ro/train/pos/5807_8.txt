This is, in my opinion, a very good film, especially for Michael Jackson's lovers. It contains a message about drugs, amazing special effects and a wonderful music video. The main movie is centered around the song and video "Smooth Criminal". Unlike the four minute music video, it's a normal speed and, in my opinion, much easier to watch. However, the plot is odd. Michael Jackson plays a magic gangster who, when he sees a star, turns into a car. Throughout the movie, he turns into a racing car, a giant robot and a spacecraft. The robot scene, in particular, is a little strange and strange. I realized it was a little embarrassing compared to the rest of the movie. A child is kidnapped, Michael tries to save her, is tortured and beaten, and suddenly turns into a giant robot, blows up all the bad guys. A little strange? Yeah, but besides the bizarre robot scene, it's a great movie, and any fan of Michael Jackson will enjoy both the Smooth and the Crime music video.
