Your medieval kindergarten garden (deliciously essayed with glee unshended by Stephen Sachs) knocks young adults down (to use the very weak term) at the University of Dayton Hall, which is closed for demolition. Daphne Zuniga makes her movie debut as ignorant and impossible as here Debbie, a bimbo who has his head crushed by a car!), A corpse of 10 bodies, good f / x makeup by Matthew Mungle, some bloody crimes (biting the bats of baseball, strangulation of chicken wire, your standard drill head, that terrible thing), a surprise finish that was later copied in "Intruder," a terrifying score by Christopher "Hellraiser") Young, a small smidgen of free female nudity and incompetent boldness of Jeffrey Obrow and Steve Carpenter (who also blessed us with "The Power" and "The Kindred"), this slides'n'dice atrocity grows like a nice cute sweet business and cute fun of low grade.
