Returning to Room 3 is the sequel to comedy in Shaolin's 36th Epic Chamber, where Gordon Liu played Shan Te, a young man who became a great monk and fighter. In this sequel, Liu plays an unlucky loser who has to learn kung fu after making his friends be beaten. He imitates the original Shan Te, tries all sorts of tricks to get to the Shaolin Temple to learn and ultimately get some unique skills to fight against intimidation bosses. It's a classic story of martial arts, with the production values ​​of those Shaw brothers and the safe direction of Chia Liang. The choreography is fantastic for both the comedy and the comedy of Gordon Liu, just like the others, especially the sympathetic monk who works perfectly for the material. The film is less epic or profound than some of the other works of the stars and there are certainly larger, more violent and brighter Shaw Brothers movies. But few have such a magical combination of robbery, unique training and fighting, with a subtle yet costly story of a useless guy who does well. Full of joy of heart, the impossibility of not giving the highest score.
