While the soundtrack is a little dated, this story is more relevant in the U.S. now more than ever. Not only blue-collar jobs, but also employees of all who are outsourced by US corporations, while government profits and Americans suffer. Peter Strauss is Emory, a steel worker working for the same job for his father for 35 years. His wife is well represented by Pamela Reed, who is very realistic, trying to support the family with two children when Emory loses her job. The mill is closed under the guise of faulty management, but there are cheaper cheats and salaries if they can pay a steelmaker in a month (outsourcing) what Strauss / Emory should pay one day. It does not matter that these men are all good loyal workers who have values ​​and try the best for their family. John Goodman, Gary Cole (like Strauss's brother) and a few other colleagues are also affected. It is very disturbing and realistic. Some scenes between Emory and his father are moving. Emory hopes the local union will be able to reopen the mill, as it promises to do so. Emory's brother, Lee, already sees writing on the wall. There are no jobs in the rust belt (Ohio) and they have to go on. However, if in the U.S. can change to?. Where will it be better for a blue steel worker? <br /> <br /> There is a triumphant scene at the end of which Emory and his crew fill the loading dock with steel products. The Guard allows them to do this as a final gesture, one of the men committed suicide and empathy. Generally, a good news movie about hard times right here in America. Something that few care to face until they are personally affected. 8/10.
