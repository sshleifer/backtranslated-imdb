"Mother" tells of a recently married mother in the mid-60s, two adult children (Reid), who, at the very end of her husband's death, wakes up from sleepwalking life because she has an affair with a carpenter who is also the boyfriend's daughter her daughter. The film is about silent passive mother, her awesome relationship with her son and daughter, the silent needs she tries to calm down in bed with her young boyfriend and the convulsions that have come to him. A somewhat antiseptic drama with psychodramatic underground shame, Mama does an excellent job of dealing with the uncomfortable problems in a realistic way, while avoiding free sensationalism. It will play best with more mature audiences, possibly with women, who may feel better with their central character, with their needs and problems. (B +)
