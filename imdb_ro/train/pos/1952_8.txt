I came to see the film "On Slim Ice" on the television in India. I have to say that the movie was very well done, and it really sent me a chill on the backbone .. the basic story makes me think what determines some addicts to decide it seems to me that Diane Keaton was at its best ... the scene where he has cravings and starts to escape his house for cocaine ... it was the best ... the two boys are good, and Lynda Boyd also showed what a good actress is ... The script is well made like cinematography and direction .. and pouring A must have to watch the movie ... for everyone
