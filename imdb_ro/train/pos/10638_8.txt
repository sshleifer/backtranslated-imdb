When I think of this film, all the adjectives that come to mind relate in a way to the physical appreciation of the world. Texture, smell, color, so I think this movie should be judged in terms of. See the rich golden tones that surround the young sleeping concubine near the fireplace or the turkish bath and let it renew your senses with spice impressions, coarse cloth, smooth skin, scented oils, flickering flames, satin laundry. Do not just look and listen, be absorbed, let the narrator's fascinating voice fascinate you.
