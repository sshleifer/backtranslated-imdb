Possible SPOILERS: Not sure <br /> <br /> While watching The Lion King 1 1/2, we could not help, but I have mixed feelings about the whole movie. It's certainly a good way to spend about an hour and 15 minutes. But there is nothing to give you the same feeling that the King of the Lion did. The story, for those who have not read the other reviews, refers to how Timon and Pumbaa meet and how they affect the events of the original Lion King. There are, in fact, some funny jokes in the movie. My favorite part is when the pair shows up with Simba. However, for me the worst parts must be when it shows that Timon and Pumbaa interfere directly with the original events. I can never look at the "Circle of Life" or "You can feel your love tonight" again (I'm fine in the "I do not expect to be king" sequence). <br /> <br /> The voice talents are excellent. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella do a great job, like Matthew Broderick, the guy who makes Rafiki and the hienele. Even the actor who makes the young Simba sounded pretty much like me for Jonathon Taylor Thomas. But why did they even include a voice actor for Zazu? He had literally only 2 lines and none was very necessary. The additions of Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller are just added to talent, though you can still hear Timon's voice and do not think of Marge Simpson. There are some scenes that seem not to match the original, the one that comes to mind when they are proud of the end. How did they have time to fit into the initial fight with the hienes? As for the DVD itself, you can not help feeling that for a set of 2 discs, the special features are particularly lacking. It could have easily matched with a comment or other appearance on the first disc. I liked the game "Who wants to be king of the jungle", even if it is the most embarrassing example of cross promotion that I have ever seen. Some of the questions are actually difficult. Overall, a good movie, though not as good as TLK or even TLK2.
