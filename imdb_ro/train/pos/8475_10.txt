This is a fantastic movie for children based on Boggy Creek Legend, though I do not know why they called it Back to Boggy Creek as if it were a sequel. This film has nothing to do with his documentary and fantasy of a child. Dawn Wells plays the role of the mother of three children who wander in the swamp around Boggy Creek with two other men, and the monster comes to their aid. Yes, it is very silly and the plot is corny, but this type of film is perfect for the 8-12 year group it was targeting. It is harmless to G-rated children and at least do not have to worry about leaving children alone while they are looking. Strictly for the 8-12 year set, older children will get bored and will think they are blades.
