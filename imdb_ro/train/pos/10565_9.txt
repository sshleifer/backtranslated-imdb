In 1933, Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler sang and danced through three Warner Brothers musicals that offered the Depression audience a temporary distraction from their problems. Gold Diggers from 1933, 42nd Street and Footlight Parade were all set in the world of Broadway theater, basically with the same subject of the show must continue. In addition to Keeler and Powell, the films included Busby Berkeley's kaleidiscopic choreography, song-stopping show and many of the same support players. All are certainly classic of their genre, but I have to admit a clear preference for Bottom Light because of its energy and driving rhythm James Cagney. Warren William in Gold Diggers and Warner Baxter on 42nd Street are admirably paying off as show production bosses - especially Baxter as he burned Julian Marsh in search of a box office last shot. Both lack Cagney's infectious energy, which perfectly compliments the frenzied rhythm of putting on a Broadway musical. He is an absolute whirlwind while dealing with production numbers, unscrupulous partners and a golden girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Of course Cagney does not make Footlight the classic. The script crackles with a couple of bold, double-edged borrowers, broadcast by a supporter supporting the cast with Frank McHugh, Hugh Herbert, Guy Kibbee and especially Joan Blondell, who cuts them all down. Busby Berkeley's dance numbers are surreal, suggestive and risqu√©, and were made only in the time-out before the Hollywood Code arrived in 34. Unfortunately, thirty-something beyond would never see such rich music performed with the verve and sass of the Footlight again. Gentility and morality have assured her.
