One of the first OVA ("original video animation") I've ever bought has to be one of my favorite anime titles. A cinematic comedy of cinematic action against an unexpected comedy (for a comedy that is) of pollution background in the near future in a dystopian society. The "Heroes" of the Dominion are the Reserve Police, formed with a philosophy "If we can not beat the crime, we will get a bigger track" and which, as the name suggests, patrols the city in tanks instead of patrol cars and which are actually far more dangerous than any of its offenders trying to catch. Most, if not all, of these policemen are psychopaths and neurotic frontiers, giving the new meaning to the phrase "free cannon". Equally colorful and funny are their opponents, the terrorist Buaku and his (wo) maiden cats, the Twin Cat satellites, whose existence always seems to involve giving the Tank Police a hard time. Animation is not a cutting-edge technique, but it is very nice otherwise; the colorful palette and the caricature of the characters and chests fit nicely with the Dominion's comedic atmosphere. Doubling English is again a lot of fun. The soundtrack of the English version is also very good. I wonder if they ever made a soundtrack album ... However, the Dominion Tank Police is great. He is a Japanese cyberpunk SF with a lot of comedy, full of characters and totally superior situations, making sure he does not take it seriously. Highly recommended.
