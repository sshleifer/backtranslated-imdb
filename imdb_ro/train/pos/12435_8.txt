I was glad to see that she had black hair! I've been a fan for about 30 years now and I've been disgusted with the two previous storyline attempts. I was delighted that the scriptwriters updated the time to include a computer, to ruin it at all. In fact, I watched the movie twice in a day, a sure sign that it was standard. This is what I do with the books I like very much. I thought all the characters were well described and represented the very first days of Modesty Blaise as well as they showed in both the book and the comic book. Also, I should disagree with a comment made by a previous commentator about the evil that must be ugly. Has he actually read the books? I thought this was a very good movie and I look forward to continuing with the anticipation.
