This movie appeared 12 years ago and was a revelation even for people who knew something about the New York scene. The performance manuals say nothing about these vogue homes. The pretenders of Anthony Slide's Great Pretender say nothing. Julian Fleisher "Drag Queens of New York: An Illustrated Field Guide," with the flow of influence that attracts Julian Eltinge, Minette, Warhol queens, and the club scene of the 90s - and the film posted - completely ignores the homes. Even Laurence Senelick's "The Changing Room" - the closest thing we have to a definitive book on shooting performance is fast-paced film and does not give any information we would have expected. I understand from the movie itself and the various articles I've found on the web that this system of houses is back for decades. The greatest interpretation of a movie by a member of the house before 1990 seems to be Chrystal La Beija in "The Queen," 1968. The historical context is mostly lacking in the film "Paris is Burning." is valuable because it focuses on a scene that is otherwise ignored. It is a valuable instant snapshot of life in 1989. The unfortunate fact that Venus Xtravaganza was killed during filming offers an extremely dramatic ending, but this is not the only film about transsexuals that includes a crime in real life. As we now know, Dorian Corey had a mummified corpse in his literal cabinet, but that did not come out until three years later. From a historical point of view, we still need someone to make a book or a documentary film that offers more context.
