Bored and unhappy beloved father, Zandalee feels trapped in a marriage, unhappy with immeasurable poet and businessman decent but boring Thierry Martin (a solid and credible portrait of Judge Reinhold). Zandalee has a hot adulterous, artist dizzying and arrogant Johnny Collins (played delicately handle thin Nicolas Cage). Can the relationship between Thierry and Zandalee be saved? Or will everything collapse and go to seed? Director Sam Pillsbury and writer Mari Kornhauser were on a history grosolÄƒ style soap while trying to tell a story of wisdom earnest desire run amok and its consequences with potentially dangerous; glorious plot goes off the rails in the last third terrible in terms histrionic. Dialogue is also hilariously stupid and vulgar (sample line: "I want to get you out naked and eat you alive"). Better yet, this film certainly offers plenty of feminine nudity (the superb Anderson statue shows that smokes hot in bafta) and soft-core semi-pornographic sexual scenes (Johnny and Zandalee doing dirty work in a confessional church with particular emphasis on steam). The setting at New Orleans does not add additional spices to the already steamed procedures. With his long and gnarled hair, with a fat mustache, dirty mouth and rough manners, Johnny's Cage is an absolute gulp, being the most "romantic" hardest ever to ever get rid of on the celluloid. Also, Anderson, Cage and Reinhold work with Joe Pantoliano as a friend of Zandalee, happy, homosexual Gerri, Viveca Lindfors, as the perceptual mother of Thery, Tatar, Aaron Neville friend barman Jack, and Steve Buscemi as a funny thief, blithely shameless. Walt Lloyd sharp and shiny cinema offers an attractive glossy image. Score aromatic, harmonic by prayer for rain also hit instead. A delightful and mischievous rebellion.
