One of the great classic comedies. It's not a slapstick comedy, not a heavy drama. A fun, satirical movie, a buyer, keeps a guide for a new home. Filled with great characters, all, Cary Grant, are convinced to squirm in the house of a dream house. </ br /> <br /> A wonderful look at life in the late 1940s. <br /> <br />
