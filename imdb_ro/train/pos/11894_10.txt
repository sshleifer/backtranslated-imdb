A truly adorable heroine who, in turn, is surprised and frightened by the monks, struggles with the mattresses, runs completely in the closed doors ... just a few of the moments that shine in my memory of "The empty truth". I loved what I got from this show: joyful placards and good supporting characters featuring setting for the diamond of the show - Tea Leoni as "Nora Wilde"; cute, clown and wonderfully prone to accidents - How refreshing to see an actress who can clown - no wonder Hollyood does not seem to throw it away. But where-oh-WHERE are DVDs? The amount of (bleep) it delivers is incredible that this little jewel remains buried. (Somebody prays me if I'm wrong.)
