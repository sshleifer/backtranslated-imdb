Welcome back to Kiefer Sutherland. it's been too long since you appeared in a movie, and what was a movie, it was 24 not, but very interesting, especially with a professional like Michael Douglas headed as a secret service agent. Kiefer's character drives Michael Douglas all the film, "Kiefer's partner" is Eva Longoria, "Houswife desperate." wow she can actually act apart from flirting all day and looks good, I wish, though that Kim Bassinger had a bigger role but other than that, I think the whole movie was a blast from the beginning up the end. This film is what I consider to be a political thriller, everyone has played its part. nothing has been revealed in the movie in such a way as to keep your guess at all times. and I really think Kiefer did a job here in this movie, but in my opinion, Michael Douglas had the subsequent performance of the day, the fingers.
