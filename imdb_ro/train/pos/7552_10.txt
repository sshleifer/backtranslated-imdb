CAT SOUP is a short anime based on the legendary Nekojiru manga. He won the Best Short Film Award at the Fantasia 6th Film Festival and also won the "Excellence Award" at the Media Arts Festival in Japan. When the little kitten's soul Nyaako is stolen from Death, she and her brother Nyatta are engaged in a bizarre journey to get him back. In the surrealist valley of the other side, they face many fantastic characters and remarkable, often disturbing adventures. CAT SOUP is an anime like nothing you've ever seen. It's Hello Kitty on Acid! It is very original, amazingly beautiful and possesses a great sense of strangeness and lyricism. CAT SOUP is very surreal (no dialogue) and sometimes cruel and upsetting. So it's more an anime for adults than kids (maybe I do not understand at all!). A great journey for those who have the chance to see this absolute masterpiece. You have to see!
