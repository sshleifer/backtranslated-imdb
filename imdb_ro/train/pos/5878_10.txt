Garam Masala is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Akshay Kumar is excellent as a woman who has a 3-sided business and is employed at the same time. John Abraham is fun sometimes and this is one of the best works so far. Paresh Rawail is superb as usual in most of his films. Director Priyadarshan made wonderful movies in the past. Hera Pheri, Hungama and Hulchul being some of the best. Garam Masala is the most funny movie he has ever made. The three new actresses are mediums. Rimi sen does not have much attention in this movie. I was impressed to see how Priyadarshan made a movie with a simple story of a guy who has a three-faced adventure at the same time. All three girls have one day off the same day and get to the same house. Packed with lots of laughter, this is a non-stop Entertainer.
