I found this movie quite accidentally, but I'm happy to have done it. Kenneth Branagh's performance nearly came to steal this movie from Helena Bonham Carter, but their strong chemistry has done together for a much more enjoyable film. This movie has brought to mind the excellent films made by Branagh with Emma Thompson. Carter's star returns here, because the young women with disabilities, who are trying to fill up, have been as efficient as those I have long seen from a woman. Presenting a person with disabilities is hard to pull, but with just her eyes to show her pain in her life situation, she made her so credible. If this movie came out after the current wave of beautiful women "ugling" for roles (Charlize Theron, Halle Berry), I made sure that Carter had a special attention for an Oscar. If you meet this movie on cable late at night, as I did, believe me, it's worth the lost sleep.
