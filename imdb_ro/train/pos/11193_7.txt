I liked the kind of Lady Lady. Give him a break. She looks great and has very nice eyes. What's not good? The scene in which Ray Liotta was raped with a garden hose was rough and cruel. In fact, a lot of things that happen in this movie are raw and crude. But it's a chaos. A lot of movies that are not clean are not all bad. I liked it better than the Valley of the Dolls, which was not only boring, but also boring. At least this was not boring. Pia becomes very naked and seems a mischief as a writer. Looking at her about Pushkin and Byron with a guy three times her age is unbelievable. I'm sure Pia is a pretty person in real life, she does not project the writer's vibe. She looked much happier when she worked as a host for the Saturday Night Fever guy and wearing a glamorous disco dress. Some scenes are funny. The one she tells the actor for two moments that she is pregnant, and he prays his eyes and catches her to "stop around her!" All the time she walks alongside any bimbo that sneaks. > Pia's nerve disintegration scene is good. Perhaps it was a mistake to go so high on it (the vortex of the flyers and the cry of cold - whoa!), And its next catatonic stupor is somewhat overwhelmed. The acceptance speech is a hohot, though. I want to see someone make this speech in a drama class. But again, it's the garbage we're talking about. You could find worse at any movie of the week back in the eighties.
