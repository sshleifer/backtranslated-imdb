The movie is more about Pony than Owl Gray. It's about aboriginal, Canada, English, aunt Gray Owl and North Bay Nugget. Excellent story. This is an excellent movie, more like a book, which raises interesting questions about identity and cultural values. The key scene is Gray Owl admitting Pony's impost and her reaction. Some comments on user ratings. Note that user ratings are the bi-polar group at 5 and 7; it is not for everyone but it has a strong pursuit. This movie is undervalued and overlooked, but will be noticed over the years. Also, few women have watched the movie, but they rate it more than men. Was it sold correctly? <br /> <br />
