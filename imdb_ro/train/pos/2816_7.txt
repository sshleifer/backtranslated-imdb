This is an extraordinary blow to Jackie Chan, thanks to the fantastic finale and great humor, although it is nothing special. All the characters are pretty cool and the movie is fun all the time, plus Jackie Chan is simply amazing in it! Jackie and Wai-Man Chan had fantastic chemistry together and they are both very funny! And I thought the main opponent seemed really threatening, but doubling was simply terrible! The character's development is above average for this type of work, and the main fight is simply fantastic, plus some of the blows that Jackie takes in this one are harsh! There's a lot of really stupid and humorous humor in this, but I'm amused and the end is hilarious, plus all the characters are pretty nice. It's quite cheap, but generally very well done, and while it does not have the amount of fighting you would expect from a Jackie Chan movie, it makes you look, plus one of my favorite moments in this the movie is when Jackie Dragon) and Wai-Man Chan (Tiger), is playing with a rifle and goes out! This is an exceptional shot of Jackie Chan, thanks to fantastic finale and humor, but nothing else but wonderful, yet worth the watch! Direction is good. Jackie Chan does a good job here with solid camera work, fantastic angles and keeping the movie at a fast pace for the most part. The action is very good! Jackie Chan is amazing as always, and he's amazing here, he's extremely enjoyable, hilarious, as he usually has some crazy stunts, he has a fantastic chemistry with Wai-Man Chan, kicked that and played this wonderful character, it was amazing ! , I just wanted to stop double it! (Jackie Rules !!!!!). Wai-Man Chan is funny as Jackie's best friend, I really liked him, he's also a very good martial artist. The rest of the cast does not think OK. It's generally well worth the watch! *** of 5
