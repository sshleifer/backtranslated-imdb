The ghost train is a treatment for those who appreciate typical humor of the 1940s. It incorporates World War II into the plot, but not as much as I originally thought, and the characters are a unique blend that plays the roles quite well. Askey, who plays Tommy Gander, is what illuminates the story for the parts that could be portrayed as boring or "creeping". The story of the haunted post is even scary even for present day standards. It's unique and the way the characters communicate with each one is fantastic to magnify the mystery that is the Ghost Train. The gang is practically a challenge for other members, while the rest is doing pretty well. He is always the focus of attention and can be called "annoying," but it is those who do not appreciate the humor of the 1940s. His humor is innocent and childish, making it sweet to look at. If it was not for Askey / Gander, this movie would have been shorter in action, joy and the result would not be as effective in my opinion.
