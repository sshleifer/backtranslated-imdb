Most of the complaints I've heard about this movie really come to one thing: it's not Versus. Yes, the distribution and the crew are essentially the same. Yes, Kitamura rehashes some photos in the battle scenes that come in the second half of the movie, but that's where the similarities end. Versus is basically everyone, presenting Kitamura's ability to create an interesting B movie in natural locations. For Alive, almost everything takes place inside. In small, cramped spaces. Here, art design is pushed in front of you and what artistic design is it! We are treated in some very complex and interesting spaces, and our characters are mostly limited to those spaces. Also, an important difference is that we do not have much action here until the end of the movie. Versus was all about action and coolness, here more attention is placed on the characters and the situation and mingles with your mind. For this reason, Alive is a much more interesting film than Versus. You may not do it and go to a random scene to watch five or ten minutes of cool blood, but you will stick on the screen for almost two hours watching the interaction with some really exciting characters. <br /> <b> I'm now ecstatic that I ordered the DVD despite some naysay. And you should! But make sure you realize that it is a different animal than Versus - it is often slow and requires a bit of thought to get the most out of it. I hope Media Blasters takes over for the R1 DVD release!
