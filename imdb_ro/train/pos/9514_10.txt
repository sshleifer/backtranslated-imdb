This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. He has a great deal of action from Hanks, Newman and the others. Definitely the best interpretation of Jude Law. The cinema is excellent, the edition is just as good and includes an original original score that matches the film's mood. Production design is also a factor in what makes this film special. For me, it takes a long time to defeat the Godfather, but the fantastic cinema shown wins this contest. Sure, the best film I nominated in my book.
