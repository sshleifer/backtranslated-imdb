Joel Schumacher Made a choice when deciding on this cast and this scenario. The story is well-written and well-staged, and this new distribution of 10 or 12 central characters was absolutely brilliant. It seems that there were 6 "leaderships" and about half a dozen supporters, and by far this is the best thing about the film, the young faces of tomorrow. It has been a long time since Hollywood reached the controversial Vietnam War films that said something about the "story to be told" (as Schumacher says), and Tigerland enters that peak of war films. However, it can not be labeled as a war movie, because it seemed to rely more on the human spirit of Bozz and the others. Think of someone who wants to see a good film, except the special one, but only good and hard drama should go to Tigerland, obviously Shumachers Best has been working for the last 8 years.
