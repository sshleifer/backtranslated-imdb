I think I'm a connoisseur of boxing movies and that's why there's only one thing that prevents me from saying "Gentleman Jim" the best boxing movie ever produced. That's Robert Wise's / Paul Newman's "Someone Up there I Like It". This film may be the number one, but "Gentleman Jim" is a close-knit number 2. The film not only chronicles the rise of James J. Corbett, it also shows boxing sport in the crucial moment of transition. By the end of the 1800s, boxing had moved away from the brutal days of empty rules in the more "gentleman" of the Marquis of Queensbury's rules. And sport has faded away from the days when it was an illegal show and a moment of acceptance and respectability. "Gentleman Jim" is not a realistic look in those days. It is romantic and, yes, even a little hokey sometimes. But always charming. Errol Flynn is perfect as Jim "Gentleman" who really is not a "gentleman," but only a fast speaker from a working class family. Alexis Smith is quite coveted as the top-class woman with whom she has a love / hate relationship (and we all know it's, of course, love that will win that match eventually). at the end of "Gentleman Jim," the great John L Sullivan (whose famous line was NOT "I can lick any man in the world", of course ... romance again), puts his hand over Corbett. This is truly one of the best scenes of any sporting move ever made. Realistic? No, but wonderful. Hey, if you want realism to watch "Raging Bull" instead. This is a more realistic boxing movie. But "Gentleman Jim" is much more fun.
