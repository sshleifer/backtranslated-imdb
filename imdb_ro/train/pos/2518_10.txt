This is, by all categories, the best movie I've ever seen. Forget Hollywood - their movies have always been sucking - this is art! The story of Moon Child begins with Kei - a Japanese vampire who does not want what has become and lives in denial. His desire for final death leads him to Mallepa, where refugees live in several Asian countries. Here, she meets Sho, an orphan who lives on the street. From here, the film is an intense experience based on the visual and emotional side of the film. It has everything; laugh, cry, angry, excite, sad, happy ... Never touched a movie like this movie. And the actors are amazing - I have never heard anyone speak so many languages ​​without sounding strange. A great praise for the editor for creating this masterpiece ... An ultimate commentary on this brilliant film is that he interprets Gackt (Malice Mizer's ex-vocalist) and Hyde (vocalist L'Arc-en-ciel) in excellent roles like Sho and Kei. I am amazed at how Gackt can change her way of talking and acting according to the age she is acting on. This is one thing you have to see. If you never see movies, see Moon Child, Crow (Brandon Lee) and the recent Final Fantasy VII - Advent Children masterpiece. All in their original languages, of course!
