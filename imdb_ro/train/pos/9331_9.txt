This movie was last week, and although at that time of the day (around 6pm) the quality of the movies is almost never good (at least here on Mexican television), we could not stop the TV. The story of Madeleine Moore truly touches you. She does not meet like a very sympathetic character at first, but seeing the whole movie, you just want to do that. This movie lets you think. And I think basically because of the role of Brooke Johnson. I've never heard of her before, and I have never seen her in another movie, but that was a great act. Complaints to Brooke. I hope to see her in another movie soon.
