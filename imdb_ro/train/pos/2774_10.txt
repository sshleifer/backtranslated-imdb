For me movies and acting is about telling a story. The story of David and Bethsheba is a tragedy that is profound and can be felt by anyone who reads and understands the biblical account. In this film I thought the stories of Gregory Peck and Susan Hayward were the best. To know and understand David's story and his journey to become the King of Israel, he made this story even more convincing. You felt his craving for a beautiful woman, Gregory Peck showed the real human side of this man who in his time was bigger than life. Hayward's suspicion, fear, reluctance, but then obedience to his authority as king was beautifully portrayed by her. It might also feel David's pain close to the fact that Uriah spent the night at the gate instead of at home. And the sadness when he was killed in the battle. Raymond Massey's strong and authoritarian condemnation of the king made me feel his anger. The sets were pretty real, and the atmosphere was credible. In general, I think this was one of the best movies of its kind. I gave her a ten rating.
