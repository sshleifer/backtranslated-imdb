O.K. I'm biased. I live near Shrewsbury in England, where this wonderful movie was shot. It still looks the same. I remember that they were shooting pretty live here, and the snow on the streets for days. Many times, when I go through Shrewsbury, I see a street or a house and I will remember this movie. George C. Scott's Scrooge is a more realistic character than many of the other versions of the screen. His physical appearance is not typical misery. Scott's is great and imposing. A man who finds the youngest than himself is inferior. We all know the story and the quotes. The book is one of the most cherished works in English. And I do not think there are many cynics who would say that people are not capable of change and redemption. This movie version is all beautiful. George C. Scott may be American, but he plays the role of the miserable Englishman with great skill. I like this movie. If you have not seen this version, I would strongly like to do it. Is it usually available for a very small amount of money ... or are you too stupid?
