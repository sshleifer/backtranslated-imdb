I feel like I have a rare uterine disease that nobody has heard of and finally I met a support group on the net! We finally found this title, asking for a response on an "expert" site on the web. And I saw this movie in my youth and was hit by the atmosphere and especially the end. I have never forgotten and have not seen it since. No one knows that he has seen the movie and almost gave up ever finding the title. Unfortunately, even knowing the name, I will probably never see the movie again because it is impossible to find commercially. Small steps ... <br /> <br /> G
