Ok, basically, this is a science-fiction popcorn movie, but it's obvious from the very beginning that he was guided with a great deal of intelligence. You can count about 10 cliques on which the film is built, but it only provides about three of them, and some of them have a turn to them, which lets you know once again that the director did not assume you are an idiot. Kurt Russell's act is really gorgeous and brings a depth of surprising and rewarding character. Recommended if you've just seen something really stupid and want to rebuild your faith!
