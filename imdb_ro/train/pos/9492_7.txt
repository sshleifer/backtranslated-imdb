This movie was nice, but for the wrong reasons. Coordinating sequences of action is ridiculous and makes the movie have some funny moments. Robert Ginty and Fred Williamson have a memorable scene together at the end, where Williamson tells Ginty: "Sure you're getting closer to guys!" I liked this film only for Ginty and Williamson, but not for the story that should have been written on the back of a napkin in four rows, and the rest would have been announced most likely. A movie with over 30 parties has only a list of credits for about 10. It seems weird that no one else has a credit in the movie, maybe they had some insight into how they would have shown the finished product. The only thing this movie has for him is that he's pretty violent, so the trio with Fred Williamson and Robert Ginty makes for a movie that's worth seeing.
