I teach Japanese for an online high school and include cultural activities so that students can learn about both the country and the language. And watching "Gung Ho" is one of the requirements. Students can buy or rent the movie. Stereotypes or not, this helps students see that others see their world and their lives differently from us. Many of my students told me they had so much enjoyed the film that they would get a copy for themselves. It is interesting to see what we value in this culture and what is cherished in their culture. I just want to get a clean TV version. I'm not really in the rough language that car workers use all the time.
