Arthur Bach is definitely unhappy in his life as a multi-millionaire and is attracted to the people "under him" in the social state - he pays for a prostitute in the opening scenes and then is very attracted to a shoplifter. <br /> <br /> Drink too much and sometimes drive while drinking, too, which, of course, is never funny. <br /> <br /> The film is great, but behind comedy there is a reality. John Gielgud wipes the floor with everyone else on the screen and creates an age character. Talk about the merit of an Oscar. Moore and Minnelli have their moments, but Gielgud as "Hobson" will remember you the most.
