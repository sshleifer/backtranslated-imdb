This is one of those movies that feel good, Saturday afternoon. It's up there with other retro blows like Flight of the Navigator. Just a cute movie with a subtle comedy to ease things. And it's fun to see how stars like Kelly Preston and Lea Thompson have changed for 20 years. Not to mention Joquin Phoenix. Personally, I really liked movies like this from time to time. Nothing too deep or too scary. Just a beautiful story. And I would never have known Mr. Phoenix if I have not read my credits recently. He was just a kid indeed when he made this film. Kelly Preston was pretty young actress in the making as well. She and Lea did a great job in this movie. I agree that it's not an Oscar-like movie. But it's worthwhile to look at. Especially if you have children in the range of 8 to 11 years. Or those who are interested in the space program.
