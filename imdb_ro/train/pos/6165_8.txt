Yes, some plots are a bit hard to follow, and Bill tends to become violent, but it's actually a delightful show I'm trying not to lose. Most episodes are very interesting and quite tense, and the acting is pretty good, though I miss Roberta Taylor as Inspector Gina Gold and Todd Carty as Gabriel Kent. I will admit that I prefer the older episodes to the newer episodes and it is a bit shameful that the program is now after it's left, as I found it easier to watch when it was at 8.00. Still, why do I like The Bill because it's not only power, but the extinguishers at the end make the next episode unthinkable. It is true that it is much more melodramatic than it was, but I really like this program as a program that does not try to take too seriously. 8/10 Bethany Cox
