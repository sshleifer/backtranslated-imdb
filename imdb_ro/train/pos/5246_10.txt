This film deserves a 10th for the brilliant portrayal of the world as it was experienced in a playboy's mind. While we have discovered that the world is morally repulsive, the film has done the best of what stories it should do, and that leads us through an experience that we would never have otherwise. Tim Meadows plays Leon Phelps so convincingly, and the story attracted me so much to Leon's anxious world that I momentarily forgot that I was watching a parody of the playboy world and felt compelled to rebel against her. Here is the overturning of the film because its great and daring achievement in stories comes at the price of its own success. Understanding that the vast majority of filming will only respond to the story of this horror film and reject that story, I hesitate to misunderstand them and admit that I loved it. I loved him not only for his fascination in the lying playboy mind, not just for the funny portrayal of the idiot human sex, but for his courage to explore fearlessly what is in the shadow of heterosexuality. In addition, it's just fun.
