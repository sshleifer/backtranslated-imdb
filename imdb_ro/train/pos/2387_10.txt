I have a child aged six months at home and from time to time I fight very badly. One morning she had a difficult time to fall asleep when the theme song of the doodle bops came to T.V. He stopped crying almost instantly, and the rest of the show was satisfied. I put her in her bouncy chair and saw her feet drop, swing her arms, and actually laugh at this show. She kept her amused and happy all the time. I also got a video about them so that, in moments when my little boy is embarrassed, I have something to reassure him. Granted, late in the night, if you wake up with colic, to give birth to candy, there are no tea cups, but sure they are at hand when I need some time to work in the household, etc. The biggest surprise about doodle candy is that my baby does not even like to see T.V. It would be rather on the floor playing with a toy or our small toy poodle than watching TV yet, the doodle candy captured her total attention. I do not know if she will continue to like them in the future, but she is still attached.
