A sharp political commentary posturing as a story of age is what this movie is like. The annoying thing is that it works efficiently on both levels. It should not do it, it does. This story about four boys and a girl who grew up in 1953, Communist Belgrade is a warming of the heart. It's what gentlemen are about classic cinema. Obviously, in 1953, Belgrade is not as tough as a dictatorial and fascist environment that communist society is often portrayed. You can listen to rock and roll music, one of the songs played is "Hey Babu Riba," which is the title of the movie. But jeans can not be bought or some drugs that are illegal to possess. Contrary to the heavy criticism of a communist society, this film does this by showing how it affects the lives of the five protagonists who refer to themselves as to our four. The girl who has a father in exile in Italy and awaits a passport for her mother and she travels to join him, the piano taken from communion from one of the boys, the sudden gift of your home and your home to the new acquaintances because they need of her. Boys spend a lot of time listening to music, and it is clear that they despise the fascism that communism created while engaging in tiffs with a fascist quack that Stalin tattooed on his hands. All this leads to the actions they take later and the memory of a fading time, as this film was released in 1986 on the twilight of the Soviet Empire. A great movie worth seeing again and again. "Repentance is not your enemy, but it is not even the friend of anybody."
