It looks like this film polarizes us. Or you love him or you hate him. I loved them. I agree with the comment (s) that said, just "feel" it. Also at the beginning of the film, Tom Cruise shows his girlfriend a painting by Monet - an impresionist painter. Monet's style is to paint in small drops, so closing the painting looks like a mess, but from a distance you can tell what the subject is. Cruise mentions that painting has a "vanilla sky". I think this is a clue to the movie. This movie is like an impressionist painting. It's an impressionist shooting! And it is not a coincidence that the title of the film refers to that painting. This is not your typical linear plot. More thinking is needed. There is symbolism and there are scenes that are jumping around and not, you will not always be sure what's going on. But at the end, everything is explained. <br /> <br /> You will have to focus on this movie, but I think people are making the mistake of focusing too much on it. When it's over, you have to think about it. If you try to realize that it's unleashed, you'll be overwhelmed. Let her happen ... "go" with her ... keep an open mind. Remember what you see and save the analysis for later. I found all the top performances and I thought it was extremely unique, wild of creativity and spellbinding. But I will not criticize the intelligence of those of you who did not like it. Appeal to a certain taste. If you like existential, psychedelic, philosophical, provocative, challenging spiritual movies, then you see it. If you prefer something a little easier, then skip it. But if you like what I have described, then you will certainly enjoy it.
