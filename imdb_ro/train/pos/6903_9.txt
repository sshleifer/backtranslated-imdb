This little-appreciated movie is one of my favorites. I can look over and over. Dreyfus and Braga are commanding, but Raul Julia is stealing! Gomes Addams, with a threatening and humorous tone, with the tone for this irresistible paradise of this very common storyline. Generally, without being understood and appreciated, Moon Over Parador lets you get out of the box and join the fun going on on the screen. Two fingers up!
