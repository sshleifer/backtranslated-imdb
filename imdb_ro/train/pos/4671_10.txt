Kudos for the writers of this film to create an extremely exciting drama. The development of curiosity is an indication of a tame and well-trained writing team. The audience member can only help, but feel that he has to harm the emotional decisions that penetrate the brain against the libidinal. The visitor has the opportunity to develop his character, although his predictions are rarely validated. Credit is also due to filmmakers to breathe life into the frame. The wooden shop is transformed into a unique personality while the film unfolds, with its own features, mistakes, a variety of very busy relationships, and, of course, an inexorable fate linked to that of the other directors. <br /> <br /> Make sure you catch it at your local art house.
