In Lizzie Borden's "Crimes of Love" (1992), Sean Young plays a D.A. in Atlanta. She is the only one too involved with a man (Patrick Bergin) who presents himself as a famous fashion photographer and seduces women, takes pictures of compromised, then leaves them. Naturally, this lonely young man decides to enter the false life of the bell, pretending to be a prey, intending to bring him to justice. I meet, I make love, then the next thing he knows is in his lap, being spanked. (Note: The spanking scene is only in the "unrated" version of this movie. The Ro version also omit some other scenes that would make the plot more comprehensible.) This psychological thriller includes several feminine nudes and disturbing scenes such as Bergin chasing one of his victims around the room, beating her with a riding culture. Like a thriller, "Love Crimes" is best when Sean Young plays his cat and - playing with Bergin, trying to catch him in an incriminating act. It is regrettable that the film does not end, stops. This is true. Director Lizzie Borden may have just finished the story, but after 92 minutes the credits are rolling, and we are left with a wonderful "what happened?" astonishment. Young's plan is played in the style of engagement, but the lack of a coherent end will be a stop for some viewers. Dan (daneldorado @ yahoo.com)
