He saw the movie twice in community projects and loved him a lot. I work in the Jane Finch community and I feel that the movie really captured some of the essence and flavor of the community - grit, determination, exuberance, creativity, in your nature with a dose of despair. Writing, dialogue and acting are solid, and I find myself in the story of young Raya as they struggle to achieve their goals and not get lost in the process. The great dance sequences, not just the bodies that move easily and with electricity, but the room moves with great fluidity and intelligence. All the characters are multidimensional - none good or bad, and the characters of the women are admirably strong. This is a movie that has a strong heart of beating and celebrates the unrepeatable spirit of youth, hip-hop and communities like Jane Finch.
