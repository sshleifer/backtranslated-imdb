All the good movies "inspire" some direct movies to the copied film. I was afraid that the "Gladiator" was not really a good movie, because I had never seen a movie that had anything like something like a novel on the new shelves for months. Then I saw the last offer of Full Moon, Demonicus. I'm a fan of the Full Moon Puppetmaster and the Blood Puppies, but I've never seen one of their puppet movies. Anyway ... <br /> <br /> Demonicus chronicles what happens to a group of camps in the Alps. One of the campsites, James, finds a cave with ancient gladiator artifacts and feels like having a helmet from a body and trying it out. He becomes possessed and, as a demonic gladiator, Tyrannus, is forced to kill his friends to revive the body, which is the true Tyrannus. Considering that, like many Full Moon movies, this has little or no budget. Sometimes editing and directing were so amateur that I swear I was looking at the Blair Witch Project. The attempts to cut limbs and heads remind me of a sketch from Monty Python. Guns, though seemingly real, really look plastic. Apparently, he was shot by a group of friends with a digital video camera over a weekend. Granted, there is nothing wrong with such films, do not rent this by waiting for a technical masterpiece. It seems to have been research and screenplay because, although Tyrannus does not behave like a gladiator until the end, at least he speaks Latin. actually enjoyed this movie. Not as much as a killer doll movie, maybe, but Full Moon still offers! The only thing that disappointed me was that there was no Videozone to the Full Moon at the end of the year!
