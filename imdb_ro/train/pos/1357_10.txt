Wow what episode! After last week, when I saw Mellisa steadily making friends about Annie's and Brandi's friendships, I almost caught up. But it was nothing until he saw Mellisa's tirade after being fired. Seeing her casting around, casting obscenities and screaming for someone to take his purse, was absolutely the most hilarious thing ever TV has ever had. She kept shouting at people who were not preparing to take their "all" clothes as if someone else wore one of her hideous outfits. Mellisa is 40 years old, and you can still mess up with temperament? Then Joan calls Annie and Brandie in the name of the book and gets up and out of the show! Both rivers are wounded brothers who have stayed on the show for so long to maintain their ratings. Mellisa crying and refusing to make an exit interview, just proving in America what everyone thought, you are a spoiled child. WAH WAH I can not make my way! I like how Annie told the cameras that he could manipulate Mellisa to think the same way, and then he did exactly that. Mellisa is by far the smartest competitor and clearly deserves to win the game.
