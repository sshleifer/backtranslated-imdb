Make me think about it for days after I saw it. This is for me the sign of a great movie. Eyes Wide Shut had the same effect on me. I'm tired of these people who need these happy endings at the Hollywood cookie-cutter. I'm thinking of seeing her again tonight to understand the plot better - but no matter the emotional messages of the movie were felt.
