I do not know under what conditions the director of Visconti decided to film James Cain's novel "The Postman Always Rings Twice" (I'm not sure even if Viscounti acquired the rights of the book), but the resulting film is definitely interesting. It's not the best version of Cain's story (I like the best version since 1981), but because of the excellent direction of Visconti and casting Clara Calamai and Massimo Girotti (a very sensual couple), it's a must for fans noir. Visconti blends neorealism with noir sensations to great effect. The film is not perfect, though. My main complaint is that the movie is a little too long for his good; the story moves at a very slow pace (I do not think Visconti was very good at editing his films). I think the noir movie works better with a short running time. Fortunately, Calamai and Girotti are magnetic players who are interested in viewers. However, as much as I like this movie and remakes, I think no one has made the definitive version of Cain's book, much appreciated.
