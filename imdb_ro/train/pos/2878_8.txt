For a long time in my life, I did not like this movie, nor did I like this movie, but not as much as many. I looked recently (sleeping, quite funny) and liked more than I did since I was six or something. Now I appreciate more, as I do with some other Disney classics I've recently watched (including "Sleeping Beauty" and "Pinnochio" or whatever you say). <br /> <br /> Now I really appreciate the animation, the smart "Disney" plot, the mummy of the mice, the expressed emotions and the plot. The animation is very well done, often it seems you are wherever the other characters are, watching them. The animation also features background styles, including the city (which is shown twice in a nutshell). Disney changes this from the original fairy tale in a surprisingly good way, by injecting intelligent compilers such as mice that make up the clothes and the essential part (I usually do not like Disney movies too much if they are not similar to the original story but with this does not bother me too much, I feel they have made the necessary changes to make this movie a Disney movie, I often do not think Disney has changed a book well in some movies). <br /> <br /> You know the story already, Cinderella is a girl working for her horrible stepmother. She goes to a ball with her birth and loses her glass goggle ... This is a movie that has to be seen with other people. The immediate family is not good enough. To enjoy this, I recommend you to watch it with friends (and immediate family if you like. :-)). <br /> <br /> I recommend this to people who like at least Disney, people who like fairytales and people who like mice. Enjoy! :-)
