Most of the comments were positive, but I would like to add that viewers should also focus on the sets. The set designer used a lot of beautiful decorative artistic treatments along with beautiful buildings, stairs, doors, furniture and so on. It's worth paying attention. The film is driven by characterization and symbolism, which is very rich. All gangster actors were thrown away - it was like seeing old friends and it was a treat. Dialogue was sometimes funny, but sometimes moved and I think it should have been like that. This is the film of the film. It was made by people, by people who love the environment. Do not miss this.
