really an excellent movie, one of the best I've ever seen. Touching and simple - just like life, sometimes crying sometimes laughs and it's just beautiful. not too much, as it should be. He really loved the idea of ​​the film, no one is bad or good, all or just people, sometimes they make mistakes, mostly because of the pressure of society, everyone tries to stay strong and some succeed more than others, and the most important is that you have no reason to upset - you can do it, but eventually the anger disappears and then you have to let the love come back, though it's hard, there is real happiness. The big actors and cast, the movie really gets into the movie's feelings. <br /> <br /> I recommend seeing him, especially if you love to see the life of the Italians.
