Perhaps some people might think this film is slow. Still, this "slow burning" allows it to affect the viewer deeply. Like the first wonderful scene: First, we can hear the voices; then we are allowed to see the characters; Finally, the camera slows down slowly and sideways and we see another character, a young man who just stays there, apparently does not even listen to the conversation or at least does not really care. The fact that this young man will be the leader shows the strategy of the film: allowing the character to develop and be determined by the environment, but without noticing the points more than necessary. People come and go, get in and out of his life. Although most of the film follows it (and most support characters are only seen when they are close to him, defined according to the relationship he maintains with), we are induced to believe that we are objective, so subtle is the director's touch.
