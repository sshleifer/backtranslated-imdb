This was the eighth and last film Columbia Whistler and the only one without Richard Dix, who withdrew from the movies and died the following year. It's still a competent thriller, the car went without it perfectly, but? something was missing: Dix! The stories of the Whistler series were always interesting, sometimes brilliant, often atmospheric noir scenarios, but not only Whistler himself had clutched on the screen, Dix did. the young man who came out for a full week gets the need to marry in the heavy rain, but is blamed when the potential bride disappears first, then she is found to be married before she feels angry. Is it possible for the groom to be deactivated, even when the private dick she has hired to find suddenly on muscles and blades or is she blind? Who twists what the question is. Michael Duane in his penultimate film is fine if a wonderful moment of Lenore Aubert came in the movie Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein and Richard Lane was great as always borrowed from Boston Blackie. Also, the only trip where Whistler himself has to get wet to walk in the rain if he has not been sprawled with sea foam in Voice. Many things have happened in the last hour, well worth looking again, as usual to fans of the genre like me. The Whistler radio series, started in 1942, continued until 1955, recording nearly 700 half-hour shows, almost all of which were available on mp3 and based on what we have heard so far, which almost deserves to be heard.
