People forget that there were several ripples King Kong - Congo, King Kong Vs. Godzilla, King Kong (1976), all oppose each other, but YETI is on its own. It borrows only one item from King Kong and what is the attraction of the animal with a woman. The myth of YETI is based on Bigfoot (not as King Kong), and archeologists have been fascinated, at some point they existed, but there is no scientific evidence to prove it. This movie is hard to find, but it's worth watching. The first time I looked at Elvira's "Lessons of Dark Performing Arts" at the beginning of the 1980s. He sent me chills back like a child, especially when YETI got angry. I saw it again, around 01:00 on ABC 2 to 3 years ago. Seeing him again made me appreciate him more, has some general effects (for his time) and the story involves a dumb boy and his dog and a bad businessman who wants to kill YETI for his own purposes. Also, the music is quite cool, very similar to YETI. :-) <br /> <br /> Gianfranco Parolini and the Yetians create a great monster atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Vote 7 and a half out of 10.
