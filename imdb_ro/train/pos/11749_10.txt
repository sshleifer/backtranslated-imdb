Finally, we get a series of televisions where we can see the talent that works! Episode 1 was great! The script has given us a little more than usual, yes, it's still "I'm not your dad, I'm your daddy and you, you cheated on me!" garbage, but the script allowed actors to feel and live those real moments rather than show us what they would feel if they were - as many TV soaps do. <br /> <br /> Working with the camera gave us something more than usual, there were no boring photographs of repeated angles for hours but there were no unnecessary shots in photos or handcrafted carp of the camera to add an "artistic", gave us what we needed to see and also some beautiful landscapes, too! Nothing has been dramatized too much or melodramatic were real people in a real place dealing with real situations, the show had nothing in the drama and was completely relevant. It has been a relief to be exposed to a real action and so enjoyable to allow our country to see how talented our actors are when they are offered a real scenario, a real opportunity! Thank you Tony Tilse, Sam Miller, channel ten and all the tower and the crew - a great job! please continue what you do, your efforts are much appreciated and do not go unnoticed!
