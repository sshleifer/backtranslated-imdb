"Dressed To Kill" is one of the best thrillers ever made. Her relationships with sex and violence make this movie for adults. Brian De Palma once again proves why no other director can match the use of the camera to tell a story. He directs many scenes without dialogue and tells him much of his story, strictly by using his pictures, and Pino Donnagio's shining score. Recorded in Panavision, the film MUST be seen on the widescreen, as De Palma uses the full width of the film to tell his story. Cropped, video, "Dressed To Kill," is barely the same movie. The solid performances of his cast, the superb direction, and probably the best ever film score, make "Kidnapped" that you have to see.
