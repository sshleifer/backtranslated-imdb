While this movie is not a classic of any stretch, it's really fun as I remember. I saw her 15 years ago on HBO and I loved the movie. It was written by the same guy who wrote and directed "Arthur," and though not as fun as the movie, it shows the potential that Steve Gordon has touched with "Arthur."
