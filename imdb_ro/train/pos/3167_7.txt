This is one of those films that explores the cultural culture of people born in Eastern Europe in Western cultures. <br /> <br /> Love on Tokyo Time is a sad movie about the inability of opponents to attract due to major cultural differences. Ken, rock n'roll fanatics, marries Kyoto, a Japanese girl, to stay in the United States when her visa expires. Marriage is expected to be just temporary, that is, until the Kyoto will again gain legal status. But, Ken, who seems to lose himself in any relationship, likes his Kyoto preference and is trying very hard to make things work. This, despite the fact that his friend suggests that Kyoto dumping and the elimination of all the commitments to the girls is bad for rock n 'roll, except that it inspires some songs about broken hearts and all that. But Kyoto comes from a strictly traditional Japanese education and does not expect to be married to Ken for so long. Not only is she home and wants to go back to Japan. It's sad that someone somehow Ken thinks he can love and be with all this, unless he thinks he found someone to feel that way, the little girl does not expect to stay so long. It's not like he does not like Ken, but he's just used to a whole lifestyle. She says, "I can not tell him how I feel in English, and Ken can not tell me how he feels in Japanese." It's a pretty sad love story with a techno-nintendo soundtrack of the 80's. I took the Loving on Time movie in Tokyo for reminding me of one of my favorite 80's Tokyo Pop movies. And for those who enjoyed "Loving on Time Tokyo", see Tokyo Pop (a New York singer goes to Japan and joins a Japanese American band), except for the movie with a happy ending. >
