It is remarkable that, for Young Young's support players, Ford has expressed less known actors than others. This not only strengthens the focus of his film on Lincoln's central character, but gives the public a refreshing insight into Lincoln as a man of his place and time, a man involved, as each of us is inexorable, into problems and feelings of his time and seeking the way to solving them. Not so much in Fonda Lincoln's words and actions but in front of the reactions of the players who support Ford as the story of forming Lincoln's younger world view, the sense of place in society and politics, and the way people responded Mr Lincoln's words and deeds have put his trust in this man whom he has considered to earn his respect and mercy. Try to try: instead of concentrating on Henry Fonda, the next time you see "Young Mr. Lincoln will turn your attention to the supporting characters - I expect you to be rewarded with a deeper appreciation of both Lincoln and I like to suspect that Ford's story through the reactions of Lincoln's Fonda support characters might have appealed to David Lean when he directed Omar Sharif in Doctor Zhivago, support at Zhivago who say about Zhivago.
