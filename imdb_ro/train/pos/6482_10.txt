I was just thirteen years old when I first saw this series and look back on DVD again thirty years later. The images from the opening credits have never left me. It affected my vision of the world and of the peoples in it. My parents were with me long enough to see the series with me and we always talked about the program afterwards. He gave me a love for studying history and the highest grades I took the public examinations of our school! <br /> <br /> Sir Laurence Olivier's voice and delivery is timeless and perfect. I have the feeling that the people who lived through it would feel that this is their version of the history of the Second World War. I can never imagine getting bored looking at me. Perhaps a series of similar cold war might be envisaged now, though, which could replace Sir Laurence is hard to imagine. <br /> <br /> l buy it!
