I have not seen many movies online for most of my life, but if I choose any of them, I would choose Spatula Madness, a smart reference to most movies, such as a star trooper (etc.), using a camera and the intelligence of steel, Jason Steele has mastered the art of transforming a normal picture into a painting and then putting it all together with frame-by-frame animation to create a tumultuous world of spatula. the story begins in the middle, looks like for excited directors? then the middle is in the beginning and so on, when I first looked at it, I was expecting a pussy look, but Jason, like me, shows Loves, so he took every detail to the fullest. although I do not recommend it for kids, or anyone else I like, but please search it on the net (a short film, look for a movie cow), its style reminds me of the south park, but less violent. 10 for the layout, 6 for the laugh and 6 for the story, it all comes to a paper of 10/10, Jason Steele, I'm anxious to see the movie.
