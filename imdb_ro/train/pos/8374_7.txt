OK, this movie was great. I do not think it was the best movie ever made, but it was definitely fun. My brother and I continue to play scenes from time to time and occasionally remove the film from the closet, throw the dust and clog it. Glad to the end, but a great concept. This is a movie that you just have to look at critics together and enjoy. Judgment is the victory for Robot Jox.
