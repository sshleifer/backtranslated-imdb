Not at Spongebob Squarepants I saw a bigger cartoon on TV. The colors are wonderful, the voices can not be better, the characters are so original, great cartoon. Hope Nickolodean continues to develop this cartoon. I hope the DVD season will appear soon! I like cartoons like this and I hope more people will find themselves in this cartoon. It's really hard to find Season DVD, so if someone finds a store selling it, please tell me. The only Catscratch merchandise available on Nick Shop is a big T-shirt but very expensive !!! If you love Spongebob; and who does not? you will also love Catscratch!
