Tenshu is imprisoned and sentenced to death. When the electric shock survives, government officials give him the possibility of being electrocuted to a greater degree or accepting some experiments. Choose the experiment and place it in a large metallic cell with a bad offender who survived the electric shock. They can have any desire in the room (in reason), but they can not leave. after a few days, meals are reduced to one day a day and room temperature is set to 100. After several alarms are sounds at intervals so they can not sleep. One day a "witch" enters the cell (though a piece of glass) What will happen next, I'll let you find out. I may be in the minority here, but I liked building, it was interesting to me. Now if the gain was half as good as you build it would have rated it much higher. <br /> <br /> My class: C + <br /> <br /> Blaster's 2 DVD set Extras: Disc 1) Cut by director; Trailers for "Versus", "Aragami", "Gas Station Attack" and "Deadly Outlaw Rekka" 2) Theatrical Cut; Comment with Hideo Sakaki, Ryuhei Kitamura, Sakaguchi Takuand Tsutomu Takahashi; Team and crew interviews; Behind the scenes; Trailer original; and promo Promo
