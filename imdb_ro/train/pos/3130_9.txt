I am Belgian and I grew up in the sixties. Most of the American series were featured here (the original language with subtitles), and Batman was one of the first to be interested. Unfortunately, this caused a "panic hysteria" among mothers, because Batman was considered too violent. Look, compare the innocence of that series to what children can see today. So, because of my overprotective mother in the 1960s, I just had the chance to see two or three episodes! I was so frustrated that I started collecting comic books and bubble books (I still got them!) To compensate them. I also have my viewing slides ... I had a need to see the crusade with my head. All children need a kind of hero. A few years later, I managed to see the re-run as a teenager and I liked it a lot. Tongue-to-cheek action would have escaped me when I saw her as a child, but I understood it at the age of 17. Yes, I watched everyone now and my soul occasionally on the internet episodes because they did not release the series on DVD (to my knowledge) Tonight I enjoyed the "Return to cave bats "... it was a pleasure to watch because it was full of trivia and jokes inside. To see Adam and Burt was a delight, and this TV movie is simply fantastic in every aspect. They play themselves while they have their songs in the evening. Congratulations to those who have produced this great nostalgic "feast" ... I'll follow her again. My advice to all Batman fans is: SEE! Rent it !!! Lend it from a friend! Buy it !!! I would never expect to note this as a 9/10 ... Very well done!
