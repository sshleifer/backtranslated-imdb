_Les Acteurs_ is the absurd story of Jean-Pierre Marielle desperately waiting for a cup of hot water, the story of a conspiracy against the actors, the story of older actors whose career is less active than they were, but an amazing tribute to French actors and their cinema. Supported by a strong reflection on cinema and action (the fourth wall, hidden rooms, to play or not to play), the story of this film where most of those famous actors play their own role (not to interfere with living life in front of the camera - the movie is not a voyeur) is rather vague and follows the actors in the series of episodes that make the film quite funny. While Andr√© Dussolier quits the film and lets Josiane Balasko play his role (a great actress, she really feeds especially when, in the role of Dussolier, she is struggling around her), actors running on the street asking for autographs , and gossip is happening, we recognize the playlists of other scenes where each (or others) have played. In fact, for those who do not know the actors (most of them at least in the 1950s) or do not know French cinema, this film has a lower interest, since most references will be missed, but it will provide yet a good perspective on the reflection on aging, on acting, on public life ...
