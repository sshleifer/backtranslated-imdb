The simple hand-room offers a near-documentary feeling to this movie and also refers to dogmatic movies. Are you ever bored with those Hollywood-style movies, with gentlemen receiving missions envious? Fed with the married policeman, the divorced man, but with his family, the personalized donut and the hunter? Have you ever wondered how real police work? Well, for Germany, this movie shows you. Located in the north between West Germany and East Germany, the former DDR, a liberated post-office clerk, begins his fresh job in politics. She quickly finds her way around regular customers and is used to life as a cop ... but it's not fun at all. Other German films, such as Derrick, Der Alte et and others, have dignified officers calmly speaking with the suspects. These police officers have to deal with the smallest of the social scale. Good dialogue and realism make it an interesting view, even more if you know a little of Germany.
