With a simplistic story and an interesting heroine, it was the horror movie that started it all. John Carpenter brings to life a nightmare on Halloween night, when Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis as her debut, career role) and her evil friends plan a night of mysterious fun - just to cross the paths with an unceasing psychopath from hell. <br /> <br /> Michael Myers escaped from a crazy aslyum near ... cut his sister fifteen years earlier, now returns to Haddonfield, the sleeping town of Illinois where his assassination took place. Once looking at Laurie, after pulling a pack in the abandoned house where she lived, she starts to feed her and terrorize her, transforming her night of fun into a terror, while he shakes someone on his way to reach her. Cinematography and beautiful illumination really do this terrible horror movement ... with the ghastly long blows feels constantly as if you were being followed by the serial killer in the maniac. Myers is hidden until it was fully revealed at the interesting conclusion. Although "Halloween" is certainly overcome, it is by no means less cold. Only the idea is the induction of goose bumps, and this little shocker is one of the most well-known and memorable horror films made so far ... gave rise to seven sequels and, finally, Rob Zombie's remake, and has set a new standard for horror that still exists today.
