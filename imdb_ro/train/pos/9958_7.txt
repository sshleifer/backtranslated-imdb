It's better than amazing (Ballroom strict, Shall We Dance?) (Japanese Version), but it's completely respectable and pleasantly different in parts. <br /> <br /> I am an English teacher and find some of the ignorance about language in some of these quite troublesome reviews, for example: "The name should scream not look" How it moves " when the movie titles can ignore the grammar "<br /> <br /> There is nothing inherently incorrect about the English grammar in the Caribbean. It's not just a standard English grammar from the Canadian Dialogue commentaries do not fit me. I put the subtitles for that I am an English-speaking Canadian standard, so I automatically assumed I would have trouble understanding everything. It was not so difficult and gave a distinct flavor different from the other step movies I've seen so American. > I liked that this movie was set up in Toronto and, in fact, I want to be even more clearly established there loved that the heroine was so atypically expressed. I liked the routines step by step. I liked the character of my mother. I have felt that many of the problems in the film have been approached more subtly than is characteristic of dance films. In conclusion, if you tend to like dancing movies, then this is a decent one. If you have problems of superiority with regard to the grammar of the English standard you have raised, your narrow words may have difficulty enjoying this movie.
