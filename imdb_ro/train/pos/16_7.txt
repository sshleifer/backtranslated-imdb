We have discovered that this is a romantic story that has a beautiful ending and feels beautiful in general. It's not a Hallmark Hall of Fame family, with marriage before marriage considered a "normal" behavior, but considering Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro, I would have expected a more strange film, at least linguistically. <br /> <br /> The most memorable part of the film is how hard it is to learn to read and write when you are already an adult. This is the great theme of the movie and involves some touching scenes, but, frankly, the movie is not so memorable. It's still a fairly gentle and nice story that I would be happy to recommend.
