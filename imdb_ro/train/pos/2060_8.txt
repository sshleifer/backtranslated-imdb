This movie is not your typical horror movie. It has some humorous and deadly scenes that can be funny. I personally liked the movie because of his off-beat humor. It's definitely not a super scary movie, which is good if you do not want to be scared and paranoid afterwards. I liked the performance of hillbilly and lester ... very credible. I think I'm going to paint my red hair like the girl from the scarecrow - very cool! However, generally, renting for humor campy and non-typical horror experience.
