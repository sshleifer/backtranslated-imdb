This movie won every one of the ten votes I have given her! Thank you for making a movie worth watching. You have shown the world, you can still write, direct, produce, and play in a black film without negative stereotypes. The poetry was wonderful, with hats for poets and musicians. I saw her last night, for I fell in love for my sake again. I will have added it to my current collection of films and will recommend it to my friends and family. Please continue to produce quality, do not worry about the quantity .... Thank you again, and the best wishes and blessings for you!
