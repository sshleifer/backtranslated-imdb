"Bell Book and Candle" was recently introduced on cable. Although we have not seen it for a while, we decided to look at this comedy. Based on James Van Druten's Broadway hit, which was a vehicle for Rex Harrison and Lilli Palmer in the early fifties, the film was adapted for screen by Daniel Taradash. The film was directed by Richard Quine, who turned the play into a delightful comedy. Obviously, judging by some of the comments made by IMDb, the big issue seems to be the association of the two stars who collaborated on Vertigo, launched in the same year. The movie audience did not believe anything about the age difference when this movie was released. In fact, most older male stars of that period have always been involved with many more younger women. The film set in Manhattan during Christmas is a delightful comedy that delighted viewers. Kim Novak was at the height of her beauty, because it is clear that her camera worshiped her no matter what she played. The witch who becomes human, Gillian, is charming. James Stewart, who plays editor Shep 'Henderson, is also seen for his sake. Stewart was an excellent comedic actor who shows why he was on top. In supporting the roles, the wonderful Elsa Lanchester, who plays Queenie, is a welcome addition to any movie, as it turns out here. Jack Nicole Holroyd, Gillian's brother, is also good. Ernie Kovacs is also seen as writer Sidney Radlitch. This is a great way to spend a night at home watching "Bell Book and Candle".
