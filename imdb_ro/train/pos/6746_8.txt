This is an extraordinary example of a fairly simple film story Noir, which is treated exceptionally well - thanks to an excellent direction of Otto Preminger, as well as beautiful acting shows. Dana Andrews plays the role of a furious detective who uses his fists too often instead of his brain. Immediately after the start of the film, Andrews is Islamized for this, and he is warned that if this continues, he will be out of the force. A little later, while investigating a crime, he is attacked by a suspect, and Andrews is forced to fight to protect himself. This time he does not use excessive force, but the attacker is killed. Andrews is panicking and supposed he will not believe it, so he's trying to cover up death - though an innocent man is ultimately blamed for murder. There's a lot more to the film than this - including a plot involving a slimy son of a bitch (Gary Merrill) and a love interest for Andrews (Gene Tierney). On the whole, this is one of the best examples of the genre - with a rough dialogue, superb illumination and a simple but very effective story. This is how it should have been Noir.
