This must be the best adaptation I've ever seen, and I think it's very close to the book. What really does this must be seen, however, is the casting of the two main actors. Wonderful Timothy Dalton is the best Rochester I have seen on screen the screening and the tragic, while Zela Clarke is the perfect combination of strength, courage, shyness and gentleness like Jane. The story (as I'm sure most people know) is this, young and simple Jane Eyre is a teacher at a charity school for 1800 girls who advertises her as a governor in the newspapers. The governor's position is being offered at Thornfield Hall to guide Adele, the young lounge room, the mysterious and respected owner, Mr. Rochester. As the moon continues, he falls in love with Jane and puts in some situations to try to see if Jane is so in love with him and her. However, there is a secret still waiting to be discovered at Thornfield Hall and when its effects are devastating. This is a moving and well-behaved drama with beautiful locations and gorgeous costumes plus, as I said earlier, acting excellent, especially from Zelah and Timothy.
