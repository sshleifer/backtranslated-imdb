Some people have said that starting with the 11th season, South Park has started a tendency to leave behind the political satire that puts them in hand for superficial hats; but this can not be further from the truth. While this episode is spoofing the Living Dead series, there are more. It's a satire of how people treat homeless people. Characters say things like "pretend to be just like us" or "want to be human." This episode attacks a culture of people who ignore the inferior class, which are often just their luck. So yes, it's still a satire and also a great spoof. What do you want more?
