This movie is a riot. I do not remember the last time I had such a movie party. I've seen some good comedies in my time and they're usually pretty funny. But this is a large line of wall. I think Best in Show is the last movie I laughed so hard and so much. The film was non-stop until the end of the year when they made 5 minutes of pure sentimental plot. Besides, it is a constant barrage of lining and rushing situations. I would like to see him again before leaving the theater, because it's Zucker movies where you do not have all the jokes the first time. You have to see it two or three times to get it all in. As far as the film itself is concerned, it could have used better editing, it's sometimes weird, but we have to forgive it. All the characters are wonderful. It's not like a movie Adam Sandler, where he tries to be funny and everyone else suffers around him and is the bottom of the joke. I think I will remember all the main characters for the years that come, because they are all so enjoyable. No victim in this movie. I also thank God for having a 45-year-old actress to play her girlfriend. Catherine Keener interprets her and she is a girlfriend in this movie. You just want women like her to exist. She is not "10" as some of the other leading ladies, but in some ways her smile is warmer than Julia Roberts overbested. If you see the trailer for this movie you might not think too much about it. I assure you, the trailer is not right. They do not give all the good jokes. Only a few mediocre ones. Oh, and one more thing. I hope critics have put this on the top ten list. Many of them complain that comedies are not getting the recognition they deserve and that they do not put it on their list at the end of the year. That means Ebert!
