This was the Modest I Did not Know! It was suggested and summarized in the comic book for the unions to sell to the newspapers! Lee and Janet Batchler were true Modesty Blaise fans who were given Job The Dream - tell a prequel story of Modesty that fans have never seen before. In their audio comments, they have admitted that they have made changes in its origin to make the story easier. The "Purists" should also remember that we really do not know if everything she told Miklos was true because she "stopped for time". I did not rent or borrow the DVD like the other "commentators", I bought it! And I do not want a refund! I looked at it three times and did not sleep through it! The excellent dialogue and the well-drawn characters I cared for (even the bad guy Miklos) just like in novels and comics! And I can not wait for the next movie, Modesty (and Willie), especially if this "prequel" is a sign of what's next!
