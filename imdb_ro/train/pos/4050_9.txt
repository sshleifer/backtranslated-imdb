Anyone who finds this boring movie is a hopeless trap, which should be based on car movies and romantic comedies. This movie is riveted and does not have a tedious moment. Why? Because it is largely based on intelligent dialogue between real people at a time of crisis and details their efforts to survive that crisis. Repeat - smart dialogue! That's what characterizes almost all of Rohmer's films, and that's why many do not like it. They prefer action. Okay, let them spend the rest of their lives watching action movies, while those with taste and discrimination will continue to search for movies like this one. Rohmer has always been accused of being "talky". Well, it is, but for me it's a compliment, not a critique. Shakespeare was talky. Is there a word game than "Hamlet?" Whenever the subject or theme of an artwork consists of ideas and conflicts over values, there must be a need for a discussion of these ideas and values, which is largely about this film. Aristocracy and Noble Birth egalitarianism; loyalty to old friends that is put to the final test when that friend takes what we think is a wrong way; the value of human life and the responsibility to help save that life, even if the person who possesses that life is not so pretty or even despicable. (Anyone ever heard of Dostoevsky or "Crime and Punishment?") These are the ones about which this film is about. The two causes of this film are impeccable, as if they were born to play these roles. Lucy Russell, who is English and speaks French as the second language, is particularly brilliant. Do yourself a favor and watch this riveting movie. This may be the last movie on this Master screen.
