This is very dated, but this is part of the charm of this 1933 film. You can say the same thing for most pre-code movies; they are just different and usually in an interesting way. It was short time, Spencer Tracy's great actress and beautiful girl and the sweetness of the character of Loretta Young, who kept me looking and enjoying this fascinating but fascinating film. It would have been hard to find a girl more beautiful than "Trinna", played by the 20-year-old who was already making the 50th film! (She started acting as a little kid, and the fact that they made movies fast in the old days.) The camera, though carefully focused throughout the movie, went several times on Loretta's face and eyes and I she was fascinated by her beauty. Playing a crocheted man with a cynical vision of life, Bill "Tracy" slowly turned into a loving man thanks to Trinna. Spencer has given his lines here with such a nature that you do not know he is acting. Although they have small roles, supporters of Walter Connolly, Marjorie Rambeau, Arthur Hohl and Glenda Farrell leave lasting impressions long after seeing this 75-minute Film. I was particularly fascinated by Connolly's role as minister / father of the camp. The story is somewhat elevated, but - hey - that's the movies. This story is about two victims the only victims of the Great Depression who are trying to survive in a "Hooverville" camp and end up being a very moving story.
