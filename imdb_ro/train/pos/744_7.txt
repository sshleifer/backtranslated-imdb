"Foxes" is a film I remember for portraying teenagers in the late 70s. Because I'm exactly the age of Jodie Foster, I've referred to this movie. It deals with the frustrations, temptations, relationships and rebellion of the youth. The soundtrack is great, for example. "More than a Feel" by Boston and the sad numbers like "On the Radio" by Donna Summer. The music of our late teens. Yeah, I always remember that, even if it was not huge.
