The film follows the events of the novel "The Most Beloved of the Earth" (can be translated as "The most beloved of the people"), written by Marin Preda (a very controversial book and film), a novel that has become something like the "Bible" or the Hamlet story, very popular and difficult to obtain, because of its satirical content on the communist regime. It represents the drama of the intellectual, humanist man in a "red" world. A movie full of passion, fear, sexuality, all the great ingredients for a great film recipe. One of the greatest Romanian films, despite the psychological accusation (after all, it is a European film).
