Roseanne's last season was a rollercoaster ride of madness. This final episode does exactly what a previous comment tells us, as much as we might have thought we knew the characters we did not. Roseanne returns to the first season and tells us that this show was an interpretation of her life. She tells in this final episode that she has changed events and people as she sees fit. Scott was not with Leon, but he was. Marcus and David married opposite real-life wives, and Dan died when he made him live. As the events happened in her life, she changed them in writing. We do not all want to be able to do that. We do not all have a moment in time that we want to use only a radius and change according to our preferences. That's what he did with the whole episode. And to another comment I would say I did not feel cheated, the family was real in my mind, it just changed the way in which the events of their lives took place. An A + ending at an A + show !!!!
