This is a good family show with a large cast of actors. It's a nice break since the last show of reality. There is nothing similar on TV right now, unless you count Joan of Arcadia as similar, because he also has a leading character for teenagers. However, Clubhouse is worth watching, because Jeremy Sumpter gives the lead character (Pete Young) a kind of love and naivety that is appealing without being too sweet and cute. Dean Cain, Christopher Lloyd, Grand Winningham and Kirsten Storms surround the other members of the main band, and each one of them is great in their role. I really like Kirsten Storms as Pete Betsy's sister; she is a pill but still cares about her mother and her brother even if she does not like to show her. It may take a few episodes to really find your feet, but Clubhouse is one of the best shows that will come in a long time, so check out the people - you'll be glad you did!
