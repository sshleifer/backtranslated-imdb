This is a movie that should be when you try to capture the essence of what is very unreal. It has that subtle noise that is rarely captured on the film, it feels like a dream sequence and really moves you into a memory you do not like. The children were extremely credible and expect something to come in the future. It acts very naturally for such young people, I do not know if Bill has taken it out of it or there, just so well, but no less excellent. Bill wrote to me as much as I worry about KevNJeff's commentary on Mr. Paxtons, who is acting badly, what can someone do in this role. He played the role quite well in my opinion. This comes from someone who said Hamlet was good (Ethan Hawke's version?) Wow ......... Do not listen to his comments. A great shot to make you feel very uncomfortable, if that's what you want? Cinema is above average rating as well.
