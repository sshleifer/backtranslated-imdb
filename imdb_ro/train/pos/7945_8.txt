I'm a fan of animal movies. If you can make a plot and put the animals as the main actors you will usually win me. Homeward Bound did this. They took a plot that was as old as time and put a new spin on it. It was a complete success. It's a very archetypal movie. You have the obi-wan of the group (shadow), which is wise and logical, you have a pleasant, but impetuous and unbelievable chance, and the princess prissy who thinks she should be pampered and praised. These three personalities burst out very well with each other. I also like how they made Chance and Sassy dynamic characters and did not overtake him. Most people say it can not be good because it's too much a movie for kids. What they forget, however, is that it should be a movie for children, and this still does not move away from the movie. This is a good movie to watch when you get bored and just want to watch a movie. It's a cartoon Disney movie, an airplane movie with a better plot. I undoubtedly advise you to follow her.
