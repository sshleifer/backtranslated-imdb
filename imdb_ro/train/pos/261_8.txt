I went to see this movie waiting for a nice time to relax in the theater with my younger sister. Instead, I had to really control myself to convince her that I was not scared. In many ways, however, it is a story for children, but with a scenario that has a great potential. It could have been one of the most frightening movies if it had planned for another audience.
