I thought it was a very smart movie. I was very pleased with this and I really could not ask for more. Actually, I own the movie because I did not return it to someone ... What I should do, but I really want to keep it because of the way I liked it. Also, they do not have too many foreign movies and this is the first. Now, I personally love Finnish stuff, so certainly added to how much I liked it. But, overall, it's worth watching. However, if you are not in the whole attempt to understand Finnish or to read bit subtitles, then this movie is not for you. 9/10 for sure.
