I'm totally surprised by some comments on this forum and many reviews. I think Tony Scott did a good movie here. Yes, it's very stylized, shiny and above, but it's really fun. I'm glad that at least Ebert and Roeper agree with me :) This movie can not be for anyone but if you like your head, dark humor, cool action and dialogue, you should see. <br /> <br /> I saw Scott's Man on Fire, Crimson Tide and Enemy of the State - all the good movies, but I like more. It's like a roller coaster ride, with excellent soundtrack selections, visual styles and at a time when all the movies seem to be pg13, it's nice to see that someone is not afraid to look nudity, violent violence and have an explicit dialogue. <br /> <br /> It does not last that Keira is super hot, and even shows nipples in this ...
