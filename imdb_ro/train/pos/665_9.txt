"And All Through the House" is a special encrypted episode not only because it's from the first season but this episode was the first one I've seen! I remember that a young man who was on leave with our parents in the summer of 1989 at our HBO hotel in South Carolina on HBO saw this episode and I was buried in the Crypt right then and forever! I've always been a fan of the series of horror suspense and I loved monster movies, and with this series released by HBO we had plenty of pleasure again. This episode being the first one I've seen is memorable for me and one of my favorites is just so nice with a beautiful twist. "And All Through the House" has a comfortable and comfortable setting on a Christmas Snow, which is a perfect way to relax for your holiday heels! Well, anyway you have Mary Ellen Trainor (who, by the way she plays in several warner brothers, usually works small) as a brave wife who takes care of her while waiting for some money and a new one story. Just like the most horror series, things get a bad deal for the worst and the wicked to get what they deserve. The odds are very stacked when a maniac dressed as Santa escapes from a local walnut house, making for a late felting feast on Christmas Eve! Starting with the old E.C. comics lessons, teach bad people to get what they are focusing on! Well, this story ends with a perfect scream of celebration! Also this story was in the 1972 film and appeared on Joan Collins, this is undoubtedly one of my favorites and probably one of the classical cryptic episodes of all time!
