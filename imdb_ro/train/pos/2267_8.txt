I have not read the novel or anything else about Kurt Vonnegut, but now I intend to start. This catch you from the first frame, and do not let go until the end of the credits start running. By taking the places you do not expect, the intrigue is exciting all the time. Pacing is spot-on, nothing takes too long, and this does a perfect job of balancing unexpected upsets and allowing the spectator to process what we've seen. It's well said and well thought out. I have never seen a movie about which I feel I could compare specifically with this. It's intense and interesting, as well as amusing and sad. The action is excellent, Nolte shines absolutely, Goodman proves once again that he does not have to go for laugh, and Lee and Arkin are spontaneous. I could go on, indeed ... no role is treated for less than stellar performance. Editing and cinema are great, and all the pictures are wonderful, some amazing and amazing. I'll go for other Keith Gordon movies as well as the other two seemingly related to this by the author of the books. There is a scene of sexuality and very disturbing and anxious content in this regard. I recommend that anyone can appreciate this; is not pleasant. 8/10
