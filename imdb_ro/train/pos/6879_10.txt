"The Groove Tube" was one of Ken Shapiro's two films, the other being "Modern Issues." This is just a large-scale television parody. In addition to Shapiro - who apparently did nothing after "Modern Issues" - the film is also Chevy Chase and Henry Winkler's cousin Richard Belzer. The three casting members (plus some other people in smaller roles) appear in different sketches. One of the funniest has Chase in a commercial at Geritol-spoofing, describing the medicine as his wife's brother and ending with her. There is also a pornographic news program, an irritating cooking show and the epic story of drug dealers. However, the whole thing is just a real challenge. In my opinion, the best three TV-spoofing films are these, plus "Tunnelvision" and "Kentucky Fried Movie" (though I could include "The Truman Show"). Very funny. I wonder what ever happened about Ken Shapiro.
