Once you get through the title of the movie, "Pecker" is a great movie, probably one of the best of John Waters. A wonderful cast, led by powerful performances by Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci, makes the story very funny and very real. There are some shocking scenes that are certainly not suitable for small children, but there is for a purpose. Unfortunately, this movie was not mass produced, and most of the audience will be refused to see it. If the opportunity beats, then go see this movie.
