This movie is the first trilogy of the Miike triad society, and the trilogy begins in a wonderful beginning. Trilogy films are only thematically linked, and these themes are actually visible in all of their films if you look close enough. The Triad Shinjuku Society is about a policeman who is trying to prevent his brother from getting too involved in an extremely extreme band of strangers, fighting over Tokyos yakuza tip. The child's brother is a lawyer, and the triad band is becoming more and more needed by one as the movie progresses. The film takes place in a very tough environment and is therefore quite violent and tough. Miike has done worse, but since this is a serious movie, it hits you very hard. As usual, there is a lot of perverted sex, especially homosexual in this case. The film is, in many ways, a typical gangster movie, but with great movement and true sand. If you only saw Miikes (Ichi the killer, Fudoh, etc.), it's worth checking out because it's a kind of compromise between his aggressive top-up style displayed in those movies and his more serious part, as seen in other films of the trilogy. And as always with Miike, there are at least two scenes in this thing that you will NEVER LOOK (see and find out for you). 8/10
