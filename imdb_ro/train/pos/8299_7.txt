When the scientist and family man Matt Winslow (Robert Urich) eventually accepts the invitation to work with the Micro-Digitech Corporation in a costume suit, he moves with his beloved wife Patricia (Joanna Cassidy) and their son Robbie (Barret Oliver) Chrissy (Soleil Moon Frye) in a huge modern house in the corporate complex. They meet their friend Tom Peterson (Joe Regalbuto) and his family, fully adapted to the new lifestyle, and Tom invites the Winslow family to join the Steaming Springs Country Club. Tom is trying to seduce Matt by telling him that every member of the club has a meteoric climb in Micro-Digitech, but Matt is not tempted by the offer. Later, he is presented to club director Jessica Jones (Susan Lucci), who is friends with Patricia and convinces her to join the club with her children. Matt feels the change in his family's behavior and decides to investigate the club, finding an evil secret about Jessica and the members. In the 1980s, when I saw the "Invitation in Hell", I liked this film, which partly reminds "Stepford Wives", with people changing their behavior into a suburban compound. I have just seen it today and found a great metaphorical message against the great corporations when people literally sell the souls of the devil to climb positions and earn higher salaries. I'm not sure if the author intended to give this interpretation of the story, but I think it fits perfectly. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Convite Para o Inferno" ("Invitation in Hell")
