Despite success in comedy or drama, Turkish directors are failing in horror thriller. "Okul-D @ bbe" are good examples for horrifying horror movies. But if you follow "Gen", you will understand that it is a strike. The atmosphere of the film is impressive and dark. Also, the special features are colorful and not cheap. The soundtrack matches the movie, but the script is not absolutely perfect and the movie's theme is common. As a result, "Gen" does not add any difference to horror movies, but does not disappoint fans thriller. In this regard, it is a success for Yesilcam and Turkey. (7/10)
