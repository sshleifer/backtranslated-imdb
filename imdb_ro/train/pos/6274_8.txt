I visited this movie with a bunch of friends one evening. I have not heard too much about it. So I did not expect anything. But after seeing her, I really liked it. Nicolas Cage and the rest of the cast were very good. But I have to say that Giovanni Ribisi's show needed a little break. But such a small defect could be suppressed. <br /> <br /> Gone In 60 Seconds is a retired machine thief that has to stimulate 60 rare and exotic cars in one night to save his brother's life. The film is not predictable in any way. So the end should be a surprise. Think it's just another movie driving fast on the car? Well, you're right. There is much more to it. Everyone should watch this movie.
