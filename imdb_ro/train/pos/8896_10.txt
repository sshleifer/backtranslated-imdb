Can someone help find the title and artist of the play, which was played at least halfway through the movie. I do not remember what scene it was playing. The words in the song are ballad. Some of the lyrics go like "It's kind of something wrong to say to you." It's a natural way to say that in a song. "It's a natural way to forgive you" Please help me with this question Thank you very much I searched the internet for days, I can not read this song from me So now it will cause me to find someone who would could help them in this matter. I would like to be attentive to the scene when playing.
