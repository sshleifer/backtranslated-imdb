Probably the most correct adaptation of Stephen King yet. It's not surprising, since King wrote the script. The story follows the Creed family who moves into a beautiful Maine house. One of the other inhabitants is Jud, a good old man who knows a few things about the area. One is the highway that passes through the front. The other is a way leading to the Pet Seman, where children for decades have buried the animals killed by the highway. Soon, Ellie Creed's cat, the church, is found dead. Fortunately, this happens while the family, except for Louis (the father), is gone for Thanksgiving. Jud leads Louis to another burial place, beyond the Pet's Semen, where the Church will be buried. Later, Louis is greeted (not so politely) by the Church. He came back, seems to have tried to get out of the bag he was buried in. Maybe he was buried alive. Maybe not. Nothing else can tell without destroying the story. Of all the king's adaptations we have seen, this would be most frightening. Characters are real and situations are normal. Mary Lambert does a great job in conducting the procedure. Suspension is maintained fairly high during the film, partly due to the development of the plot. The scene where Gage will be killed will stay in mind forever. Then, of course, we have the conclusion. It's easy to figure out what's going to happen, but Lambert takes some really scary and sometimes disturbing moments. Generally, this is a good movie and an excellent adaptation. If you like to be scared and do not mind being haunted by occasional disturbing images, then "Pet Sematary" is exactly what you are looking for. Non-horror fans will want to avoid this.
