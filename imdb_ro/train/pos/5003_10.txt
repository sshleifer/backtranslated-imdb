I'm not going to watch this show. But I'm glad I did. Critics of this thing do not understand it! It's one of the funniest and most fun things on T.V at the moment! Although, when interviews were made with ordinary people, they probably seemed useless; but put them in the mouth of animals and insects, and it is a laughing reward. I laughed so loudly, I had tears in my eyes. The pig with nursing babies and her mother is invaluable. Birds of husband and wife talking about health problems, and the male bird took a stupid thing after the wife said it was constipation tears me completely! Creature Comforts is the most imaginative show I've ever seen! We hope it will return to the next summer when this run is over.
