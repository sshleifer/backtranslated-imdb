Although I am not the biggest fan of wired martial art, when a movie goes straight for fantasy rather than for battle, I have a lot more fun and this movie is one of the best in terms of the fantastic plot and the crazy Flying Flight. Ching Siu Tung has created here a delightful life with fine performances and great etheric beauty. The great, tragic Leslie Cheung plays a night tax hero in a haunted temple and engages in a stunning fox spirit and a creepy taoist. Cheung's performance is full of naive but dignified charm, and Wu Ma is pleasantly separated from the wall as a Taoist monk who shows a sword game and even receives a musical number. Perhaps the best is Joey Wang as the fox spirit, really a pleasure to look with every move and gesture with seductive enthusiasm. The film takes elements of fantasy, horror, comedy and love, all mixed together into a constant entertainment package. Ching Siu Tung, directing and manipulating choreography, gives some neat emotions and fills the film with fog, shadows, and scary forest colors, giving each scene of the forest a wonderful atmosphere of comfort. Also remarkable are the elaborate hair styles and the gorgeous clothes of the female characters, and if I'm not mistaken, Joey Wang's sporty hair has sometimes been like fox ears, a wonderful touch. Although the film has a relatively small action and sometimes a pop pop song, it's probably not recommended, it's a nice piece of fun with humorous characters and plot, even with an unusual character, an almost constant offer visual treatments and a heart-filled atmosphere. An etheric treasure, highly recommended.
