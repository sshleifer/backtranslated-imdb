Sunshine Boys is a tremendous comedy about two ex-Vaudevillians who come together for a special television, despite the fact that they despise each other. The comic genius of two masters at work, George Burns and Walter Matthau, are stellar! Some of the best scenes are when the duo is fighting for the foolish trivial things! The material is fast and full of witchcraft, appealing to all ages. MILD SPOILER ALERT: There are some sad moments slowly towards the end of the movie that deals indirectly with aging affections that give the movie a soft, sincere tendency to show this reviewer that what the pair really needs most for success is reciprocal. If someone loves The Couple Odd, you will adore this movie. An excellent movie!
