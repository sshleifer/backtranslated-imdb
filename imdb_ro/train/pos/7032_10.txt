The theater club of my school will perform this show in the spring of 2002 and I can only hope that we are just as good! I recently saw this film as a kind of "research" for my role (Rosie Alvarez), and I just want to say, Vanessa Williams is the best! Wow! Casting for this movie was direct (with one exception). Jason Alexander, man, is there something he can not do? He was the most wonderful Albert Peterson ever - I loved mostly all his facial expressions and fun dancing during "Put on a happy girl!" It's so great! Vanessa Williams, as I said earlier, is the best. She was a beautiful Rosie, and her shift from secretary to seduction was totally credible. Tyne Daly was hilarious because Albert Wendt's mother and George Wendt were gorgeous as McAfee was upset (though I loved Paul Lynde's performance in the 1963 version!). Brigitta Dau breaks me like Ursula Merkle; she really put her in the bar! And Marc Kudisch was a wonderful Conrad Birdie ... "Suffer!" There was only one casting I did not understand and, as you will see from previous comments, many other people do not understand. Chynna Phillips as Kim McAfee - what was that? I mean, she's very cute and very talented, but ... she's a little too old for the role. Eh, maybe I'm delusional. Okay, anyway, I recommend this movie. It will leave you smiling! <br /> <br />
