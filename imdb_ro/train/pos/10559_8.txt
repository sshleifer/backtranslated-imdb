I did not write a review about IMDb for the longest time, however, I felt compelled to write this! When I looked at this movie, I found a special review that urged people not to see this movie. Do not pay attention to this ignorant person! Nothing is a fantastic movie, full of laughter and above all ... imagination! Are not you sick and tired of being forced to feed the same old cycle of garbage movies? Sometimes a movie like NICE comes and offers you something you have not seen before. I do not even care if you do not like (I even hate) the movie, but no one has the right to discredit the movie. IMDb has a monumental impact on reputation, and no negative review should discredit this movie. Just say you hate and why you hate it ... but do not try to tell people they should not look at it. We have our thoughts and we will be content with our minds. If my judgment is good, I would say that more people will enjoy this film, unlike those who hate it. <br /> <br /> Treat your mind to a little eye-candy! See NEVER!
