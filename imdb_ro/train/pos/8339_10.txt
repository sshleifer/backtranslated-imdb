I.Q., in my opinion, is a sweet, charming and hilarious romantic comedy about finding the right person for you. If you ask me, James (Stephen Fry) was really a dull guy. For me, Ed (Tim Robbins) was better suited for Catherine (Meg Ryan) than James was. Anyway, everyone involved in this movie has done an absolutely tremendous job. Now, in conclusion, I recommend a lot of sweet, charming and hilarious romantic comedy about finding the right person for any fan of Tim Robbins or Meg Ryan who did not see her. You are laughing, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, hit with a friend and look at it.
