Peter Weir's first success, THE LAST WAVE, is a really efficient cooler with a fascinating back story based on the aoriginal myth. Richard Chamberlain gives a good interpretation as a defense attorney, whose life is becoming more and more unpleasant to reality as he goes deeper into a case of tribal tribal tribal strife. David Gulpilil plays one of the suspects who is doing everything in his power to guide Chamberlin through the "Dreamtime" region, a central alternate reality / chronology for native Australian history and tribal custom. Hard in the atmosphere, deliberately ambiguous in the plot, the film is based on an endless anxiety, which is somewhat diminished by the bad effects, probably because of budget constraints. However, an interesting film, whose overall impression of the mystery and dread that lies just below the surface of what we perceive as "reality" will remain with you.
