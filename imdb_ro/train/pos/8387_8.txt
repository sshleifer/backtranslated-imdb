This first part of the BRD Trilogy has a higher density of passion and plot than Lola, but less of the magic of Veronica Voss. Political accounts have shown them: we see post-war shortcomings, how commercial merchants have managed to control so much of everyday life (a delicious moment when Fassbinder, playing a wizard, tries to sell a complete set of Kleist to Schygulla, who notes that the burning of books does not offer too much heat: he really wants firewood). There is a quit in the first hour. The scene from Mary's room with the black soldier, interrupted by Hermann's appearance, should go faster. The scene of the train, when Maria meets Karl Oswald, collapses when he insults GI - I stretched out, it was so bad. But as the story grows and the years pass, I was drawn more and more into this glossy and cold world.
