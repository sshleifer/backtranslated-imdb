"COSBY", in my opinion, must be a CBS hit! I'm not sure if I've never seen each episode, but I still enjoyed it. It's hard to say which is my favorite. I also loved the theme of the song very much. If you ask me, even if I liked everyone, it would have been good if Madeline Kahn had not died during the show. Since when it happened, I've always wondered what the show was. Everybody always did a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, although it can now be seen on TBS, I strongly recommend it to catch it only if it extinguishes from the air forever
