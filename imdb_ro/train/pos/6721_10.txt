If it were possible to distill the heart and soul of the sport - not the pure lifestyle - surfing to its perfect form, this documentary did. This documentary shows that life is not just about waves, it is more about people, pioneers and the modern avant-garde that push the sea wave envelope further than it ever was. <br /> <br /> Stacy Peralta - a virtual legend of my 80s skateboarding days as a teenager SoCal - has edited reminders of stunning stocks and interview pictures to their essence and created what is not just a documentary, but a masterpiece of the genre. When his heart and soul are in the subject matter - and clearly he is here - his genius is full of a pure vision that does not shine, promote or feel his subject. He respects surfers and surfing / beach life, but he does not even paint it. There is also a real reality for sports. There are so many about this documentary, about surfers, about the early history of sport, about wild sister, about great sources, about profiles. Greg Noll, the first great-person personality to pioneer the athlete; Jeff Carter, an amazing guy who has been practically alone for 15 years on the great surf surf Maverick in Northern California; and, the central piece of the documentary, Laird Hamliton, the Messiah of today with the great surf. <br /> <br /> There is a huge heart and warmth between all these guys - and a few girls that appear on the room - and a deep and powerful love for navigation and the ocean that comes in every word. I found the story of how Hamilton's adopted father met him and how Hamilton, like a little boy of four to five years, forced him to be his father in a particularly unimaginable (and again sympathetic) sympathy. <br /> <If you like surfing - or even not - is a great document to look at, just because you are a student of the form or someone who appreciates incredibly well-done artwork.
