Plotwise this is a bit silly whodunnit masquerading as a drama / biopic period. However, the only reason I wanted to see it first was because I was curious about what great Henry Fonda was really at the top. I did not disappoint - it produces a truly warm and charismatic performance. In addition, I can say honestly that I have never been bored in a stage during the movie, so a strong *** 1/2 of *****
