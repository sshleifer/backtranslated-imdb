I do not agree with previous comments about this movie. I think it was cute and fun and had a good message for young girls like my daughter. You do not have to dress like a cheap prostitute to be cool. You can be intelligent, cute and classic at some point. I think the cast was good and the story was good for the target audience. All-in-all my wife, daughter (10) and everybody thought it was a good movie. I certainly recommend it. She also encouraged my daughter to start reading the original mysteries of Nancy Drew, who I'm sure will love much like I loved Hardy boys. <br /> <br /> It was a struggle to get her to sleep tonight because she wanted to start reading right away. I can not think of a better result for that movie than the restoration of interest in the classic series.
