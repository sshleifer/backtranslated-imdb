At the second view of this movie, I like even more than the first time. It is full of shades and a perception of life as quite common and often fear, but what highs this film at a rare height is its focus on the small incidents in our lives that we normally offer only the slightest attention. Here the film revolves around the celebration of these incidents, the encounter of a towed truck driver and a client, the jogger listening to a cry of the baby from the bushes. Dialogue, acting, casting and direction are superb. Not two to four years, no great revelation. What I noticed was how true were the characters of their basic nature and how much life they became when they were celebrated. Kudos for all involved in this, we need more "Grand Canyons" in our lives. 9 of 10.
