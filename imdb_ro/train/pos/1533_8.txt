What network was Diagnostic Murder on? I thought it was CBS. Am i right ?? Also Back in those days, current production H.Q. it was close to Van Nuys Airport. I certainly remember, because basically I did almost two episodes in that daze. More. I remember the first few days. I found an article in Reader's Digest giving this actor / writer a clue for a terrible episode. So just because she suggested I was awarded. Granted or not, I have not succeeded in developing it, and has been cut off from all of this because of my poor publicity. So, as a justification I have learned as always, the hard way ... Turn the dice. Just a sidebar on Mr. Van Dyke. He had a house in the Brentwood area on Chalon Road and was an incredible party house. Dick had a wonderful sense of modernity when he built that house.
