As romantic comedies go, he was a cute and winning one. I thought writing could have been stronger to build the final connection a bit better, but that's not a huge crossing point. But, Amanda Detmer and Scott Wolf perform well and are as charming as ever. These are two of my favorite actors and I was very happy to see them thrown out as romantic stars. I hope to see them running on several projects soon. Generally, this movie will not change your life, it's sweet, warm and winning. It's not a bad thing to be at all.
