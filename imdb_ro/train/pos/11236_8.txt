Because I'm not affiliated with production in any way. Hidden Frontier is probably the movie of Star Trek fans with most episodes produced so far. Over 7 seasons (this is the last) produced about 50 episodes. It does not mean any kind of money on almost no budget, and everyone volunteers their time and energy. <br /> <br /> By their own recognition, previous seasons do not have the same quality of production as the later ones, but as the effects progress, work on the green screen and the action of everyone is improving. It has been difficult to "in" so started from the beginning and followed all the way through. HF benefits from the story arcs, like all the best scifi, and is bordering on the Star Trek universe in which it is set. The characters and "relatives" of the original series were brought into stories and added a lot to the sense of stories, sometimes improving the characters to the original. The whole experience includes an excellent web site, blooper rolls, a high-profile forum that is attended by many actors and production staff and a weekly chat. If you're looking for high-definition, high budget productions, this is not likely. If you're looking for continued adventures in the Star Trek universe, with stories that make Star Trek credit and make you believe, that's one.
