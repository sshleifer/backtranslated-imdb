This was another great film by Tom Berenger .. But some people are right that he was another character SGT BARNES but he was still awsome .. Tom Berenger played a great sniper in the jungles of Panama! Billy Zane was at first the same as Cpl Upham from Saving Private Ryan, but then became more aggressive in the end! The sniper has been awsome and action buffs should look at it .. I remind you that it would not have as much action as action action reg .. I got on DVD and it is excellent!
