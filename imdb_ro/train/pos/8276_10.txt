Now that's what I'm talking about. Finally, a low-budget horror trip, which uses its limits to its advantage. WENDIGO, while sometimes erroneous, is a triumph of imagination. However, it is based on the heavy moves of the EVIL DEAD to master its spirit, but it is still a better look than 99% of direct movie noise. The story is quite simple: a family has a vacation in a remote cabin and they are threatened by a particularly disturbed hunter. But director Larry Fessenden really knows how to create suspense and add uneasy layers of restraint by using mythical Wendigo. It is real? Is everything in the boy's imagination? Is it an outsourcing of the child's emotional state? <br /> <br /> Some have thought that the movie is unsatisfactory because it is left to decide. Do not be fooled by this crap. A movie that makes you think it's not to be avoided. It's one to enjoy.
