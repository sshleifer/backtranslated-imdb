Hitchcock was of the opinion that the public was not really interested in what puts the protagonists in danger - but they are in danger and need to escape. This film proves that Hitchcock was not 100% correct. Police believe that Jean Simmons is guilty of a crime when it is not clear. Trevor Howard decides that the best way to do it is to execute it. And so the body of the film has our charismatic pair that avoids trains, buses and coaches - jumping over the rocks at the top of a waterfall - mingling over the docks' roofs. All the good things - but I could not help reminding myself that it was all useless. He should have stayed. In other words, MacGuffin was not strong enough.
