I own Ralph Bakshis forgotten the Fire & Ice masterpiece on an old OOP rental video tape. Well, for one thing, it's better than any Conan-esque movie you'll ever see. Sure, it's cheesy but who cares? It was the test of time, and the only way it seemed cheesy is compared to the modern fantasy era like LOTR: FOTR (although I like this movie). a battle between Fire & Ice, a royal daughter is kidnapped by sub-human Jaroles (Ice) creatures, while a unique survivor of a victimized village saves her. Betty, but that's not the point. It is really to bring to life an interesting idea about a world of two enemies: Fire & Ice. And he succeeds. <br /> <br /> As for action scenes: gorgeous. They are well-manipulated, they have terrible suspense, and they have loud noises. Just check out the climate battle, now that it's an end! Actor and dialogue: competent. Really. They will not be nominated for an Oscar, but they are fine and do not get nervous. The animation is pretty good. Shot on 3D and rotoscope (I think) looks pretty good. Many backgrounds look very detailed and well-drawn, and although the characters' design feels a bit dim, they are all right. Generally, this is a small neglected gem and you will have more fun than any superficial "fun". 10/10
