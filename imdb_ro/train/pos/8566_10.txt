I really like 101 Dalmatians when it came out in 1996, 5 years later I went to see 102 Dalmatians in 2001, I thought it was fantastic but I think 101 is better because I think it's funnier , more humor, was based on the same story as the cartoon version (one hundred dalmatiuni (1961)), I wonder if there are plans for 103 Dalmatians. I hope there may, perhaps, maybe, not all Dalmatian fans will have to find out if there will be 103 Dalmatians in the future.
