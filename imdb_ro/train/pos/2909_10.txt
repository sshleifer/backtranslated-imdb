I love Paul McCartney. He is, in my opinion, the greatest of all time. However, I could not afford a ticket at the Tacoma Dome concert during the Back to US tour. I was angry at least to say. Then I found this DVD. He was almost as good as when I was there. Paul is still the man and I will enjoy it for years. <br /> <br /> I have a complaint. I'd like to hear all the Hey Jude. Paul is also not dead. The biggest single single DVD concert ever. <br /> <br /> *** from *****.
