There were moments when this movie seemed to become more complicated than it should have been, but I think that's part of his charm. Detective Philo Vance's observer powers seem higher than all the other orientals of the combined era when it comes to that final assessment of how the crimes were committed. The fall of the dagger in the Chinese vase was for me; I mean, could not one give up her? <br /> <br /> Vance (William Powell) had a line at the beginning of Archer Coe's film about "psychological impossibility" to commit suicide - I had to think about it for a while. I was wondering if there is a scientific basis, in fact, for this concept to be true without having studied psychology. It seems logical, but then it's always the case that they do not fit the rules. You know, I got a shot from the shaken coroner doctor (Etienne Girardot) who reminded me of Dr. Star Trek McCoy several times said, "I'm a doctor, not a magician," and "I'm a doctor, not a detective." I can imagine DeForrest Kelley watching the movie and telling her, "I'll have to use it sometime." Once the killer's identity is revealed, it does not seem to be such a big surprise, but until then it's really someone guessing. But Archer and Brisbane Coe were aside, the film did not answer the central question of the title and the killing I was interested in - who killed Ghillie's dog, Sir Thomas MacDonald?
