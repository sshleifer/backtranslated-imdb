In 1990, Disney's cartoon world was certainly on his first date. Shows such as Chip n Dale Rescue Rangers, DuckTales, and Gummi Bears were already popular, and now Disney has made another cartoon, and the cartoon has begun Disney Afternoon. This cartoon is called TaleSpin. This is the old character of the Jungle Book, Baloo the Bear, while he gets a job on the plane. In series he meets Kit Cloudkicker, former Air Pirate and lucky cloud surfer, business woman Rebecca Cunningham and her overactive daughter Molly. This series is very funny and has many great tones of words that you probably do not understand as a child, but you later understand life. This is a smart writing series and it's great to add a DVD collection. Parents, buy this for your kids, rather letting them watch all of these horrible Nickelodeon cartoons. If you liked TaleSpin, check out Darkwing Duck and Goof Troop. Rotate it!
