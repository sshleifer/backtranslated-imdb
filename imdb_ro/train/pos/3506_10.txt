Peter Sollett has created a charming portrait of real people living in poverty in Lower East Side of New York or Loisaida, as known by locals. Sollett's heart is in the right place, examining this dysfunctional family, which is typical of the various "inner cities" of the country. Mr Sollet positively emphasizes the story he is presenting. These are generally good children, the children of the parents who left it and whose grandparents took it under her wing. <br /> <br /> Instead of presenting their characters as losers, Mr. Sollett shows a positive part that everyone has. These children are not in drugs or steals because they are poor. If this story was made by Hollywood, we would have seen a parade of stereotypes, instead of children struggling but deep inside, they are not losers. Victor Rasuk, as Victor Vargas, was revelation. He is a natural man. So, July Mars. Her character shows us a nonsense girl who will not be fooled or driven to do anything she does not want to do. Altagracia Guzman, that grandmother is excellent. She expresses the frustration of not being able to guide her grandchildren into the things she believes and who are so important to her. <br /> <br /> Overall, this was an excellent image thanks to Peter Sollett.
