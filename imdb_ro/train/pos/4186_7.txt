I saw this movie yesterday and I have to say it is the best horror movie made for the $ 36,000 I've ever seen (Sorry Steckler) The film is definitely worth looking for if you're a zombie fan. This film revives the soul and the atmosphere. Some of the zombie photographs are the best ever captured commitments. Very creepy, looking for dust-dust bodies, slowly faint with the screaming victims. Brrrrrrr. Sexy Hot Sexy Canadian women with sexy accents will keep you busy before HORROR raises his head. This movie was fun from beginning to end. I could not ask for more than that. My only complaint is that it was too short.
