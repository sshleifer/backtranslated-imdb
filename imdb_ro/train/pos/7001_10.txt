I never commented on a movie before. I watched this movie with my girlfriend last night. I read the comments saying this movie is with you. Yes. It's been almost 24 hours and I'm still completely affected. This movie allowed me to ask myself questions. How can I compare to a character like Ben, who is totally uninterested. I liked this movie. I like movies that keep me guessing and asking me to the end. I feel two predominant emotions, happiness and sadness. An amazing movie feels good and a very sad one. I wanted Ben and Emily to be together, but in the end they were forever. If you have not seen this movie, get it and watch it. Make sure you have no distraction. You will want to see every hue in this image. One for my library.
