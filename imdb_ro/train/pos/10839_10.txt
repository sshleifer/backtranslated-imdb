I saw this movie in the video store a few years ago and I hired it. My husband and I liked us so much that we bought VHS and we have enjoyed it since then. The land was well discussed, so you do not have to go over it again. The point is that this film deserves repeated viewing. In particular, Americans will not take all the jokes for the first time. I know I did not do that. This movie is funny, emotional, sad ... at the same time. When Ray proposes toast at his daughter's wedding, it's a foray. When Karen calls Tony "Brian" as he tries to kiss her, it's scary. When Beano is finally surrounded by the woman in black, it's too fun for words. And music: it's as good as any movie soundtrack I hear over the years. We were dancing in the living room at "Everybody". <br /> <br /> Every performance is absolutely perfect. Bill Nighy was rightfully compliments for the role of Ray, a man who had too many bad trips. Stephen Rea is perfect as Tony, the nice keyboard player who wore a torch for Karen all these years. It has an appealing look that makes women embrace it. But all the actors are just as bright. Ignore any pan that you read about this movie and see it. It's a jewel.
