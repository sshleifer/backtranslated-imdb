and laughs loudly in many scenarios. The plot of the base film is well chronologically, a story of the opposite trying to find a way to survive each other in the immediate vicinity. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly Lemmon and Matheau's best film as co-stars, and the interaction between the bad Oscar and the OCD Congratulations is classic. The scene in which Oscar sets a double date, leaves the room for a short while, and comes back to find Felix and the two girls all crying is invaluable fun. For any fan of smart comedy, Odd Couple is a movie "go out of your way to see it".
