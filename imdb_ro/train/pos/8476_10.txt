*** Spoilers * <br /> <br /> My father recorded this movie for me when I was 3 years old. Until the age of 5, I watched her more than 400 times. I just looked at her and looked at her. And I still do today! It has a bleak story, a lamb mother is killed by a wolf - a very emotional scene - and wants to become a wolf like him. After years of training, the lamb is turned into a really bad thing. He and the wolf travel to his old barn, but he can not kill the lambs, no matter how much he wants. He ends up killing the wolf, but is no longer seen as a lamb by his former friends and can not return to his previous life. Art is beautiful, the songs are .. well, good, and the voice acting is better than some things today. <br /> <br /> In total, you just * * to see this movie is a great masterpiece. Although, it is very difficult to find today. <br /> <br />
