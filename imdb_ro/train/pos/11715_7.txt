This is a small spoof / horror comedy with Cassandra Peterson aka Elvira: Mistress of the Dark, the most infamous horror hostess of all time. It was meant to be the pilot vehicle for Elvira and was so successful that it was taken over by the NBC network. They filmed a pilot for a television series to show busty babe in black, but unfortunately sit-com never made the pilot stage over the sexual references. This movie is very funny. Elvira is modern Chesty Morgan and the Hungarian queen. This film was followed a few years later by the abyss "Haunted Hills Elvira", which was meant to be a takeover of the old Roger Corman films, but falls flat on his face. Watch this movie for a more fun experience!
