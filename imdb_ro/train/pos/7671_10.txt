Dr. Mordrid, what can I say? Jeffrey Combs did it again! Anton Mordrid has been on Earth for 100 years, waiting for Kabal, a wicked sorcerer, to come to kill him. Mordrid and Kabal used to train together as children, so Mordrid knows all the tricks of Kabal. The film is a bit confused, but soon you feel part of the action. I will not quit the end, so go and look at Dr. Mordrid! I found the film to be very nice, because it does not have a lot of violence or sexual scenes. The film focused on the plot and I love it! It seems to me that the best movies are those in which it seems to fly. This is because you are so horrified in the movie. Doctor Mordrid is a great movie! I give him 20 out of 10. It's worth seeing! <br /> <br />
