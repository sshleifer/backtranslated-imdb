Kay Pollack (the man behind this film) is a very good man who tries to share his philosophy of life in different ways. He wrote a bunch of good and well-written books on how to control your senses and keep your soul happy. The message in most of his books and in this film is that your thoughts are, in fact, what causes your problems and that the reason for your anger is almost always caused by what you think. The main message is that you can choose to be happy, but it does not do that much anymore. To watch this movie and learn something very important in life, you have to keep your mind open and listen to all the "hidden messages" (or guidelines to get life) that most of the tracks in this movie contain if you listen and watch . Watch him with your ears. <br /> <br /> You will not learn the meaning of life but you will learn how to live and make the most of it <br /> <br /> So while looking, please note: "The mind is like a parachute, it works only if it is open!"
