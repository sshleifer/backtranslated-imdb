This movie is very cool. If you are a fan of Tsui Hark and fantastic Chinese movies, you should like this. This film is the Indian Lord of the Rings: a fantastic story, based on Chinese mythology. (I realize that many critics have called this plot less, I think they probably have zero knowledge about Chinese mythology.) If you liked Stormriders or Warriors of Heaven & Earth, it should be right in the alley. This movie is still very hard to find in the U.S. even though it was purchased for distribution in the U.S. along with Crouching Tiger, Dragon Hidden and Iron Monkey. Well worth the search! This DVD is also worthy of holding.
