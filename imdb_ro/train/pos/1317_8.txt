This anime was undervalued and still is. Almost the movie Dorky, as I noticed, I'm back in the 10 years since I saw it for the first time. One of the best movies released. While animation is not perfect, camera tricks give it a 3D feel, and the story is still as good today, even after I grew up and saw some sunshades like Neon Genesis Evangelion and RahXefon. It does not have the obvious depth anywhere, but tries to see it from an easy view. It's a story to have fun, do not question. One more of my favorites is coming back and when I feel like a chicot on several easy-to-understand animations. Not to say it's a childish movie, there are surprising moments of living and you need a sense of humor to see everything.
