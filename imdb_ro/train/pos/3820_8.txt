This is a story about Shin-ae, who moves to Milyang in Seoul with her little son, June, to start after her husband's accidental death. Her husband was born here and opens a piano school, but she also has the ambition to own land with the money he has received from his death. If it was about the movie, it would probably have been like a Hollywood movie that fell for a local guy and was happy with her son in their new home. But that's not Hollywood. Her son is kidnapped and killed, apparently because he knows he has money from the settlement. The pain process, the attempts to move on, the attempts to clarify the conscience of guilt, are all admirable, and the lead actress is superb. The only warning, and it must be mentioned, is that it is a depressing film. You need to know he's in. You want Shin-e to go through her grief and find some happiness. Again, it is not Hollywood, it is Korea and in the Korean cinema, especially the drama, they do not shoot any shot. Life is what's happening to you. A great action, but sometimes a tough movie to watch, due to movements. If you stay, you will be rewarded. Do that.
