Ossessione's debut film Luchino Visconti, this Italian noir is generally credited with the launch of the neorealist movement - well, it is so well said on the back of the cottage - and it is a sometimes penetrating portrait, sometimes ludicrous of individuals alone in the moral flow. Placed in fascist Italy, an assortment of supporting characters - including an ingenious monk who takes over communist virtues - embodies the remote despair of a country seeking its identity from outside, carrying fantasies desiring a soul. Although Visconti's compassion for the uprooted and his ability to express painful conditions has already been well developed, the spider of deception is thin - though a noir substrate is to put a protagonist manipulated by fate and fatal females, Gino here is so anxious to start with the fact that you are afraid it might be worth it - the cosmic irony too didactic, the tortured relationship with the bathroom. However, it is incisive and essential, although its real impact on film history is certainly questionable.
