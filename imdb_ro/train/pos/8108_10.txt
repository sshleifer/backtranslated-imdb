I have "Living Things" on D.V.D. and is very clear compared to the VHS version. Audio is correct, but sometimes it can be hard to understand. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie so much that I searched for a copy of the book and found it. He gave details of what happened some things. The best things about the film are the little things I did not notice at first. Like, John Cabal playing a toy plane at a Christmass party as if he were a diving bomber, out of sea power calling a battle ship, "Dinosuar." Airborne ships, an undeclared foray, enemy airplanes. Wings of winged airplanes. Strong songs for women throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> There are more, you see the movie to enjoy them.
