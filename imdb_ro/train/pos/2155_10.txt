Shoe's Sugiyama accountant (Kōji Yakusho) feels bored with his usual life, limited to hard work, and stays home with his wife, Masako Sugiyama (Hideko Hara), and his teenage daughter. One night, as she travels by train, she sees the beautiful face of Mai Kishikawa (Tamiyo Kusakari) on the balcony of a dance school, and a few days later she decides to visit school and take dance lessons every Wednesday night. However, she is ashamed to tell her the secret family. Meanwhile, Masako feels changes in her husband's happier behavior and hires a private eye to investigate if Shohei has a business. I just finished watching "Shall We Dance"? and I really liked it. What a wonderful and delightful movie! The story is amazingly good with drama, comedy and romance. The distribution is excellent and I was particularly impressed by the beauty and goodness of wife Masayuki Suo's wife and professional ballet dancer Tamiyo Kusakari. On September 6, I saw the American remake of the movie "Shall We Dansu?" for the first time, and I found a delightful entertainment. But now I can say it's another useless remake and I recommend this original movie. My vote is ten. Title (Brazil): "Dança Comigo?" ("Dance with Me?")
