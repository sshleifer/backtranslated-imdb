Lapyuta (Castle in the Sky), more than any of Hayao Miyazaki's films, brings joy to the public's story. It's a kind of movie that makes someone feel like a child again; it's just magic. It's a crime that it took so long for her to be released in states, but now that she's here, check her out! And stick with the original language; the oak has somehow changed my impressions of characters, which should be avoided at any cost in translating a movie (or a book, no matter what.) I give it ten / ten.
