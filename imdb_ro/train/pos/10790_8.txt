This incredibly formal blow from the Walker, Texas Ranger team contains some of the most incredible scenes ever seen in a TV movie. In addition, you can predict the outcome from the beginning pretty much. However, it's a fun movie that does the job: it's fun. That's all she has to do, and so. Cascades and explosions are fun and exciting, and the plot is not bad at all. The act is also decent, which is not a surprise, because everyone knows that Chuck Norris is not Steven Seagal. If you are a fan of the genre (and of "Walker, Texas Ranger"), you certainly like this. If not, then do not waste your time. 8/10
