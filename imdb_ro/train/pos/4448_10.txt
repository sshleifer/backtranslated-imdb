He saw yesterday the movie for the first time and enjoyed it. I'm a screenwriter and I liked how minor characters intervened only when there was something pivot / climate in a scene. <br /> <br /> I thought the dialogue was very sharp and the premise of the story is quite shocking - at some point, Barbara Stanwyck openly flirts with her daughter's boyfriend; And the regaining of a passion in her husband she has not seen for ten years; And with the fire signal shot, "two fires and then one," she gets drunk with her old Dutch hairdresser (the reason she left the city first!) ALL TIME! The moral majority must have been completely annoyed when they saw this blow back in the 1950s. Love costumes and cinema and directly from the hip dialogue - just to watch Barbara Stanwyck and What You Do "Bunny Hug is enough reason to rent this DVD movie One of the best movies of that time I've seen for a long time.
