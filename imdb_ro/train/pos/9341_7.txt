Sandler is amazing again ... I've already become a Sandler fan. This movie is the saddest Sandler story. The phrase is fantastic. I've been crying more by clicking, but there are a few similar points. Considering the value of the family before losing it and being able to say "I love you" are some of the most impressive truths in life ... It's tough, it's real ... and actually there is a real owner of this success, Binder. I do not think another director could give these emotions that way. <br /> <br /> Cheadle and Burrows are also stunning ... Cheadle is one of my favorites at Crash. Do not expect laughter or a positive atmosphere ... If you're ready to face the realities of life, do not miss this movie.
