The film begins with Vincent Price to begin his performances as a magician. However, halfway through the very successful show, the police came and closed it. It seems that his old boss has cheated on the tricks he has created the Prize - even the ones he did during their home. As a result, Price justifies the killing of the evil man. The problem is that while the spectator understood why the price killed and most likely believed it was a good thing, because the price was crazy, he could not stop at one (such as how to eat the Chips of Lay ). <br /> The film was full of very creative and spectacular magical tricks (including a huge circular saw and a crematorium for shows), wonderful plot twists and exciting action. One thing you can not tell about this movie is that it's boring. While it's far from subtle, it's fun along, though it's worth a look. If I have never seen the version of HOUSE OF WAX from Vincent Price, I would probably like MAD MAGICIAN much more and score 8 or 9. That's because while THE MAD MAGICIAN is a great movie, reminds a lot of the movie that preceded him (HOUSE OF WAX). The bottom line is that, since HOUSE OF WAX was so successful, the formula was resumed in the tracking movie. Both were made in 3-D, both have a plot in which Price has all the justifications to kill, but he can not stop once he committed the first and both are very fun to watch. The biggest difference, and there is little, is that HOUSE OF WAX was in color and was more of a horror movie, and MAD MAGICIAN was certainly more of a mystery. My advice is to see this movie AND HOUSE OF WAX (Price only version). There are so horrible horror films in the 1950s.
