The second alternative story of the Gundam universe (G-Gundam being the first), Gundam Wing is another different view in the verse Gundam. Familiar elements are found, but Gundam Wing is actually different from his counterparts. The biggest being Gundamuri are nothing more than terrorists fighting a single organization. Indeed, the series does not really become a show about war until Episode 7, but the true conflict, the Eve wars, does not happen until the subsequent episodes. <br /> <br /> The greatest positives of this series are her characters. All the main characters are written throughout the episodes of 49 episodes and you can truly feel with each of the roles they have put together. Another extra plus is the fantastic character and the mecha design of the series. The projects have made some of the other Gundam colleagues shy. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest critics of this series is the number of UC murderers who claim to have broken from the original UC saga. Why Gundam Wing receives this rap as Gundam Seed's UC's more apparent clone is there is beyond me. There are indeed many high moments, but they are rendered in new ways and there are distinct differences as well. Take, for example, the usual comparison between Zechs Merquise and UC Icon Char Aznable. Throughout the series, Zechs is more depressed in the Alliance and in ways and OZs, while the Red Comet was the shining symbol of Zeon. Another big difference is that Zechs loses a lot of soldiers under his command, so the other nickname he gave in the early episodes: "The killer of his own men." Char does not have this tag. <br /> <br /> The problems with this series are not the mumbo jumbo philosophy, but two problems. The first is the re-used animation material of the Gundams attacks. Of course it's fun to see the tanks for attack with heavy weapons, MS and planes the first time. But on the fourth scene of re-use, like that, it gets old. <br /> <br /> The second problem is that the whole series should take place over a full year. If you really think about all the events that have appeared in the series, much happens in just one year. <br /> <br /> But I think you can easily reject this when you ignore the first intro lines so often. As it stands, it is probably the best of the Gundam Alternative Universe stories and a great introduction to the Gundam world. After all, it was the first Gundam anime in the air in American television.
