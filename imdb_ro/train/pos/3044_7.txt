For anyone who may not know what a movie with an actor is, this is the best example. This plot is ridiculous and makes no sense. It's full of clich√©-like situations, hackneyed lines, melodrama, comedy ... you call it! But Amitabh Bachchan can do something convincing and this film is no exception at all. Everyone turns into a decent performance - Shashi Kapoor, Waheeda Rehman, Ranjit, Om Prakash, Smita Patil ... But Megastar, who shades everyone with his upward presence. Without him, this movie would have been a non-starter ... The story is about the separation / wrong identities / misunderstandings / love / hate / loyalty / good vs evil - everything, indeed! Amitabh's is a brilliant performance on all tracks in a silly movie! And did I mention it ridiculously funny?
