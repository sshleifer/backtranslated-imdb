Dana Andrews is in "Where the Pavement ends" in the 1950 film, which calls Gene Tierney, Gary Merrill, Karl Malden and Neville Brand. Andrews plays the detective in New York Sgt. Mark Dixon, a bad temper policeman who has been in trouble in the past to beat suspects. When a man is killed in a gambling club owned by a mobster, Scalise (Merrill), Dixon and his partner go to investigate. Scalise accuses Ken Paine (Stevens), who left the club after fighting not only with his wife, Morgan (Tierney), but with the victim. Dixon thinks the victim has earned a lot of money and was killed as a result of mafia males. He goes to see Paine, and without realizing he has a plate in his head at war, he hits him on the floor and kills him by mistake. Now it must cover the crime. As a further complication, he falls for Morgan; her father (Ken Tully), who left for Paine's apartment after seeing Paine hit her daughter, is arrested for murder. This is a real noise, with some good shows. Andrews, with a nice and beautiful face, is convincing like a tough but nervous detective who must stay one step ahead of his colleagues. The movie fuses him with fabulous cost "Laura", Gene Tierney, and looks great like a model with a bad taste in men who apparently are accustomed to straying. He knows a little, he still has one in his hands. Ken Tully does a wonderful job as her father who protests her innocence despite some profound evidence. Karl Malden is very tough as Dixon's boss. My only problem with this well-directed film, moving and absorbing is the end. Pure Hollywood, and putting me in the place of Tierney, I doubt I will react the same way. A minor criticism for a film written by Ben Hecht and directed by Otto Preminger. I did not find it as amazing inspiration as "Laura," but few things in this world are. If you like the noir movie, this is a must.
