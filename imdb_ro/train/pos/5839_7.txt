The last (I think) of the Boys made with Hal Roach, this is the last really funny movie they made before going to the twentieth-century fox who has misled his talents. Although there are weak moments - the deal with the "lung tester", for example, is a bit, ah ... exaggerated (but it is worth to have, just to see "dr." Jimmy Finlayson) - but overall this film is a summary good of what boys brought on the screen. Richard Cramer (uncredited) appeared in other L & H films and threatens with great beauty here as convict Nick Granger. The scene in which boys have to eat their own synthetic meal ("Looks good, smells good and probably tastes good, eat it") is one of my favorite moments in the movie. Stan & Ollie will always be pleasant companions in the lives of millions of their fans.
