I really enjoyed this movie. The story jumps long enough back and forth and is not easy to follow. There is no solution to this story, and you are left to wonder what really happened. Because I like a kind of movie, I liked it. I especially like scenes of "meetings" between boys and I was attracted to their lives. And, of course, any naked Staphane Rideau movie will get some extra points. ;-)
