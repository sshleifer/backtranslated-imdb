Every time you think you have a handle on Deathtrap, there's another turn. It is best to stay calm and enjoy walking in this way. The best-known kiss on the screen between Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve (unfortunately, was cut from the TV version I've seen), this movie has much to recommend. Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) is a very unhappy man. Once a successful playwright, his latest Broadway tracks flopped. And while Myra's wife (Dyan Cannon) is nothing more than a monetary and emotional support, this does little to make Sidney feel better. To add insult to the wound, the young playwright Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve) just sent Sidney to look at her. It is the first of Anderson and Sidney can see that the young man is a talented writer. She jokes to his wife that she should invite Anderson to kill him and subdue his play as his. She laughs at first, but when Sidney invites Anderson to go to dinner, he worries that he can put his plan into practice. And her fears can be justified ... It's a brilliant script. There are breaths and it all comes back through the plot and they come quicker and furious as you get close to the end. It is the kind of film that has you on the edge of the chair and keeps you there all the time. An absolute masterpiece of suspense and mystery. The actor is excellent. Caine performs his excellent performance, and he has a talent to play cultured, refined and intellectual people. Reeve also offers an excellent rendering of a man who is not as wide-eyed or innocent as it seems. The amount of Cannon's franchise works well for Myra. And Irene Worth gives a beautiful interpretation as a subdued neighbor, who is also a psychic. This is a movie with an end you would never expect, and repeated looks help to lift things lost earlier visionaries. A crazy classic who, unfortunately, was only remembered for a scene that at that time overturned some sensibilities - and that's a real shame.
