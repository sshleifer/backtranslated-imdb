"Cube" (1997), Vincenzo's first film, was one of the most interesting and complicated ideas I've ever seen when talking about movies. They only had a decor, a bunch of actors and a plot. So what made so special was the effective direction, the great dialogues and the bizarre condition that the characters had to treat as a rat in a labyrinth. The second film, "Cypher" (2002), was about his story, but he was not as good as "Cube," but here are the characters tested again like rats. "Nothing" is something very exciting and makes Vincenzo come back to "Cub's days," blocking the characters again in a very different space, not playing again with the characters like playing with rats in an experience room. But instead of a thriller sci-fi (even some promotional teasers and erroneous trailers seemed like that), "Nothing" is a free and easy comedy that can certainly be called a modern satire about our society and the intolerant world living . Once again, Vicenzo astonishes us with a great idea in such a small thing. 2 actors and a dazzling white screen, that's all you have for a long time and you do not need more than that. While "Cube" is a claustrophobic experience and confused "Cipher", "Nothing" is completely opposite, but desperate at the same time. This film proves once again that a smart idea means much more than just a millionaire budget. Of course the movie sometimes fails, but its prime idea means a lot and eliminates any flaws. There is nothing to say about this movie because everything is a brilliant surprise and a totally different experience I've had in Cube movies.
