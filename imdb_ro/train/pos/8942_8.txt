A number of taxpayers mentioned the age difference between Stewart and Novak. He was 25 years old and was 50 years old when the movie was released. I think the difference does not matter for a suspense drama like Vertigo, but it matters for a romantic comedy. We can understand easily, that is, why his character would have attracted her, but it is less clear why she would be attracted to him. Still, the film works like a light romantic fantasy. The scene in which he looks at him along the cat's head, the dark eyebrows painted, and the sounds of her cat and cats, is a real magic. So, when the scene is heading toward the top of the Flatiron Building, it's a little disturbing and we see the very strong age difference. As she embraces her, she gets to tear her fingers through her hair, but stops this movement and just flicks her fingertips easily in front of her toe.
