My daughter is really unleashed when I refer to Drew Barrymore as if he was hit by a pan, not to mention Dudley Dooright's chin that Jay Leno will die for. How wonderful, when I discovered in Fever Pitch that I really like Miss Barrymore; and Jimmy Fallon; and Red Sox; and Boston! This movie is probably best characterized as a sweet, light comedy. To be absolutely stereotyped, the girls will want the movie for his romantic charm and Jimmy Fallon's vulnerability, and the boys will love it for all male ties and for describing sporting mania. <br /> <br /> My wife hates my wife, my teenage daughter, and we all find something in the movie. That says something in itself. It's a great way to spend an hour and a half or so, and it's probably a good time.
