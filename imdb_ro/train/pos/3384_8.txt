My rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> I really like this movie. Compared to today's brainless film (just action and special effects and nothing new about ideas), "Soylent Green" asks for something that does not exist today: to think. Well, it would not be a big surprise one day eating man "cookies" that are created with a human body. With everything happening on this planet and to see how people are so indifferent to all, this kind of future is possible. Of course this film has some age, but the idea behind the movie is real again. Rich in Paradis, another in hell. Well, luck today are TV and idiots like "Show Reality". TV is a good brain to wash. It is a shame to see that man's intelligence has no progress with technology. Because write it all off. If you like reality shows this movie is not for you. If you all believe the same politician. If you do not like to ask questions about now and the future, you should never look for this movie.
