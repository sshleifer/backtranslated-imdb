Panic is a massive gem of a movie - you think you found it in the first half hour just to realize, with great pleasure, that Henry Bromell is a much better writer / director than that. <br /> <br /> The film builds slowly, with a quiet, devastating scene after another, all done perfectly by William H. Macy, Donald Sutherland, Neve Campbell, Tracey Ullman, John Ritter and the most remarkable actor for children for a long time, David Dorfman, the son of Macy, who offers his lines as though thoughts of the unspoken thoughts were created in his mind. Rich and rewarding, this movie will stay with you long after the credits have gone off.
