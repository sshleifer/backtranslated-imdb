Very good! Which, of course, is all that needs to be. Fortunately, there is no social or political message, and no less attempt in this direction. Could the plot actually take place or take place at some point or place? It is unlikely, because, however, it is simply a movie, and the films spring from imagination, not from reality. The only purpose of this film is to entertain, certainly, not to educate and entertain, with a delightful reality and a heart scattered by winds. I think most would agree that we're expecting enlightenment and authenticity from documentation. But for entertainment I want what is today described as a "no-brainer", which the mating game is in every respect. For some chuckling and absolute laughter, from time to time, it's an excellent fantasy.
