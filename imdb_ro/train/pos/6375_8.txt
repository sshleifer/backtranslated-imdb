While I have a great deal of respect for Disney animation movies, lately, they have not been what I would call "must-see." Atlantis watched intriguingly from the first film poster and trailer and fortunately lived up to my expectations. Atlantis is a more "mature" movie by Disney in the sense that it lacks the songs (an unusual feature for a Disney really), and focuses more on action and discovery than any other recent Disney offer. The world of Atlantis, hidden beneath the core of the earth, is fantastic, presented as caves wilted with ruins and then slowly developed into real ecosystems, which, although usually containing a memory of harshness, are becoming more and more interesting until the tropical paradise touched. Presenting the landscape and simply setting Atlantis without cheerful songs gave the kingdom a much more beautiful and exciting look. The inclusion of an Atlantean language, as well as attempts to connect it to the mythology of ancient civilizations in real life, adds to it and works quite well. Also, except for scenes involving Mole's practical jokes, there does not seem to be a "childish" element that he usually associates with Disney movies. Instead, the main elements were struggling to reach Atlantis and the constant discovery that took place in Atlantis, because Milo, outside, was able to learn all he needed to know about this place, helping the Atlanteans discover parts of their history they did not know. Part of this involves the Atlantic "armament," which is used in an extremely action-packed climate, which, for lack of a word, is quite interesting. sense, and the movie does not present new computer-generated visual effects but, in addition to Toy Story movies, this is the most fun Disney movie I've seen over the years.
