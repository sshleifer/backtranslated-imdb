I really think this movie is great, personally. But in every movie there is a downer. Now, some of you may not have seen Hilary Duff's "Lift the Voice" movie, but if you think about them, the two shows are very similar if you know what I mean. In the Courageous Girl, Holly wants so bad to enter the Haverty Conservatory. In "Lift Your Voice," Terri wants to go to a L.A Conservative. (I do not remember the name of the conservatory there). They're both in the music field, and both have to sing at the end of the semester. It's really funny how these two movies are similar. I personally liked "Brave New Girl" better than, "Raise Your Voice" though.
