This is one of the few films I consider film teaching is an improvement to the original book. The story is clear, accessible, fun and exciting, and musical numbers are undoubtedly exceptional. I worshiped the cyclical interpretation of the "old guards" and the charming "Portobello Road," an excellent combination of early animation and real actors techniques that, although dated, do not distract the charm of the play. The backdrop of the Second World War worked well and was not missed as the film began, which is often the case in the "evacuated" stories. A film that is often too underestimated does not produce joy for people of all ages. The performances of the actors are extremely well done, and the whole text is well connected and well-designed. Make sure to make a smile on your face!
