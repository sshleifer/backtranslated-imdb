I like this episode of Columbo. Perhaps because Ruth Gordon is in her and she is wonderful as a successful writer, Mister Abigail Mitchell, an American version of Mother Agatha Christie. She is delighted to look like a perky, loving author who suffered a terrible loss when her niece died in a drowning accident. She blames the niece's husband, nephew. She intends to kill him to avenge her death since the police abandoned her. I would have loved someone other than Mariette Hartley to play Veronica. I never like Hartley in something personal. And, of course, with Columbo, they're laughing like when they ask Veronica for a dance class. Ruth's Abigail is herself intelligent and fits with the wisdom of Columbo, which has always been greatly played by Peter Falk.
