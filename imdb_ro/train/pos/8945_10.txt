this is an honest attempt to make a love affair in love with sweet. the inspiration behind Bewitched, this wonderful sweet rom-com is a timeless treasure. comparisons are obvious. Jimmy Stewart plays an unhappy but strident "right". kim novac plays a strange blond witch that captures him by using a love spell. but when this spell is broken by a stronger witch, she takes care of her business to run her own store, and she feels comfortable that her baby boy (her feline family) is cared for by her beloved aunt. you will recognize your aunt in "Murder by Death". this movie is fun and cute sweet, wearing a spectacular sense and a beautiful witchcraft sensation. worth a look.
