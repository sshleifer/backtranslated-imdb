This movie probably never made a blip on the radar screen, but it has quite a bit of quality. It's pretty realistic, but you think it's just a movie. " Duvall and Close present ordinary people and you will never realize that they are now big-name actors. It seems that the robbery in this story is about too old to banish Eugene's girlfriend, but I think it's possible. It seems unlikely that the child will travel from Montana to Nevada alone, but I think it is possible. You may think that family problems in this movie would never happen in their own family, but I think it is possible. I remember that Glenn Close said something like, "You think the work you do is the hardest part of your life, but it's not like that."
