This amazing documentary gives us a glimpse into the lives of brave women in Cameroun's judiciary - police women, lawyers and judges. Despite the enormous difficulties - lack of resources, desperate people's poverty, multiple languages ​​and more legal precedents, depending on the country's region and the religious / ethnic context of the plaintiffs and defendants - these brave and powerful women make a difference. This is a rare thing - a truly inspiring film that restores a bit of faith in humanity. Despite the atrocities we see in the film, justice is served thanks to these passionate and working women. I hope this movie will be released in the United States. The more people I see this movie, the better.
