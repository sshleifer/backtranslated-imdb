I saw last night this French horror movie and I really enjoyed it. The whole movie takes place in a prison cell, with three prisoners finding a handwritten diary in a wall of a serial killer who has escaped 20 years ago, somehow without leaving the cell. As he looks through the diary, he discovers that he is heading for black arts and commands that could be their way out of the cell and freedom. What they found out is something completely different and terrible to say at least. I like low-budget horror films that deliver the goods in a fairly qualitative way and tell a good story. This film does this despite the fact that it took some time to go. The result and horror it unleashes are very interesting for me and I enjoyed the walk. There is not a lot of gore, but that would not suit the story, though the gore is pretty good.
