Carla is a secretary who is essentially deaf without hearing aids. When she is overloaded at work, she can hire Paul to help her. Paul is just out of jail, and his past is not entirely behind him. To say too much about the story, which has many twists, it would be a mistake. The most interesting thing about this movie for me is how the sound is used to indicate when Carla can hear and when she can not - a sort of "hearing point" (as a point of view). The early scenes that did this, as well as the early character development of Carla and Paul, were more interesting to me than the subsequent upheavals and transformations, some of which were hard to follow and / or hardly credited. There are some unpleasant violence. Back to the positive side, the cinema was very good. The movie is worth seeing, but probably not looking for. Seen at the San Francisco International Film Festival on 4/28/2002.
