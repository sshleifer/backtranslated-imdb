I remember seeing this in the 1970s - then we recently borrowed a few episodes from our public library. With a break of almost 30 years, I reached another conclusion. Most of the executives interviewed in this series - some in the center of power, such as Traudl Junge (Hitler's secretary), Karl Doenitz (German Navy chief) Anthony Eden (UK) - have gone a long way, but their hand accounts will live . Generals and amirals to sergeants, Russian civilians, concentration camps survivors, are all registered here. <br /> <br /> I recall the interview Lord Lord Mountbatten (killed in the 1970s) This is truly a jewel and I think the producer of this series has been invested by Queen Elizabeth for this work - well deserved. Seeing these few episodes from the library makes me want to buy the set. This is the only "10" I gave, but I found that a fine bottle of wine is much appreciated shortly ...
