Let's do things like: Zombies do not exist, so the director can have WALK, RUN, even the hell, if he wants to. That makes this original Zombie movie so good. Everything they did was so original. I hate it when the filmmakers do everything like Romero or when the fans boys expect everything like Romero. Some idiots think the zombies should only roar like a typical Romero movie, again zombies do not exist, so a director can make the zombie whistle if he wants to. The zombies in this movie look great, but generally there are no dead bodies because they died! They are quite disturbed and full of faces and blood cut. One of the most beautiful scenes was a half-eaten cat. It looked so real that my daughter shouted when she saw her. This movie received very good reviews in Fangoria and Rue Morgue, so it made me want to go see him. I'm glad I listened. They are always right when it comes to the tastes of real horror fans. 10 out of 10! Rent him!
