Possible spoilers: fairs that appear late <br /> <br /> Rarely one sees so many fine and memorable characters (almost entirely actresses to be precise) in a single movie. Even if only a few appear for the houses, each one is a jewel. The British make this mix of comedy stories and real life better than any IMO, so it is not surprising that most of the actors are British. Music is great; but, in fact, Clio Lane was no doubt herself - his visceral warm sound returns to me like a few jazz singers. > <br /> As an elderly musician, not too old, and of course not in that class, of course, it was an attractive film - a great movie for anyone who wonders if he is in his profession or law whatever it is. And, of course, a great celebration of the life of the scene. We've lost a little opening, but a provisional 9/10 - and it certainly makes us want to see everything.
