Every day we can watch a large number of movies, soap ... on TV. Sometimes a miracle happens. A wonderful movie, with real feelings, with great actors, with a great director of realism. For me there are two movies that everyone needs to see: the first is Pacula? "Sophie's Choice" with Meryl Streep. The second is "Journey of Hope." As human beings, we must learn about humility, the love of others, the acceptance of another civilization, and another way of living. We must also fight racism and fascism. We must avoid judging, criticizing; we just have to love our landlord. This wonderful movie helps us get to John's dream (Lennon): Imagine that all the people who live live in peace. These two movies are hard to see: watch them, but surely you will be injured, but better. The great movie, the great actors, the terrible story, the pain and the guarantee crying, but also the better understanding of the others. Enjoy it.
