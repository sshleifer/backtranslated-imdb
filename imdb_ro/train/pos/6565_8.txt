I know movie snobs snore. But if you are looking for a surprising fun ride through the jungle of movie B, try "Jake Speed". A little thin sometimes, but the single line and location more than do it for that. John Hurt (God loves him) seems to have fun doing the role of an ultra-evil white slave. Crawfords' Nemesis, Jake Speed. He adds a film size that only a pro like Hurt could offer. Crawford and Dennis Christopher (Jakes sidekick) are a good team, though you wonder why they put each other together. However, together, both Crawford and Christopher portray a team that is so entertaining that for a moment you may feel like a child again in the inherent situations and suspense that he offers. Karen Kopins delicious does a wonderful job as a woman in distress who is more concerned with the motives of her savior, then her agonizing. <br /> <br /> We have not found a movie that is just as fun without preaching, or face the movie trying too hard. Not all movies must be the latest "Citizen Kane". And believe me, Wells was an original. So, let you remember that sometimes the movies are for fun. There are no social comments or attempts to influence the public. But just for the fun of being alive and living at a time when our hero lives in a celluloid dimension.
