Yet some of those brilliant young people who left and dared to make a romantic teen movie (in fact, I can say that - would invoke the devil of her fans) on a small budget but full of taste, sensitivity and maturity. Peter Sollett - you deserve more admiration and respect. Thank you again to demonstrate to the authorities in the industry that stereotypes can be shattered in the toilet. A single location, a handful of rich characters, a low budget, a good acting (and too amateur), a decent lighting - worshipers of true indie cinema, should look more at this and look at STOP ... well ... you know what.
