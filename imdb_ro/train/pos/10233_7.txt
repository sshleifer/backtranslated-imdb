I've always been keen to watch Hong Kong movies, but they've all failed to meet my expectations ... until now! THE PARADISE ARBITRE does not contain flat humor, most HK movies, and no other story line that has been shot in the movie. The story is not complex, but there are scenes to be there just to fill a "smart" space (the only smart martial art movie I've seen is CROUCHING TIGER, but since Hollywood is involved, it's not a true HK movie for me). There are some incredible fighting scenes in this movie, from the first movie (one of the toughest I've ever seen, but so short) to the latest main scenes! But remember, there is a lot of flowing blood (half-cut people, decapitated, etc.). The production is pretty good, and the special effects show that the writer's fantasy can be fulfilled, even if some photographs have to be quite technical (observation: the sheet of paper he throws and trapped in a wall!). Yeah, it's not Tsui Hark or John Woo who made my favorite movie in Hong Kong, it's Ringo Lam! And I'm sure he'll see more from this director! I would.
