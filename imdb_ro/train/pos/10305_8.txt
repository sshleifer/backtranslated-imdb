If you want a serious laugh of pain, watch this movie and the things Bruce challenges to his news colleague. Removed scenes are invaluable. I do not know why they did not include them in the original movie. It can not be because of the time because the movie has only 101 minutes. Morgan Freeman is a brilliant actor who has been overlooked for too long. Jim Carrey needs drugs!
