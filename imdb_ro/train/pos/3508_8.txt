Incredibly exciting and exciting, I realized it was impossible to get back once I started looking. They are usually one of the toughest critics, but for me this movie was just brilliant, weird, because I might say it almost smells the air and feel the textures of the locations. <br /> <br /> From cinema I thought there was a great use of light and texture. From the orange light of summer light to the plastic couch, they all had a distinct air of realism for me. From the character's point of view, I thought that the notion of Victor Vargas as almost glue that linked the story was quite inspired, each of the other members of the family having a more complete background simply caused more intrigue in the main character. Beyond that, knowing someone like the grandmother and who was at the end of such a situation, I can say that the situation was particularly realistic. Brightness, emphasis, cooking, and even the comments made to me were so authentic. I think this movie worked for me because I started watching it without expectation and I found it completely sinking and brought back memories of teen emotion, it's worth being a watch.
