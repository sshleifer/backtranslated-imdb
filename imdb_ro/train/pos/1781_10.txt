... here comes the Romeo Division to change the paradigm. Let me just say I was BLOWN AWAY of this short film. I saw it by accident when I was in Boston at a movie festival and since then I thanked God for that. I really think I was part of an event, as if I read a script from Tarantino before something else comes or I see the first screening of Mean Streets. I'm not sure what festival is going to next or what the creative team has for future products but I hope to be there for that. Again, a truly incredible piece of shooting.
