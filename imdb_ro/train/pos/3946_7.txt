I found a single comment about this completely informative film and it was totally too tough, so I decided to write on my own. I saw this movie for the first time when it came out and I captured it several times since then. First of all, let me say that, overall, the things this movie takes right is what it deserves. It does not matter that it has some low budget bizarre and other mistakes. It's worth watching. The idea of ​​setting up a film about Walt Whitman's visit, a restrictive and narrow Anglo-Canadian community in southern Ontario, and bringing people to life is a brilliant mis-en-scene. The film is about the type of humanized catalysis Whitman inspired in humans. And in this sense it is accurate. The actor - especially Rip Torn (Whitman) and Colm Feore as a doctor - is very good. The scenario and dialogue are strong and pay attention to the soft and inflection of time. On the whole, what do you dislike? In addition, does it mean another movie in which Whitman is brought so alive to life?
