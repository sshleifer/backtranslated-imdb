As the new BSG was not what fans of the original series expected, Caprica might not offer what the fans of the new BSG (for the most part) expected. It's a very interesting show, if not somewhat involved in itself, or at least the pilot is. If you are looking for the great CGI excitement of the (new) BSG, you will be very disappointed. If you liked drama, you'll probably find something you like and maybe even identify you. The story analyzes how the Cylons were developed, why Adama hates them and the origin of a monotheistic society. Writers also succeed in fighting the man "playing God" and creating or re-creating "human" life. It will be interesting to see how this is played. I realized that it would have happened in some parts and talked to others, but it was all promising. A small part of me wishes (or hopes) that there might be some tiny inclinations of BSG there (besides the back story I mentioned), but this could contradict the story too much. Like BSG, I'll have to wait and see if Caprica grows over me, but it's too early to tell her. It would be very easy to break this as a failure if you compare it to the previous series, but I'm willing to give it a chance. Overall, I thought it was interesting enough to make me see how the real series is before "throwing the towel (prosperi)".
