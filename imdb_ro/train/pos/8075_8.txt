I decided not to think what famous movie critics say. Even though this movie did not receive the best reviews, this movie made me the day. It made me think. What is a false world? What do you do when your loved ones cheat you? It is said that no matter how often you feed your milk with a snake, it can never be loyal and will bite when given a chance. The same is that some people are never grateful. This film is about how selfish people can be, and how everyone thinks only to themselves and works for themselves. A brother dies inappropriately in the hands of a gangster. The surviving brother decides to take revenge. Through this process, we learn about the futility of this world. Nothing is real and no one is loyal to anyone. Amitabh gave the performance of his life. The new Arian actor gave a good performance. The actress who played Amitabh's wife stole the show. Her role was small, but she presented her role so diligently that one is moved by her performance. Chawla had a really big face, but her role was very limited and she was not given a chance to express herself fully. A great film by Raj Kumar Santoshi. His films always give a message to the public. His films are similar to the novels of Nanak Singh (a Punjabi novelist who always had a purpose and targeted a social evil) because they have a real message to the public. They are fun, but also lessons.
