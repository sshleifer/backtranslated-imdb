This, made for the television version of the legendary stand against hopeless chances, is more objective and more realistic than previous versions of the events, although the film then went too far in humanizing the figures of Sam Houston, Bowie, Travis and Crockett . The focus is on Jim Bowie, played with a cynical and clear detachment by James Arness, who apparently still lives at the age of 85. Then, aged 65, he returned to work after a few years from the screen to make this part. Rivera Julia, born in Puerto Rican, humiliates General Santa Ana like no one since J. Carol Naish back in '54 did. However, the Mexican dictator is portrayed as an exhausting, tiring popinjay - gaudier uniforms have never been seen before or since. He receives excellent advice from the European officers he hired, but convinced of his infallibility he does not listen to. Alec Baldwin is the only actor whose age is suited to the character he is playing: Col - William Travis. His image is sincere. He is almost astonished by the elders who share his command with him. One note was Brian Keith as Crockett. In a bag of coon and carrying Ol 'Betsy, he stumbles as if he's been lost in another movie. Without convincing in the portrait, character is reduced to a few scene conventions. <br /> <br /> The script reveals some historical facts ignored or suppressed in previous versions of the film. We find out that Jim Bowie was Santa Ana, fighting his brother-in-law. Mexican soldiers had a poor performance because they were armed with rifles left in the Napoleonic wars an earlier generation. "Santa Ana likes a business." Bowie explains roughly. The entire defense project of the former Spanish mission as the fort was inadequate military - a fact explored in depth in the movie "The Alamo" in 2004.
