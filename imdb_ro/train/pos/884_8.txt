If you're a fan of the noir movie and you think I'm not doing it the way they did, here's your answer - they're not doing them anymore in Hollywood. We have to go back to the French to remember how satisfying, subtle and terrible it can be a well-made film of that genre. Read My Lips is a wonderful gift for the faithful of director Jacques Audiard, with strident stories and fine interpretations by Emmanuelle Devos and Vincent Cassel. The basic compilation could have been written in the 1940s: but ex-con, and an intelligent fatal female but dowdy (which proves to be ambitious without mercy) are discovered while living lives of desperation and gloomy desire manipulate each other to meet their own goals, develop complex relationships of love / hate up criminal system that involves heist, double crosses, close calls and lots of money. All actions take place in depressing, deceptive and / or poorly lit locations. <br /> <br /> Audiard has, of course, made some modern twists and turns. Femme fatale is an understated office worker who happens to be almost deaf and uses her lip readiness to take revenge on those who marginalize her. And if you can expect live love scenes, you'll find that both characters are strange and immature from a sexual point of view. Add a little bit of modern technology and music and it looks like it's a contemporary movie, but make no mistake - this is the old movie noir movie. It's as good as any genre and is easily one of the best movies we've seen all year round.
