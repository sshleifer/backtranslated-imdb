Fascinatingly I approached I Am Curious (Yellow) and it is a play with great fear. I have read many reports about her controversies and explicit sex. What we received was not that, but a cinematic experience profoundly challenging and interesting, unlike any other. I honestly believe that most commentators who felt that the movie was "lame" or "boring" approached the film as if it were pornography. Perhaps this is pornography, assuming that pornography is something intended to contradict the senses, but is intentionally neo-erotic. Lena, the protagonist, throws it all into the show, giving it a reality and a humanity that is simply convincing and durable. Her breasts may be poor, unusually large nipples, fat thighs, and her face, a bastard. But by the end of the movie, the audience comes to identify with her and accept her mistakes as human. This touch makes it even more necessary for credibility. If the director had threw a bomb from Briget Bardot, the effect would have been canceled. I can not recommend this challenging piece anymore. Be prepared to invest much thought in this movie deliberately. The patient and the viewer will be rewarded with all sorts of other films they can dream about.
