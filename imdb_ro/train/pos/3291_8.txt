A wonderful film and a shame that it will not get too much attention outside the artistic circles and the students who will stay up until two in the morning to watch it on channel 4. The land is simple, works very efficiently, the blur of the child's fantasy and the heavy nightmare is very blurry. The budget looks rather low, but for the people involved, it does not show up too often. He also did not give too much of this. I was lucky enough to get this out of the TV when it was a few years ago, and it resisted half of the visits. It is one of those films that will not appeal to all; though, as usual, those who have a closer look at the cinema would get a lot out of it. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Buerke puts good performance on Anna's spoiled arm and is a shame that seems to have left the action scene. The cross is also very good, having the character's stature very well in the context of the image. There are some really disturbing (and not so easy) moments in this movie, both half a second and more tense tensions. Watch him with the lights out! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
