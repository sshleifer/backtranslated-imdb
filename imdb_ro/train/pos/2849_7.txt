I can not say that this movie is a disappointment because I read some reviews before watching and did not do the way I thought it would have. The bar was not so great that the fact that my expectations were met does not mean too much. Good: New York City. If you live in a city like me, you will recognize certain places and understand that the city should be more than a decor, rather one of the main characters. There are really delicious moments, humorous conversations, and plotting of the left and right plot that all keep things interesting. Bad: The first thing I thought after I left the theater was that I wanted more, but not in the positive "let them want more" fashion. Of course, good scenes and scenes outweigh the evil, but there are a lot of skits that fall into the 'in' category, too many, in fact, which ultimately brings the film down. Also, the diversity of New York, although suggested that many distant tablets of the city and mentioned in conversation throughout the film, are never really realized or analyzed to the point of doing justice to the city. For example, many of the sketches imply good middle-class whites. I mean, I know that the city hosts many of the many demographics, but come, Je'taime's Paris and the diversity of characters make New York look like Lancaster, PA, or in a really white place. It's just disappointing to see the city shortchanged on its patrimony like that. However, even after I said so, I would recommend giving New York, I Love You a point of view. Who knows, maybe you will not agree with my opinion and maybe you will not. You will never know until you see it alone. This review is not intended to discourage anyone from viewing this movie, as everyone's opinion on art differs. I just give you a very vague look about what to expect.
