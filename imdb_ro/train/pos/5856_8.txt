Evaluate E (contains violence). I have had the original Spiderman PC game for a few years now. I still have not beaten it because on Windows XP there is a glitch at a level that I cant beat because of it.So be warned if you have XP.But for those who do not XP give this game a try.Its a game fun family fun with action and awesome for any spiderman fan. In the game you play spiderman and you take on the different criminals who commit crimes. Spiderman is a fun little game and I recommend it to any fan of a spiderman or a parent who want a fun game, clean for their children.
