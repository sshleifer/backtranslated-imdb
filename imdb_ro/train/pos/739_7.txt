I've been a fan of Jodie Foster since we were both kids since Disney. I loved her thriving antics in movies like Candleshoe. "Foxes" was such a big departure from all this. When other young female actors of that era turned into sex puertilization disguised as comedy ("Little Darlings", anyone?), Jodie went for a depressing and tragic story of adolescents dragged to their death by attraction strong temptation and addiction. This was not Disney. It was not Porky. It was not Halloweed. This was a dark and powerful story about the destruction of young life. Unfortunately, it is a story that is unfolding daily across the country, this movie could be resumed (with a current soundtrack) and still be completely relevant. It's not the best movie ever made, it's tired in some parts, not all the performances are particularly remarkable. But Jodie Foster continued to show her chops as a true adult actor (a trend started when she was very young in Taxi Driver). 7 of 10 Barky
