I, like many horror fans, have been forced to eat the same big banana remakes in Hollywood and the MTV school swamp over the last 20 years. Here, finally, it's an original musical genre that beats all the right boxes. You want a hot actress, you want vampires, you want cool weapons, you want cool vehicles and you want blood, a lot of it with the bucket load - you get it. With a great fighting choreography and a supporting role at Hammer Horror, she quips herself, Stephanie Beacham, this is truly fantastic. <br /> <br /> Despite the low budget, choosing to use a 35mm stock and adding mix quality CG effects, director James Eaves has created something that feels much bigger. A necessity for the old school fans' horror.
