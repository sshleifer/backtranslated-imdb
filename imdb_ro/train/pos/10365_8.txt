This is a true story about an Australian couple who is accused of murder when their child disappears. Meryl Streep is excellent, as always, and manages to keep our interest even if she plays a character that is not particularly enjoyable. The media frenzy that surrounded this case in Australia is a reminiscence of Sam Sheppard's killing case in Ohio in the 1950s. These real life situations show that the media can affect the way a criminal case is handled. I remember very well that the Cleveland Plainfield Distributor, running a huge title, saying "Why is not Sam Sheppard in prison?" The prosecutor eventually yielded to this relentless pressure, and Sheppard was tried and convicted. Only after years of imprisonment was he exonerated. I like movies that tell a true story, do it in an interesting way and make an important point in this process. This is one of those movies. Other good movies that tell the story of innocent people accused of murders are "Hurricane," "Blue Thin Line" and "Breaker Morant". In particular, the latter is another Australian film, which is highly recommended. 8/10
