I have to see this on the plane last week in NZ and I was wondering how the British film and the book will measure. I have to say that I was favorably impressed. If the fanatic attachment to Red Sox during the weak years works even better than the original dedication to Arsenal FC, which has been successful over the years. As a British I was also interested in seeing you do not have to understand baseball to get what's going on. One question comes to my mind - the script was written using Sox as a team just before finally breaking the Bambino Curse? Or was there another team in the frame? Like a red Sox fan I (strangely know, a brace that understands baseball) I have to say that added to joy.
