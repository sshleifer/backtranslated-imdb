An extraordinary black and white cinema, and a lot of things, highlights this life story about a Kansas 1950 crime, in which a whole family was destroyed by two men. was written by Truman Capote, so you get the very liberal message against the death penalty at the end of the movie, which is absurd in knowing the facts of this case. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson sang the two attentive losers who overturned the outlook of life and who uselessly kills this beautiful family. <br /> <br /> Despite annoying tilt in the end, this is a riveting story from the beginning and cinema makes this even more fascinating. Family photographer Conrad Hall has done a great job in this respect. It makes me want more modern movies to be made in black and white. See it on DVD. Blake, Wilson, John Forsythe, Jeff Corey and all the support distribution are excellent here. The third view of this film came in early April 2005, shortly after Blake, in real life, was declared innocent in killing his wife. You can not think of Blake and this different movie afterwards.
