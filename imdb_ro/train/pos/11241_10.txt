I bought this movie, one of my favorite DVD movies, and recently, as usual, during the screening, everyone changed my mind. I'm a massive fan of Hazel O'Connor and Hazel O'Connor. the soundtrack of this film has me in tears, especially the song "Will You". It's a pure nostalgia trip for me back to my youth. This rate is best for Quadrophenia (who also played Phil Daniels). A good soundtrack and a wonderful view of Great Britain in the years of Thatcherite of the 80 years I grew up in. The end is so sad, a few hours after the end of the movie are like a child blubbering. I expect to fill this DVD from repeated viewing, I can always watch it again and never be bored, just for the soundtrack. Hazel, I'm sorry to hear about your father's sake. God bless you all. xx
