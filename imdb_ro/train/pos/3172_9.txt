Debut? Wow - Cross-Eyed is easily one of the most enjoyable indie films I've ever watched in the past year, making it hard to believe that Cross Eyed is the writer's debut movie. I mean - I went to IMDb to find more of this writer's movies ... because Cross Eyed has the unique signature - you want to see what this writer should say. These days, seldom to see a movie that is well written, well-directed, well-edited and well-acted. For me - Cross Eyed encapsulates what film she should do - combining the best of all film elements to create a smart, artistic and lively story. More, please.
