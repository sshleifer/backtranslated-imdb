As for parody films, there are few that deserve time and energy. but with the recent recurrence of horrific parodies such as Data Movie and The Comebacks, it's a breath of fresh air to come back and rediscover a really funny joke like Johnny Dangerously. After his mother has no medical problems, little Johnny goes to work for the crowd. What happens is a series of gags, most of which work, but there are, however, occasional flops. But a foreign gangster who can not master the American language (at least wise profanity), a rival gangster, with a plea to shoot his mouth (... once!), A younger brother with D.A. who is out to get Johhny Dangerously, and a hot starlet hot couple for his afflictions have Johnny busy. And the spectator will be laughing, for the most part, that every gangster-film clich√© is swallowed up by talented casting and decent writing. It's not perfect with a long shot but certainly good for a smile on a bad day.
