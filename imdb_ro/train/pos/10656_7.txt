What a wonderful Barbara Stanwyck movie I met last night. "Jeopardy" was fantastic. It was made in 1953 and probably for double bills, but it kept me on the edge of the chair. Barbara Stanwyck interprets Helen, who, along with husband Doug (Barry Sullivan) and son (Lee Aaker), is an isolated fishing spot in Mexico for a holiday. The husband has a drop off the wharf and the only way to be saved is if Barbara heads back into a garage for a particular rope. While in a psychotic killer (Ralph Meeker, one of my favorites), and what follows is a cat and mouse game, Barbara tries everything she can to get Meeker to come back with her to - and release her husband. The movie was so suspense and such a surprise - I did not expect such a great movie. But I suppose I should have realized - is something Barbara Stanwyck doing is a little less wonderful?
