This game is amazing. Indeed, you should get it if you do not. Although it is old now it was amazing when it came out. I think this game will always be a classic. It's just as good a Super Mario World or something. When I was young, my friend and I would have stayed and played this game for a few hours trying to beat him that we did in the end. It's not nearly as advanced as Super Mario Galaxy, but if you're a fan of Mario it's essential. It's fun and fun. Everything you might want from a fantasy game, except for good graphics, (well it came out in 1996.) ROCK ON 4EVA MARIO LUIGI AND YOSHI !!! Nintendo is the best!
