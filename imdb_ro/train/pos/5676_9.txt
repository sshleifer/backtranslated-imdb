THREE-BLACKADDER THIRD SERIES "If you want something done properly, kill Baldrick before you start" Hot on the heels of the second series the show returned with the current owner of the famous name down on luck and in service as a butler to Prince Regent, a vain and stupid follicle for Blackadder's venom played by Hugh Laurie. Baldrick is still in the trailer as the other piece of the comedy jigsaw. The format is similar to the previous show, after they have now found the winning formula of what changes things. We see Blackadder trying to get rich behind the cute regent in more ingenious ways, trying to make Bladrick a mr. Or trying to make a bride for the prince. In many respects, this is one of the most accurate of the series in history, the ruling regent took control of the throne during his father's madness, and some of the enlightened characters say much about the times. Samuel Johnson, William Pit, and Wellington all go through events and they all manage to steal their scenes, not an easy thing with such a star cast
