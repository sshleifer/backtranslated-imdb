Like his early masterpiece, "The Elephant Man," Lynch proves his critics that he can tell a simple and simple story without losing his artistic touch. This is a true story of a retired old man (expert played by Richard Farnsworth) who decides to travel a tractor in several states to make a final visit to his alienated brother who is now at the door of death. A beautiful score from Badalamenti, a refined picture of rural life (the love of those field cornfields) and a director's hand that reveals the humanity's basic humanity is a beautiful slice of life. Its extremely sluggish rhythm can make it difficult for some viewers to sleep, but those who stay together for the trip will eventually be rewarded.
