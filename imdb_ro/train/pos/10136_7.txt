This is one of the best episodes in the second season of the MOH, I think Mick Garris has a problem with women ... He kills all, they are often the victims (Screwfly, Pro-life, Valerie, I do not remember Argento's episode in season 1, etc., obviously Imprint). I think they are happy to see that women have been burned, tortured, mutilated, and I do not know. Never "The Right to Die" is one of the best, with good transformations and graphic and suspense scenes (especially with beautiful cell pictures). The act is that the whole series, the usual I could be the worst as "Pro-life" or "We Tail for Ice cream". I also think the plot could be done for a movie and not just for an episode. The series' ideology is horrible, killing and ending women, mutilating animals on and off ... the first season was better than the second, with episodes such as "Cigarrette burns", "Homecoming" The most funny), "Imprint" (very shocking).
