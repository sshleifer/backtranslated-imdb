As movies B go, it was way over the average (I warn the reader now that I can reveal some key elements of the plot or other parts of the film, though I try to minimize any such trend). As it usually happens, it was extraordinarily fantastic (despite a "cookie cutter" approach to trying to copy some of the original Verbatum elements.) Despite this sometimes dull tendency, it seemed to work in this film divorced his attention from comparisons with original "scanners"). The film was similar in the "Superman" series as regards the description of the main character of his early childhood and the relationship with his parents (which seemed to be modeled on the same lines as Kents in the "Superman" stories) and the theme of a pure moral hero, possessing extraordinary powers from an early age, etc. Expression of profound feelings of alienation of prodigious or otherwise non-children, adolescents and / or adults who have joined them was a theme that reminded me of films like "Real Genius" and (more superficial) "Doctor Mordrid" and hit a particularly strong chord. <br /> <br /> The movie had a positive message, and it was fun to watch. We have discovered some of the intuitions and precision (in describing certain aspects of paranormal experiences) fascinating and sometimes profound. These moments appeared occasionally from all the famous schlock and free sex (uality, in this case, because the sexual elements were made with taste) and the violence that makes B movies (or Shakespearian plays, for example!) To be so much fun to watch! This is a watch to look for all the comic books, sci-fi, "distant viewing" enthusiasts, and fans of horror! With correct exposure in straight circles, the film could develop a next cult, along with original "scanners."
