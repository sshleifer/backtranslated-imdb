I will not repeat everything that has already been said by other viewers of this film. In my opinion, this is an excellent film, not just a very human story of the developing relationship between a father and his adult son, but also a small window in the world of Islam, for those like me who are not too familiar with this religion. An important aspect of this story is that of the young man's relationship with his father's beliefs and practices, and how his attitude towards religion seems to change in subtle ways as we progress on their journey with them. This is a very challenging, pleasant and enjoyable idea. a well-done film that I would recommend to anyone with a brain and heart.
