What do you dislike about this movie? Every year, you know you'll get one or two movies during Christmas and most will be terrible. This movie is definitely a new fresh idea that has been extracted quite well. A very funny fun for a wealthy young man who pays a family to simulate a real Christmas for him. What's good to have money like this if you can not do fun with it. It was a winning situation. An ordinary family gets six digits and a rich guy gets to experience Christmas as he imagined. Only if Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) was incredibly difficult to cope with and it was just a revolt to see the family reluctantly according to its absurd demands. It was fun and funny.
