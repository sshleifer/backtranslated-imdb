The 1986 film of The Spirit was a pilot for a possible series. However, the Creator of Spirit would not like Eisner's film and so no series was produced. I thought it was a very fun movie and captured the spirit (bad) of the comic with a modern twist. I'm sorry it did not materialize in a series. Sam (Flash Gordon) Jones was a perfect Spirit. Nana's visit was a beautiful Ellen Dolan and, of course, she would later go to Star Trek: Deep Space Nine years later. Perhaps, with the release of Frank Miller's movie "The Spirit," more people will be able to see this rare jewel in the history of the Spirit. It turns out that when Hollywood makes a movie from a character or an idea already set, someone will inevitably look for previous versions of the property and launch the video to make a few bucks. When Antonio Banderas dressed Zorro's mask, we were able to get previous versions of the DVD masked hero, such as Alain Delon's biggest version of the 1970s (though all the copies we've ever seen badly edited). Heres hopes someone will soon release The Spirit's DVD adventure.
