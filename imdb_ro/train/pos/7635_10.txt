I have seen this movie many times and I have to tell you that I enjoyed each other. This is Belushi's movie, in my opinion. Belushi and Lovitz are so enjoyable and can be identified with the average man that you can help but get involved when you start watching. The movie has a wonderful cast of stars, some have already been great, and others have just started. It's billed as a good movie, and that's exactly what it is. This movie teaches that life is not always so bad after all. Sometimes you have to look at things from a different perspective in order to fully appreciate what you already have. When you have finished watching, you will appreciate the things that you have a lot more and you will also smile. You can not ask for much more of a movie in my opinion, let alone a hilarious movie and you will never lose interest. Very High underestimated movie here folks. Rating from me: 10 I'm out !!!
