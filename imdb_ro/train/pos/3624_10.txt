Rookie made me smile from start to finish. Dennis Quaid played the role of perfection. The boy who plays his son was fantastic. He made a movie of the son's father to remember. Messages are good. Follow your dream. If you can not look, it's fine as long as you try. Excitement is palpable. I think this movie will be classic.
