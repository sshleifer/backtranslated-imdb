"One Itch In Time" is one of the home bands that Bob Clampett hit for WB in the early 1940s, including "Horton Hatches The Egg" and "Tortoise Wins By A Hare". Aged in manic times and exaggerated chaos, it is basically the saga of a flea that occupies the breaking ground for a new house and the dog whose ground is broken. Because Master Elmer will give him a terrible flea bath if he is so scratchy, the unfortunate canine is forced to bear a spiral of upward torment as the flea hosted uses pick-axes and electric tools to clean the "earth." Finally, the little monster lights up the safety in a small mountain of high explosive explosives, which it gathers behind the victim! There is an extraordinary explosion, and the unfortunate pooch covers his eyes as his back end erupts in a lighted poster of the fourth of July! That really has to hurt, and the dog flies, but soon stops the action and says with a cheerful smile: "You better cut her, because I think I start to like it!" For years, this perverse confession has been censored, but the current fingerprints have restored the clip, so viewers can enjoy it in its diabolical initial glory. However, cutting is the closure gag in which the cat blows his brain after he complains: "Now I've seen everything!" This was a common gang at the WB, but since then it has been cleared from this cartoon and several others, including Horton.
