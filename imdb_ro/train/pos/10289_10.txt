WOW, Jim Carrey eventually returned from death. This movie made me laugh and cry. It also sends a message from which we should all know and learn. Jeniffer Aniston was great, she will eventually have a movie hit under her belt. If you liked a liar lying, you'll enjoy this movie. I'll give him 9/10.
