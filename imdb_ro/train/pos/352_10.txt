I just saw "Valentine" and I have to say it was the best slasher movie I've seen in years. Unlike the recent trend of 90-year horror films, this film is more concerned about being more stunning than being self-defeating. For those who hate "Scream," there is no reference to the "horror rules" in this movie (even if the old slasher movie rules apply here). <br /> <br /> This is a perfect horror mix of 80 and 90 years. You will get the style, cinema and good action of the 1990s, as well as the madness of watching and blocking a movie from the '80s. I think 2001 will eventually give fans of horror the kind of movies they wanted. This is certainly a move in the right direction. Denise Richards is here as a fun character. You can tell her she likes the role, and that makes her stand out. I loved it in this movie.
