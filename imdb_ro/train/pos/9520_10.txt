This is a beautiful movie. The true story of the relationship between father and son. This is by far, Tom Hanks at its best. Tom Hanks is really out of the box in this movie. He usually has beautiful roles. However, in this film, he appears in this film as a little strange, but still appears to smell like a rose, even to the last scene, the murder of his character. The distribution of this movie was well put together. I also like the part when there is total silence when Tom Hanks's character shoots and kills all the men in Mr Rooney's group. There is something refreshing and yet profound for no sound in that scene, just excitement. I like to look at John Rooney's character, Paul Newman's character, when he realizes, even before he sees it, that Tom Hanks's character takes revenge, and he knows his fate has come. The first time I saw the movie, I was upset and I knew I had to get out and get the video, and then I added it to my favorite movie collection of all time. Tom Hanks is my favorite actor, so this movie has a special place in me.
