An imagination is a terrible thing to waste ... especially when you have talented actors. Writer / director Jones does not waste any time to share his viewer with his protagonist. <br /> <br /> Anyone who shared a slob apartment will cry with laughter. Anyone who has arrived while a maid of yards places a ticket on the windshield will simply cry. We all wanted to destroy a terrible bastard on a man's head. These are just fragments of what's in the store when you watch the movie "Cross Eyed," an unimaginable film that should be a cornerstone for Jones and his sense of humor both in front and behind the room .
