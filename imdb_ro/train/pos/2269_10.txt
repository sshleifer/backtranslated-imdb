I just read the novel "Mom's Night", I've been holding the DVD for some time now and I look at it so often. Some of the movies I have and I have seen make me think and doubt as much as Mama Night, am amazed at the shine of not only Vonnegut but also the translation of the text on the screen. do not rent or watch this movie on VHS, must be done on DVD, and must be accompanied by the director's commentary on the film. To see how they made a fairly simple story, yet complex in its substance and dialogue and made it work so well, I think any spectator will be amazed. The omissions in the movie are few text, and do not degrade it for long, the film could also be the book, and it is the best adaptation we've ever seen. So I have recommended both the book and the film together that it makes a disadvantage to just say to look at it. It will change you if you do.
