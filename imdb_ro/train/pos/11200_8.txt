This early film has its flaws - a predictable plot and some overlapping scenes of dubious relevance - but it is already clearly demonstrating Hitchcock's way of editing and using powerful images. He is also one of the most Expressionist films of his stylist; notes, for example, the strange distortions he uses during the party sequence and the frequent echoes of the titles and the plot of the images. However, his core remains the final match, which is still among the many exciting examples of cinematic boxing. Even if you know that the hero has to win, it becomes quite credible to lose, and his wife's move from the corner of the champion to him, motivating the final salary, is very well related to the progress of the match. Timer inserts do exactly what they should; you can almost hear ticking (even if it is a silent, visual film often have a surprising sense of hearing for them). Pacing becomes amazingly fast and the spectator is aspired to the emotion and brutality of both the match and the sexual jealousy that underlines it. The only DVD I'm familiar with is Laserlight, a public domain company. As with every silent Hitchcock they released, they attached various musical acts, mostly orchestral. Changing sound is often undesirable and sound quality varies a lot, but some care seems to have gone through most of the real options, and the music that accompanies the final match works very well; it is unlikely that this sequence will ever be better off than it is here. This is a more impressive film than his obscurity now suggests. It deserves an honorable place both in Hitchcock's canon and in the thin list of valuable box films.
