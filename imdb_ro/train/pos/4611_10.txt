Version: Universal / Hong Kong Legends R4 DVD release. Cantonese / English subtitles <br /> <br /> Once upon a time, five years ago, the world was obsessed with "The Matrix" and I was probably one of the few fifteen-year-olds who just thought that "The Terminator "was better than" Matrix ". I was just a simple teenage boy, I was looking for a good action movie and then a brilliant light on a TV station I never saw, a little station known as SBS. One night I noticed in the TV guide that a movie with Jackie Chan - "Police Story" would be later. Being fifteen and seeing just "Rumble in the Bronx" and "Rush Hour," I said "WOW AWESOME" and I sat down to watch her and I continually shouted "WOW AWESOME" as the movie progresses. Two weeks later, after SBS showed the "Police Story" trilogy, I knew I found my new favorite actor. Jackie interprets Chan Ka Kui, a Hong Kong police officer who busts a big drug, Chu (Yuen Chor). Chu's secretary, Selina Fong (Brigitte Lin), is detained by police as a witness against Chu, and Chan is assigned to protect her. Things are bad - bad news - when Chu's case is rejected and he decides he wants Fong and Chan dead. "Story Police" is one of the greatest action movies ever, and certainly one of my favorite Jackie Filme Chan. It starts strong and ends with one of the most incredible sequences of action ever shot. Everything between them is great. However, some fun parties may seem a bit less taste for more than a few people ... Like a story, this is still one of Jackie's bigger efforts. For an action movie, the story is pretty good, and Jackie is a much better actor in the field than in the New Police Story. This is not "Miracles", but maybe it's a good thing. "Police Story" is one of Jackie's most beautiful works. I got on Jackie Chan's movies and I should make a nice start for any of Jackie's potential fans. The bad news for anyone who sees this is that Jackie Chan's films do not come much better - 10/10
