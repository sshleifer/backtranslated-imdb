Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci are an excellent couple and show her with their unique charisma in this film. This is the typical "alternative" or indie film with a plot that presents a rare situation that suddenly becomes very important. Pecker is an average boy who has an old room and his main hobby is to photograph the exotic inhabitants of the small town he lives in. Suddenly an alternate artist gives his attention to working and hires him to expose his work to some important festivals and more. But Pecker's life is changing sharply, because now wealth and fame seem to upset the city's people who are Pecker's main inspiration. Even his sexy girlfriend gets crazy because now he does not pay her "proper" attention. Well, this is an Indian film with a margin, but not for everyone. It may seem boring or pretentious for some people, but still I think it deserves a watch just because it offers something "different" than the typical Hollywood standards. To describe in a few words: This is Christina's typical Ricci and John Waters movie. That's it. Oh, and I almost forgot to mention that the "Full of Grace" lines are very annoying. Lord.
