I am completely shocked that this show has been canceled. It only took you a year. I just started looking at her and I like it. A show that could disappear to friends. She had the humor and was very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> It's about two brothers and two sisters who live under one roof without their parents. Kurt (Joey Lawrence) plays the older brother role and takes a more paternal role. <br /> <br /> This should take a lot longer than a year to be fantastic. Amazing show with all the best actors. <br /> <br />
