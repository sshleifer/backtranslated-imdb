Another one does not make that category. This story of a family with real skeletons in its closet still qualifies as good, clean, sometimes superior fun. Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are at the top as the troubled Hadley brothers even took their roles and fled with them. Malone earned an Oscar, and Stack was nominated in support categories, both honors being highly deserved. They counterbalance somewhat weak leadership. Neither Bacall nor Hudson could be called bad actors, but they both had better parts and played them much more convincingly than they did here. It's hard for me to accept Rock Hudson playing a heterosexual red-blood like he does here, but that's more of a personal prejudice than anything else. But this does not get away from the entertainment value of the film, which is considerable and this movie is highly watched. If you woke up one night and this movie will happen, I'd say I'm following him. It is well worth it.
