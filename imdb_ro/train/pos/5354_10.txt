Why did not Dynamo have any trousers? Where did they go ?? It has never been explained. That's why the movie was so great. Plus Starsky gave AIDS children !!!! It works very well. Richard Dawson deserved to win the best actor in a secondary role! A I D S My favorite line in the movie was "That hit the place" A I D S This movie was for the "birds". I tried to give this movie "stinkeye" but continued to play. What are they doing wrong ??? !!!! I thought "HATEBOAT" was funny lol;) I would love this for a show. Why Dinamo was not wearing pants. I know his arm was hurt, but ... What happens to those crazy futuristic nets. Why did not he say that kind of family raid, Ray Combs, a net? He could have used one. AIDSSSSS
