I can not believe I'm seeing this movie now - I think maybe I thought it was another movie about wandering slaves and I avoided roots for the same reason - as I have seen Schindler's list - I do not want to be "distracted" by the pain of others, it does not matter how authentic or informative it should be. So, I think the main thing I noticed about Color Purple was that it was not blacks who were whitewashed by whites. Black people were perfectly capable of wasting their own daughters - or giving them to be treated as slaves of their "wives." It was painful to look, but everyone was finally redeemed, and the act was phenomenal! I could not believe the character Oprah played at the age of 35! And I love Whoopi to start with - it was amazing. I'm so glad I felt hot yesterday afternoon, and Showtime was running The Purple Color.
