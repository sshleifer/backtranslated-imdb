Based on St Ives by Robert Louis Stevenson, the film tells of a young French captain Hussar (Jean Marc Barr) during the Napoleonic wars. Earned in the battle, he is sent to a prison camp in Scotland, led by Major Farquhar (Richard E Grant). Shortly he falls in love with a local girl (Anna Friel), strikes a friendship with the major, and discovers that his long lost grandfather, who has fled France during the revolution, lives only on his way! The spiritual performances of all distributions and memorable lines make it an over-average offer.
