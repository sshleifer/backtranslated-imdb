"Panic in the Streets" was a decent thriller, but I felt a little disappointed about it. The central theme of a city attacked by a plague in the modern age is fascinating, but the film does not explore it or develop it. It's well made and fun, but it's not as exciting as it should have been. The script for this movie is very weak and brings the whole movie down. None of the central characters are truly convincing or credible. Fortunately, the movie is very well done to compensate for the poor scriptures. Elia Kazan's direction keeps the film in suspense and moves at a rapid pace. There are some distinct sequences, especially the memorable climax of climbing. When his direction was combined with several scenarios for several years later, man might have made no mistake. The actor is also very good. Richard Widmark has always been a leading man who can be watched and doing everything he can with a subscribed character. Paul Douglas spends his time crying a little too much, but he also does a decent job. The castout standouts are the two villains. Zero Mostel, known primarily for his comic roles, is really thin as one of the final characters of the cinema. Jack Palance is undoubtedly a bad villain. "Panic in the street" is disappointing, but it is still worth watching. (7/10)
