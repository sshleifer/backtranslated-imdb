Brokedown Palace is the story of two of the best friends, Alice and Darlene, who are on a spontaneous trip to Thailand and end up in jail after being trapped with medication planted in their luggage. In this way, the film had the potential to turn into a serious and moving film such as "Turn to Paradise," but instead, the film chose to focus a little on the situation of the girls and more on their friendship. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale turn into excellent performances and the movie is much more about the interaction between them - suspicion, jealousy, questioning and testing their friendship and, finally, the sacrifices made on behalf of friendship. This film chooses not to get too deep into politics or even the harshness of prison life (which is less glossy) and focuses more on these friendship issues. There were some plot holes here, and some parts that did not seem credible or realistic. I did not feel the real fear or hopelessness of their situation, as we could. And we have a little feeling outside the prison walls, Bill Pullman singing the allegedly stubborn lawyer who turns out to have a heart of gold. In short, this should, with all rights, have been a much darker film than it was. But in general, I liked it. The actor was good, the soundtrack was perfect, and the story had plenty of twists and turns to stay interesting. Worth seeing.
