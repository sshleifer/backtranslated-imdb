I rated this 7/10 movie, which is an average of 8/10 for production scenario values, the direction and 1944 and 6/10 for acting. My acting rating in turn was calculated at 4/10 for all characters on the screen, except that played by heroine Ella Raines as Carol Richman, who was excellent at 8 / 10.I also congratulate Thomas Gomez as Inspector Burgess, whose character convinces that he personally does not believe that the guilty verdict on Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) was only in the prospect of his naive alibi. These two form an alliance to prove Scott's alibi. I have this movie on a DVD "Suevia Film Noir Cine Negro" in Spanish as "La Dama Desconocida" with the original "Ingles" soundtrack an alternative language, because despite the search we could not find an English version in its entirety. she was still anxious to see another show by Ella Raines after impressing her performance as a heroine in "Impact" playing a single female garage owner.Here Ella fulfills another heroic role she believes in her boss engineer innocence and refuses a few suggestions she should return to her home in Kansas (her boss's name for her) before solving the missing alibi.The fact that she is in love with her boss is a bit harder to believe since he formally only seemed to have had a formal business relationship with her. He nevertheless designed homes and playgrounds for children, so I assume the "family man" s in Carol's brain. <br /> <br /> In the 1940s, with the "movie code" in operation, the producers could only express their sex through metaphors, and here they are in the form of angry reels played by Elisha Cooke jnr.Carol , as a girl of light virtue, in an attempt to attract the drummer by giving him information about the aliens "The Lady Phantom". The other main character, Jack Marlow (an associate of Scott Henderson), is interpreted by Franchot Tone, whose interpretation I found too theatrical, and I wondered why Carol, for example, Strang ely admiring his hands.Here the script would have been improved and offered more suspense as these theatrical telegraphing plotting moves far too early for the public.
