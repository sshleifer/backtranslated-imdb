This is my favorite movie EVER. I followed her at least 10 times and weep every time. My family invites me not to look at her, so I do not have a pleasure. I think I like it as a true story written by Antwone himself as much as I like the movie. The actress is top and the actors were perfect for their role. Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors. But this is my favorite movie he has done so far. I took care of a little boy who was born in jail. He was the most precious little boy I've ever met. He was now adopted by a wonderful family who fought for him for almost two years. I saw this movie while the fight was still going on and his future was uncertain and I am so happy he is safe and loved. And I am so happy that Antwone is happy and has found his family. I would like to know more about him and how he has been since he met his family. I just can not say enough good things about it!
