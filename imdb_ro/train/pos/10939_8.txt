Five Deadly Venom is a great kung-fu action film wrapped in a mysterious mystery. There are all the usual kung-fu signs: a great choreography, terrible doubling, different fighting styles and a wide range of extremely exaggerated emotions, often cheese. However, the plot is certainly better than the average. It's interesting and attracts attention during non-combat scenes. Occasionally, he is even capable of lighting the audience, such as when the X character gets a horrible injustice. Another thing I love about the Five Venous Deadly is the superb simplicity of moral and film themes. Almost everyone gets what's happening to them. Those cowardly, greedy and corrupt lose. Wicked boys, consumed by selfish greed, are eventually destroyed by their own betrayal and return. Good boys use teamwork, planning, and integrity to overcome chances and get out on top. <br /> <br /> Poison Clan rocks!
