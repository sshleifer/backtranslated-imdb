I and my sister saw the premiere last night ... it was so good that I was stuck for the whole thing .. hahaha .. i think i'm attracted to the season !! .... they have very good actors in this .. the coach and the player who likes the spots were very good and the intrigue has already taken me but I do not really understand how they will keep it stretched throughout the season .. probably will be some big twist tho .. i cant wait until Tuesday .. finally Jeremy sompter who is he? I can say it will be great !! he was so good we fell in love with his character right away .. cant wait for the next episode .. Go Jeremy! <br /> <br /> Aimee
