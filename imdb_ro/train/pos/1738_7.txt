This is a hilarious movie. Burt Reynolds is a NASCAR star who signs a sponsorship contract with Ned Beatty's Chicken Pit restaurants. The contract contains all sorts of humiliating clauses, such as Burt's obligation to wear a chicken suit during the race! Jim Nabors is his mechanic (not quite convincing). Loni Anderson (oh, yeah!) He is nominated by Beatty to keep Reynolds honest and strictly adhering to the contract. This is a funny film in which Burt proves he is not too proud. I like!
