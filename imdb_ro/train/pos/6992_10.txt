I would not say it's a bad movie; in fact, is quite typical for the type of movie that the "poverty" studios released at the time. Filmed for Monogram, Bela Lugosi is very effective in acting as a rather demented physician, masculine as a respected community member. In this film, Bela and his acolytes have the habit of stealing young brides and, after their disappearance, have injected Bela's wife with a serpent from their bodies to keep their young. Lugosi is more than the task of making this film pleasant, but the film suffers from the ultra-wood act of co-stars Luana Walters and Tristram Coffin. The coffin (a nice name for a horror guy) is particularly bad in this case. I've seen him in numerous movies and TV shows and he's always the same; rigid, wooden and completely unconvincing. Mrs. Walters is just a little better, but she does not have the talent to act to make her a credible role. However, the viewer can enjoy the great act of Lugosi, which still has a damaging scheme that should only be prevented in the end! Despite being acting poorly, "The Corpse Vanishes" is a good movie for everyone to see.
