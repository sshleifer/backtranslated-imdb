Excellent view of a mature woman who will lose everything (even a baby has a mortgage). The way he engages in this special "business," the innocence and the true love that exists between people in a small city, blends perfectly to give us a fresh, easy and fun comedy. I could not stop laughing with a very funny scene of two old ladies in a pharmacy. I like European films, and with movies like this, my opinion gets stronger. A movie that I also recommend with my dark eyes in the same genre is Waking Ned Devine. Saving Grace, a comedy many friends enjoyed as much as I did. You'll like it.
