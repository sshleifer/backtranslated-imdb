I have to agree with everyone else who posted. I have seen it a long time ago, but I tell you that whenever I hear some songs of this anime, I remember the story, the beautiful animation, the characters and the feeling I have when I look at it, and makes me cry a feeling so happy but sad). However, I discovered that the love story in her felt alittle hastily and did not explain things properly, but did not ruin any part of the viewing experience. I was so much in this anime that afterwards I had to do some research (and look at the end a few times) and I found all the answers and much more. I like how they set up historical legends to fit into this anime, it was amazing and just made me want to search a lot more. (I have always been very interested in certain historical figures associated with this anime) <br /> </ p> <p> <i> I think it should have been a longer series, but if they just had to work with them, they fired it well. I would recommend this to anyone who likes the emotional anime with an excellent story, well-built characters (some mysterious) and a bit of fantasy. Also, even if this was based on a game H has nothing in it and actually I prefer it (I have no problem with mature anime, in most cases I prefer it)
