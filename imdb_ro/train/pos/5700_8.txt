I've read many negative reviews about this movie and finally I've had the opportunity to see it on DVD. To be honest, I really do not know what the problem is with her. It's a thriller mortal mortal shown from different points of view, from an eccentric drug distribution often drug / potential suspects, including late porn director, John Holmes. Please read the synopsis of the film plot details - I want to contribute more to a review than to a synopsis. Many reviewers have gone so far as to give this film the lowest rating due to violence, but I really do not see. Many modern films worsened - Saving Private Ryan was ultimately more violent than the film, which often rely on stains involved blood than brutal killing real (murder described in this film was made with lead pipes , after all). /> I was excited both halves of the film - the first showing John Holmes hopeless addict in cash and showing the second half of a minor conspirator in a senseless bloodbath. The film has an excellent acting, even though Dylan McDemorant seems more than a bit in place in persona biker-esque persona and goatee'ed bad boy personality. The soundtrack was also wonderful - a fantastic mix of 70 rock and pop from B obscure sites, spread over a few hours in all the right places ala Boogie Nights.
