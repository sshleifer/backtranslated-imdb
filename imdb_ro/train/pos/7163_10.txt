I seriously loved this movie .. I started reading the book and I loved it ... how everything was created and everything had a purpose ... I think this movie was so good because Louis Sachar wrote scenario. . And, of course, Andrew Davis has directed him ... Shia Lebouf offers great interpretation for his first film ... the story is very interesting and interesting ... there is humor, heart and intensity ... it is very similar to the book I found this the movie is not at least boring ... I loved it absolutely ... and I encourage anyone to read the book ... everything in this movie is very well put and built carefully ... two for nothing in my every way
