He made me wish my happy birds could talk. Printed print on the reviewer who disguised the film. A sweet story that will enjoy people of all ages. Paulie is an adorable treasure. It has some clever lines that really made me laugh. I especially loved dance sequences during the showbiz party. You can forgive the obvious clich√©s as you cheer him in the attempt to be reunited with Marie. A charming movie with two powerful characters who really amateur with the little parrot, separated from his young owner. She would have liked to have seen more of the woman who became blind and had to give up their mutual journey. I liked the artistic and poetic inspirations, a shame that she could not share Paulie's meeting. Bless Paulie in his new house, eventually with Marie, perhaps with a cute young man who helped him to defeat the antagonists to finish his journey.
