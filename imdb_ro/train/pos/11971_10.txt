I think that the commentary on the show, which is very interesting, is too exaggerated. When someone comes to watch a TV show, what does it do? It is to be glad that he is watching a show, unless he is a critic or a person who is analyzing the story. But most of us are not watching the shows to relax and enjoy. FULL HOUSE is an ideal show to watch after a busy day in the office / school. It makes you laugh and it's not just humor. Yes, the Tanner family is a perfect family, a perfectly hypothetical family. If there was such a family in the real world, it would be a model to follow for us. But this is a TV show, not a real family, and there is nothing wrong with describing a hypothetical family on television. The mere fact that the show could work so much shows us that people enjoyed watching it, whatever the next comment. Another good point about the show is that any person of any age would not enjoy just looking, but would take back a message however childish this message. Jesse's talks with Michelle are extremely exciting if you do not think of it as childish. In general, I would say that after seeing every show at Full House, there is a thank you in your heart, which is rarely present after many other shows.
