Okay, I admit that filming is very strange - some of this is due to the plot, but I still had a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of the feeling that Pierce Brosnan plays this role (though he did a really good job). <br /> <br /> It's based on a true story of an Englishman who went to live with Canadian Indians in the early twentieth century. He claimed to be a mixed Indian of blood. He was, in fact, so successful and well-thought that people came from all sides to listen to their lectures and to take on wild journeys - even though he was not an Indian mixed blood and all his knowledge was from books or forged! The film focuses on this and what happened when the farce was discovered. The actors and arrangements were great and I liked the movie (once we suspended the mistrust of Brosnan). It was not widely distributed - probably because it was quite cerebral - not a Bond movie or a love story - just a very strange movie about a remarkable man.
