I'm far from a fan of Sylvester Stallone and I think the only time I really appreciated his appearance was in the French movie Taxi 3, which is a little bit non-existent. And yet I have to admit that this movie was not that bad, even if I feared the worst. When Gabe (Stallone) fails to save the girlfriend of one of his friends and collapses to her death at a 4,000-meter-high mountain peak, she can not continue to work as a mountain ranger. For almost a year, he does not put food in reserve but returns. Immediately after returning, they received an emergency call from a group of hikers who were trapped in a snowstorm. At least, that's what the rebels think. In fact, there is a group of thieves who crashed into the mountains after their bold plan to steal money-filled cases from a government flying plane has failed. Cases are spread everywhere in the reserve and they need the help of professional mountaineers to recover them ... It is, of course, not one of the smartest films ever, but in its genre it is a pleasure. I was especially pleased with John Lithgow as the ruling mind of the evil and the leader of the thugs. I know him best in the TV series "3rd Rock from the Sun", but I also enjoyed the performance in this movie. Generally, the action is fine, it has a lot of action to offer and, of course, also some unique, but also offered a very nice decoration. This movie was filmed in a magnificent natural environment. I liked mountains and valleys with snow, mountain rivers and forests ... Perhaps that is why I give this film a higher score than what they normally give to an action / adventure film of this kind. I give it 6.5 / 10. If you do not expect too much, this is a nice movie.
