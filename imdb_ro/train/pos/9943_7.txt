The film does not claim to be something spectacular like many movies. Movies rise as fun and fun. And that's exactly what it was. It's the Korean version of a man Bring him. From getting go you can feel for the rest of the movie and how it will end but joy is not in the surprise twists nor is it how the movie is a carbon copy of another. Instead, joy is organized on the journey of how the other two "thieves" have become men in themselves. Therefore, the movie is fun and fun. The work room, especially the dolly movements, were very well executed. The script, being a faint tad, was too pleasant in the fact that the characters were not two dimensional, but they were full of life and desire. This movie will not win any Oscar, nor DVD sales, but a fun watch and fun experience.
