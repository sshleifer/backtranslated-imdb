JIST: See something else. This movie was greatly appreciated by Gene Siskel, but after seeing him, I can not figure out why. The film is definitely original and different. It even has an interesting dialogue sometimes, a few cold moments and a creepy noir. But it's not fun. It also does not have a lot of meaning in plotting, but especially in character motivations. I do not know anybody who behaves like these characters do. This is a difficult film to keep in mind - I suggest you do not accept the challenge.
