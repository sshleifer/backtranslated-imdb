I was born in 1982. Most of my childhood memories are in the late 80s and 90s. I saw Groove Tube for the first time in 2001 when I was 19 years old. And I realized he was hilarious. So for anyone who thinks something "dated" may not be funny 30 years later .... I think again! It's funny, even if you have no idea how the 70's were, and the thought of having pants at the bottom of the bells makes you ruin. Who can argue with a Bozo guy who reads adult literature? There is a lot of laughter. The scrotal puppet show at the end is the best.
