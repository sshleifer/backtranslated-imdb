Moon Child was one of the most iconic movies I've ever seen. What I really liked was the picture of immorality / mortality and about obstacles and life guidance. The film describes much of the vampire Kei with the power of immorality and its advantages. Whether it has supernatural abilities or eternal life, these are the things people usually want. Moon Child shows the pain and the disadvantages of being immortal because feelings of loss affect almost all the characters, especially the main characters Sho and Kei. The significance of the title "The Lunar Child" reveals that the film is approaching the end, where it clearly shows that everyone is a month that shines the way of others, giving guidance. Personality I like pretty much the morale of the movie described above. The weaknesses of the film are in some parts of the action and special effects, because it made the movie less authentic. The scene in which the Toshi character dies could have been stronger and more realistic if more authentic emotions were put into acting. Some scenes with special effects, such as gun shots, could have been even more authentic without making it look like a video action game. The sparks that came out of the arms seemed too fake and I think it could have been removed or fixed. However, I think Moon Child should be a movie that everyone should consider watching. The symbolic ideas and images that the film brings out would be easily accepted by everyone and could be of interest to many viewers. It's a pretty film and also fun to watch.
