When I saw this movie, I was amazed that it was just a TV movie. I think the movie should have been in the theater. I've seen many rape movies, but that's obvious. This film has a kind of realism rarely found in today's films, not to mention TV films. It tells a story I'm sure is very realistic for many rape victims in small towns today and I realized it was very credible (which is hard to find in other rape-centered films). I also thought that Tiffani Theissen and Brian Austin Green were wonderful in the parts they played. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys movies that have a tough reality for them. I liked very much.
