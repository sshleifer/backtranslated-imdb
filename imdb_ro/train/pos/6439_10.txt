I went to see this movie twice in a week and I can only sum it up in one word (which I do not normally use): Wonderful! In my opinion, the best movie ever made. Who deserves Oscars and other awards, if not the Swedish crew who created cinematic perfection in the last scenes of the film, when everything that is said (and left unchanged) throughout the story is pulled together? Just as the character of Daniel Dareus evokes so many feelings and feelings within the people around him, the film does the same thing to the audience: come out with an abusive head and a heart full of sensation. Wonderful things! The next time you ask yourself "what is the meaning of life," you might think about how you feel after a sumptuous experience, as it is in heaven: happy, content, fulfilled. Tell her to Mrs. Dalloway, Mrs. Virginia Woolf: "Such moments are sufficient."
