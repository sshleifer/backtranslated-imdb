Fatal error is a very cool movie! Robert Wagner, Antonio Sabato Jr., Janine Turner, Jason Schombing, Malcolm Stewart and David Lewis are in the film. The film's release worked very well. Robert Wagner played his good role. The relationship between Saboto Jr. and Turner was a beautiful one. There's a big difference in age, but I'm a unique couple. The two actors have worked really well. The music in the movie is very good by Ron Ramin and fits the film well. There are a lot of things that happen in the movie, you do not know what's going on and what will happen next, and this movie will keep you from start to finish. If you like Robert Wagner, Antonio Sabato Jr., and Janine Turner, follow this great movie!
