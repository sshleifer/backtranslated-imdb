I grew up in Houston and it was new when this movie came out. As a result, I do not remember anything about the movie. But I remember the sensation produced by Gilley and the mechanical bull at Johnny Lee's "Lookin 'for Love" song, which brings back memories from childhood whenever I hear it. However, a few years ago I saw this movie for the first time as an adult and all I can say is that I was overthrown. Some movies hit me harder. This movie is just as brutal and real as you can get. From Uncle Bob's farmhouse, chemical plant in Texas City, Gilley's dance hall and Bud and Sissy. And maybe for this reason it does not have a wider appeal. But no matter how you feel about country music (I because someone can not stand despite my roots in Houston) Urban Cowboy is a unique slice of American pie. That's why I like it!
