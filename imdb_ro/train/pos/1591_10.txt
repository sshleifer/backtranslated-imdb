Mom and I have just become addicted to this show, laughing at tears! I've only seen about 10 episodes and I'm disappointed that I did not pay attention to this hilarious series before they were canceled! The story line is very funny, the characters really have extraordinary personalities (or not so wonderful, but they are still funny!). I TiVO every episode of what I like about you. Amanda Bynes and Jennie Garth, as well as all the cast, do not let me get bored as I look! There is an inappropriate language for children and sexual content, but with a parenting guide almost, you should not have too many problems. There is a kind of "Friends" relationship that draws me to this show. I really like it.
