Pandro S. Berman was "In Production Leadership," but it made him the so-called line producer. But who produced this epic, shot not in Arizona but in the Mohave desert in California, where the scavengers yielded with all the remnants of the "golden temple", the Thuggee lodges, the British outpost at Muri, the Tantrapur village, etc. minor technical defects can and must be forgiven. What is unforgivable is the lack of an Oscar for best music, although the Academy did not offer it at that time. A unique theme was played in different tempos, including waltz, marsh and sweetheart, mood. Brilliant! One of the curious aspects of production was the Kipling widow's requirements. An actor who plays Kipling appears briefly before and after the battle scenes. In the initial release, her scenes were cut, according to Mrs. Kipling's requirements. Later, they were included and borrowed a "link" of Kipling's immortal poem to Ben Hecht's script. Interestingly, this very typical and pro-British story was made by a great screenwriter who killed the British.
