This movie could only come in the 1970s! It's a bizarre action movie set in a small California city. A kind of mills or plants are closing down, so suddenly bad bad behavior takes place on the street! Locals are fed! Thus, Ben Arnold (Jan Michael Vincent) goes to another city to recruit his brother, Aaron, played by Kris Kristofferson. Aaron is a Vietnam veteran who looks and acts a little out of balance. He rests with a bunch of other Vietnam veterans. They come to the city to clean it up (they become MPs), but under their good deeds they actually run gambling houses, ask for money, etc. It takes a while for people to catch up, and in a biblical show, Cain and Abel, Vincent has to take his big brother. There is an interesting blue fur atmosphere for this movie, which makes it interesting (note the battle scene!). Vincent is almost too angel in this role? he thinks so much about his brother that he can not conceive of having committed the evil deeds he has accused of. It finally comes to his senses? his girlfriend, Victoria Principal, is brutally shot back and he's beaten in his house. Kris Kristofferson is very effective as Aaron. He deniely condemns any wrong action, and even with meekness and conversation with Vincent's daughter (refers to him as "Uncle Aaron"), even if he threatens his father's life, smiling all the time! Vincent and Kristofferson have good chemistry in contrast. Bernadette Peters makes an interesting appearance as a "saloon" girl who draws Aaron's attention. This is a 70-year action movie if you can find it! Not available on DVD yet?
