First of all, do not go into the Revolver waiting for another Snatch or Lock Stock, this is another kind of gangster movie. I saw the night gala and this movie definitely divided the audience. Is it a kind of movie in which half of the audience will leave thinking what this was? It was terrible, and the other half will let you think WHAT was that? That was cool. Personally, I like movies that I do not understand, that is, the Mullholland Drive and the usual Suspects, so I enjoyed the Revolver. <br /> <br /> It certainly was not perfect. I saw a big turn coming at a mile away, at least a part of it, and although sometimes some free ends are unexplained, Revolver leaves a lot of unexplained questions for no reason. Also, some scenes such as the animation and the scene where Sorter goes into a snorting snake (actually, one of my favorites), though, great scenes to watch, seemed just there because they were wonderful to watch, not because they match the movie. However, there were many good things. I thought the actor was superb from all the main actors, Jason stratham, Ray Liotta, Vincent Pastore and even Andre Benjamin (which was a pleasant surprise). This movie has certainly retained my interest, with a great, suspenseful, wrapped scene, after another. When Ray Liotta was kept under the table wow ... well you have to see him. The script was extremely well done, and the soundtrack, as in most of Guy Ritchie's films, was great. Although a step below movies such as "Fight Club," "Mullholland Drive" and "Common Suspicious" a wonderful, fast, psychological action film with many twists and turns and many scenes you will remember long after the movie it's over.
