Now it must be a family movie! There are few films in recent years that have targeted families or children who are genuinely worthy of their public eye; but this is one of them. My whole family got out of the movie, was amazed, amused, orbit and happy. I read some small anecdotes of her here and there. The kids loved them and I did (and hubbie and I have 36 and 32 years respectively)! In addition to its beautiful and striking animation, the characters (both small and imaginative) are very well developed. There is none of them that you can not empathize with. The personalities that bring the lives of these little creatures are well-made voice talents, combined with the skill and art of Disney's best animators. This is a Walt Disney movie worthy of itself. I think Mr. Disney has enthusiastically endorsed this new movie ... Flick, Dot and their little hero colleagues can become as popular as Mickey and Minnie in our time. <br /> <br /> This is a family leaving the theater that wants to see again .. and buy to own on video or DVD. I'm eager to see her again ... to get what I missed the first time. (I have never seen my children so quickly and clearly identify and embrace the characters before ... my daughter still talks about the little "Dot".) This movie is fun, heartwarming, intelligent and great fun for the whole family!
