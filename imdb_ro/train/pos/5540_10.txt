At first, this movie seems so bad that I almost fell into a trance the first time I saw it. It was like a bad dream. A cosmic boredom. But I gave her a second chance, then another, and so on. Finally, I was addicted to this film because of the slow dream, beautiful natural sets, bathed in a moderate autumn light, and especially musical scores, consisting of progressive songs from the '70s and popular songs absolutely refined by the actor / singer / songwriter Derek Lamb (Troubadour). You should notice the song about strawberries, silver trout, and the lady that disappears in the air, heard in the middle and near the end of the film. There are some carnival scenes at first allowing us to appreciate the natural charm of Elizabeth Suzuki. If the film had been made by several directors like "Bergman, Lars Von Triers or Jean-Luc Goddard, critics would have rolled on the floor, they were a cosmic masterpiece. I personally think this film is a million times better than any of Fellini's cinema sh # Â¤ @ t! Certainly not for the pretentious.
