BABY FACE is a fast crackling, wise, knowing a smile of a movie that only lasts for an hour and 15 minutes, but oh, what a smart 75 minutes I'm on <br /> <br />! That a story that covers so much land could be said in such a short time putting the majority of today's filmmakers to shame. Today's screenwriters should study the BABY FACE economy and cut off the balloon that overwhelms so many of their films. <br /> <br /> The story is not a nonsense. An amoral woman rises first to wealth, then to the bodies of men falling crazy in love with her. Surely the production code left him in a redemption, happy conclusion, but it is not hard to see where the direction the writers wanted to follow, enjoy what exists and use your imagination for the rest. Stanwyck is great as George Brent and Douglass Dumbvrille as an unfortunate captain. It's not a great movie, but certainly a nice one. If you have never seen BABY FACE, catch it the next time it is shown on the cable or rent the box. It's worth the effort ..
