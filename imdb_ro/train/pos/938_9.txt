Although George C. Scott is the only actor in this version of the ACC without a British accent, he does nothing but to do it with Ebenezer Scrooge's interpretation ever larger and bigger than life. <br /> <br /> It is particularly effective when faced with Bob Cratchit in his office at the end of the movie. When Scott stands in front of a large window, the sunlight throws a shining cloak over him; all you can see is his silhouette. Augmented by Scott's voice, a grave grunt, the effect galvanizes ... just like Marlon Brando's first scene in APOCALYPSE NOW. "The Horror," indeed! <br /> <br /> However, as they say, even the thing that works for you can also work against you. Because Scott shows such joyful ferocity throughout the film, it is infectious. In other words, Scrooge "before" is almost as charismatic as "after", even if he should not be. This is what might be called the "Doctor Smith" effect, because Jonathan Harris used a very similar approach when playing that role and many other hardships (scene and screen alike). Actually, I do not really take Scott's glib into account. But other purists of "Christmas Christmas" could. Watch the movie and judge for yourself.
