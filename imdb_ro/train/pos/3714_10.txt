First of all, I did not know what to expect when I started the movie. Whenever someone brings back a kind of cult movie and adapts it to now, something becomes inexplicably lost in translation. br /> <br /> This is not the case here. This movie starts only on the right path. It is a familiar territory, but it also manages to take it over the top. Crockzilla someone? This must be seen and try to keep a straight face. This film takes some of the old classics of fun cult movies and manages to blend in without problems in a modern production. It is good to see that someone meets the need in this market. Very well done. <br /> <br />
