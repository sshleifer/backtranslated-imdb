I first saw BLOOD OF SAMURAI during the Hawaii International Film Festival. WOW! Blood has just thrown us into the air with taste, gore, vitality, gore, enthusiasm, gore, cry and even more goran, and all in MUCH! Especially for those of you who enjoy all Japanese chambara samurai and ninja movies, DEFINITION TO SEE THE HEALTH!
