With actors like Ralph Richardson, Raymond Massey, Cedrick Hardwicke and Margaretta Scott, how can you be wrong. Very unusual scenes, especially modern ones. Making modern machines is very effective. Here you have rocket explosions from the construction of vehicles that help clean the area, so new structures can be made. Although it's much smaller in this movie, it's not very hard to figure out who will be the future Mrs. Pumphrey of the BBC series, all the big and small creatures! Indeed, the resurgence of Raymond Massey and Ralph Richardson. The musical score is by the famous Swiss composer Artur Honegger and is also unusual. For that time (1936) it seems that they really used big sets or the effects make it look like that. Finally, it's a very good story.
