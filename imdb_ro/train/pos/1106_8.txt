If you're a fan of Altman's big big-screen movies, as shown in major films such as M.S.S.H., Nashville, Gosford Park and less-known movies such as A Wedding, then you will no doubt be entertained by HealtH. Focused around a health convention where two women are in the chair, HealtH contains many of Altman's 70 years of regular life, such as Paul Dooley (who helped write the film), Carol Burnett and Henry Gibson , James Garner and Glenda Jackson. Like many Altman movies, there are many subplots in this movie, but it's not nearly as overwhelming as movies like Nashville or A Wedding, but rather a more centered sense, maybe M.A.S.H. or Gosford Park. The whole thing is an obvious satire of the Health movement, full of contradictory characters, with stars like Dick Cavett, who offer a bad comment on the whole thing. Highlighting the entire electoral process is Altman's pessimism about politics and public appeals, but what's most appealing about this movie is the fun that most people seem to have. That would be one of Altman's last films for a while!
