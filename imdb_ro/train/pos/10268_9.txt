This typical Mamet film offers a quiet and even understanding of what makes a trusted man (Joe Mantegna) good. Examined as a psychological study by a noted psychologist (Lindsay Crouse), she slowly pulls her into her world with unpleasant consequences. The cast includes a number of players found in several of Mamet's films (Steven Goldstein, Jack Wallace, Ricky Jay, Andy Potok, Allen Soule and William H. Macy). I loved Lindsay Crouse in this movie and I often wondered why he did not become a more known player than he has become. Maybe I'm not looking for the right places! The film has a slow pace with a flat dialogue, but maintains a level of tension throughout which logically leads to the end of the bang-up. You would expect a real disappointment at the end, but we found it uplifting and satisfying. I love this movie!
