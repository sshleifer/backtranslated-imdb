This early version of the "Student in Prague" story was made in Germany in 1913, starring Paul Wegener (who was also in The Golem a few years later). In this film he plays a double role (technically impressive for a 95-year-old film to see them in the same shot) after meeting with a mysterious old man who makes a deal with him for gold - the gold he has to buy, he saw an Countess who had previously been rescued from drowning. Going fast (the film runs for over an hour) and quite well written and characterized, the "Student in Prague" has echoes of legend Faust as well as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, starting from a pact with a a mysterious figure of evil potential and developing in the good and bad parts of the same person.
