One of the smartest serial killer films in recent history. ZODIAC KILLER offers an imaginative image on the background and history of one of the most famous serial killers. Those who create the film create an unexpected good outlook on the pathology of this mysterious murderer and anyone who remembers the Zodiac will be intrigued. Others will want to discover more about this enigmatic murderer. Unlike many serial killers, Zodiac was not crazy at all, but very methodical and self-promoter. The director interprets here the audience's expectations and pulls him. The film is built like a murder mystery or a "cold" thriller. It's a smart investigative / procedural horror film that will prevent gore-dogs from looking for cheap emotions. Some people do not like any movie that's filmed on the video. This attitude is very old and provincial. It's an attitude and a vision of movies that puts technical problems above the value of entertainment or artistic value. These attitudes are on the way. ZODIAC KILLER is a low-budget movie, no doubt, but discerning viewers will look beyond that and find a gorgeous gem.
