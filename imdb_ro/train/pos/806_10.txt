Star Wars: Episode 4. <br /> <br /> The best Star Wars ever. his first movie I've ever won Sean was the bad guys and a very good ending. I really expected me to think about the next star wars, because that's the way things fit in this movie that you just need to find out in the last one. With many movies, I always have the feeling that he may be a holder, but not that. and I will never forget that his role was Luke's father he is his father. Love also feels a figure to make a field player back. if you have never seen a movie star wars you go to it this one.its the best. <br /> <br /> Thanks Lucas
