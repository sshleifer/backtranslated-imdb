This is one of those films that make trailers better than feature films. The concept was very cool and different, the humor was unique, I just feel that the opportunities to put the "fist" in this movie were missed. So many lines and gags have been left hanging for too long without a definitive end and really did not let me laugh. Wilson, Wilson, Farris & Thurman were wonderful. Wanda Sykes was under-used in this film and needed more exposure and more opportunities to change her character in more time. 7 out of 10 for me, more than a DVD rental. I've also been looking for some sort of musical movie that feels good at the end, something that has become a kind of trademark for these romantic comedy films, Something about Mary, Meet Parents, but again, I felt the sensation of being a little deceived by the fact that this movie was a much better movie with more music and more fists. He felt like he was ruehed in theaters.
