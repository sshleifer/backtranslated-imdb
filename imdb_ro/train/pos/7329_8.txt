I really liked this movie. Humor was a bit absent sometimes, but I liked how the story moved dramatically and seriously across the movie. This is the only film I saw Verdone (the other was "A sacco bello") and I see why the Italians find it tiring, but he thinks he has played the role of a loving father. <br /> <br /> One of my drawbacks with this movie was that I knew it was in Italy - somewhere in the center or south, I suppose, but I felt like it was not a place. This movie could have taken place in New York, Boston, Melbourne, New Dehli ... I always thought it was important for movies to have a place to give the audience something to deal with. (Maybe I missed something?) :) If you like Italian movies, then I think you will enjoy this. It's not a Fellini or Rossellini - it's not realism or neorealism. It's a comic story with serious moments that could really happen to any of us.
