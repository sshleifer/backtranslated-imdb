Everyone we meet influences our thinking, changes our ways, a little of that person is ruining us. "Day 8" deals with this theme (cf. "Rainmaker"). In this film, Harry (Daniel Auteuil), a business psychologist in sales psychology, meets with Georges (Pascal Duquenne), a child of Down's syndrome on the run. The winning performances from these actors give this film its main force. The opening sequence is excellent if Georges relates his theory of the creation of the world and in the final scene we discover what God created in the eighth day. There are a few moments in the story that are very frustrating for Harry. For example, Georges, who is completely uninhibited, demands a pair of expensive shoes and does not have enough money. It is the kind of scene where you laugh through tears. I liked the scene where the Down syndrome group, on a trip to the art gallery, escaped on a bus and crashed the gate of the Paradis fun park. The fullest of the offensive of all fools is the scene in which Harry and Georges pass on a highway, and looking back, Georges gives the driver an unsatisfied greeting. There are also some gentle scenes, especially the impressive use of hands - the hands that feel the sun, the wind and the rain, the hands rising, hands stretching and engaging in love and friendship. This is the real cinema that touches the heart. There are very moving scenes in which Georges proposes to Nathalie, where Georges binds Harry's head in his arms, where Georges continues to call his dear mother, where Georges teaches Harry to laugh. I felt there was a deep, beautiful message in the movie - the very presence of the grass (Did you know it cried when you cut it?), The trees above your head, the song of the birds, the small insects - the miraculous creatures of nature. They're all there to enjoy if we do not go back (like Harry and Georges) to look around and listen ...... A beautiful movie.
