Even Shirley fans can be surprised by "Now and Forever" for a long time. The movie was filmed with Paramount Studios? not Shirley's parent company, Twentieth Century Fox? in 1934, before producer Fox, Darryl Zanuck, perfected Shirley's successful formula (cute songs, cold hearts to melt, young couples for her to play cupid, happy endings). Thus, "Now and Forever" falls into the category of a Shirley vehicle without Shirley's standard story. It's a strange position for any movie, but this impressive, talented talent makes it work. Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard play Jerry and Toni Day as fun and irresponsible lovers. The only thing that this still dysfunctional duo seems to hate more than to be together is separate. When suddenly landed with the custody of Jerry's daughter, Penny (Shirley Temple), is Toni? and not Penny, as many think? who persuades Jerry to quit his criminal career. But Jerry flungers at the office workplace, and desperate to prove that he can secure for his new family, he soon returns to thieves and rogue. In a standard Shirley device, Penny tries to melt the heart of curmudgeon Felix Evans, the victim of one of Jerry's opinions, but her attempt fails, for Evans is revealed to be an artist himself and blackmailing Jerry to help him steal the jewelry. Drama, war, death, and sadness that have everything, make this movie very unusual for Little Miss Sunshine. There is no happy ending, no dance and only one song (the cute number "The World Owes Me a Living"). But that does not mean that Shirley fans should avoid "Now and forever." Rather, Shirley's usual disagreement makes her more exciting and memorable than many of her other films, but be careful: to avoid the colorful version of this movie and to see it in black and white if you can. Color is brilliant, brilliant and unrealistic, and in many scenarios, Shirley's famous curls are actually red instead of blonde.
