I finally watched these episodes in 2008 and I had to go back and check when they were produced. They are absolutely scary because they have made fun of what the future is. Whether Parker and Stone lived in Texas and witnessed Gov Bush's idiot, or those weird and strange people who pay attention to things. Boo, scary! Bush's brother invades the White House, dressed as Arabs with rifles? Bush "accidentally" runs someone? (No, wait, it did some sort of doing that as a gov.) That might have seemed like a sitcom at that time, but now it has to be considered brilliant if it's scary.
