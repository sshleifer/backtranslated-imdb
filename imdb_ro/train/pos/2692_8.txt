I really enjoyed this movie. It has an excellent direction, by the already known Bigas Luna, born in Spain. And it is in Spain that the film takes place in Catalu√±a to be more precise. <br /> <br /> Moon once again explores the theme of a obcession in this case, a young boy for years obcession women milk. There are some psychological concepts in this story, such as complex disapproval eldest son feels his brother's birth. In the film it is leading to obcession the young boy who suddenly sees his mother's milk go son born recently. So he tries to find a breast cancer that is able to feed. He thinks he's in a woman recently arrived and here the movie is all around it. <br /> <br /> This film is very much on the images, more than the story itself, the spectator captures certain moments (unforgettable moments) and certain symbols (the film deserves a detailed analysis of almost everything that happens because it means usually something ...). Surroundings, typical landscapes in the region as well as the surrealistic behavior of the characters, also symbolic, and the excellent ambiguous soundtrack of Nicola Piovani takes us to a different dimension, not parallel to the real world, but intersecting times in the past. .. that deserves to live in that world deserves to watch this movie, even if we could eventually get tired and a bit sick with excessive obcession that can extend beyond the limits ... <br /> < br /> I also enjoyed the performance of the protagonist ... 8/10
