This is one of my favorite family movies. I liked it when I was young and still keeps with me that I'm older. I still laugh at all the old jokes and I might even throw a tear of times. I have not cared much about the animals talking, or at least those animated by the UN, but which I will support. It's a pretty old film, but it will always have a place in my heart. There are no other live animal movies to think about when I could really compare it, much less so. I may give too much praise to this film, but I do not think it looks. I really keep a big message that "Home is where the heart is". Or at least that's the message I've gained from her. Definitely recommended for a good night of old family movie.
