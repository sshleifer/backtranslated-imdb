It's funny how you can change your life in a second ... To participate in "The Waterdance" for the first time was an unforgettable experience, the way you need to get used to a new way of life may seem scary and to notice that there are other people in a similar situation can help you continue. <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz's performances and especially Helen Hunt (oh man! Helen is the purest and most beautiful woman in the world ...) are wonderful, Wesley Snipes also surprises one of your last series. A simple, yet deep, film that does not leave us indifferent to the message: Enjoy every moment of your life ... really with a movie like any hour is not frequented !!! (I'm sorry, it's a Brazilian expression ...).
