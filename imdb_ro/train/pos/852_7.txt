MATADOR is a lite-hit film ... if you can say about a hit-man movie. Violence is never presented, but is often introduced. At first I was scared that I was in another gangster-hit-man-hipster-dark comedy retreat in the mid-1990s, but was surprised when I realized it was just a sweet and humorous story about friendship. There is nothing extraordinary about this movie, but each of them keeps me grinning. The three rulers have the best chemistry that the big screen has offered in recent years and they seem to have had the opportunity to make the film together. The script is sharpened, though sometimes it felt as though the scenario had been adapted from a scene due to established dialogue scenes. This is a good movie that I probably will not remember for too long, but at that time it was a complete joy. Good movie.
