One of the joys of building up the recent Bela Lugosi collection is to see delightful movies, such as The Invisible Ray. Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi are in a film that sneaks into meteorites and radiation, and while science is absolutely absurd (especially the Karloff camera technique, as Janos Rukh uses to determine the location of a particular meteorite) did not taken care of in the lease because the movie is completely enjoyable. The effects are good for the time, the act is great, and the finish is particularly strong. It reminds me of science fiction and romance novels in the 1940s and 50s, complete with razor-sharp weapons and ridiculous science. You have to watch this movie!
