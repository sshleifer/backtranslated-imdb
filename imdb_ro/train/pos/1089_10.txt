This film was made in 1948, but still true. Very, very funny. Start with a family who wants to buy a small place in the country and "builds" from there. Anyone who has ever built a house will find this movie very popular. Big distribution. Cary Grant and Myrna Lloyd are delightful in this movie. This is a classic black and white film that reflects the great style of the 1940s ... clothing, architecture and family life. Many references are made at the cost of things, and comparisons with current costs are quite amazing. I can not imagine anyone who does not fully enjoy this movie. I'm surprised by the number of middle-aged people who have never heard of her. A real classic.
