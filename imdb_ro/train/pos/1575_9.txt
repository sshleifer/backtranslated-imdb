The van trotta rosenstrasse is the best movie I've seen over the years. Actually, I'm not really interested in movies with a historical background, but with it I was interested in that moment! The only annoying thing about the film was the scenes in New York, and the impression I had had to "try to be as American as possible" ... what I think has failed absolutely. The back scenes really came to my heart. German actress katja riemann deserved the full prize. she is one of the most impressive actresses I've ever seen. in the future, I'll watch more movies. good luck to me, that I'm German speaker =) and only for a year in us, so as soon as I get back, I'll buy some riemann dvd. <br /> <br /> who have not seen this movie yet: WANT! I think it would take too long to describe what it is all about, especially all the back of the flash and the time switches are hard to explain, but you'll just see it zesty !!!!!!!
