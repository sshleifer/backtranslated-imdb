Life Pod is one of the movies you are just watching and try not to analyze it too hard. The actor is rather amateur, at best. The special effects are obviously low, but not bad. The story line is rather a stock, but with an interesting twist. Computer runs amok, but not exactly a computer and the amok of operation is very easy to understand when revealing the truth. Still, the film has its moments and it's pretty much watched. For me, at least some of the attraction of this film is the prominent role of Kristine DeBell. Perhaps she is not the greatest actress in the world, but being a former fellow on Thursday of the moon, she is pretty pretty. In all Life Pod is like other low-budget Sci-Fi films from the 1980s and somewhat predictable. The White Star Lines bit is nice if it is completely inaccurate. White Star Lines' latest stock was acquired by Cunard Lines in 1947, and the last White Star sailing vessel was Britannic (not Titanic's sister) which was sold for scrap in the 1960s.
