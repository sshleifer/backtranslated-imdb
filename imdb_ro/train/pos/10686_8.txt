And I'm a fanatic of Nicole Kidman. I would have paid to see her and hear her read the Moscow phone book, which I knew it would have done when speaking Russian in this film. <br /> <br /> All four principles are excellent, but the movie itself is a number of good pictures and better scenes held together by nothing. While one is always ready to suspend unbelief while watching a movie, it requires the viewer too much. <br /> <br /> It could have been very funny (what's in it) or pretty scary (what's in a scene), but the director did not seem to know what way to go.
