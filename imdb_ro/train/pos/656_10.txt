Of all the reviews I've read, most people have been extremely difficult on Alexandre. Even Marie or Veronika did not seem to despair in particular to keep Alexandre, being just a little intelligent, though not intellectually, as most of us are, no matter how difficult it is for anyone to recognize. Alexandre moves away perfectly, takes care of everything, gets and gives what he wants. girls allow this, veronika loves sex, Marie is his patron. is there something wrong with any of these? is anyone in love? really? I do not think. Although the French New Wave cinema is prone to pretension and so on, it's wonderful simply because of the need for a plot to create emotions. Ease is wonderful and all who are in Alexander's position in an urban area can ask. Looking for a patron, someone interested?
