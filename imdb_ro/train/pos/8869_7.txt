In this little film we have some extraordinary characters, but a very superficial plot. It's really nice to look at because Singleton does a great job in presenting esoteric conflicts and interpersonal relationships. This makes the spectator forget the non-existent realism that this movie is supposed to be. In fact, what we have here is all possible cliches and stereotypes on cellulite at a rate higher than that of a soap. It's definitely not a deep film (even if it wants to be), but better than an average college film.
