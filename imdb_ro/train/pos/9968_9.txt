My mother made me see this movie as a child and I'm trying to see it every year as I make all my other Christmas favorites. What I remember most was the evil Devil and Santa who were looking through the telescope. I waited and looked every year in the TV guide to see when it was shown. Usually, I would find myself playing on a Saturday afternoon. I found the film only in English that took something special from the film and wanted to find a copy of it in Spanish. I keep this film dear to my heart and I have never suffered from nightmares, as others would suggest. Yes, it's a different movie about Santa Claus, and that makes it unique and unique. I can not wait to receive a copy of this movie and look at it with my children as my songs and memories explain to them!
