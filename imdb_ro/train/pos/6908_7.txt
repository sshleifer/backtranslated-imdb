Richard Dreyfuss plays "Moon Over Parador" Paul Mazursky film of 1988, also with Raul Julia, Sonia Braga, Jonathan Winters and Charo. Dreyfuss plays a New York actor, Jonathan Nolan, in the Caribbean country of Parador, to make a movie. When the dictator died suddenly, Chief of Security Intelligence (Julia), which is what actually controls the dictator and the country, makes Jonathan to play dictator, noting the similarity between them. Soon, Jonathan is included in the palace that Alphonse Simms Simms and his girlfriend, prostitute, Madonna (Braga), who realizes that the switch promises to help him in any way he can. Mazursky, appearing in drag as Simms' mother, shows how the CIA in third world countries. The character Winters assumed the seller is actually an operative of the CIA. The film, however, flirts with, but it really works on a plot very seriously and is more of a send-up, and a funny one at that. Richard Dreyfuss job done fabulous Jonathan actor and the dictator's Alphonse, creating two characters separated and catching both. Gorgeous Sonia Braga is wonderful Madonna and Raul Julia is performing funny as Strausmann, the man behind the dictator. it's one of those shows where you never know exactly what he thinks character - he may have liked or turn psycho at any time. Charo is on hand as a maid and manages to be fun and discreet at the same time. A very good movie, not a big blockbuster but very fun.
