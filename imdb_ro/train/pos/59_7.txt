While I was the video store, I sailed through the rent of a dollar and came over this little jewel. I do not know what it was about, but I only had an intellectual clue about it and I was right. The story focuses around two girls who have survived a shooting school. One of the girls is Alicia a teen revolt who is the only witness of the complete attack and another is Deanna, another survivor who survived a bullet in the head of a miracle. Thrown together with fate, they easily begin a painful and beautiful exposure of healing and move. I do not like it when the amazing movies fall through the cracks. Because wow what the busy show Phillips and Erkia Christensen not to mention the rest of the distribution! My only complaint is that the DVD was devoid of special features. And some cuts in the movie were a little embarrassed. But everything is an excellent movie.
