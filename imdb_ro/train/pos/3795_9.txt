After seeing this film at the SF Independent Film Festival, I could not wait to hear about how to get a copy. Jim McKay then talked about the film that portrayed his ironic situation: how to get cast for a film portraying minorities (women, non-white) who work to solve controversial issues (adolescent pregnancy, adolescent pregnancy, racial identity, a single mother) and how to write a faithful script on all these subjects, being a white male at the age of thirty. The multi-racial, multi-genius audience of most adults has hit the fantastic story of the film, detailed characters and fantastic portraits of the "real life of adolescents." Most adolescents have just left the building - which has made me think it's a movie best viewed by adults with children as a starting point rather than as many adults felt "it's about them." Therefore , questions about distribution - how can we get our hands on it? The Internet (retail) would be a great way - this is a movie that will be buried, like "Pups" or other modern modern teen movies - and McKay seemed receptive. As for his credits as a writer / director, McKay was sensitive and detailed in his work - joining the Crown Heights neighborhood where the film is set, working with actors to describe characters in their own vision of what they think - the results are realistic disarmant.
