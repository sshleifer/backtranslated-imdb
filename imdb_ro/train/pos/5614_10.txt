It took me a long time to find the title in a special video of Berlin and I was lucky to find an English version with Dutch subtitles. I think he's one of the best horror ever. I find it odd that some people call this movie a black comedy. I have to admit, I could not laugh when I first saw it (and it was the same with the second time!). On the one hand, Trelkovski seems so beautiful and even cute in his shy behavior, but on the other he is beating this boy on the playground, and there is no explanation for that. But the most tired thing is, of course, his transformation into Simone Choule and the fact that he does not know who he really is. His hallucinations are the most terrifying of this film. Of course everything is in his mind, but it is this apartment that removes this feminine part of him or even before he moves - I think that is an interesting question. His shizofrenic behavior is hard to understand and it is horrible to see the two parts or identities that are fighting each other. The result is that he cuts his hand first and then jumps out of his window. But this terrible cry - does this mean that everything will repeat itself again and again ... that his soul is in a cage or something? And these Egyptian hieroglyphs and other Egyptian things? The fact that he / she looks like a mummy in the hospital - is not an incident, but a clue to my point of view.
