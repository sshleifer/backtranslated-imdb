First, when people hear "GUY RITCHIE", they immediately think of SNATCH. Yes, Snatch was a good movie, but the problem is that everyone is joining Guy Ritchie to Snatch. He does not expect him to explore new frontiers. This REVOLVER movie is different from snatching; is much darker and is very complex. The reason I gave a 10 rating is that I had to see 3 times the Revolver to understand everything. So this movie plays with your head. He is very intelligent writing. This movie is different from Snatch. It's been great, the cinema is beautiful, and you can recognize Guy Ritchie's personal touch (driving style) in it. What earned me was the protagonist's complexity and how we remained with more questions than answers.
