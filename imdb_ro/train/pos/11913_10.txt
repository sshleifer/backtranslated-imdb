This is an excellent movie for female body-builder & female action fans! I think Sue Price did a great job in this series of films (Nemesis 2,3,4) and turned out to be a great fighter. It has a very striking appearance and an iron will to resist the Strong Nebula (Nemesis 2). Although it is not a great value film and Sue Price's acting skills are not the best to meet in my life, the movie itself was something wonderful, a priceless jewel for fans of female bodybuilder action! Well, some parts of Nemesis 2 have been copied by other SF movies, such as Terminator or Predator, but that's not the point. The point is that A.Puyn has performed in this film a very talented talent builder who has put all his energy and body talent to show how well he can do. I really liked this movie and I followed with the same enthusiasm Nemesis 3 (a rather boring sequel) and Nemesis 4 (a much more interesting sequel than 3). What a pity he did not show on DVD :-(
