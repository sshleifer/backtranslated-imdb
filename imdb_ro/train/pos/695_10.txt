This movie attracts you and attracts you to keep your eyes on the screen. The writer / director is brilliant with the narrative parts and the use of the angles and creative and exciting perspectives of the room, all of which add to the end of the grip you will have on you. Insomniac's Nightmare is original and refreshingly different from any other movie on which you saw. Is it a dream or a reality? This indie will make you discuss the twists and turns you get through the conscious and subconscious. She has a feeling, with dark interpretations of illusions. Dominic Monaghan has become really insomnia. He is a great actor, who is not hard neither eye! He poured his whole being into this role. From the story to the way this shot is made, this indie is one of my favorites. I recommend them a lot and look forward to seeing more from this innovative writer / director / cinema!
