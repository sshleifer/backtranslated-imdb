This is a powerful documentary about domestic abuse in Cameroon. The "sisters" in law are jurists and female judges who in 2004 successfully pursued their husbands for the abuse of their husbands and won a woman they desperately want through a Muslim council. It is quite long - about two hours - but fascinating both with individual claimants and defendants, as well as with lawyers who have successfully represented them in court rooms chaired by female judges. He will leave you, as he left me, with many questions about exactly how this change took place. How and when did women get positions of authority in Cameroon? A few cases presented in this film have had a significant effect on the treatment of women in general by their husbands? Was it a divorce given by a Muslim tribunal, against the spouse's express desire, a one-time event? I do not suggest that movie producers could have answered these questions. They made the film two years ago, not yesterday. And the movie they've done deserves a broad audience.
