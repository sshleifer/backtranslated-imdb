Everyone has already commented on cinema (good to the sea), personalities (older than life), structure (chronological, with many references to surf culture in time). What is missed is a more important issue of sociological importance: the suffering of the American culture of the basic for something more fulfilled and more satisfying. I was a surfer in the 1970s. We used to watch 16mm movies at local high schools in SoCal. I remember the feeling of surfing all day long until my skin radiated my heat, putting on a hawaiian shirt and shorts and watching the latest surf film at night. Often, the narrator was the screenwriter himself, reading a paper script scenario. Sometimes a surfboard or a proto-punk band would add music. I've never been happier. Except for noise and hollering, seeing "Giants Riding" took me back in time. It also reinforced a feeling that life on the edge, do not worry about social money and social and corporate climbing without keeping up with Jonesii, pushing yourself physically and mentally for a moment of joy and jubilation - it can be the answer to the question: "What is the purpose of life?" At least for those like Greg Noll, Laird Hamilton, and others, they seem to have found something that few of us are sufficiently daring or honest enough enough to live in: living only in our conditions. Maybe society would break up if we did everything we wanted in life, but it's great to see people who live their own dreams. This message really impressed me.
