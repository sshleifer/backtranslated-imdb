Fluttering Atlantic butterfly wings can trigger a hurricane in the Pacific. According to this theory (somehow related to the theory of chaos, I'm not sure exactly how), every action, no matter how small or insignificant, will start a chain reaction that can lead to big events. This little jewel of a film shows us a series of seemingly unrelated characters, most of them in Paris, whose actions will affect the lives of others. (You can apply the theory of six degrees of separation.) Each story is a facet of the jewel that is this film. The actor is well tuned and nuanced (Audrey Tautou is bright), the stories are plausible, the humor is right and the viewer leaves the theater to give a sign.
