This is a very good movie and one that I liked to see many times. Michael Caine is great as always. Michael Caine has received some kind of reputation for taking on any role in any movie, regardless of the quality or lack of the same thing, but makes a good way to play Sidney. From the beginning it is so well written. Who would have thought that Ira Levin, who wrote such horrible things like "The Boys of Brazil" and "Rosemary's Child," might write something courageous. Let's face it - Michael Caine, Chris Reeve, Dyan Cannon, Henry Jones ... how are you going to be wrong with a good distribution of Sidney Lumet? I am very reluctant to go because if someone would give something about this movie, it would be a crime. Watch it and adore it.
