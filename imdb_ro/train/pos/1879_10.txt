I was too young to remember when I first saw the movie. But I saw it for the second time about 7 years ago. My sister told me I had to see it. Now my whole family is remembering it. Cite it at least once a day. I really like this movie. I still laugh all this time. Sure, it's a really drunk millionaire who's irresponsible. Everything is that he still has the lost humanity in the other things we see in the film. And she is willing to give her everything for love. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants a laugh. Many laugh. Its Hallarious, sweet, and if you a buff movie, it will really change your idea of ​​"Funny". Look at a group of friends or your family, and I promise you will not have anything to say again with Authur lines in your head. It will make you laugh for years to come. It's very hard in my family to find a movie that everyone likes. But this movie, I feel, has made us closer. And I know he'll do the same for you!
