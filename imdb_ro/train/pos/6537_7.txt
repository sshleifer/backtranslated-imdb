The children I took to this film loved him (four children aged 9 to 12 would have given it 10 stars). Emma Roberts was adorable in the lead role. (Expect to see more of Roberts' future generation in the future.) After being exposed like Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton, she was refreshing to see a girl who did not look like she had worked streets. He also enjoyed a vision that included Tate Donovan, Rachel Leigh Cook, Barry Bostwick, and Monica Parker (with a Bruce Willis cameo). Final Takeaway: Cute movie. (Note: I did not read the book series, so my comments are based only on the film's merits.)
