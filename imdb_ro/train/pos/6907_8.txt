This movie is fun to watch. If you liked "Dave" with Kevin Klein, you'll get a shot of it. Think Dave went to South America while Dreyfus plays Jack Noah, a career actor selected by Parador's secret police secretary of the island, to replace the drunk drone of a dictator , Alfonse Simms a heart attack and died. Noah frowns, helped in his role as the mistress of the dictator, while trying to counter Raul Julia's plans. Jonathan Winters also appears as an American emigrant, who turns out to be the CIA. They also played Polly Holiday and Fernando Rey. <br /> <br /> There are some absurd moments like the old dictator's cake kept frozen for a year, and the final scene in which Sonia Braga, who has a bee, connects Dreyfus's body is seen a few moments later white with a murmur on her. But, in general, it's a wonderful story.
