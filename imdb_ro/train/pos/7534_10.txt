I totally disagree with other reviews.All essentially negative. I took a chance on this movie and was glad I did. Glad really. I could not find anything wrong with it. Nothing period. The script is original. The actors are all pleasant and convincing.Dee Smart reminded me of Marcia Brady from Brady Bunch.But this gal can really act.The setting in the Australian Outback is perfect.Performante incredible.More Soundtrack Paul Kelly.God bless Paul Kelly.The Cranberries are also here. I've seen this movie twice in less than 24 hours. I'll probably watch him again. That's interesting. It makes him believe. It's (probably) better than the nine tenths of the so-called Hollywood blockbusters that were also at this time. BACK OF BEVER is a nice movie. We filmed the movie. I did not find anything wrong with her. Check it out! My first review!
