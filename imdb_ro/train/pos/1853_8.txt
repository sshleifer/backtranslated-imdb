Well, it is again a movie that plays with your feelings and you go out soft, unlike a rocky movie. But I'm a sucker for those who gave her a good score ... the act was very good and there were many feelings. Violence is kept to a minimum that makes a change. I would have given a 9 if it was not the salute at the end! All in all, a good movie with very good actors. <br /> <br />
