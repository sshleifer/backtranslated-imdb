Warning! Spoilers ahead! Spoilers <br /> <br /> I saw the movie in German, so it might have been that I missed some clues. Despite some weaknesses in the plot, it's a movie that came to me. I especially liked Lexa Doig's act. Sometimes I have the impression she is * Camille. But I can not wonder what happened to Bob, Cassie and the baby. I thought that after he was initially put on Bob, he eventually came to love and regret what happened to his brother and had to lie to him. Otherwise, it's kind of weird to take the baby and love them. It is up to the viewer to decide - and I do not like such endings. Dean Cain was as good as ever, Eric Roberts ... well, I've seen him better, but worse. I think the film is more of an analysis of human relations and react in unexpected situations than a crime story. <br /> <br /> Bottom line is that I liked it a lot.
