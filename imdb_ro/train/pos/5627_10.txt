This move even made me jump out of my chair in anticipation of what the actors were going to do! The actor was the best, Farrah would have had to get an Oscar for this was fabulous. James Russo was so good I hated him to be a bad guy and played awesome. There are not many films that made me feel like this. The actor was terrific that Alfie looked shocked by those big eyes that Farrah looked like a victim, and you reorientated with horror as she passed through her. Farrah made you feel there and felt the same anger you felt you wanted to hurt, though you knew and it was wrong to do it. The film wore you on a roller coaster and you went up and down with each scene.
