Lindy (Meryl Streep) and her husband Michael (Sam Neill) just welcomed a little girl, Azaria. As seventh-day Adventists, they live their beliefs every day, and soon Azariah was dedicated to God in their church with two older boys. Michael gets a vacation and the family decides to head for Ayer's Rock, one of the most impressive tourist spots in all of Australia. Not being rich, family camps near the place. After a wonderful first day, Lindy makes Azaria sleep in one of the tents. Suddenly, she heard Azaria cry. When Lindy got to the tent, a dingo dog was just coming out, shaking his head. The baby has disappeared soon, as is the dingo. Although the entire camp is looking for its child, it is not found. Concluding that he is dead and that the dingo has done with his beloved child, the Chamberlains struggle to accept God's decision and to continue with their lives. But, unfortunately, the story gets a sensational coverage in the media, and soon the story goes, that Lindy killed the baby. Then she is arrested and judged. How can it happen? This is a great representation of real events that show how "mob rule" is not a fantasy of imagination. The entire country is back against the Chamberlains, partly because they are considered strange. Streep gives her the best interpretation of the Lindy complex, whose intense conduct she intends to do against her every step. Neill also does a wonderful job as Michael hesitant and confused. The distribution is one of the greatest of all times, with representations of people across the country who got to Lindy's case. Costumes, scenery, scenario, direction and production are all above the line. If you have not seen or heard about this movie, fix it immediately. It is not far from reality to say that this "Complaint" should be seen by all those who care about the film and the abusive power of the media.
