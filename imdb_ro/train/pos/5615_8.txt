A Kafkaesque thriller of alienation and paranoia. Extremely well done and Polanski behaves like a diffident introvert who is trying to adapt heavily to his missing homes in Paris and his colleagues. Horrifying early on because of seeming average and self-obsessive fellow tenants and scary later that he develops his defenses, which will ultimately be his overturning. Personally, we could have done without the cross-cloth, but I accept the node for Psycho and the fact that it has a logic given the story. However, he could have worked without removing the little theatrical element, but maybe that was intended because the yard seems to surely take the look of a theater at the end. I can not believe there are more than a few feelings of the director not to be a real "French" and a Jewish to boot. However, there is plenty to enjoy here, including a good performance from a wonderful looking Isabelle Adjani and old old Shelly Winters is as reliable as ever.
