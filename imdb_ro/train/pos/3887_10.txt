I managed to record this on my satellite, but I would love to get an original version in a format that we can use here in the United States. Eddie is truly glorious in this San Francisco show. I do not remember that laugh at a routine. My wife and I have enjoyed both this band and the work I've done Glorious. I just want to buy a copy and help Eddie support my purchase. We need more shows available.
