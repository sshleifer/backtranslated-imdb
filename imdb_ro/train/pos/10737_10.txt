If I did not know better, it almost seems to have been staged, but it was not. It was perfectly arranged, and how they got all these images is amazing! The unfortunate events of September 11, 2001 are put together in this documentary and in the classic movie that this classic unfortunate made. Only the history of the film should make him MUST see for any American or person touched by the September 11 tragedy.
