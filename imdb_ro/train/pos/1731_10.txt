The age of sexual film in the late sixties and early seventies began with free nudity in mainstream movies and ended with the legalization of hardcore pornography. The years were between 1968 and 1972. One of the most beloved and talented actresses of the time was Monica Gayle, who had a small but fanatical cult of followers. She was actually able to act, unlike many who have filled the main roles of these movements, and subsequent credits have proven it. And her seemingly deliberate discoloration in obscurity, even when her career took her down, not only strengthens her mysticism. Gary Graver, the director, was also a talent; probably too talented for sexploitation, and her talent, combined with the presence of the Monica Gayle screen, makes Sandra, The Effect of a Woman a Pleasant Pleasure. The movie does not shoot and you will not have your finger pressed on the button fast forward.
