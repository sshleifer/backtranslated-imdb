On the night of his party, Paul Coleman (Jason Lee) meets the cute Becky man (Julia Stiles) in the bar, drinks a lot together and wakes up with her on the bed. His future mother-in-law calls him and informs that Karen's fianc√©e (Selma Blair) might come to his apartment and desperately ask Becky to leave his place in a hurry. Earlier, he finds he has crabs, and later, in preparation for the wedding party, he realizes that Becky is Karen's cousin. This is the beginning of a very fun comedy, with hilarious situations. The first attraction of this film is certainly the central trio of actresses and actor. Julia Stiles and Selma Blair, who are excellent and incredibly gorgeous actresses, and Jason Lee, which is amazingly funny, have good performances. I laughed a lot along the story, but there are some scenes that are really hilarious. For example, when Paul finds Becky in his bed; when he finds his paints; his imagination in many situations; in the pharmacy, trying to buy and get explanations about the crab medicine; most of his neighbor's scenes, minister; when Karen calls the store; or when the police find a suspect of Paul's attack. I could count many other scenes, but it's better for the reader to rent or buy this movie and have a lot of fun. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Crazy For Them" "Louco Por Elas"
