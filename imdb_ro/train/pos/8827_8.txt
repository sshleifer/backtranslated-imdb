With a minimum budget, an eight-minute running time and a great deal of imagination, Nacho Vigalondo has made one of the most exciting shorts I've ever seen. The subtlety of the script is truly remarkable, as it does not end at the last moment. Do not let anyone tell you what it is, since you will be able to enjoy it much more. Nacho Vigalondo is the discovery of the year for his unique show: directing, writing and acting in this short format is the most remarkable effort I have seen over the years. Also pay attention to Marta Belenguer's performance, her reaction photos are incredible. <br /> <br /> Note: 8/10
