Okay, so the plot's on the ground. Yes, well, so there are some songs and / or random dance sequences (eg Adam's concert and Henri's stage act). And Leslie Caron can not really, you know ... it works. But in a way, "An American in Paris" manages to come through as a polished, first-class musician - largely on the basis of the incredible dance talent and choreography of Gene Kelly and the charm trucks he seems to import them in every scene with Caron. (He needs this because he seems to have a problem with emotation.) The most successful and technically inspired by this musical is obviously the 16 minute ballet at the end of the movie. She is amazed to shoot, and Kelly and Caron dance well. But my favorite number should be Kelly's character singing "I've got a rhythm" with a bunch of French school children, then going into a series of American dances. It's just to prove you do not need special effects when you have a real talent *. Not "classic" with "Singin 'In The Rain", but pretty up there. It's worth the clock!
