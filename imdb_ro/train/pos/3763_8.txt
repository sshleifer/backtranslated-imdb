Now it's more! The first film had some dialogue and weaker action, but it seems the team behind them took things together to continue and launched a solid, pleasant, hilarious and creative comedy that will keep everyone on the edge fully. <br /> <br /> Really, this is full of wonderful things, full of creativity, and is less of a spoof in the 80's at the same time. The scenes from Hell are wonderful, so are the ones in the sky. There is no crazy adventure adventure that he promises, and you will never see such a movie. Even the final act of the film is not as bad as the first, being generally unimaginable and enjoyable in the extremely clich√©ful repertoire of family fun. And even Keanu Reeves, despite showing about 30 years, is not that bad here. Sounds like a good deal for me.
