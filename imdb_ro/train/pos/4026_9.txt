Pinjar is really a masterpiece .... It's a provocative film that makes you think and makes you ask our culture. It's undoubtedly the best Hindi movie I have ever seen. This movie was supposed to be featured at film festivals around the world and I think it would have been a serious competitor at Cannes. All the characters were dressed perfectly, and Urmila Matkondar and Manoj Bhajpai are haunted by their roles. The story of the movie about a partition is a very important story and one that should never be forgotten. > <br /> He has no prejudices and did not give the partition a human story. Here, no country is described as good or bad. They are evil Indians, bad Pakistani and good Indian and Pakistani. The cinema is excellent and the music is melodious, full of meaning and haunted. Everything about the movie was amazing ... and the act took my breath. They were all thrown away.
