10/10 for this movie. <br /> <br /> I am a British doctor from India, currently in India. the word Beckham took me out because I'm a heavy Liverpool fan and I personally think Owen is cool. Since Liverpool and Man Utd are rivals, I was sure I would not watch the movie. But then I was in Delhi to meet some friends and I had an early morning flight so I thought, "What the hell, let's spend time watching this movie," because it was a late night show. I should have seen this movie the day she was released I think using Beckham's name was to attract the audience's appeal (which had back in my case !!!) but then I really do not I can think of a better title for the movie. And Nagra, Knightley (a dead dead drop) and Rhys-Myers did a great job. If you hate football, do not like Manchester United (or I'm only 29 years old, a professional psychiatrist, but a child in my heart. "This movie hit" Star Wars "on my # 1 position. br /> <br /> Surprisingly, there are not too many comments on this movie by Indians as I wonder why? 10/10 for this movie.
