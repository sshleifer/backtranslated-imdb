But, unfortunately, because of rights issues, this will almost never happen. The transcripts of Joe Bob's commentary on the movies he's watched under B are available on the internet, but he does not capture enough of his terrible delivery, which was a real challenge. Currently, Joe Bob (real name: John Bloom) confines himself to making the extra features of such classics, such as "I Spit On Your Grave" (with what some fans of exploitation call the biggest bandwagon on the film of all time) and Jason X, one of the most remembered Friday 13th sequels of all time (the series was never the same once he left Paramount). All I could imagine when they canceled it was: "Damn, where else will I fill my meat, blond jokes and horror trivia every Saturday night?" Does that mean I have to make a living now? Unfortunately, it is. But it will always be a place in my hungry hungry heart for "Monstervision". Live Drive-In!
