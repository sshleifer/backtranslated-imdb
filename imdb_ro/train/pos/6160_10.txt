SPOILER ALERT !!!! I had just watched the extended version of Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Although I liked the extended version, I would like to have left the original DVD. Portabello Road could have been cut to its original length. It was too long and shot the movie along. Although the dance is great, it would have been much better left on the DVD as a deleted scene. Everything in all this is a wonderful movie. My 5 years of age I liked. And it's great that the movies I enjoyed as a kid are being passed on to a new generation. This and Mary Poppins are added to my collection. <br /> <br /> As I remembered! <br /> <br /> *** din **** <br /> <br />
