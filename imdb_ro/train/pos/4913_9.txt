The title overestimates the content of this movie somewhat, which could lead to some unrealized expectations. Frankly speaking, there is very little "panic on the streets" to be seen here. Actually, during the film, very few people actually know there is a free-will killer who could spread the plague to anyone and anyone he meets. As I said, what we have here is a very well-done story with a suspense level that starts reasonably anyway (because, unlike people on the streets, the spectator knows what's going on) and that director Elia Kazan builds very deliberately. As the killer infected with the plague is looking for, one of the most interesting side we found was the developing relationship between Dr. Reed (Richard Widmark) and Captain Warren (Paul Douglas). At first, the two do not like each other, although they have to work together. In the end, they have created a real relationship of mutual respect. Kazan did a good job with that. Quite a lot, all the performance here was excellent. Widmark and Douglas were great and I was quite taken with a very early look at Jack Palance playing what will become his typical "hard" role. I found very little to criticize here. Maybe Barbara Bel Geddes met like a bit flat as Reed's wife, Nancy, but her role was not really central to the story. All in all, a great work. 9/10
