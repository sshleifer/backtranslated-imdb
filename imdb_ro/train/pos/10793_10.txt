There are some spoilers in this comment! Unlike the comments I just read on nativetex4u and some others, I really enjoyed the movie and I would love to see it as a weekly series. /> <br /> I'm a fan of Judson Mills, but also a big fan of Chuck Norris and while I admit that some of the action scenes have stretched the line a little, the story fits even with other weekly series I'm currently running. The opening of fifteen minutes, when Deke ran out of bad boys after blowing his missiles, was very packed. I can not see how many "professionals" failed to reach a target on the move, but the action was definitely there, and Deke, being the hero, had to survive. As for the comment on the need to "capture the film in the box to fill the time after departures." This film was not originally scheduled by CBS for a January filming and filming was completed in May 2001 with a good period of 4 months before the terrorist attacks against the United States. If the author of the commentary paid attention to the film, instead of trying to avoid it, he might have done the narrative story: Rashid, a Bin Laden-like character, intended to launch a nuclear device in the United States. The president's man was called to locate and eliminate the problem. Perhaps the writer should actually SEE the movie before attempting to comment on it. <br /> <br />
