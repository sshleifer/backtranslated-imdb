This is one of my favorites, with Mariette Hartley and Robert Lansing "Sandy" and Agnes Moorhead episodes-and-Tiny-Spacemen. It is important to take from mid-1961 on the long cold war involving the US. Scene City beat insufficient dialogue of the characters of hunger, their uniforms dirty and the minimum action "say" everything: the absurdity of "a conflict that threatens to destroy human life, modern civilization and all that is sweet and redemptive. It is a" fable " because it was made in a time when, like the second crisis of Berlin (spring 1961) and the crisis subsequent Cuban missile (October 1962), it was actually a reasonable representation of one of cities of the US, ruined and full of a few survivors miserable. also, see it as a "fable" because it is not just a story warning, but that is the redemption of all our myths popular: a story love, put in an impossible situation, involving two lovers very wrong.
