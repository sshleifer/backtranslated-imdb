This is probably one of the most original love stories we've seen over time, especially for a war-based film (short). Basically, it's a story based on two worlds, one obviously real, the other fictional, but the filmmakers say at first that it's just a coincidence if it's a real place. Anyway, Peter Carter (the great David Niven) would collapse on a plane, he spoke to June (Kim Hunter's Planet of Monkeys) before he saved himself out and said he loved her. He had to die out of parachute jumping, but somehow he survived, and now he sees him and loves June in flesh. This other place, like heaven, is unhappy because he survived and was meant to come into their world, so he sends the French conductor 71 (Marius Goring) to persuade him to leave, but he is obviously in love. Peter suggests that he should appeal to keep his life in the other's yard, he is granted this. Obviously, love prevails when the two lovers announce that they will die for each other, and Jun offers its own place! He also played Robert Coote as Bob Trubshawe, Kathleen Byron as an angel, a short (then unknown) Lord Sir Richard Attenborough as an English pilot and Abraham Sofaer as a judge / surgeon. David Niven was the 36th of the 50 greatest British actors, the film was No. 86 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for the Happy End, was No. 47 in The 100 Greatest War Films, was No. 46 in The 50 Greatest British Films it was number 59 on the 100 big movies. Impressive!
