This is an excellent but hard to find triple world war I thriller spy in Italian inimitable 60's. From the psychedelic chart of introductory credits and the high score of Ennio Morricone to the scene of lesbian love with Capucine and in the apocalyptic scenes of poisonous gas scenes and German cavalry in storm trooper troops, a film that should not be missed. It's a movie that captures the horrors and cruelty of the war and the ruthlessness of the players on and off the battlefield. In addition to battle scenes, some of the productions and special effects are primitive, apparently because most of the budget for this film has been saved for battle scenes, but for movie lovers 60 should not be a problem. I first saw this movie on TV many years ago and I had the forecast to record it on VHS. I still have the tape and I'm glad to see it from time to time.
