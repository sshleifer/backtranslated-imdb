My personal feeling is that you can not divorce this movie from its political / historical base as many tensors (Americans) tend to do. It's not about growing up on Main Street, USA. It's about growing up in Yugoslavia at a time when it was broken between East and West. Just as the boys are torn between Esther and everyone else, and Esther is torn between "Tovarish Joe" and boys. There is shame in certain situations that are lost in an audience that has never lived under Tito. I feel the movie is undervalued and it's too bad I lost the director. Movies like this make freedom to feel more important. It's not just another age-old film in Eastern Europe ... ... it's a delicate portrait of adolescents going on a fine line that could lead them to real freedom.
