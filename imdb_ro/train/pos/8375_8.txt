<br /> <br /> The jox robot is a great little movie, some of the sets are bad and the act is not so great, but the special effects are great for a movie of this size and age. You have to remember that this movie is over 10 years now and was made very cheap in the first place, so you can not think too much about the bad parts. So sit back and watch a great movie with big robots in it.
