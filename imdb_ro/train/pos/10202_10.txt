I personally liked this film and I am alarmed by the ratings that some people gave. It's a comic book and is animated, now if you do not like comic books or animation, then of course you will not like this movie, why did you see and disturb to evaluate it's beyond me. However, if you are a fan of interesting, powerful and heroic (sexy) characters who hit the ass and save the world (hell), you like this movie. I thought the story really shot me and it was a very exciting movie. Quite anime-esque or more like some of the American movies following this new animation trend for adults. Like Titan A.E. I meet Punisher's live version. Finally, I highly recommend this film to the comic strip and superhero or anyone who has a mind wide enough to find a fun movie.
