"Twelve Monkeys" has all the necessary elements to become the masterpiece of Terry Gilliam. A remarkable scenario, a sustained rhythm, sometimes ironic intelligent dialogues. Moreover, he had a good nose about distribution. "Twelve Monkeys" is also the first film in which Bruce Willis returns from the character he played in his previous films. Here, a jaded and hopeless character that you could call a prisoner took over a fearless and invincible hero (as was the case with "Die Hard"). No matter how he tries, he is a prisoner of the time. The film also contains an extremely thrilling ending. It has a real dramatic power. But this great movie is also a reflection on man, the dangers he has suffered (especially those that could cause the end of the world and here, these are viruses that can create diseases). No matter how long it takes, "twelve monkeys" will be estimated at their true value: one of the masterpieces made in the nineties.
