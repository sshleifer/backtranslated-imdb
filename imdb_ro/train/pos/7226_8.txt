A little typical of this time. Obviously, it was first conceived in this world for the scene, but nevertheless a very good movie from the beginning to the end. Peter O'Toole and Susannah York end up performing the stage performance for the silver screen and both do it effectively. There are very few things in the way of the story and anyone who is not familiar with this type of off-beat character study can be a bit put on the account of it. Still, a good film in which Peter O'Toole and Susannah York come to survive.
