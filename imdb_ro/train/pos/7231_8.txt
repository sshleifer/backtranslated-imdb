The usual cat and mouse antique abound until Jerry jumps into a bottle of invisible ink. He receives Tom's tortured idea of ​​torture without him knowing. The cat gets wiser and tries to do things that make him see "jerry", even if it's not true. Of course, Jerry gets Butch aka Killer aka Spike the dog in the act (even if it's late in short, and his contribution is really minimal) Brilliant animated short that reminded me of one with a white mouse that scares Tom both bad. Most of the gags work and all the violent like any good tom and short jerry should really be. This hilarious cartoon can be found on the Tom & Jerry Spotlight DVD disc of my Spotlight collection <br /> <br /> My degree: B +
