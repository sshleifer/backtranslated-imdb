Add Paulie the parrot to the characters loved by animated movies. This movie is a love story - bird and Gow Rowlands, Bird and beloved Marie, Michael and Marie. A Russian goalkeeper helps a parrot who talks and thinks to find his rightful owner many years after Marie's parents sell him in a pawn shop. Before we finish warming our heart, we learn all Paulie's mistakes. Cheech Marin and his dancing parrots are wonderful. Beautiful photo all along. The wonderful, mouth-watering film will make him a cult favorite.
