I have not read the book on which it is based. These are some of (the other are the film roles), John Ritter's latest work (RIP), is hoped to be hilarious. And it is. Almost every time he is present in this, in fact. Most of the cast, supporting and regularly, play each other well and the material tends to be great. He plays the role of Paul Hennessy, the father of three adolescents: Rory, the typical guy of that age, Kerry, the middle-depressed child fighting for causes and awareness, and Bridget, the fashion lover, popular ditz. Sagal returns to be the female leader in a sit-com, and her character is far from Peggy Bundy. The show has changed to some extent after Mr. Trei's Company went on, and for a time he did not seem to decide if they wanted to laugh, be old and respectful. You may wonder how and why it lasted so long afterwards: it could be quite good, some of the additions were lucky (if you like David Spade, most of it is to do schtick) and he had things to say. My favorite personal episode is in the last season. Humor is a beautiful blend of "bad person" jokes (mostly related to old age colleagues), silliness, dark comedy and raw material. This has addressed sex and other adult subjects, but never in a graphic way. The language is mild and sometimes moderately strong. I recommend this to any fan of those who did it. 8/10
