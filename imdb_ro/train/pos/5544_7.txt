PRC, which was the lowest of gold really hit with this little thriller. They did the same thing a year earlier with "Detour," which is probably one of the best low-budget movies ever made. "Strangler" is basically a unique film, full of fog and shadow, a technique used by most poverty studios to hide sets or lack of them. But here, it works well. Charles Middleton's ghost (better known as Ming the Merciless) shines around the marsh killing those involved in his illicit execution for murder and generating some sympathy from the spectator. His final victim is to be the daughter of the ferry ... ... he concentrates his anger not only on those directly involved in his fate but also on their relatives. Rosemary LaPlanche makes the usual imitation of someone in a coma that goes for her acting style. He offers himself to the master to stop killing, but as a pause for the public, the strident sees the good of his gesture as a sign that his mission is complete and he returns to the last, somehow punished. If Ulmer (who directed the "Detour") directed the Strangler, she would have hung from the nearest tree and his strangler's work would have done. But who complains? It is not the story of what is the major attraction, but the shrouded sets, the illumination and the general moodiness of the play. It is behind the "Detour" as the best time of the PRC
