"Castle of Terror" is an astonishingly surprising artistic entry from Italian director Anthony Dawson. Exquisite black and white cinema, impeccable dubbing, superb casting, fairly logical scriptures, deliberate pacing, and a surprise (although perfectly fitting) end with this. Only movies, sometimes the hokey music and the rather "abrupt love" at first sight between Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) and Alan (Georges Rivi√®re) have an otherwise surprisingly fun movie. While visiting England, Edgar Allan Poe sits in a pub, telling one of his ghost stories about Count Blackwood. Recognizing the great writer, Alan, a young news reporter, calls for an interview with Poe. During the conversation, Poe reveals that all his stories are true. Truly, Alan expresses his skepticism about life after death. Count Blackwood offers to bet Alan 100 pounds that he can not survive this night in Blackwood Castle, a night after Halloween when he walked. Alan can not afford his bet, so he bets his life for a bet of 10 pounds. Unlike Mario Bava's "Black Satan", "The Blood Castle" is quite limited, making some moments of even worse violence, especially surprisingly from a director associated with these terrible Italian space films from the 60's. It's a pity the only version of this movie that I found is a pan version and seriously damaged (and recorded) scan. Even so, it's worth seeing and shouting for a modern remake, perhaps with Christina Ricci or Jennifer Love Hewitt as Elizabeth. Watch it and enjoy a movie that compares well with Robert Wise's "The Haunting."
