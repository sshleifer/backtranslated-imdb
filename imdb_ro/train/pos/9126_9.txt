This movie is remarkable and marvelous. Prince's music oscar was greatly deserved (many people do not know he won one). I think this is one of the best movies to watch a nightclub late at night on DVD. An extraordinary surprise: The Prince has a good job and is good enough to transmit the pain to the room. Day Morris, Wendy and Lisa are good in their supporting roles. Very cool movie landmark.
