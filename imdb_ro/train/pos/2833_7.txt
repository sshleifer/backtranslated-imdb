He re-saw this movie after thirty-seven years. I was eleven years old and I realized the South Beach cinema on Washington Avenue. In 1969, I thought where it is! it was a very good movie. Now, however, after almost forty years, he is not as good as he was. Time has changed, and this movie is now an old tired old-world war of generations. However, it has captured a place in time that is just a memory. It's exciting to see fashion fashion, old Vegas, a thin Don Rickles, chain smoking and a hip opening song. The act was decent, the script was somewhat outdated, but the memories were still fresh. Where La is, it can not be where it is for you, but for me, it was still a fun and fun trip on the memory strip.
