In Brooklyn, a century ago, the rivalry between Chuck Connors and Steve Brodie and the brigades of competing volunteer officers lead to Brodie's famous bet that he can jump off the Brooklyn Bridge. This is a story that will be known to a lot of people through a Bugs Bunny spoofing, "Bowery Bugs", 1949. This generally liked movie would probably be more widely available if it were not the notorious and anxious scenario which involves some Chinese residents of housing - a time capsule of racially antediluvian attitudes, giving the film a great historical interest, in my opinion.
