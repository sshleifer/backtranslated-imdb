Does anyone know what kind of pickup John T drove? I have a Ford Ford in the mid-70s. This movie is my favorite, as well as my wife. It was the first memorable movie I saw as a married couple. Lifting is of interest because it is similar to the first truck I have driven and I recently found another one like this one. I would like to recreate the pick that I must sow in the movie. Also, the music was great, and the acting was great. Where and what is the lady who represented John's aunt? Also, John had a double cascade for the scene on the tower when he fell close? Also, what year Mustang made Debra W in this show. It looked like a model of 60 years. Thanks,
