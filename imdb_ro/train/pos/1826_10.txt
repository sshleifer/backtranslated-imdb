I liked this movie when I was little. Today, at 17, this is one of my favorite films of all time. Beautiful animals and appealing characters are just two of the things I love about this movie. Although many people can not enjoy songs, most are well made and go along with the story. She focuses on Charlie, a strange German Shepard beautiful, which may seem unicable to some at first ... but eventually you will win over. It's not a kiddy movie by any means. Often very dark and frightening sometimes. A living for Don Bluth fans and animators. But keep a tissue at your fingertips. ADGTH never succeeds in making me cry and will do the same for those who are sensitive to the movie. Probably one of the greatest animated non-Disney movies of all time. Together with Watership Down and My Totoro Neighborhood. WHITE LINEN: A heavenly masterpiece.
