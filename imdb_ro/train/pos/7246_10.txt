This movie is completely ridiculous. Not only is the plot atrocious, but the act is terrible. The special effects are asinine and the whole film is put into a post-apocalyptic desert. However, it is by far the most funny movie ever given permission to be produced. There are 101 minutes of laughter because we all know that there will be no fuel in the year 3000 nor in any of El Camino. There are also other things that I will not spoil, just because I'm what makes the movies so wonderful moron. I highly recommend this movie, just because of its total idiot. I have no idea who would follow this by expecting it to be a high quality feature, but if a good laugh is what you need, watch the Exterminators of the Year 3000!
