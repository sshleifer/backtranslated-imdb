There are other reviews here, so I do not have to say how big it is or what it is ... My point of view is: I heard about this age-old film before it was shown. I do not even remember HOW, I just know it was through the internet. Distributors have passed before they ever get hit! For several months I cried and wept. Note that on this page there is a link to buy this movie, and the only highlight is the VHS from Amazon.com in Germany. You can use Alta Vista's Babelfish to translate. I know it's the PAL format and they changed the text on the screen in German, and at the beginning of the film there's also a little bit of a narrative, which is also called in German but as hilarious and dizzy as this movie, ! If you want to see this movie and you have a place that makes conversions it is so worth it! It took about twenty dollars to get to the US. from Germany. Believe me, it might seem like a lot of party to a movie, but if you're in the b-flicks horn you'll blow money left and right to get conversions for your friends!
