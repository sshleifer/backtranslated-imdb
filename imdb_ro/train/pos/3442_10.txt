This film leaves the intellectual mind to think and try to analyze the story. Also, I can not understand why people would destroy this movie. If you are a Jerry Bruckheimer fan, this movie may not be suitable for u. This film has a high degree of realism. Performers of actresses and actresses is exemplary. Not false, but only natural. <br /> <br /> No special sound effects, such special side effects. Working with the room is great, the music is so good. I can not wait to get the soundtrack. It leaves your body numb, like Constant Garderner. He has direct talent, he is certainly not a survivor.
