I liked the episode, but it seems to me that it should have been a brief reference to the secretary who was punished because he was actually an accomplice after that. While I like when an episode in Columbo has an unpredictable overturning like this, his resolution should be part of the end of the episode, along with the killer's discovery. The interaction between Peter Falk and Ruth Gordon is invaluable. At one point, Gordon, singing a famous writer, makes a comment about being flattered by the famous Lt Columbo, alluding to the detective's fame as a killer. This is one of the best among the many high rates of Columbo.
