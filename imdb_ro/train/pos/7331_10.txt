In a time of magic, the barbarians and demons abound in a diabolical tyrant named Nekhron and his mother, Queen Juliane, who lives in the ice region and wants to conquer the region of fire led by King Jerol, but when his beautiful daughter Princess Teegra was kidnapped by Nekhron's warfare, a warrior named Larn has to protect her and must defeat Nekhron to take over the world and the kingdom with the help of an avenger named Darkwolf. A fantastic animated epic (rotoscoping) is Ralph Bakshi's second best film, with "American Pop" being the number one and "Heavy Traffic" being the third, and the "Wizards" being the fourth. It's certainly better than "Cool World" or "Lord of the Rings," artworks are designed by famed artist Frank Farzetta, and animation has a good coloring and there is also a hot deal for boys. <br /> <br /> We recommend this movie to fans of fantasy and animation everywhere, especially the new 2-disc of Blue Underground. <br /> <br /> We also recommend: Black Dog, Dark Crystal, Barbarian Conan, Wizard of Oz, Rock & Rule, Wizards, Heavy Metal, Starchaser: Legend of Orin "," Fantastic Planet "," Princess Mononoke "," Conan The Destroyer "," Willow "," Princess Bride "," Lord of the Rings " "The Army of Darkness" Dragonheart "," King Arthur "," The Hobbit "," The Return of the King (1980) "," Conquest "," American Pop "," Jason and the Argonauts " "," Hercules (Disney), "" Legend, "" The Chronicles of Narnia, "" Harry Potter and the Fire of Fire.
