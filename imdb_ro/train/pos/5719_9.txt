As I have seen with many IMDb comments, some reviewers seem to demand that each movie they see has a clever paradox that will gain intelligence. I'm not one of those people. If I see an action movie, I want to see explosions, gunfire and heroism. If I'm watching a comedy, I want laughing tears in my eyes. Do you have any idea. Therefore, watching a horror movie, I want to be scared first and foremost. The Grudge is a very scary film in both well-performed "jump" scenes and frightening images. I have been a horror filmmaker for many years and talk about masters like Dario Argento, rather than the directors of teenage horror movements that are unleashed these days. If you want to be scared, watch this movie. Unlike the original Japanese ring (which also thinks it's a great movie).
