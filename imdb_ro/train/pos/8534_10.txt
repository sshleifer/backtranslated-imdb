Eric Stoltz offers extraordinary performance as Joel Garcia, a young successful novelist who ends up paralyzed in a special hospital for people with disabilities recently, after breaking his neck in a hiking accident. As he learns to cope with and adjusts to the severity of his limited physical state, Joel becomes friends with Raymond (an amazing Wesley Snipes) and blond, gentle blond, racing biker Bloss (a wonderful William Forsythe) who feels threatened by the multiethnic diversity of fellow patients he has to share with a room. Joel also receives substantial support from his loyal and loving, but married Anna (played radiantly by Helen Hunt). But he must understand that he is handicapped on his own. This important triumph of the film is its laudable refusal to be stubborn to be disinfected and not to sense the severity of what these people are going through. Directors Neil Jimenez (who also wrote the brilliant and profound script) and Micheal Steinberg relate the story with an exceptional taste, intelligence and warmth, specifically addressing with the sincere and material disappointment of how disability irreversibly alters the lifestyle, sexual life (this point is most powerful in a striking succession when Joel and Anna try not to make love in a motel room). Besides the expected expectation, the film also offers a surprising surprisingly brutal and funny humor, which is evidenced by Joel's and Bloss's serious succession making a secret night's expedition to a strip club. Another significant plus is Stoltz, Snipes, Forsythe and Hunt, with Grace Zabriskie's support as Bloss, the friendly mother and Elisabeth Pena and William Allen Young as compassionate hospital nurses. In spite of the grim subject, the film ultimately proves to be a very moving, positive and elevating cinematic test for the astonishing power and durability of the human spirit. A simple jewel of a drama.
