I appreciated photography, textures, colors and often, unlike a comment, lighting. What was missing for me was a coherent story. I have found that it is often disjointed, poorly edited and sometimes difficult to follow. My version was 110 minutes, IMDb shows one at 125m. Possibly cuts and subtitles did not help. I'm applauding any movies that get rid of the Hollywood mold, but that made me disappointed. Miss Gillain was bright and the performance was good, I just wanted a smaller dialogue. If someone would like to see another movie that has a certain affinity with it, try "Hideous Kinky" with Kate Winslet.
