I have recently seen this movie and I enjoyed it very much. gives you insight into indie filming and how really it is really involved when you have a low budget, but you need an actor / actress to get people, everyone come to see it and show the movie. Bobby Myeres, played by Modine and his partner, Saul - Paul Linder, make a great combination, finding the eccentric Miachel Bates, actor "NAME" played by Alan Bates was a perfect decision in film and film. My most favorite member was Sandy Ryan performed by the wonderful and underestimated Debra Kara Unger, with a special performance again in the movie. If you like to think about a comedy, then this is for you. The low budget covers a smaller budget with high laughing content.
