Immediately after the Second World War, healthy Hollywood minds tried to distance themselves from the flame without a scourge that is a natural ingredient in a war effort. "The Best of Our Life" and even the "Gentleman Agreement" investigated the way Americans looked at them after the war, but Delmer Daves's "Pride of the Marines" beat them. The film is about Philadelphia's smart choice, John Garfield, who goes to war as a marine and after a night of nightmare in a foyer, the Japanese soldiers complaining to him and his friends, "Mariiine, tonight you die!" a hand grenade, and escapes his girlfriend back home, rather than depend on her after returning home. Delmer Daves is endless in his description of these men who are courageous, almost coincidental They are there in the lap and when they are shot they react so much for heroism but they do the job and then comes the self-esteem, Darkness, Dark Humility, Garfield is in angry denial of his blindness, and the film makes no excuses: "There is no free candy to anyone in this world," as his friend tells him. Ame, a Jew, played by Dane Clark, reminds him: "In a war, someone gets it and you are. Everyone has trouble! When I get back, some guys will not hire me, because my name is Diamond." Great movies are made with courage like this, and if the first half hour of "The Pride of the Marines" does not rise to this full occasion, it has since evolved into a true work of art, weeping and thinking, beating and hoping hope, simply: art. <br /> <br />
