Antwone Fisher's story about childhood neglect and abuse is a source of inspiration for all of us who have witnessed or even lived in the situation of adoptive children. Abandoned by a disturbing mother, Antwone never met his father. Growing with "church" aggressors who use "n-word" not only to intimidate and injure, but also as a term of enthusiasm, because a young person assisted in how best his friend is killed in a shit and angry while serving in the navy, Antwone's anger slowly turns into positive power when advised by a ship's shrink and love enters his life. The scene where Antwone meets his mother is one of the most powerful moments in the movie. Overwhelmed by unexpected confrontation, the woman listens silently that the young man tells him how a life without crime, drug addiction, fathers left and right, lives, despite its extreme circumstances. <br /> <br /> If the scene was not strong enough, the next one drives it home (and opens the flood gates): A reception to receive Antwone's home; dozens of smiling faces and open arms announcing that He is part of this great family. One of the messages delivered by this wonderful movie is that there are many well-meaning and honest people working to help orphans and unwanted children. Even though some houses and administrators do not seem to care and do not appear in themselves, many give it all. The character who found Antwone's "file" once revealed the circumstances of his birth is one of those "bright lights" in the darkness of the system. The DVD includes a French-language track, different subtitle choices as well as additional features and parental assistance information. <br /> <br /> Like a Clevelander, I appreciated the location of the movie. No matter where you are, you will be deeply moved by this autobiographical gem.
