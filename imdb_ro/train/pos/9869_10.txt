I would say that this is one of the best animated movies I've ever seen. I liked it for the first time, but really appreciated it at the second watch a few weeks ago. I can see why this kind of activity continues at the box office. Apparently, a lot of people liked this movie. A splendid palette of colors (man, this looks good) and lots of good humor (but clean) adults make this great winner. The opening scene of 3-4 minutes with "Scat" is excellent, as well as the subsequent interludes with him. "Sid," laziness (expressed by John Leguizano), however, offers the main humor in the movie. It's usually funny to say throughout the movie. Ray Romano is the voice of the mammoth, the great character of the film, literally, while Denis Leary is the bad guy-advanced sabertooth tiger <br /> <br /> This is not just humor and pretty colors but a beautiful, sentimental story of the way a small child softens a pair of harsh characters. This is not interrupted with a lot of songs, either: one just a short one and there is nothing offensive, linguistic. If there were more animated movies, it would be better.
