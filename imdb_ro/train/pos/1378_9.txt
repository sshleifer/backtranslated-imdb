I saw this little Belgian jewel two days after I saw American Teen. Do not make a mistake, adolescence is a roller coaster ride, be it American or European. "Naissance des Pieuvres" (or as it is called in "Water Lillies") is a story of a young 15-year-old girl (played by Pauline Acquart, who sometimes resembles a young Scarlett Johansson) girl wishing to be on the team school swim just to be close to another attractive girl (Adele Haenel). It is more than obvious that Mary is more than attracted to Floriane. These include Marie's unattractive friend Anne, who only wants a friend like any other girl of her age. Along the way, we show the usual range of adolescent fun (broken hearts, store upsets, alcohol and / or drug use, occasional sex, etc.). This is a small and silent movie that takes time to work as it happens in your system (Michael Bay fans, note: pacing here is slow, so you're heading), but if you have no problem With that, Water Lillies is a charm. No rating here, but it would pull down a hard "R" because of tongue, nudity, adult situations.
