Wonderful, small, almost insignificant. Polanski finds the invisibility of his characters and does something enormous of it. In front of and behind the camera creates one of the most awkward masterpieces I had the pleasure of seeing and seeing and seeing them again. He never left me down. People, even those who know me pretty well, believed / believe it was / is something wrong with me, based on my attraction or should I say, the devotion to "Le Locataire" They may be right, I do not know, but there is something irresistibly delighted in the Polanski darkness, and I have not even mentioned humor. The mystery that surrounds the apartment and the previous tenant, the mystery that takes over and, of course, us. This building was inhabited by the old Oscar winners: Melvyn Douglas, Shelley Winters, Jo Van Fleet, Lila Kedrova. For anyone who loves movies, this is a mandatory viewing. One, two, three, many, many views.
