A great concept, a great distribution, and what a pity there was no time to discuss the story. I liked it and wanted more. Dench, Dukakis and Laine, there are now REAL women! However, Dench and her character had enough substance to wear the script in some of her smaller moments. I have a tape and I will continue to follow her, hoping there is a clue in the end that suggests it will be a sequel. Top drawer! - No question! - No argument! <br /> <br />
