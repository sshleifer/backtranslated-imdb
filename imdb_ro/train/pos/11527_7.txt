Miriam Hopkins is "The Red-haired Lady" in Leslie Carter's biopic of 1940, who plays Claude Rains as David Belasco, Richard Ainley as Lou Payne and a fine team of players including Laura Hope Crews and Victor Jory. <br /> <br /> Miriam Hopkins and Claude Rains offer great performances. Hopkins was a beautiful actress who makes us feel for Mrs. Carter. Rains is great as the egoist producer / writer / actor / writer David Belasco, one of the great names in the theater. Although Mrs Carter's second husband, Lou Payne, served as a counselor in this film, she is a poor representation of Mrs Carter's real events. True, there was a much-divorced and bitter divorce, and she was undoubtedly regarded as a scandalous character for this and becoming an actress. However, she had the custody of her son Dudley, so there was no custody battle. Once he broke up with Belasco, he did not return to him and actually started working in Vauduville and actually made some end-of-life films. She really married Lou and became her leader in many productions. Mrs Carter's driving force at the beginning of this film is to regain her son's custody, but eventually realizes that in her time away from him, he is closely linked to his father. Also in the film (and I'm not sure if it was true in real life), she traveled with her mother and lived in a theatrical guesthouse, which gives the movie an interesting atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Not a bad movie, perhaps not a representation of the greatness of either Carter or Belasco. One of Mrs. Carter's most famous moments was in the Heart of Maryland, where she wore a six-foot wig. Outside the scene, the fans blew their hair while she hung 35 feet above the ladder, holding the center of the bell to keep it from ringing. Pretty visually.
