Robert De Niro, Cuba Gooding Jr., Hal Holbrook and all the other actors and actresses from "Men of Honor" combined to make this movie a great movie. Mark Isham wrote the movie, so you know that music is really beautiful. But: After we noticed a blow of goose, gaps and extravagance from the heart, right from the beginning, I had to swear to ignore them and sit back to enjoy the film. If you can do that, it's really good. The story of Carl Brashear, a true hero of life, is inspired enough to last a lifetime. Search the web ... The whole story is more amazing than the movie, as the director admitted in his comments. In the Second World War, there were only three African American divers in the US. However, none has reached the status of the US Navy Master Diver. Carl Brashear was the first African-American US Navy Master Diver. And he was the first amputated diver ever to have been certified or recertified as a US Navy diver. (Resonance applause). On the negative side of the film director: Should I just tell you about one of the many "loopholes"? Yes, I will mark this comment as containing "spoilers" and do that ... The early stage, the pivotal helicopter hitting the radio mast and sinking into the sea: It would never have had time to match a full Mark V diving club if it were the legendary Chief Master Billy Sunday, in time to be just "... a few minutes late" saving the pilot. So, for gaps, goofs and over-dramatization, I disturbed "Men of Honor" from a perfect 10 to a 7. Hollywood EVER realize that unbound truth is much better than their dramaturgical approach to the story? I doubt it. Sin!
