Getting acquainted with this film, before I saw her on the Rialto Canal, it seemed like a pleasant, lively and enriching film. <br /> <br /> Casting was excellent. I liked all the characters, they were a little exaggerated in places, (but this is a movie). The way he showed a pleasant, giddy, main character's walk took him until he returned badly, as real life can and does. Yeah, I thought Andy MacDowell was great. I was particularly interested in seeing this movie once it started, because people joked so often about her acting skills (I think it's pretty bad because she's always a solid actress in my opinion). I really liked the end of what Andy's character said, "sometimes I feel he's never been here", etc., it was as complete as it is in a situation like this (with which I can personally identify myself) then it was that wonderful classic piece "Nocturne" I think by Chopin, which was a beautiful way to end (the light comedy bar at the end, which probably was not necessary). I say "well done" to film makers - I saw 1,000 e of worse movies!
