I bought this inexpensive rental item from our local store. She was near the mint, and I never heard of her. Obviously no one else had one. I can not believe my luck. You are going through the whole world of emotions and trying to get a complex message - the moral and non-triumphal position of the Mandela Party, no doubt. Despite its enormous length (I had to see it in two sessions) - it was like a book I could not put down. Maybe the songs are not so memorable, but the spirit of things shines forever. I can not understand the comments that a musical (clearly designed for the scene) is not realistic! I saw the "South Pacific" and I read the book and can guarantee that the music is not realistic compared to the book. I'll treasure this little discovery until it's out. One day they will again make it on a better budget. <br /> <br />
