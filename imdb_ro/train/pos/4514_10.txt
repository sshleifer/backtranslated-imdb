I recently saw this movie, on a lazy Sunday afternoon, with a friend of mine and we have a lot of fun! This film is a masterpiece of garbage. Try to watch this for this purpose! It was not to be expected, of course, but the performance of the actors (and Alberto Tomba is absolutely the best), the poor scenario and the low budget created an amazing mixture of stupid things. Tomba was retired from alpine skiing, where he was a dominant technical skier in the late 1980s and 1990s. Tomba won three gold medals, two world championships and nine World Cup season titles. Seriously about the director: no one knows why he signed this film Damiano Damiani. All the other directions of Damiani are considerable.
