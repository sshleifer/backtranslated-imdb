I love this movie very much ... when I started to watch it I thought I would get bored pretty soon, but it surprised me ... I thought it was a great movie and I saw it several times now. The characters are credible and I have to say I fell in love with Brian Austin Green everywhere (Beverly Hills 90210 for the first time). I would recommend this movie if you are a fan of it, but I agree with another comment made earlier that the end is a kind of disappointment. I would have liked to give me a little different! It does not matter, however, a good story.
