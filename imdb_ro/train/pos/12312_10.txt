I can not believe a movie that can be done so well in 1987 and virtually unknown in the West. Do not repeat any more reviews here. The score is very good and moves. It literally means "Dawn never comes" - when it comes to, the beautiful ghost and lover will be separated forever. After 24 years, Joel and Leslie still look very good. I liked Joel in God of Gamblers and many Leslie films, including Better Tomorrow.
