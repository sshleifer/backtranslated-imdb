it's a fun fact, I was the baby in the movie, the one in the bed. :) I'm 19 years old now. my parents took me to try for the party, I lived in Texas at that time. I think we just made $ 80 for that, but I have not been in it for a very long time. My parents said I was crying when I was supposed to be happy and would be happy when I had to cry. I was mixed. Actually weird and funny I think .. and I'm not a child actress. I live in San Antonio, I work on an eagle. I graduated here in Texas, but I lived in Maryland most of my life. This movie is a great movie, though a good concept. I've seen it several times in the next 19 years.
