I watched this movie on DVD several times now, the first time, I followed the second half after the clock and then I returned in the first hour. an interesting film, thank God, not kiera knightley in her, refreshing and gives us a true perspective in the difficult life of Queen Victoria and the difficult choices she had to make. Nothing is bad about the movie, no really bad language or something of a sexual nature that would offend the family. Could tell the children to search a little about the queen's victory and probably lesser-known characters such as Conroy and Lord Melbourne
