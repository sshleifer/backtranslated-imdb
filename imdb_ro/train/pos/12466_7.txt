If Jean Renoir's first film, "Whirlpool of Fate," takes us first into the rural world, the rivers, the life of the peasantry that he will continue to explore, it seems that only the second film deals in the highest part of the rich and the privileged, the upper classes and those who try to get up. Put the characters from the first two movies together and you have the seeds of the "Sea of ​​Illusion" and "The Rules of the Game". This movie is beautifully filmed, the room being fully utilized by the amazingly large flats and the areas behind the scenes that dominate the movie's interior, and the action, although frequently overlaid, offers some wonderful moments, especially from Muffat by Werner Krauss. But Mrs. Hessling, full of charm and sentiment, who at first seems to give Louise Brooks a run for her vampire money, never exceeds one note, the selfish portrait. Perhaps this is, in part, a problem with the scenario, which seems to be largely aimed at high points and exaggerated emotions; who have not read the novel, I am not very clear whether the elections were well-done or not. However, the differences between Nana's protagonists are well drawn and I particularly liked the relationship between Muffat and Vandeuvres to Jean Angelo - the tragic comprehension that everyone seems to have about their supreme fate and their mutual sympathy, especially the scene at the base of the enormous ladder where Vandeuvres warns Muffat and we wonder if violence will erupt - this and other discoveries of the ridiculous helplessness give the film the depth it has. Far from his greatest achievement, and probably for me, just a shady total of "Whirlpool of Fate," it's still worth seeing for fans of Renoir or those interested in silent cinema in general.
