I enjoyed this movement very much. I'm convinced that Matt Stone and Trey Parker are the comic geniuses of our time. They have the odd ability to add this level of absurdity to pop culture and make them red, but in a realistic way ... if that makes sense. This is mainly what makes South Park fun. Once you have surpassed the fact that it is probably the most vulgar and indiscreet cartoons ever, you will see in each episode the message that is being transmitted. This is evident in BASEketball. Although directed by David Zucker and is absolutely red, he has a sincere message about corporate America and the shame that is the main sport of the league. I'm also a fan of sport, so I find this fun movie sometimes because it's so true in that bizarre way that people hate to love. The opening prologue is brilliant ... the laughter of laughter is formed every time I see that these players start Riverdance! Some may not like this movie because it's not just a cup of tea for everyone ... but like South Park, once you look over the absurd ... it has an authentic message that is transmitted through genius literally comic books. I gave this movie 8 out of 10 stars.
