He never saw this movie and enjoyed the song and dance of Cagney and other casting members: Dick Powell (Scott Blair), who had a great voice and Ruby Keeler (Bea Thorn). James Cagney plays the role of Chester Kent, who writes musicals and eventually goes into the production of prologues that are featured in feature films featured in the 1930s cinemas. Chester has problems with people who try to steal their ideas for shows its. This is a very fun movie with a lot of comedy and lots of laughs. Joan Blondell (Nan Prescott) gave a great support role, who was also very young and cute. Dick Powell was great as a singer and dancer and just started off with his long and successful career. Enjoy.
