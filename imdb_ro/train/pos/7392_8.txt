I really like this movie. She has a wonderful chemistry among the actors and tells a story that's pretty universal, the prodigal son's story. The look that I enjoy best was the way the bathroom was more than a backdrop for the story. While the father told his son the story of his wife's family in the northern deserts of China, the water and bathing element became an almost sacred ritual. The water was so rare that a simple bath was deep and profoundly understood. Generally, the movie was very effective. However, there have been times when they came close to the "too" sweet ... that is bordering on cloying during the park's recital. But I generally recommend this movie.
