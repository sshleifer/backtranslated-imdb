There is no doubt that Halloween is by far one of the best movies ever, not only in its genre but also outside. I like the atmosphere of creepy movies that the whole thing could happen here, a kind of situation makes it scary to think. if you have ever been in this situation what you would do. This is a movie that I enjoy watching a lot, especially around Halloween time. John Carpenter is a very professional directer i love many other movies of his but not there is no doubt that the best-known movie is Halloween.Oh and if you're thinking about watching Rob Zombie remake don't.It is a pure carp and a true Halloween fan would like John Carpenter version 1978 better . Michael Myers is one of the hottest slayer killers in any movie, and is a very famous one. So, by all means, go see this masterpiece you will really like.
