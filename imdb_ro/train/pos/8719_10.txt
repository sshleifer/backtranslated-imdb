I was amazed by the improvements made in an animated movie. If you stay close to the screen, you will see detail in the grass and surface structures. Details, colors and shading are at least a better order than Toy Story. How they managed to eliminate shading, I will never know. I hope PIXAR will provide a documentary about how the movie was produced so I can find out how all this has been done. Based on this film, I think the animated films of the future will be judged on this film.
