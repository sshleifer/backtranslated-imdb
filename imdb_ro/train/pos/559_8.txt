A good film with - for his time - an intense, stretched, rather dark story that reminds of John Ford's "seekers," though not so brutal. The story begins quickly and is not left behind, with some very good dialogue scenes between Jeff Webster (Stewart), Ronda Castle and Sheriff Gannon. This film resembles in some ways the "Bend of the River" (1952), also a Mann-Stewart, but it seemed much less sentimental and interesting. There are some warnings: a conclusion too fast (and rather sentimental) that ends; Corrine Calvert, 24, is not very convincing as a naive French teenager and, of course, the film takes place in the mythical West, a fabulous field where the real laws of nations and physics do not apply. But these are trivial concerns. James Stewart is surprisingly good as a dark, disengaged man who thinks he cares about no one but himself and the mountain landscape can not be beaten. A beautiful costume of Western costumes.
