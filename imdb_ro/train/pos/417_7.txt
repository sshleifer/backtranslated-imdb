This film has Bill Bill Hickok, Calamity Jane, Buffalo Bill and General Custer together. Gary Cooper plays Wild Bill and Jean Arthur plays Calamity Jane and Charles Bickford plays a bad guy who sells weapons to the Indians and can hardly recover him. This was the first time that Cecil B. DeMille and Gary Cooper worked together, and the next movie was basically the same but settled at a different time. This film begins with Lincoln's assassination and also deals with an Indian war. Calamita Jane is in love with Wild Bill and Buffalo Bill gets married and now wants to stay home. This film also deals with Custer's last stand and is far from being exact. Gary Cooper is as good as usual and I usually do not like Jean Arthur, but I liked it here.
