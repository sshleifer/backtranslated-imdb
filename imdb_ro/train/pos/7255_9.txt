This is not a movie you watch for entertainment, at least most of the people you know are not. It is a portrayal of cruelty both for the body and for the mind that happens in a war quite well, the characters seem plausible, because you read their minds, something more often found in books and rarely in movies, but done very well in this song. I would like to see "All quiet on the west front" and "Die Br√ºcke" in terms of leaving a lasting impression. I would like to introduce him to school, along with the other two films - yet finding a copy was hard enough - which is a shame.
