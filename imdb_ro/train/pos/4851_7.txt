Ghost Train is a wonderful and fun movie, typical of the finest British comedy coolers of the 1930s and 40s. The antics of comedian Arthur Askey is not as fun as it once seemed, but this can be overcome by seeing him as a piece period or curiosity. For a low-budget war production, the Ghost Train is atmospheric, efficient and offers a true suspense. Pleasant fun for a dark night (and, yes, stormy). Lighten up, remove the critic's hat and enjoy.
