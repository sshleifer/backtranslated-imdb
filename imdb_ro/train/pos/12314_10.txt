From time to time, there comes a movie that raises the bar for every other film of its kind. A film of this caliber will influence many movies after its release for years to come. "A story about Chinese ghosts" falls into this category. It is probably one of the best horror films of the 1980s; possibly one of the best ever made. Film makers have created a movie that addresses all horror fans. The story is appealing and original. The villains are threatening and terrifying. The sets are creepy and atmospheric. There is even a small blood and a gorilla to satisfy the house's splash fans. But do not let the 'horror' tag scare you unless you're a fan of the genre. This movie fits easily into several different categories. <br /> <br /> The screenwriter blended dramatic drama, comedy, horror, kung fu and love genres into a luxurious cinematic pizza. "A Ghost Story Chinese" is a beautiful epic love story said fortunately, free of free nudity and / or explicit sex scenes that have destroyed many Hollywood `s love stories. Those rushed by the romantic elements of the story can rest and enjoy the rhythm of swordplay and wire-fu. If this is not enough, actors Leslie Cheung and Wu Ma offer plenty of humorous situations to enjoy your appetite for comedy. This movie offers something for every fan of the movie. <br /> <br /> Director Siu-Tung Ching and producer Tsui Hark assembled a truly amazing cast for this movie. Leslie Cheung proves that he is not just a talented actor, but also a talented singer and a charming physical comedian. I can not think of a different Cheung interpreter who could have better interpreted Ling Choi Sin (except Chow Yun Fat). Joey Wang is delightful as Lit Su Seen, the cruel spirit that steals the heart of Cheung's character. Her portrayal of the title character is truly haunting and memorable. Wu Ma is hilarious as the ardent taoist who helps youngsters in love. <br /> <br /> At the technical level, this film is very impressive, even to today's standards. The direction is superb. I would like today's Hollywood executives to look for talented artists like Siu-Tung Ching, rather to fall back on MTV's usual video or Pepsi commercial executives. The cinema is superb. You have to recompense any cinema that can make a movie look good when most of its pivotal scenes take place during nighttime. The special effect of make-up is top-notch. In fact, most of the effects of this lifetime movie blow away the inferior quality CGI ghouls and gossip that have become a common thing in modern horror films. <br /> <br /> Since its release, "A Ghost Story in China," it has given rise to two worthy sequels, a full-length animated film and countless imitations. None of the films that followed or copied failed to capture the magic of this classic. This movie requires viewing for any fan of horror or just anyone looking for a great way to spend 95 minutes of your time. 10 out of 10. <br /> <br />
