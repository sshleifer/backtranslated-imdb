question: how do you steal a scene from Walther Mathau stereotype expert in full, angry and shining Grumpy Old Man? Answer: quietly, with a lifetime and perfect time, as George Burns does here. I do not know anything about Vaudeville, but it remains a favorite movie, the two leaders are laughable, the funny scenario, the direction and the rhythm really good. Richard Benjamin is very funny as a straight man - trying to get to Burns through the window, etc. Even small pieces are wonderful. There are so many funny scenes, Mathau messes up in advertisements, Burns repeats responds as though the tracks ... <br /> <br /> A delight. <br /> <br /> Enterrrrrr!
