... and the series lets you forget everything. They are about three years older than children in the series. Born in 1958, I learned to lead during the first gas shortage and received my first post-college post during the second gas shortage in 1979. The 1970s were a terrible time to be youth - inflation, - Funny thing is that this series does not ignore any of these things and still manages to make fun for 70 years for those of us old enough to know better. She manages to look straight ahead - while authentic clothing - and yet fills the show with the hope of youth and the things that make high school and high school years both the best moments and the worst. Then there are the parents. The two young lovers in the show - Eric Forman and Donna Pinciotti - really have horrible parents with the best intentions. The parents of Eric, Red, and Kitty are not exactly June and Ward, although I'm the one for the decade. This is what happened when the 60s finally came to the suburbs of the 1970s. Donna's parents are two people waiting for the 1960s to show their entire lives to give them strange legitimacy. Eric Fez's friends, Kelso and Jackie round out the group of nerodinciozity, well understood and snobbish incompetence. Hyde is an unusual teenager for a show about the suburbs, but he is largely someone who has to play the books to which he was divided even when those books are handled by largely absent and negligent parents. I strongly recommend all eight seasons, even if season eight is not delayed due to Eric's absence.
