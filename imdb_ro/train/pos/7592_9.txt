I just finished watching the movie and wanted to give my own opinion (and justice) to the movie. First of all, to get things straight, this film does not claim to be anything but a solid comedy action. It does not intend to revolutionize the cinematographic industry and gain critical appreciation, nor does it want to be considered one. If you really want to enjoy this movie, I suggest you give up your critical mind and your desire for a good plot, because you will not find anything here. That's what we've set, let's continue the movie. We had low expectations for this movie simply because it did not have a strong plot (Yes, filmed, we also underestimated this movie), but I never expected to enjoy this movie so much. I enjoyed even that much more than Stephen Chow's movements (which I found Kung Fu Hustle to be his best effort, and I would also have rated 9). The action is tight and epic, while the comedy presses on the right places. SPOILERS alert, I think the action might be unreal, but why would I want to watch a serious basketball anyway? There are many other sports movies (drama) that have already done well, why create another? SPOILERS END <br /> <br /> I do not even know why you read this. Go and look at it. Just remember, just watch, enjoy, smile, laugh, and from time to time (the cinema industry) create masterpieces such as Pulp Fiction or The Godfather movies that are better in the dump pile. I'm not saying that Kung Fu Dunk deserves the recognition that previous examples have again, if we talk about Stephen Chow-ish's comedy, this is a top ten. Highly recommended if love: - no good-action brainer movies - Kung Fu - Trance Thieves - Kung Fu and comedy - what the hell, watch this. you will have a wonderful time. <br /> <br /> 9/10 for you the cast of Kung Fu Dunk. ^ _ ^
