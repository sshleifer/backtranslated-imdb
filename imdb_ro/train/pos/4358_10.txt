Okay, this movie is probably worth 7 out of 10 stars, but I voted for "10" to help offset the deceptive rating from a handful of boso who gave this movie zero or 1 review. Each of the segments for this anthology presents great potential and promise to talented producers ... three of them have continued to gain a notable success in early Hollywood productions. The performances range from rough to impressive, with notable changes made by Bill Paxton, James Karen, Vivian Schilling and Brion James. Martin Kove can be a great melodrama as a psychotic hypnotist with a bizarro stroboscopic lamp, and Lance August seems deliberately diminished as an unsuspected laboratory victim. But on the whole, they have a few laughs and really scary moments. It is certainly worth seeing, so judge for yourself!
