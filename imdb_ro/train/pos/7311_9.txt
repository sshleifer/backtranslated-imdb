Halloween is a movie that I have to go out and watch every time that day is. I really watch sometimes when it's not the feast !!! This movie is so great. Jay Lee Curtis is an actress I can never stop loving. This movie might be old, but the story line makes me meet every time, and the acting was absolutely fantastic! Although I have not seen the remake, I already feel it was TOTAL useless. I think Rob Zombie I have never remodeled such a classic. What kills me, however, is to know that there are people who have seen the remake without even hearing the original. I'm angry just to think !!!!!! it was wonderful and will always be remembered in history as a classic.
