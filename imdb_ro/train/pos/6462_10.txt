I will not destroy the contents of anyone who has not yet seen this humorous masterpiece by Kay Pollak. A famous conductor played by Michael Nyqvist seeks peace of mind, moving into childhood village. The villagers, who followed the genius silently, slowly tried to share his glory. Each role in this film has a very specific purpose and has remarkable potential in each of the actors playing their own string in short but precise words, a symphony of love. Not love in the sense of the relationship, but in the tone of spirit deeply buried in each of the characters, each revealing their own story, needs, skeleton, desires, and more. I will not forget to mention the two main parts of Frida Hallgren and Michael Nyqvist, whose plays play in unforgettable harmonies of emotion. They touch each other with a pain in their own inability to love themselves. Michael Nyqvist is really trying here in a very difficult configuration, in one of those movies that either ends up catastrophic or fantastic. And fantastic has gone from the beginning to the end, not a second less or more than enough, you have left with a feeling of change and a taste for more. So far, certainly one of the best movies I had the pleasure to watch.
