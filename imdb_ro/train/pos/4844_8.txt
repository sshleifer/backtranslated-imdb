One of my favorite movies I saw the first time I was 10 years old, which probably tells you a lot about the type of humor. Although dated, humor definitely has a charm in this regard. Expect to see the popular Askey & Murdoch banker so popular in his days, with lots of interesting, strange co-characters. The lady with the parrot, the couple who must marry and are in difficulty from "her", and my favorite, the master, "No one knows where it comes from ... no one knows where it goes." Interestingly, the phantom train was written by Arnold Ridley from the fame of the Dads (Private Godfrey the Physician) Watch it on an afternoon rainy afternoon after lunch and smile.
