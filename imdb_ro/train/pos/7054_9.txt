I thought this movie was much better than most critics who gave it credit. Although it has the confusing parts of the plot, it does not interfere very much with the understanding of the film. That said, if you are open to more liberal political ideas, then perhaps this is not the film for you. I thought all the actors in the movie were remarkable. Each character has funny moments, and the audience at the Tribeca Film Festival laughed all along. I thought satire was a bit over your head in a certain area, but this is done intentionally. John Cusack is right that, although set in the future, even make you see this.
