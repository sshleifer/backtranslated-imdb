I've read a number of reviews about this movie and I have to say, "What's wrong with you!" This was an excellent movie! I thought this movie was gorgeous from start to finish and the story was extremely well said. I am convinced that people who did not like this film did not pay special attention to the film. There are a number of very important scenes that, if you do not pay attention, will be confused, and the following scenes may not make sense. I urge anyone who did not like this movie to look at it again and watch it alone so you can really pay attention to it. The story made me a perfect sense and, as I said, it was very well said. Every scene in the movie has one point and everything fits together at the end of the movie. All the actors did a fantastic job! Sean Connery was very good in his role as always. Laurence Fishburne was great as Tanny Brown, playing a very interesting character. Kate Capshaw was also a pleasant touch and looks great. Blair Underwood was a nice surprise, I did not expect anything great from him, but he did a great performance. Ed Harris was the real jewel of the movie. He plays a really sick individual and makes you see how disturbed his character is. Watch his eyes in his scenes, just great! There's also a very young Scarlett Johansson (as Kate) in one of his first roles ... it's not a bad place to start. Excellent cast in this movie! I would strongly recommend this movie to anyone I like any of the cast members or just like thrillers. This is a great movie and must be seen. Do not listen to the opinions of others, see the movie and get to your own conclusions. I hope you see the movie and I hope you will enjoy as much as I do. Thank you for reading, chris
