When a small town is threatened by a murderer, a policeman drives after him pretending to be his friend. As she becomes more and more emotionally involved with the killer, her psyche begins to play, causing her to lose focus on the work of catching the murderer. It's not a high-tension excitement film, but a solid police work and a good description of the failing mind of a psychotic loser.
