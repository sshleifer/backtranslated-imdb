Launched two years before my birth, this Oscar-winning film has all of the Technicolor settings and costumes, a breathtaking cinema, wall-to-wall Gershwin music, a high choreography, an easier scenario than air, Kelly, Levant, Foch, Guitar and Caron. Hollywood does not do that anymore. Definitely, this is my favorite film of all time, a standard by which I judge all the other films. Enjoy, enjoy!
