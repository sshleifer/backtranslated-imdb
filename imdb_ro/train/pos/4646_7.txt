I did not know what to do from this movie. I think that's what it was about. I have never seen a movie like this and I doubt I will come back again. Glover puts together something unique for him. I think we appreciate having to read some of his poetry, maybe one of his shows. I really like this guy, it's so bizarre I can not help him. Note: We've seen this movie before it's through the final editing, so maybe what we saw and what others saw was different. You know, I think, if I choose to see the movie again. I think I'm going to have to be properly influenced by drugs ...
