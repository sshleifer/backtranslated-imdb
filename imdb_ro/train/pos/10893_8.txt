It's a good thing I rented the movie before seeing the ratings of the viewers on this site. It was a great movie that I will add to my Christmas selection. The cast was great, and Ben Affleck plays a leading role. I would tell viewers who did not see the movie go ahead and buy it. I'm evaluating it right there with the Christmas holiday. The film was very funny and well written, and Ben plays the rich eccentric executive very well. The things he says and does is how I would imagine a person with too much money to act. The movie is much more fun than Santa and Christmas with the Kranks. In addition, it has a good story line and learns the true meaning of Christmas, which is that you can not buy love with money.
