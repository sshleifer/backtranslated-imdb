Just Cause takes some of the best parts of the three movies, Cape Fear, A Touch of Evil and Silence of the Mouses and mix it together to come up with a good thriller of a movie. Sean Connery is a liberal law professor, married to former District Deputy Prosecutor Kate Capshaw, and is a cruiser against capital punishment. Blair Underwood's grandfather, Ruby Dee, finds Connery at a conference and convinces him to handle his nephew's appeal. He was dying for killing a young girl. When Connery arrives in this rural Florida countryside, she faces a difficult Sheriff played by Laurence Fishburne, who is equally ruthless in solving the crime that Orson Welles was in contact with evil. Later, after Connery receives the verdict left with the evidence he has discovered, he feels pretty good about himself. At that moment, the film takes a decisive decision from Touch of Evil to Cape Fear. To say that it's not what it seems to be easy to say. The tower is evenly transformed into some good performances. Especially reminded of Ed Harris who interprets Hannibal Lecter as a deadly serial killer with Underwood. He will make you crawl and begin to make Connery rethink some of the comfortable liberal premises on which he has based his beliefs. Many confirmed liberals, which I know, came out of thinking quite differently once they became victims of the crime. Of course, the reverse is just as true. Many laws and conservative orders, if ever involved in the wrong end of the criminal justice system, want to ensure that all his rights are indeed guaranteed. Criminal justice is not a goal, it is a process and one that never ends with that for the whole of society. I think if Just Cause has a morality that would probably be.
