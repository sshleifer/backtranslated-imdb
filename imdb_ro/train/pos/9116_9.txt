The idea is a very clever title, the film has a serious language in the sense of humor. But it is so subtle that you do not know how to read it! These guys are making a comedy full of souls or something else is happening. The little dialogue the movie has is not very delicate and this adds to the power of the movie. If all the sound was off of the movie, it would not take anything from the movie. Physical actions or the art of showing are so strong that, of their own responsibility, they contain the story. <br /> <br /> I am a blessing and with blessing the emotion is followed by shame. I first say this film as part of a "black" film festival. After watching the movie, I was so impressed with the work. But then I wondered what next? Where can someone else see this work? The common art association with no purpose is not here. You can see the design intent from start to finish. Using the African style music pouring everything seems planned and for some reason. Character development is amazing. I think casting is the most powerful aspect of the film; the characters are easy to define in 2 minutes of the 6 minutes of the real movie. We have to see more of these films, there really has to be more support for the development of short films along the board.
