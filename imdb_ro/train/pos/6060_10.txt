This is a great documentary documentary. Any car racing fan should have a copy of this remarkable movie. Director Stephen Low has done a great job, as well as the main film stars, father and son, Mario & Michael Andretti. The DVD looks and sounds amazing. And best is IMAX! Disc test for home theater.
