It's been a while since I watched this LOTR. Currently, I'm hunting a copy for purchase. Bakshi's activity is quite true for the original work. Visual are engrosing and sometimes haunting. Drawbacks? Occasionally, the movie is confused or muddled. There is one or two times where the story slows down to a crawl. But on the whole - buy this movie. It's great for kids, adults and collectors.
