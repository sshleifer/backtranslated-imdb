Otto Preminger's movie Dana Andrews's movie is among the most undiscovered (mostly) jewelry of the genre. Because they do not have paranoia, misogyny or hysteria, it would seem that they did not happen at the time, but the clear eye image, the complex game with identity, masculinity and representation, the subversion of traditional psychological traditions, the austere and geometric style seems astonishing today modern and very similar to Melville. The lucid ironies of this film are so busy, brutal and ironic that the "happy" ending is one of the most crucial in Hollywood history. Brilliant entertainment thriller level, also tense, and packed with double-edge dialogue.
