This movie has a lot of comedy, not dark and Gordon Liu shines in this. He shows his comic side and it was really strange to see him beat. His training is "unorthodox" and who would have thought the knot binding could be so dead? Many stunts and choreographies. Very creative! Add Johnny Wang to the mix and you have a wonderful final surprise! Do not rush with the guys at Manchu; I am ruthless!
