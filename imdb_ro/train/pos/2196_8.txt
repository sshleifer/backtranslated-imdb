... so what happens in those 10 minutes gone that were so horrible that they had to remove them from the original movie? I was three years in the production code of the movie ... Barbara Stanwyck starred in the original track, but here, Carole Lombard plays Maggie King. Co-star Fred MacMurray is probably best known for "Double Indemnity," with Stanwyck, as well as his television show "Three My Sons". Be careful for a young Dorothy Lamour (Bob Hope) and the fabulous Franklin Pangborn, who has prepared almost every film on tape. Of course, he works in the beauty salon on the ship! Add the sublime Charles Butterworth and Anthony Quinn. Good time and smart banter at first. Maggie Ella's friend is played by Jean Dixon, who was best friend in "Holiday" and "My Godfrey Man." In "Swing High," Maggie Tours meets a soldier leaving the army. Maggie loses his boat when he leaves the port and gets confused with the soldier. Quinn, with 20 elements, has a small scene at the local bar in Panama where Johnson (MacMurray) played the trumpet. Maggie, Harry (Butterworth) and the band Skid together and are trying to figure out how to get back to the United States. Some good songs by Lamour. Good (but short) performance by Cecil Cunningham as "Murph" wise, Panama's local salon owner. While others complained about how bad it was, it was not so terrible and it was even a little exotic, with Central America's fake location for the first half of the movie.
