This was the first Walking Tall movie I've seen, I believe in a $ 2 cinema along Hollywood Blvd, so I had no reference to Joe Don Baker's first installment. I remember being shocked by McNairy's corrupt system and the brutality of "redhead gangs." I was also amazed that a man decided he would not let her slip and went out to do something. Brave? I thought so - at a point where I sent my trembling around the spine. I think this movie is a great story about the American courage to get up and do something about a system that just serves its interest. I was pretty blown, and I think this is still one of the best hero / anti-hero movies that could laugh, but includes recent movies such as "The Punisher," but even more because it's a true story. The recent remake of "Rock" does not make any justice for the real fire in Buford Pusser's story. A "classic" that I'm sure will resume again in the future.
