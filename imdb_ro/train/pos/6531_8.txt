I really enjoyed this movie ... it was cute. I liked it, but if you did not, it's your fault. Emma Roberts played a good Nancy Drew, even if it's not enough like the cards. Old-fashioned models are weird when you see them in modern times but look good on them. For me rich girls did not have costumes to make them look rich. I mean, they seem to have taken all their clothes-at a garage store, and they just decided to put it all together. All the costumes were sticky, especially when they wore the usual costumes. I do not want to make the movie look bad, because it certainly was not! Just go to the theater and watch it! You will enjoy it!
