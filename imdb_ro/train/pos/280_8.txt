Undying is a very good game that brings some new elements to the tired genre of the first person shoot em ups. Patrick Galloway's story is an expert of the occult fighter and of a formidable fighter who is summoned by a friend to his property in Ireland to investigate strange fainters. The game is set in Ireland after the First World War, so do not expect to find weapons like chainguns or rocket launchers. All weapons in the game can be considered antiquities, but the real fun in the game is its spells and the system it operates. Our hero is ambidextrous, so he can use both hands at the same time: he throws spells with his right arm and uses his weapons with the left. So you can shoot and spells at the same time, which, as you understand very fun and also unique to this game! The graphics are excellent and can work very well on average P.C power. The level design is also cool and atmospheric. For the most part, the game revolves around the covenant complex and the mansion, but there are many other places waiting to be discovered while you are progressing. Thanks to Clyve Barker's talent, the game has an excellent story and a plot (something very rare for a first person shooter) and I said before a great and very frightening atmosphere, the acting voice is also good but not excellent. But the game has two main flaws. First, it is quite linear, so when your mission says, for example, go to that room, all the doors in the house will be locked apart from those that lead to your mission room, this can save you time , but it restricts your freedom to explore. Second, the fact that all weapons are antiques may not appeal to most fps players who are accustomed to high-tech weapons. In terms of difficulty, the game is very well balanced. Most of it is difficult, but sometimes it becomes more difficult, but not difficult. In general, undying is a great game. Surely one of the best cps there.
