Cliffhanger is a decent crime crime adventure with some flaws from director Renny Harlin, whose admiration to make this film about an expert mountaineer who has been taken hostage with a friend by a band of dangerous criminals looking for some cases costume full of stolen money Stancosi Mountains. Sylvester Stallone is impressive as Gabe Walker, the specialist climber, especially in the action / battle sequences, but some of them certainly fall on the unrealistic line. For the sake of the film, though I want to stop my unbelief. Other distributors, including John Lithgow, Michael Rooker, Janine Turner, Rex Linn, Caroline Goodall, and Leon are respected as supporting characters in the film. The sequences of action / battle are well executed, but as mentioned above, some are not very realistic, no matter how hard you are. The climbing sequences, however, are very well done because instead of making the whole movie in a studio somewhere, the locations they chose have felt very real, and the Ariel views of the mountain ranges are wonderful, adding a touch of the reality of the film. Deaths are inventive, while others are somewhat predictable. The villains are solid, but it would have been better if they had to focus on a more central one instead of having a lot of them. The pacing of the movie was a bit sluggish, but the good overpowers the evil in it. If you're a big fan of Harlins or Stallone, then the chances are you'll enjoy it too. Cliffhanger generally has character development, with enough action, drama, suspense, excitement, emotions, and good cast performance that make this movie worth the time to watch.
