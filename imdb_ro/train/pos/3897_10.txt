This video was my first exposure to Eddie Izzard. I had more friends in one night, and for one reason or another I had channel-surfed at HBO during the evening. Someone named "Eddie Izzard" was on. I tried not to laugh at the first few jokes. I did not want to be "responsible" for the rest of the group's joy of something that had killed me, of course. Having kept my laugh more than she was healthy, I let go - like the rest of us (we were not stoned, by the way, we're not talking about insurance and pensions ...). We were asphyxiated afterwards. The story lines, the plot, the bizarre and ingenious links throughout the sketches are not brilliant at all. Since then, I've been addicted to Eddie-Izzard's every comedy piece that I can take. His work is an absolute genius. His comedy is effortless. It seems rather that the hysterical funny friend who comes to your house and complains about it or the fact that ... It is convulsively funny. It gives you the impression that the joke is between you and yourself, the only real fans of humor, after all. If you are disappointed with this video, you have no sense of penultimate humor - or humor, as the UK says.
