During the night of opening the Vanities a woman is found dead on the podium above the stage. As the show continues, the police try to separate what killed who and why before the final curtain. I have always heard that this was a great mystery of classical comedy, so I was delighted to find a copy. Unfortunately, nobody told me about the continuing and continuing musical numbers. While the numbers are surely the guy Hollywood did in their days of glory, they become intrusive, because they stop pretty much the film despite attempts to link the action around them. This would not be so bad if the music was half decent, but it is not. There is only one good song. Worse, as if the studio knew it had a song, Cocktails for Two, and we are forced to survive four versions: a duet, a large number of production, as Vanities finals, and in the background as incidental music. I do not think Spike Jones and City Slickers have ever played so much. The rest of the movie is pretty good with Victor McLaglen fighting nicely with Jack Oakie. Charles Middleton is very funny is his scenes as an actor in love with the cabinet mistress. With no essential clue, I can recommend this if you think you can get through the music numbers or are willing to scan through them. It's a fun movie about the way I do nothing.
