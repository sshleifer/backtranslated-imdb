"A little silly from time to time, it is cherished by the wisest people." If you are too smart to watch this movie then you are too smart to be alive. <br /> <br /> Wonderful adventure, great premise, a timepiece with a careful eye for details. Walter Matthau, Meg Ryan, Tim Robbins - and al - just great! <br /> <br /> Rent it, sit down, relax, take it, smile a little. Feel good. <br /> <br /> Then, thank you.
