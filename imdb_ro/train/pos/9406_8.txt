Other commentators have detailed the parcel and social parables and comments (or better) that I could, but I would like to join my admiration for this gem of a movie. She is very well, more than 50 years later in every category - script, acting, photography, scenic design, sound design ... really is a classic one. This was my first exposure to the "young" Alec Guinness, and it is obvious from the first cadres what made him so special that he eventually received a knight. <br /> <br /> I only have a rate of "8" because it is basically a fairly easy parable that examines human nature but does not really whip it; and because the plot takes the easiest way to the end, rather than actually solving the conflict between the inventor and the workers and industrialists who follow him all over the city. Also, a few minutes of thinking reveal the basic flaw in the logic of the scenario - wear and tear is almost impossible the determining factor in the purchase of new clothes (especially clothing clothing); children grow up, people change size, gain and lose weight, and go with the latest ways all the time and have as long as the fabrics have a woven fabric. And if nothing else, the manufacturer would make a fortune to provide indestructible materials for military uniforms (especially BDUs). <br /> <br /> However, this is a great movie. If you have a chance to see it on a classic movie channel, you should.
