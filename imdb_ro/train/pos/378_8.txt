These days, Spielberg's "The Purple Color" is mostly remembered for being nominated for eleven Oscars and winning. What is even more alarming is that Spielberg himself was not even nominated for the best director. Undoubtedly, the filmmakers deserved more recognition than they were awarded. The story relates to the trials and troubles of Celie Johnson (Whoopi Goldberg), an African-American woman dominated by her incest father and then by her abusive husband. The film stretches over several years and focuses mainly on Celie's relationships with the women around her. It's a very feminine perspective, but you do not have to worry about a "fiction" of sugar. The story is interesting, renewed with humor, although the central character's battles are primordial. Some can not appreciate the change of tone towards the end of the movie, but I did not bother, even if a similar content in a smaller movie would likely overturn my eyes. The film received three Oscar nominations for action: Whoopi Goldberg (Best Actress), Oprah Winfrey (Best Supporting Actress) and Margaret Avery (Best Supporting Actress). I think Goldberg and Winfrey definitely deserved and Danny Glover was unconsciously rigid. As I have already mentioned, Spielberg did not receive a nomination for the best director for his efforts. Such an omission required faith, since Spielberg's direction is of prime importance. I'm not crazy about Quincy Jones's score, but it's not under the media in any way. Ultimately, the story is a satisfactory, well-told by a film master who works from Pulitzer Winning Materials. Give it a try and you'll probably be as confused as I am about how it could be so badly treated in the Oscar night.
