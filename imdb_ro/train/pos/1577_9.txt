SPOILS WITHIN. It seems that von Trotta was much happier with what the balance of the personal story versus the history of the events was than in her earlier film Versprechen, Das (1995). The direction seemed carefully controlled, and I felt it was extremely appealing - especially when it was about the visual narrative (the mixture of title and succession and the lighting of a new candle in the modern era commemorating the death of different characters in the past). To clarify two points that many people have confused about: <br /> <br /> First of all, Lena did not sleep with Goebbels. Though this seemed implicit, it was not the intention. Von Trotta told me that! (And she is a very beautiful lady, by the way!) Secondly, the time period of the events was, in fact, accurate from the historical point of view (the real data are shown near the memorial) and the prisoners were released the same suddenly as in the movie. There is evidence that Goebbels was annoyed by the fact that he did so and that he had planned to eventually recover the ones he had released. Generally, what impressed me most was that it was an original story of the "over-mobile age." It seems to be a shame that it took so long (for various reasons) this movie to hit our screens. More, please, Margarethe!
