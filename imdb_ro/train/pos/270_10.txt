I have to say, Seventeen & Missing is much better than I expected. The perception that we took from the previews was that it would be bad, but I was pleasantly surprised by this impressive mystery. Dedee Pfeiffer is Emily, a mother who insists her daughter Lori (Tegan Moss) does not attend the so-called graduation party in a week, but Lori ignores her mother's wishes and anyway she goes to the party. When Lori does not return home, Emily knows something is wrong and she starts to have visions of her daughter and the events that led to her disappearance. Seventeen & Missing is better than so many other television movies this type because it's not so predictable. Pfeiffer is the reason why this film is seen, and most of it is believed to be credible. This Original LMN movie premiered last night. 10/10
