I just found IMDb and I was looking for this movie and I was almost moved to tears by the comments of everyone who saw this movie as we did at the age of 6 in 1967? I saw it before the Jungle book, so I was Eagle Boy for a few hours and then Mowgli for the next year.

When we got home, we had a chicken frying dinner and got the desired bone and I guess who I'd like to be? My father then said, "I bet you wanted to be an eagle" and, of course, we all know that desires are broken if someone guess so much tears and little resentment to this day that he has failed to fly ...
