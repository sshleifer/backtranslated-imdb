I often wondered how much it was intended for the children ... with all the problems that are around its identity (in this film we realize that he is the spirit of a dead child because his house is a cemetery plot) as well as the disturbing message of this particular movie. Perhaps Casper was rather a piece of morality, or the famous studios felt like bringing a new land in cartoons of "reality." GOOD BUNA TONIGHT is a well-animated project - no doubt. But the development of the plot that involves the fox (who becomes a friend of Casper, but encounters a tragic end) is a concern. Casper's image of mourning is rather graphic and worrying for the children (though the outcome gives a happy ending, but I will not end) and the violence is quite steep, even for the 1940s. <br /> <br / > It could be a good cartoon for parents to use to explain the death of children - but I would not send it to the video camera for a cartoon break.
