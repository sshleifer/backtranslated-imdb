Yeah, it's a chicken shot and it's moving pretty slowly, but it's actually pretty good - and I'm a man of man. You have to love Judy Davis, no matter what it is in, and the girl who plays her daughter offers a natural and compelling performance. The landscape of the small summer place on the coast is beautiful and plays well with the main theme of the film. The actors and unknown actors (at least unknown) offer a realism to the movie that attracts and keeps attention. Generally, I give her 8/10. Go see.
