Surprised to see the low enough score for this movie. I just saw this movie for the first time in 10 years and I was reminded of why I like it. Come back with me, kids, at a time when Michael Keaton was a type of straight comedy, and you could find joy in this movie. It's a gentle comedy - the guy that Ron Howard specializes - but if that's your job, you should check this out. "Gung Ho" is a bit dated, because it takes place in the last stage of the pre-global economic world, when the country where a business is still important. That says it offers laughter as well as a lesson about how people can learn from each other for a special benefit. You can watch this movie and enjoy it without remembering one scene especially you like it very much, but that's because the whole movie offers a slow but constant flow of laugh. It's like an I.V. drop. And I want to say this in a good way.
