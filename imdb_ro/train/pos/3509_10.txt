I've seen this movie once more back and it's still in the top of my favorite movie list. It's amazing to put together and what really makes the movie are detailed bits (such as "Cafe Bustelo" coffee box being reused as a cup of her grandchildren's hair) that people do not see because you DO NOT UNDERSTAND THIS MOVIE If you're not Spanish. This is just one of the films that are specific and specific to culture. Please do not bash this movie if you have no prior knowledge of what the foundation is built on. I fully see what was written by the screenwriter / director and he hit the perfect target! This movie deserves a better rating.
