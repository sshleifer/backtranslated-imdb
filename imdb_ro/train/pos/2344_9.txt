I'm one of those people who usually watch programs and keep my feelings about a private show. However, Pushing Daisies is my exception. I became curious about the program of the commercials that broadcast and who gave a look at the premise of the show. I was skeptical at first, especially after the final of Six Feet Under was still in my head. Here we are again, I thought. I followed the first, second, third and all other episodes. Wow! First of all, I thought he had taken the subject of death and was presented in a way that was tasty without being morbid. The characters had hired and I loved Ned's thought that the main character was not able to literally touch the love of his life, Chuck without the consequences of her death. Most characters have a desire for things they can not have. Besides Ned and Chuck, Olive is waiting for Ned. Lily and Vivian are waiting for their niece. Chuck and Emerson always long for the monetary rewards of the mysterious death he's resolving. I think the characters are perfect and credible. I like how Emerson, who is black, falls from the rest of the characters, since he is an African American; I like the subtle cultural humor that sometimes comes from him. Generally, this visual fairytale is one of the most valuable entertainment tracks I've seen since the 2007 season. I think the show has plenty of romance for the romantics and enough who did it for the smell of the mystery. I just want the writers to come back to work so the show can continue to evolve.
