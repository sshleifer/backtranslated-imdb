I liked this movie and, after watching them, they made me wonder how many "Caitlin Rose's" exist in the world. How many other girls have been subjected to this kind of sexual abuse and tormented by classmates and have been too scared open their mouths about it? How dangerous and cruel can teenagers be to each other, as, as this film shows, whoever is right is not primarily important, the one who is popular and feared who manipulates the minds of young people and influences them to allow this kind of immorality to happen. Tiffani Amber Thiessen offers strong performance as a victim of rape, and Brian Austin Green is convincing that the man torn between the girl he thought he loved his best friend. This is the kind of film that does not get exposure deserves. Remarkable and brilliant, too good to be just a movie made for television.
