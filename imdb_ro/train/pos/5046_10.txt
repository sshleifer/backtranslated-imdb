There is such garbage on the cable film channels that I hit a jewel with it. From the beginning to the end I was caught and deserved top marks. The father of two sons hears messages from "God" to kill people who are told they are "demons". <br /> <br /> When the opening credits showed the director as one of the casts that can often be a warning of a bad movie; Exceptionally, it is inversely here, while drama is non-stop from beginning to end. And there is no moment in the movie when one is not totally excited because there are no unnecessary or unnecessary plots, and the script is first class. <br /> <br /> All actors offer convincing performances especially the main actor who is exceptional. <br /> <br /> This movie is at least as good as "The Silence of the Lambs."
