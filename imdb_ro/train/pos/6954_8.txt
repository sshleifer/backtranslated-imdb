This movie was one of the funniest movies I've seen over the years and laughs with the audience I support. Since my Greek Greek wedding (2002), laughter has been so spontaneous and intense. It is easy to complicate that Mr. And Mrs. Smith (2005) last year using parody (spying on Mr. and Mrs. Smith and sex in Super Ex-Girlfriend). Ivan Reitman's director, the balance between comedy and drama, between mad and deceptive, is great. Never shock and serious graves create the rules of comedy. At the same time, this predictable romantic comedy never loses touching emotional elements, even if the end is broadcast in advance. In some ways, it's so obvious that it's great to see how it's played. Just as in real life, sometimes the truth is so obvious that it can not really be seen. Eight of ten stars are classified there with Tootsie (1982). Perhaps a new one (depends on how it appears in the second view).
