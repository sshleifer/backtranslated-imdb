I just managed to understand the Celestial 3 DVD region of the Five Venoms and what super-service they made of it. A remarkable digital digital transfer and a necessity for any of Kung Fu fans. The story is quite straightforward and has already been mentioned, so I will not go into it anymore. Needless to say, it's the battle scenes that many buy for film and do not disappoint. The only problem is that there are few and they are far from being repeated. Bruce Lee could take these things and drink a cup of tea at the same time! All the blows and strokes come with all the important clicks of the "type writer" and "whooshes" of air, which is a cool, though funny effect! I gave this movie a B +. Good, but not great. Somehow I feel it could have been a bit better. Golden Swallow, by the same director a decade earlier, had a good story and better action.
