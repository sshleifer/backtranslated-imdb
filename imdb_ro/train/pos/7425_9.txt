Barbra Streisand is a tour of force in this Hollywood story. Her performances and songs are unique and are special in great movie theaters. The scene in which she was presented to the public unexpectedly by Kristopherson, against the wishes of the crowds and her, only to transform them through her magnificent spectacle "Woman on the Moon" is one of the best examples of the film about how great a great the performer can win over an audience. It's real. The scene in which Evergreen rank with the best of business ... all live, do not stick-sync, very special. Streisand is often criticized for being a Diva, but she offers this. She sang most majestic "More attention to you" She deserved the Oscar she and Paul Williams won for Evergreen, and Kristopherson also had his moments, well above most of her appearances. one of 1937 (Janet Gaynor, Frederic March), although I will always enjoy the musical remake of Judy Garland and James Mason in 1954. I have not seen the DVD yet and I do not know about its quality.
