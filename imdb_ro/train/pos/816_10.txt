First of all, I would like to say that although I know my part about star wars, I'm not a fanatic. I do not know how many chromosomes a Wamp rat or the extended family of TK427. what I know is this: star wars, all the movies (except for Episode 2 though), captured something magical. it's hard to say what, Lucas button found and boldly pressed, but it works. Star Wars is more than just a movie. is an idea. How, can you ask? I will explain. the warrior stars reach the most universal stereotype, good vs evil. do so so obviously so deep that literally any person in any environment can understand. Episode VI does well, ending the epic struggle between a son and his father used and manipulated, but with the addition of prequel, reveals even more the story behind. Suddenly Darth Vader is in front and the audience understands that it's about Anakin's story, not just about Luke. but just before 1-3, there was an amazing depth to everything. it felt real, as if the capsule had fallen from the sky in Lucas's lap, detailing a history of a galaxy far away. Star Wars is definitely a little over-normative and I have to admit, whenever I see it, especially on it, I feel very small. I feel like I was pushed into a world where good and evil are so clearly defined. I have a feeling of tingling when I see them, a feeling that something, in a way, touched me more than any physical thing could ever be scared.
