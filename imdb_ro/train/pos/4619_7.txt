First of all, I'm a big fan of 80's and Jennifer Conelly's films. So yesterday I got lost in a local bookshop / movie store and found a VHS copy. I read the back and sounded good for $ 3.99, it was a good deal. So I took it home and pushed it into the video camera. What a sweet movie! At my age, I mean more films like Last Night or St. Elmo Fire, but I still remember how you would be 15/16 and in love with an older guy, etc. we are younger. And if it does not work, we're stuck and we think we'll never get over that. But, of course, we do. Many times. It's that kind of sweet quality I got from this movie. The feeling of "Oooh! I remember when something like this happened to me ..." is all through him. Characters are interesting and well developed. I recommend it to everyone who likes 80s movies, teenage movies, or anyone who just wants to come back and remember a simpler moment in their lives.
