It's a slasher colored film. It's about that. It has the mysterious element that SCREAM has made so popular in slasher films, but I never care about such things. The fact that who is the bad guy is not so interesting, since the clues are misleading anyway. Scenes of death were inventive and gorey, bringing memories of horror films of 80 years, like Friday, 13. Another nice thing about this movie is that it's hard to give it the face of the surviving girl, unlike SCREAM and IKWYDLS where it was obvious. <br /> <br /> People who do not like slash movies will not like this movie. Just like that. I really enjoyed it and I'm going to watch it again while waiting more than that. <br /> <br />
