Big voices, an adventure and clever dialogue make this movie a very good movie. Adding the "character" to the three lead animals gives the story much deeper and more meaningful, especially the relationship between the older man, Shadow and the young hellraiser, Chance. Previous versions of this movie could not give the animals any personality or real reason, which is perfect here. Sally Field is full of love in everything but really shines in this movie as a proud feline, Sassy. The great contrast between dog and dog's outlook on life and just the right amount of warmth and spirit to make the plot and the excellent resolution. There is even an uplifting score and a beautiful mountain scenery. Perfectly perfect for a single evening or with children. Disney hats.
