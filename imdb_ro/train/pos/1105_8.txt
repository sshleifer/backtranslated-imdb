Residents of Manhattan's flats have to come up with all sorts of inconveniences. The worst is the lack of cabinet space! Some people who eat all the time use their ranges and dishwashers as warehouses because cabinets are already full! Melvin Frank and Norman Panama, a great team of comedic writers of that era, saw the potential of Eric Hodgins Roman, whose hero, Jim Blandings, can not resist the narrow apartment, where he and Muriel's wife and two daughters have to share. Jim Blandings, a Madison Ave. executive, had it! When he sees an ad for life in Connecticut, he decides to take a look. Obviously, an owner for the first time, Jim is deceived by the real estate agent to buy the dilapidated house, which is taken to be inspected by a rogue agent. This is just the beginning of its problems. <br /> <br /> Anything may be wrong, it goes wrong. The architect is asked to come up with a plan that does not work for the new home after the original was destroyed. Since one problem leads to another, more money is needed and all that will be the initial cost ends in a bloated price that Jim does not allow. The movie is fun because of three principles in it. Cary Grant was an actor who clearly understood the character he was playing and redeemed Jim Blandings. Myrna Loy, was a delightful actress who always played with Mr. Grant. The third character, Bill Cole, an old boyfriend of Myrna, turned into a lawyer at Blandings, is suave and dishonest, as Melvin Douglas played it. One of the girls in Blandings, Joan, is played by Sharyn Moffett, who had a similar resemblance to Eva Marie Saint. Grand Louise Beavers plays Gussie, but he does not have much to do. The film is photographed dear to James Wong Howe, who knew clearly what to do to make this movie look much better. The H.C. Potter is light and succeeded in this movie that will delight fans of classic comedies.
