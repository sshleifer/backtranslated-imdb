After the world of the sitcom with "Father Ted" Arthur Matthews and Graham Linehan's next creation was a forgotten BBC jewelry called "Hippies" Although created by the pair - the six scripts were written only by Arthur Matthews. br /> Located in London in 1969 - Ray Purbs, a hippy, is the editor of an anarchist magazine. His friends are his teammate, very poorly stretched and smoker cannabis Alex, "his girlfriend" is feminist Jill and not too bright Hugo. Simon Pegg was gorgeous as Ray, but he's superb in everything inside. This sitcom has a sense of "Citizen Smith" about it. Ray was very similar to Wolfie Smith, trying to beat society, but unsuccessfully. Finally, this sitcom will be released on DVD in March, I can not wait to buy it. As it was in 1999 and has been repeated on terrestrial television - my memories are not very good on the sitcom, yet I remember two really clear episodes, the first one opening the "Protestant Hippies" that I thought was a beginning good - if Ray goes on a protest against the sandpaper and the other episode was "Hippy Dippy Hippies" who think it was episode 4, again quite a clear memory of the police. Unfortunately, the sitcom had a negative reaction from the audience (I can not believe it). The BBC ordered another series, but Arthur Matthews decided against it because of the negative reaction. Well, I can not wait for the DVD. Best Episode: Hippy Hippie Dippy - Series 1 Episode 4.
