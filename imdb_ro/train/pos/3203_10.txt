I think this movie was one of Kurt Russels' good movies. Kurt Russel is my favorite actor, so I think he's a good actor in whatever role he plays. But this movie has had a lot of action in it and I know it should have more than a 5.6 out of 10 per meter, but many people do not like this movie. Well, I thought it was good, so I think everyone should see this movie. If you see this movie and you like this, I think you should see Back Draft and Kurt Russel. Dau Soldier *** 1/2 of *****
