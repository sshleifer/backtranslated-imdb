This is a weird, cerebral, surreal, esoteric film. If there is such a thing as "Intellectual Intellectual Cinema," this movie is. I started to scare you and want someone else to look at it and barely have a plot! I'll have to see this movie again several times before I feel I really understand. If you are the type of person who likes "My Andre's Supper" and Godard movies, or if you do a lot of drugs that change your mind, you'll probably enjoy this movie. Wow.
