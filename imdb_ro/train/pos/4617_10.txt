I was a fan of Jennifer Connelly of Fenomena, and after I heard seven minutes in heaven, I saw her as fast as I could. The film is not just a comedy if you think that many of these things that most of us have passed through as children and currently live not only was the wonderful movie led by the phenomenal Jennifer Connelly that it caught my attention that this film was terribly written and acted out there was a good deal I liked and followed it again and again and for those of you who enjoy a good laugh or love jennifer connelly you can not get down seeing this movie !!!!
