Two back-to-back movies for the Indians; Veer Zaara and Deewaar. Although Veer Zara was a love story of a guy who gives everything to someone, Deewaar focuses on the main subject. It is not hidden that many war Indians have been rotten in Pakistani jail for years - for which the Indians have not ruled. has time or sympathy, neither the other. I'm sure some of the Pakistan wars are in India, but let's focus on the film. Full of actors. Some were actors such as Raghubir Yadav, Rajendra Gupta, etc. Amitabh Bachchan, who plays the role of a major, acted well. Akshaye Khanna did a good job. There's nothing for Amrita Rao than a couple of giggles and couple songs. I think the role of Sanjay Dutt was very solid, even if it was not too long. It acted very well here, and the delivery of dialogue was also impressive. If you compare it to LOC, which was nothing but a story-telling film in all directions (if it were a story) - Deewaar is a well-directed film that holds a good rhythm and is right for all actors. 7.5 / 10
