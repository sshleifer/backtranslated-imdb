I would not say "We've come back, a story of dinosaurs," just a version of Jurassic Park kiddie. I found it more interesting than that. Like the former, she questions the security of bringing beings from one age into ours. But I really open my eyes when I see who gave the voice: John Goodman, Rhea Perlman, Jay Leno, Walter Cronkite, Julia Child, Kenneth Mars, Yeardley Smith, Martin Short and Larry King. To paraphrase: a given actor, "Cheers" woman, host "Tonight Show", the most trusted name in the news, a famous chef, police chief "Young Frankenstein" Lisa Simpson, one of three CNN amigos that I should not just focus on distribution. I thought this movie had something for both children (purely fun) and adults (natural history). True, it is escapism, but the perceptive type. I would say that John Goodman, who makes Rex's voice, is a kind of precursor to his voice work in Monsters Inc. Worth seeing.
