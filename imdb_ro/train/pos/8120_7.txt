Things to Come is a SF Sci-Fi movie featuring an imagined world or "Everytown" for over 100 years. You can break into about 4 different scenes or parts. The film stretches between 1940 and 2036 and refers mainly to how this leader or the "boss" wanted to get back on board the planes after Alltown was bombed and the war broke out. has about 3 defects: the sound is dirty and the video has some strange, the characters are not at all deep, and the total plot is not completely solid. The plot does not have anything I can not put my finger ... it just seems a bit fluffy. But if you like Sci-Fi SF and you are interested in what H.G. Wells though it may happen in the next hundred years, this must be seen. It is worth seeing just why everyone was afraid: a long, stray war, because it was about to go to war with Germany, and there was a threat with biological weapons and everything. > Things to come is a good movie that most people have to see once.
