Does anyone happen to know where this movie was shot? The scene of aviation on the rock is beautiful. It looks like England. However, the building of Ivy's apartment certainly looks like the Brill building with its fascinating lifts. Charles Mendl is listed as "Sir Charles Gage". Maybe I blinked, but I never saw him. Maybe she was the husband's lawyer, but again, I do not remember that character is in the movie, other than being mentioned as making a phone call. Perhaps he was on the aviation scene? Or the scene in the ballroom? Was anyone at the scene? Herbert Marshall was 57 years old when he shot this movie.
