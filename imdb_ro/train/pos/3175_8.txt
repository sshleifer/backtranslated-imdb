It's great how this movie attracts you. I laughed honestly. I do not care that it's a low budget because it works for me. To be honest, my wife did not really go the same way but I prefer a different movie. She admitted, however, that she was very creative and well put together and probably everything on a string of shoes. Those characters that are life are strange and troubled give me something to refer to in my world. Continue to continue and be who you are. Dreams are what you do from them. Looking at this film, the second and the third time, I realized that there were hidden moments that came to me for the first time. What can I say, I like my fun with some complexity. Anyway, he liked it. I hope to see more.
