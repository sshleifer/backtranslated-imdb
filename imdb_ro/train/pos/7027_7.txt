"Bye Bye Birdie" is not one of the best musicians of all time, but it is very entertaining and accessible to many audiences. The original film could have been great, and Dick Van Dyke resumed his Broadway role he signs, but instead made a script so the film is very unsatisfactory. This re-make, broadcasted on ABC in 1995, is much more faithful to the original script and includes original songs that were used in a national tournament that featured Tommy Tune and Ann Reinking's choreography. ) Jason Alexander is a very different type from Dick Van Dyke, but is well interpreted as Albert (before "Seinfeld", he began in musical theater.) Vanessa Williams is a perfect match for Rose. It is also a great work from Tyne Daly as Mae and Mark Kudisch as Conrad Birdie (a role he played in the national tournament). This film is not without problems. Major responsibility is Chynna Phillips, who, however appealing, would simply look and seems too old to be teenager Kim. And George Wendt is somewhat gentle as her father, throwing somehow the number of "kids" away (a number of original cast members Paul Lynde stole the show with.) But overall, this is a delightful, well-done film the material deserved .
