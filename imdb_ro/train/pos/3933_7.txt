The problem of portraying a real person is that performance may be good, but it does not work if the audience does not believe the actor portrays it. That's the main problem with "Young Mr. Lincoln:" Henry Fonda offers great performance, but it has been hard for me to think that Abraham Lincoln was as talkative as Fonda. a drama in the meeting room with a young Abraham Licoln in the foreground. Whether or not it was a true story, I do not know, but if it is not, then why do I say it using Lincoln as the central character? Nevertheless it does not matter. In the film, Lincoln defends two young people who are accused of murder. There is not much for the movie and as a result it seems rather empty. I wanted more story and character development. The film has a duration of 100 minutes, but it does not feel that way. There are a few small Lincoln scenes and relationship with Mary Todd, but they seem superficial. The actress is good everywhere, but as I said, Fonda's performance works as a character, but not Abraham Lincoln. I do not think the real Lincoln was soft talk. True, he has a big voice when he needs, like when he convinces a lot of drunken flattery to let the accused go through the process, but Fonda portrays Lincoln too quietly. The other performances are still solid, especially Alice Brady as Abigail Clay, the mother of the accused. She's a beautiful lady for whom we can really feel. Simple and forced, but very sweet; we can see why Lincoln wanted to help her. John Ford seems to think of this film as an epic and, at the time of his release, it probably was. But even then, it is not enough material to present it as such. It's a nice watch, but not a classic.
