"Vanilla Sky" was a wonderful movie. Or rather, "Abre Los Ojos" was well thought out. I saw the movie one late night, excited about what was coming. I was not disappointed. By the end of the movie, I was awake. I could not get it out of my mind. The whole idea about it just let me go. The end was a surprise rather than Shyamalan. The plot line was also something that kept me interesting through and through. The distribution, superb. It was a great movie. The kind of movie you can watch again and again and you always find something new. I've seen it four or five times and I always find something new. It's a movie that will interest you forever.
