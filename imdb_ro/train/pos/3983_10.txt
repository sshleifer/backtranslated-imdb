Deserving of the prestigious Hollywood Award nomination, this is a fun jewel with plenty of pizzas and delightful surprises. Extraordinary fun scenes include a hilarious (and re-shoot) shooting of a WW1 rose scene with Australian comedian Clyde Cook as a non-optimist com and McDoakes unhappy like a Messenger Boyer / Colman? all under the glamorous eye of Ralph Sanford, delightfully breathtaking Anguish; a lost McDoakes guided and re-guided by Jack Carson as tangled; Chandler deputy director enjoying an opportunity sent by McDoakes: "I'll be a director!" Ace comic O'Hanlon has a double role playing McDoakes as well as himself playing McDoakes! Strangely, Richard L. Bare, who plays in one or more other entries in the series, refused this opportunity here. In real life, Bare is a Hudson rock boy six feet high, but here is played by veteran actor (over 500 movies!) Jack Mower.
