Halloween is one of the best examples of independent film. It is very well done and has more psychological elements for it than you could at first sight. It's a simple movie said very well. Music is perfect and is one of the most haunting scores ... If you have not seen this movie yet, you have to check it out. The cast is extraordinary. I wish I never had a follow-up after the sequel. The first was by far the best and should have ended as it did without a sequel. It was fun to see Jamie Lee Curtis in the movie. She does not seem to get old (she is just as wonderful today, without hairdressing and seventy). Scenes through the mask are one of the most frightening things ever!
