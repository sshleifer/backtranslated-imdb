For a "no budget" movie, this is a shame. I do not know if America would like to, but I laughed all the way. Some Funny Funny Things. Really non-Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Actors and rock music. The machines and gags, and even less so with your stuff on the face, have broken us. Whooo Whooo! I've seen some actors before, but never this, one or two of them think I've seen in commercials or somewhere somewhere. Practically Rocked! Fortunately, I came to see a copy from a friend of one of the actors.
