Do not allow my constructive criticism to stop you from buying and watching this classic Romy Schneider. This movie was shot in a smaller budget, probably against the will of Ernest Marishka, so it had to become owed. For example, England is portrayed as being bordered by Germany. A Will to Victory Victoria and her mother take a vacation in Germany only with trolley trips. They got too fast. This could not be helped, but the castle they rented for the film was Austrian. When told to be a queen, she goes to the royal chamber where the court members lean, where are the British citizens outside the castle, who applaud their new queen? Why does ISBN not show herself to the balcony to greet her subjects? Budget reduced! If the audience then aware of these imperfections? I wonder how critics have felt? During the Han scene he meets Prince Albert, but he is not excited about it. During the inn's food meeting, listen to music from the famous American Civil War song, such as "My Old House Kentucky" and "Old Black Joe." What the? civil wars in the 1830s? Is Romy Schneider portrayed as Scarlet? Where is Mamma? Magna Shnieder is playing her too? Is Adrian Hoven Rhett or Ashley? What was in Marishka's mind? Well, add it to the camp. It's an unintentional story to cheer on Queen Victoria. This is the only reason you need to collect or see it 03 11 09 Germany and England correction are connected
