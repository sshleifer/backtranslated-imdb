It's rare to sit in front of the TV to watch a particular program. It was even rarer when I enjoyed the program eventually, but Last of the Blonde Bombshells was one of the best movies I've ever seen. A remarkable note, led by Dame Judi Dench and Ian Holm, and an excellent screenplay full of witchcraft and combined vice to make it a truly rewarding experience. I can not say how well I thought it was, so I will not try, I will only say if you have the opportunity, PLEASE DO YOU! I just hope they appear on the video.
