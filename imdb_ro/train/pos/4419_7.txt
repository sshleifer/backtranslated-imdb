I saw this movie and I heard the writer-director Juan Gerard speaking at the Santa Barbara Int'l Film Festival. All I knew about it was that it was the story of an 8-year-old man, old at the time of the Cuban revolution of 1958, and how it affects his home and his family. His opening scene will bring to mind "Cinema Paradiso". In fact, the film is full of classic films: "Rolla roulette" (Casablanca), "chicken cock" (Rebel without a cause), references to Bunuel, "Touch of Evil"; you will find more. The homeless man (Georg Stanford Brown) is a reference to Cuban folklore that often uses black as a type of Greek chorus. What really is this movie is the culmination of a dream. Gerard's desire to honor his family and film environment, which he loved all his life. This is the true story of Juan Gerard and all the people in reality, as well as the events described. Gerard is, in fact, an architect and engineer (and passionate filmmaker), but his dream was to make this film. He and his wife decided to live that dream, and Harvey Keitel became an "angel" who believed in Gerard and agreed to produce and stay in it. Keitel keeps the screen as the mysterious and secret grandfather "Che". Brown and Keitel are the only Americans in the cast. Iben Hjejle (High Fidelity) and Gael Garcia Bernal (Y tu Mama Tambien) offer strong support in key roles. True, the first half of the movie suffers from rigid line deliveries, but stick with it. The last half is much better as the events of the revolution combine for the climax of bitterness and honesty. It is Juan Gerard's first effort, but he is sincere, as is his passion and heart, indeed, through this first sincere effort. I will definitely see her again, and I hope he will continue his film career. <br /> <br />
