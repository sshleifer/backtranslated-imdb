Waiting to see another Nunspoitative movie, with an average upper mother, abusing and torturing accusations, Flavia turned out to be much more than I had anticipated. It actually has a feminist story, although I do not think such a term existed at the time the movie is set. It certainly was not practiced. Women (and Jews and the poor) are very worried and imprisoned in missionary places in society. Along the story, Sister Flavia (Florinda Bolkan) is witnessing the tyranny of her time until she can no longer sit there and even do something about her, though with disastrous results. The pre-crediting sequence has Flavia as a young adolescent near a battlefield. She sees a badly injured Muslim soldier (one of the few still alive) and tries to help him. Before she can, her hateful father faces the soldier and heads up (an extraordinary family dynamics, right?). After that, her father forces her to join a monastery where there is even more injustice. Although the scenes involve violence, rape and nuns, I would consider this more a historical drama than Nunspoitation. <br /> <br /> Indeed, many of the ingredients for an explosive piece are there, but acting, working with the camera, the story and the music are too good to keep it at this level. Most of the movies I've seen usually have the basic premise: a good girl ends up in a monastery, where the Mother Superior is a supreme bitch who likes to whip people and / or make her life a hell alive. Flavia spends much of the first part of the film, asking passively for all the atrocities that happen around her. Much of her passivity is forgotten when she gets acquainted with the strong (but slightly blonde - she likes to boast like me, but it's much easier for the guys) Sister Agatha. When a group of Muslims attacks their monastery, Flavia and Agatha are not afraid of the other nuns. Their attackers actually function as liberators (cruelty and close slavery to the monastery). In fact, he is a Christian, not a Muslim invader, who hits Dear Sister Agatha. Agatha's death sends Flavia into her violent crusade against those who have oppressed her ... Her father treats her as dirty. Her Muslim girl deserts her at a very unfortunate moment. I do not want to give much of the rest of the story, but be prepared to be shocked, devastated and saddened at the end. This is a great movie, so do not be fooled by its (unmarked) reputation as a garbage epic. In addition, how could a movie be shot with Florinda Bolkan and Claudio Cassinelli on Earth? I'm not familiar with other works by María Casares, but Sister Agatha is a character draco. I've read many great reviews of Synapse communication (USA), but I like the German X-rated copy Kult DVD. It's not anamorphic / 16: 9, but it actually has a smaller image on all edges than the release of Synapse. And there are also many great, wise, or funny lines of dialogue (many from Sister Agatha) <br /> <br /> "Why is God the male, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit? -Flavia <br /> <br /> "These people are afraid of them, sister-You're afraid their power will be taken away from them!" -SR. Agatha (for Christians who fled after the Muslims arrived) <br /> <br /> "Woman, where are you going?" Muslims can do nothing for you, which Christians have not done! -SR. Agatha (to a group of Christian women who have fled) <br /> <br /> "The Lord bless these Muslims - to put fear in these pompous Christians." -Flavia <br /> <br /> "Does he only need a Muslim to make you dress?" -SR. Agatha <br /> <br /> Closing message: "Flavia Gaetani, still not a Muslim - no longer a Christian - was punished as a fugitive nun. The idea of ​​the film came from the events that took place during the invasion of Muslims Italy culminating in what is today remembered as MARTYRDOM OF 800 at OTRANTO "
