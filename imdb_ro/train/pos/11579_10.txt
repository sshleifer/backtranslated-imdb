this movie is a masterpiece a story of a young woman during the war, and it really does not exactly like the movie, but it's a great story, I was impressed by this film, acting and story where I love a movie very much because it's a real story is that I'm Giff a feeling that I was there and I'm sorry for the rector Maruschka Detmers plays for who wants to end life here in this way. I recommend that everyone needs to see this movie, especially young people, and teach me something in this movie. This movie can be compared to the orange film soldier or any real story that happened during the Second World War.
