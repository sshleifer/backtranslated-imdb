Taking into account all the political opinions, Feroz Khan and "Gandhi, My Father" by Anil Kapoor, is a good film that intelligently explores the confused part of the family of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and the struggle of his greatest son Harilal Gandhi with society father bigger than life and, most importantly, demons in his head. One draws parallels with Gandhi, father of the nation, and struggles with any son he could have with their father. The actor is good. Shefali Shetty, Darshan Zariwala and Akshaye Khanna - strictly in this order - add the color and the pathos of this story about Harilal, who is crying to be hugged only once, and also runs with the slightest touch of his finger. /> The direction of Feroz Khan and the production canvas are generous and attractive, however, the scenario could have been more stringent. I saw the game a few years ago on a pirate video DVD (which I called Mahatama vs Gandhi, I think) and certainly was rather captivating. Although the film's bottom line and the moments of the father and son's son are just a brilliant experience. This movie could have been great. It's limited to that. It has the potential so great that it was just a difference of story between a father and a son or just Gandhi or even both. somewhere, the plot is lost and when you expect an absolute symbol of emotion, nothing comes to you. He compares decent with Gandhi's. Of course, not an overall movie like Kingsley's Gandhi, or abstract like Hey Ram by Kamal Hassan. The film manages to find its position; however, one is asked "what if ..." It's worth an hour. 7.5 / 10
