Jess is 18 years old, she is very smart and wants to play football, when she joins a local team, she has to lie to her parents again and again, because they will never approve of her pursuing her dream, will to set up with a nice Indian boy and learn how to cook. Bend it Like Beckham is a very funny movie I feel good it does not have to be profound and complex, it is good as it is. The distribution is very good and plays its roles very well, the story is simple and predictable, but it works perfectly and the script is very realistic and very funny. A great 8/10 family movie
