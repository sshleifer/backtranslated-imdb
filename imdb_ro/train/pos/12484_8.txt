This movie scared my carp! I have to admit that I spent most of the movie watching my fingers, but what I saw was really scary. I cried loudly two or three times during the show. The film made my favorite aspects to be sound and photography. The sound was great, and the setting was really creepy. I read somewhere that it's a strange team of husbands and spouses who managed it. For some reason, this makes me even more alien to me. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy jumping and jitters of scary movies than this is for you! Very suspense and a wonderful movie to rent with a bunch of friends who love to watch movies squeezed on a couch screaming like little girls!
