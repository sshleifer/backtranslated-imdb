Still, I liked it. Warren Beatty is just right as the hero of the comic book. What saves this movie is the incredible set, incredible distribution, and is based on a mediocre scenario. I was really expecting something more substantial in terms of action or plot, but I have very little. The main reason to watch this movie is to watch some of Hollywood's greatest stars at the time in such an unusual movie. <br /> <br /> The only person who did a great job and was not even in this movie was Madonna. She was not part of this movie, and her acting career was bad enough. The movie at some moments has just stopped. You waited a little longer and you have nothing. Al Pacino plays a very bad guy and he's doing pretty well. He and Beatty make an excellent guy and a bad guy. <br /> <br /> It's also interesting to see Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty in a film other than Isthar. I did not see Ishtar, but I heard bad things. The thing about this movie is good, but it could have been a lot better. I liked it as a child because it looked great and visual that the movie is amazing, the sets are incredible, the writing is correct and with such a cast in the movie I expect a little better. SPOILER <br /> <br /> I especially thought the final was not big enough. It was interesting, but for a big film, I thought it might have ended with a little more than a bang. The reason to watch this movie is the atmosphere. The film uses only the seven comic stripes, making everything more visually, anyway. The costumes and the make-up were also perfect. Facial makeup for the villains was great. Beatty is not up to a character larger than life. However, this is a good movie that could have been a lot more. It's better for me than Batman, the other adaptation of the comic book that came out almost at the same time. Of course the movie was much bigger from a brutal point of view.
