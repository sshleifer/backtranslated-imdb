What would happen when a depressed cop works with a psychiatrist during probation? It can be a lot of fun ... This film has set a benchmark in the genre of action / comedy of Argentine cinema. Characters of the character, the probable story and a rhythm that laughs has some emotion. I recommended it for a fun time of fun. Peretti and Luque join their efforts to fight a cold and bold foe at a time when it is difficult to trust someone. This film will surprise you on the other side of the "Analyze me" coin, but not with anything to envy. And if you want to meet Bs.AS where there are few scenes from the city center and the city center.
