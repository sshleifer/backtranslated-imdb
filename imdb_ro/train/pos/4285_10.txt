This "tragicomie" written by the famous Serbian drama / screenwriter Dusan Kovacevic is probably one of the best movies ever made in the comedy category. And yet, her appearance in a playplay transformed into a feature film takes nothing of its value. A masterpiece should not be missing to see (preferably with subtitles and without being named). In an elderly bus, on the way to Belgrade's capital, a warrior warfare decides the behavior of passengers. Two Gypsy musicians sing about their miserable lives, but they also foresee a tragedy to come; their song divides and unites the stages in this extraordinary film (real life Kostic brothers are amateur actors, but together with Stanojlo Milinkovic as a farmer who shows the road gives real performance). The character spectrum gives a brilliant image to a society facing a war, a perspective on the collective person of the nation: everyone is aware that the war is about to begin, but tries to live their lives as well as hoping that ignorance could avoid the tragedy. Using simple film language, director Slobodan Sijan painted a picture of the society torn by the previous war (World War I), but he also portrays personal portraits successfully: a singer's provincialism, the lack of experience of new spouses, the veteran's seriousness the way to visit his newly consecrated son and gloomy predictions from a man who appears to be a German spy. Brilliant in his narrative, with the memorable soundtrack (especially Gispsy songs) and the adapted, well-photographed and edited atmosphere, this feature (Sijan's debut) was just an introduction to a series of regrettable sweet-sweet comedies that will define cinema Serbian in the 1980s: "Marathons trce pocasni krug", "Kako sam sistematski unisten od idiota" and my favorite director "Davitelj protiv davitelja").
