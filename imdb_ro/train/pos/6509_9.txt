I can not believe some of the comments on this show! The show is just a genius! Certainly not following the tried and true ones, but we, as consumers, always want the same things that have always pushed us. We should not have the option of resting and enjoying something new from time to time. Style is not as realistic as previous Scooby Doo shows, but it should not be. The show titled "Shaggy and Scooby Doo Get a Clue," in which part of that title, says that all the cast of other shows would constantly come into action. And nowhere is it said that they will solve the mysteries and that they can not even stand monsters, why would they be? I'm really glad to have some long plotting points that work in a Scooby-Doo show. Still have jokes, clumsy robberies, fast changing clothes in tracking scenes, standard lobby galleries, and even Scooby's snacks. Actually, I'm glad this show is there because I love him. I am delighted to have escaped from the rest of the team for a while and focused on just two main characters and a villain. Sure it's ridiculous, it should be! Of course it's different, it should be. It should make you laugh at the bastard and cheer on the idiotic robotic butler to triumph over all the parasites, no matter what their size. You should make Roobi-Roo joke running. The whole thing is just so well put together, there is not one thing I can think of as BACK with it. Writing, driving, animation, all the charts. The title music is great (my computer plays "GET CLUE!" When it wraps), and the background music starts.
