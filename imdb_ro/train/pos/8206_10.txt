Clint Eastwood returns as Dirty Harry Calahan in his fourth Dirty Harry movie. Clint is older, but still has, Harry was told to have a vacation after some trouble that happened because of a robbery (if the "Make my birthday" memory)! But the city that made a holiday was worse, the woman returned vigilant after a rape attack in a funfair and began to receive punks one by one. The last movie to see Sandra Locke in a Clint Eastwood movie! An improvement after The Enforcer, which was more of a comedy and less serious. Clint Eastwood's sunglasses were Gargoyles, which are best known for the sunglasses carried by Arnold Shwartzeneger in The Terminator. It's worth a watch if you like Clint Eastwood, Dirty Harry or Thriller Action Thrillers.
