After 7 years of watching terrible stupidity called Star Trek Voyager, I felt quite numb. The following genres and DS9 were bloody things and Voyager destroyed TV Trek. He opened with probably the best pilot at a show at Trek. The crew was very good as choosing the actors for the tracks. Scott Bakula played a typical captain for the first time in deep space, and his way of doing things was a refreshing change to the already known captains. The rest of the crew were really folding in their roles, and I think they have come down to a good first season. When the show was canceled prematurely, I was very disappointed. In Mirror, Darkly showed us what was able to cast. Too bad a movie or TV movie has never been taken into account. So much story back and the foundation of the federation left to tell him, including triggering hostilities with the Klingons ..........
