For a long time it seemed that all good Canadian actors headed south of the border and (I think) all the other two filled the top slots and left the dregs for sexual comedies. This movie was a real surprise: despite strange plots that are typical of phrases, the actors seem to try to put something in their characters and what we, the viewer, came back to was almost a true suspension of faith. When the excerpt from the musical video attacked the evicted police, you almost thought it possible. If you are a fan of better sex sentences (Canadians or not), you should definitely look for this out. And the big surprise, this sex freak is loaded with very good nudity.
