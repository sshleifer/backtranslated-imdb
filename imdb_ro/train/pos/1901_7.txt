It's hard to get your finger on this. Basically, I guess it's a comedy about a rich drunk drunk who falls in love with a poor (comparative) girl he wants to marry at the risk of being disappointed by his family. It has fun moments, romantic moments and exciting moments. Dudley Moore is funny and, in a way, makes his selfish character, Liza Minelli, a compelling folklore, as if attracting his attention, but John Gielgud steals the show as a sarcastic butler of Arthur. but amazing fun with a memorable soundtrack and fled for almost 3 months to our local fleet.
