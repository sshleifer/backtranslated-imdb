Not only was this movie better than all of H's final season: LOTS. But it was better than any movie made for the TV I've ever seen! Looking at "Top 250" I see that only a small screen shot did: How Grinch Stole Christmas. I think it's time to raise this group to 2. I'll admit that the original series had more shows that were better than that, but I was not upset. I just loved being able to get into the Baltimore Omicide Squad world again!
