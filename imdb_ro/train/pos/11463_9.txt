I saw this film at the Rhode Island International Film Festival and it was completely blown. The structure and execution of the movie were fantastic ... I know it will not, but it really deserves an Oscar. Cal and Andre were phenomenal like the two classmates who were upset. Yes, the movie is very controversial and I can see a lot of people who have a lot of problems with it, because it's about school shooting and especially makes you identify with the killers. However, despite its harsh and harsh subjects, Zero Day is SO worth watching. I look forward to coming out on the video so I can buy it - it's very, very good. Very powerful and intense ... the ending sequence stops you speechless, because it's almost too realistic. Their uncertainty, the "recordings," students' images and panic, totally indescribable. I really hope he gets the attention he deserves. It is done in the same format as the Blair Witch Project, a handheld camera, made to appear as a true documentary documentary documentary - but God is the INFINITE better. Very impressive, the hats that all involved involve. If you have the chance to see it.
