A thief in the night must be the best of all time-thrillers. I have no idea what people complain about what people complain when I say that this movie scared to accept God. They only had to find an excuse and accused a thief in the night. Do not listen! These films are not just about one of the many possibilities of trouble, but they are also fun to look at in their simplicity. They are, in fact, with a low budget, and that is unclear, but not very obvious at first sighting. I had no idea because I really assumed that many films like those made in the 70s included small boutiques throughout. A thief in the night tells the story of the young and cynical Patty Myers living to what happens until her husband and all her friends disappear almost prophetic rapture we all warned. At first, the movie does not rely on everyone around it until rape happens. Which leads to them shows that those around them are Christians and believe in Christ, what usually happens with a lot of people. Everyone around them, whom they once knew and loved, will disappear forever, and the one behind them is the one who accuses them all but themselves. Nobody can blame because he's always right. Just like these drunks who complain about the film. These people must be full of adults. I'm thirteen years and I do not see me complaining, especially since I was just like Patty before you again accept Christ into my heart. For those who have not seen it, if you want a bit of everything thrown in a Christian film instead of stereo-typical films everyone else is wrong, but you will enjoy a thief in the night. Do not beat it before you try it. Something new is always good. Trust your own instincts.
