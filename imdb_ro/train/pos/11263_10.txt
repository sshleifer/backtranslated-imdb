This is an excellent show! I had a history teacher in the US in high school, which was very similar to that. There are many "facts" in history that are not really true and Mr. Wuhl shows them very well, in a way that is unforgettable. Mr. Wuhl teaches a class of film students, but history students and even the general public will appreciate the spiritual path that he discovers some of the most well-known errors in world history and strives to impress upon those students' brains. The use of live actors who perform "skits" is also very fun. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this series to all those interested in the history they have learned as a child overturned.
