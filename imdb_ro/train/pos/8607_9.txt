They never understood why MacDonald-Eddy's swan song has always been so ruthless - not just by their detractors, but by almost everyone. For me, "I married an angel" is more lively and more imaginative than any of the duo's most famous exits. The sets and costumes are as generous as any of those found in an MGM musical, the script is written by Anita Loos ("San Francisco", "Women", "Gentlemen prefer Blondes", etc.), Rodgers and Hart songs (though slightly altered by the directors of MacDonald-Eddy, Bob Wright and Chet Forrest) received a heavenly treatment by Herbert Stothart (Oscar winner for the "Wizard of Oz") and, best of all, in their contemporary clothes and seeming to have fun with bizarre procedures. Try to show "Rose Marie" or "Sweethearts" to the uninitiated today and they may have a lot of time to stay still, but this fantastic fantasy, fast-paced, is about to have fun.
