this film was almost a great imaginative film. A mixture of Shakespeare, Pop, Jazz and Faerie stories. This movie was an imaginative twist on the Cinderella theme. With a strong cast, led by Kathleen Turner, the film had everything for him. Everything but production values. Almost never think a movie needs special effects or big budgets but with a top production like this one came with the same terrible quality as any other made for the television movie. In addition to better cinema, the film was almost perfect. <br /> <br />
