Unborn is a pretty good horror movie, with a low budget, exploiting the fears of pregnancy. He is well served by good-looking Brooke Adams and b-movie James Karen, although the support band is quite average for a b-grader. The music, by Gary Numan of all people, is also good. Henry Dominic's scenography is smart enough for such things, though there is a misogynistic idea about it. Rodman Fender's direction is adequate enough and there are some unnecessary cheap scares. If you are a fan of Adams, whose film career is never as illustrating as it should have been, check it out; it's wonderful, as always.
