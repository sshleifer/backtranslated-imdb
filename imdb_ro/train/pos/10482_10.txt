I like this movie. It's one of those that I can track again and again. It is well done by a good distribution that does not try too hard to be studded. The premise of a recent widow who turns into selling the pot to fulfill his goals could have been transformed into an Americanized turd of a movie or thriller of action. Either he'd killed the movie completely. The film behaves like an Ealing comedy with a terrible factor of feel-good in everything. <br /> <br /> It's worth looking just for the scene with the two old ladies and a box of cornflakes ... (not that's not a spoiler!)
