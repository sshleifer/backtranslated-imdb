Jeremy Brett is simply the best Holmes ever, with a barrier marked by the great Basil Rathbone of course, and this is probably the best adaptation of Conon-Doyle's short story. A lengthy adaptation includes some new plot nodes that fit well with the surrounding drama and accentuate the hatred that you feel about Milverton. Great performances all over the world, especially from Robert Hardy, and both Brett and Hardwick completely rounded and comfortable in their roles, make this the superb play of drama.
