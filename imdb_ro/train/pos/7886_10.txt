Okay, I'm a fan of the Nightmare series and everyone says this is the worst! But it is not !!! Did not you see Freddy's revenge? WTF! This was the worst of all !!! Now this movie is pretty decent and it lacks Freddy's story and it's great to have a daughter, etc. And then I found out he was in 3-D !!! I was so excited, I remember when I saw it on the DVD set and I instantly went to the 3D sequences. Only a lot was in the 3-D, though, such as the hand of Lisa Zanes, Dream Demons, Freddy's Claw (several times), Lezlie Dean holding a knife, Lisa Zane with a Bat Baseball, Doc's hand, Freddy's head explodes. I really loved this movie because it was in 3-D, but I want the whole movie to be in 3-D, not just in the last 15 minutes. By how are 15 minutes NOT TEN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
