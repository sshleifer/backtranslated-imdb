"Panic" is an uncharacteristic film about a reconciliation of middle-aged love with a hairless young man, his love of wife and son, his duty to his employer with his own identity. Although the film has a nebulous purpose and an ambiguous end, it is a superb production in almost all aspects. Clarity and sincerity of characters in such an unlikely story can fascinate and disturb the audience.
