I was 16 years old when I saw the movie and was always a great favorite of mine. Of course, you can not reject Kristofferson's appeal in the movie - HOW IS THE MAN WHAT IS THE MAN ???????????? Sheesh. He's still there. He is the bad boy that every woman wants in secret. His acting is flawless. He played a beat / druggie only in the way someone who went through him could - and he had - in '76 finally got to the wagon, so it was very real. Music is GREAT and even though in recent years I thought Streisand was not somehow the right person for him in a sense of physical beauty, I think it's more of a problem for male viewers than for women. Our brides look at Kris - and, of course, boys look at the woman's interest - my husband can not watch the movie b / c - he does not like what he looks like. But I made him stay on the red Ferrari scene on the way to the end just to see how well it was - the work in the room was so perfect and you were all in the car together with the music - I saw it on my 50 "plate - WOW !!!! And finally, the quality of the transfer was GREAT - an anamorphic and truly clear widescreen display with a great color and very low noise, except for the dark areas that is normal for > <br /> I remember my mother and I loved this movie together, I bought a copy for Christmas. I loved seeing her with her last night. <br /> < > I have tried to stay with the original with Judy Garland, but I think I first saw this, I can not go back to the previous age. Watching all the 76s was just as much as what I was living at the time. /> <br /> I work through Streisand's comment, but she seems to talk only about herself and about her , so far she has even mentioned Kris or details about the scenes in the film. Her voice sounds exactly the same as then. Check it out, if you grew up in the same age as me (born in 1960), you will love it. <br /> <br /> Wendy
