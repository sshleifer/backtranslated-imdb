This awesome game of Marvel super heroes pays tribute to yourself by staying loyal to comics. Of all the super-heroic Marvel games that have been so bland with poor graphics and gameplay, Spiderman is improving in both departments. He also has the voice of Stan Lee, the creator of Spiderman comics. As you would expect Spiderman to do all he can to the spider. He does more than spinning belts. In fact, he uses them as weapons and shields. When he does not use the web in battle, he also blows. Spidey has his hands full when fighting Venom, Rhino, Mysterio, Scorpio, and Dr. Octopus to name a few. Look for Captain America in a cameo. Most levels are challenging, but some of them require patience to beat. The only complaint about this game is that it is so short and can be completed in less than three hours. If you are a true fan of Marvel superhero, this game is for you, but do not expect a long gameplay. More luck in "Spiderman 2". My Rating: 9 out of 10.
