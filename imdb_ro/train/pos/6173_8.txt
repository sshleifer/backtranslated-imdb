A great movie. The act - from a doctor to a plower to the prostitute, with very few exceptions, was wonderful; I thought soni razdan (mrs.noble) and vrajesh hirjee (saurabh) were the best of the less known actors. Even Kurush Deboo (Tehmul), who may have been accused of having exceeded, presented a fairly credible and familiar character. Another great thing was to work with the room - and how he captured the energy of bombay streets, Gustad's silence tells prayers and his life in small apartments. I liked the story of the wall that becomes an altar and then breaks - and the philosophical artists take it. <br /> <br /> It's great to see good movies on Indian themes.
