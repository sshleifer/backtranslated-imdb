It's good to see that Vintage Film Buff has correctly classified their excellent DVD version as "musical" because this movie is simply. Like his unofficial remake, Murder at the Windmill (1949), murder plot is just an excuse for a spectacular fantasy with Kitty Carlisle and Gertrude Michael, who lead a cast of super-decorative girls, including Ann Sheridan, Lucy Ball, Beryl Wallace, Gwenllian Gill, Gladys Young, Barbara Fritchie, Wanda Perry and Dorothy White. Carl Brisson is also at hand to borrow his strong voice at "Cocktails for Two". Undoubtedly, the most popular melody of the movie is heard no less than four times. However, Gertrude Michael, who steals the show, not only with her "Sweet Marijauna", but also with her strong performance as the hero's rejected girlfriend. As for the rest of the cast, we could have done without Jack Oakie and Victor McLaglen altogether. The only good thing about Oakie's role is his weak ice with a worship icon, Toby Wing. In fact, to give you an idea of ​​how far the rest of the comedy is overburdened and overstretched, super inspector McLaglen can not simply put his hands on the killer, even if, you think, in this case, it happens to or the person you suspect most. Director Mitch Leisen is in fact making great efforts to turn the killer to the worst member of the cinema audience by giving the player concerned, after the closure.
