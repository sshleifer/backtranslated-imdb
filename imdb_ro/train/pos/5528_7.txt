This is a very beautiful and almost meditative film - there is almost no dialogue in it besides the narrative; and the landscape and music perfectly compliment. I have not met the red hair of the girl and the fox until it has been shown to me by a friend (who also has red hair!) It's almost a kind of old-fashioned movie, saying children now prefer animations like Shrek or Toy Story etc. - but I feel that young people should be better imported for the beauty and wonder of nature that this film is certainly doing. Perhaps it is not the best movie ever, but certainly an excellent and relaxing vision for all ages - not just children.
