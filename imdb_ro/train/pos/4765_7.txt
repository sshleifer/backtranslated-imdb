A priest who has abandoned his job meets a young man who has just been ordained. This film is about the cruel dilemma of a life dedicated to God and faith and a life of more earthly pleasures. In post-war France it is about the mortal aspect of the Faith itself. Perhaps this is not the movie of a life, but it is a pity that I let him fall into oblivion. In addition, Pierre Fresnay is sublime.
