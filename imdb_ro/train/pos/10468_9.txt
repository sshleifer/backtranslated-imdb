Monstervision was a show I grew up with. From the late night hosting with Penn and Teller to one, the only one, Joe Bob Briggs. The show kept me on Friday night in my school years and gave me some of the best memories of going outside the entrance house. Undoubtedly, the best evening late television ever. If you did not stop, you missed. I know I live John Bloom and Joe Bob, but I want to get them back from where I'm ... MONSTERVISION! Question ... Has anyone stayed in all the 4 hours of "The Swarm"? q :) <br /> <br /> Long live Monstervision!
