Currently on the new METOO program, at 16:00 on business days, immediately after "Maverick" and even before "Wild, Wild West" (followed by "Star Trek"). saw an episode of it when it was originally, but I'm really captivated by it. Unusual, unusual, surrealistic stories settled in a mythical West. A kind of "empty city" of Westerners. And the stars are there: Dan Duryea, Lyle Bettger, Brian Donlevy, MacDonald Carey, Rick Jason (a bitter Mexican), a young Dick Van Patton, Jack Lord, Noah Berry, Jr. (like a colorful Mexican), Martha Hyer, Marguerite Chapman, even Ann Robinson ("World War"), Gloria Talbott /> <br /> He fled to SEPTE CITY, over 200 episodes, from January 1959 to December 1965. Eric Fleming is quite remarkable as the Chief of the Gil Train Favor, has ever lived with the samurai code of honor, and only a fair balance between tenacity and openness. I wanted to vote for President every day. (PS had a very interesting biography: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0281661/) And a young Clint Eastwood is quite striking like his impulsive straight hand, "Rowdy" Yates. Also, the veteran character of Western actor and country music ("One-eyed, single-purple, bearded bearer"), Sheb Wooley is there as spice scout Pete Nolan. And Paul Brinegar makes the most cantankerous character of a chef that you could ask for as "Wishbone". And then there is that awesome theme song, made by immortal Frankie Laine. (Between this and the theme "Maverick," I have Western themed songs that go over my head all day.) I look forward to every episode; I collect the entire set. A good time (not to mention a moon-ving experience) is always guaranteed, as one expects to see if the boys are going to fix their difficulties before advertising. Rollin, rollin, rollin "..."
