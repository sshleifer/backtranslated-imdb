I know some people think the movie is boring, but I do not agree. It's a very complex and extraordinary person's biography. I liked the characters in the film and I think leaving parts of Archie's life was a mystery that captured mankind. I do not think the purpose of a good biography should be to detail a person's life, but rather the complexity and relationships that make them interesting. And what's more fascinating than someone who successfully reinvented? "Men become what they dream of - you have dreamed well". Good job for Lord Attenborough. I also wanted to mention that Nathaniel Arcand really came out as a charismatic actor and I hope to see him in several films.
