My father was the prison guard (now retired now) presented in this documentary and I grew up in the prison life, so my opinions will probably be completely different from anyone else watching this movie. I will say this, the filming that brought us this miracle of 93 minutes are fantastic artists and even better people. They were brave enough for A) Show them and tell them this story B) Enter those inmates and hearts inside and C) Do all this responsible. Responsible for their art and, more importantly, the officer in charge of the detainees and the staff of the correction complex Luther Luckett. They should be praised endlessly for this work. To take 170 hours, give hours of recording and to be able to cut it and take it down to 93 minutes of riveting, there is nothing extraordinary and they have my utmost respect. I saw this film in circumstances that only very few could see. I went to the detention exam. I was in the same room with these men, while they saw how their hearts were spilled on the screen. I saw people crying on TV crying in the chair in front of me and letting me tell you it was a very profound experience. These men have committed terrible crimes in some cases, but have found ways to try to redeem, even if they feel unmotivated. How many of us have the courage to do this? How many people could do what they did in such a tough environment? To see them react to the movie was an experience for which I am eternally grateful and I will never forget this. I thank the people who allowed me to see this life, thank my father for making it possible, and thank Philomath Films for taking the time to pour out his blood, sweat, soul and tears into this project. /> <br /> This movie will change everything you think you know about life in prison, and the detainees care about him. "Oz" is not real, television is not real. "Shakespeare Behind Bars" is.
