It was originally meant to be a film that Gene Kelly will play, but when the producers could not get it, they got "the biggest actor in the world" and the result is pretty good. Basically, Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) has trouble doing what he does best, setting up a high stakes dice game, because he needs $ 1,000 to get the place. So to get the money he needs, he has a $ 1000 bet with old friend Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando) that he can not bring Sergeant Sarah Brown (Golden Globe Winner of Great Expectations and BAFTA nominated on Jean Simmons) Havana. Meanwhile, Nathan has trouble trying to get rid of the woman who wants to ask for her hand, Miss Adelaide (Vivian Blaine). Also, Robert Keith tries as Lieutenant Brannigan, Stubby Kaye as Nicely Nicely Johnson and B.S. Tile like Big Jule. An interesting romantic comedy, with Brando singing all of his songs, and Sinatra being smooth and cool. He was nominated for Oscar for best art film, best film, best costume and best music for Jay Blackton and Cyril J. Mockridge, was nominated BAFTA for the best film from any source and won the Golden Globe for Best Musical / Comedy Movie. Frank Sinatra was number 43 in the top 100 pop culture icons, Marlon Brando was number 30 in the top 100 of the top 100, he was the number 11 on the 100 biggest sex symbols, he was number four on 100 years, 100 stars - was number 35, and Brando was number one the world's biggest actor, "Luck Be a Lady" was number 42 per 100 years, 100 songs for, the film was the number 23 to 100 years of music. 100 greatest musicals. Very good!
