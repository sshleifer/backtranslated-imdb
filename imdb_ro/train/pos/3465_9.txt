I sat down to see this film with much excitement and hope. I did not think it would be possible for this film to rise to its subject. But he did absolutely, and then some. First of all, I have to say that Jared Harris did an extraordinary job like John Lennon. Sometimes it seemed that Harris channeled Lennon. The resemblance was often unexpected, and he clearly studied Lennon's manners and inflections. Aiden Quinn was good enough as McCartney also had a striking resemblance to Macca, though he occasionally made a trip over the Scouse accent. This fiction work has been well written and well conducted. It was a pure fantasy, of course, but sometimes I felt like a voyeur peeking through a keyhole at this meeting. The scene on the roof moved in particular, as McCartney told Lennon what he had never heard of as a child - that he was dignified and important and that he could never be guilty of having been abandoned by his parents. I also enjoyed the scene in the park where the two danced with absolute abandon at the reggae band! My only complaint would be: I'm not so sure John was just as cute as he was featured in the movie at this stage of his life. He had sat down pretty well in his domestic situation and, in fact, he was known to be very friendly when approached by fans. Only a few years later, he was very friendly when he was first approached by his assassin for an autograph on the day he was killed. For the most part, this movie has served to reawaken those feelings about what John might have lived a little longer. I'm sure the Beatles would have come back together at some point. And I'm pretty sure Lennon and McCartney will be friends today. Okay, VH1. I'll watch it again and again
