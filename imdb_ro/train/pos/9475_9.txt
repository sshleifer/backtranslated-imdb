The most satisfying element about Dan in real life is that the relationship between Dan (Steve Carell) and Marie (Juliette Binoche) makes sense and is extremely realistic. The distribution of Oscar winner Juliette Binoche as Dan's love interest was a superb decision; she is particularly talented, intelligent, naturally attractive and, thanks to kindness, aging properly for the party! If this movie had been done with Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson, it would have been a disaster. Another great thing about "Dan in Real Life" is that it's a perfect movie for adults who are interested in a mature comedy that leaves the three pillars of the frat pack: chickens, chauvinist boys and immersive jokes. "Dan in real life" is spiritual and has fun, he laughs intelligently all the way. While other comedies incorporate or rely almost entirely on jokes that shock their audience in laughter, the jokes from "Dan in Real Life" are more natural and smarter and involve public thinking. My only problem with Dan in real life is that the rebellious medieval daughter is played too scandalized by actress Brittany Robertson. It's hard to say whether this was a personal choice on her part or a director's choice. In any case, its character is unrealistic and annoying. But, this is just a minor flaw in the movie, and it is not taken from the story as a whole. <br /> <br /> In total, "Dan in real life" is a wonderful movie, a fantastic escape from the redundancy of offensive and offended comedies. The quality of the film, the director, acting and, in particular, cinema is excellent. It's just a beautiful, light-hearted comedy.
