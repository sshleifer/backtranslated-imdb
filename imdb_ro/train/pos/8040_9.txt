This will be somewhat short. First of all, do not listen to critics because it's not as bad as most say it is! Sniper uses a classic film formula, which many immediately reject as a defective film. While the sniper does not reflect the 100% truth about how our country's military snipers work, it gives those who do not know anything about the Professional Writer a look into the Sniper world. And yes, the movie has many flaws, but what movie does it have? There are many good scenes and good action by Tom Berenger. I have to say that the two worst scenes are at the beginning of the movie with Billy Zane in the helicopter followed by Zane in the Navy Bar scene. The best scene in the Sniper is with Berenger, in the middle of a field with the opposite force that shakes it! There are also plenty of good jungle pictures and some classic photos using the camera as if you were looking through a camera. And yes, the motto "Sniper" is "one shot, one killing." Sniper Judge for you! <br /> <br />
