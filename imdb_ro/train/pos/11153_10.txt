Violet, but naive, great Joe Buck leaves his home in Big Spring, Texas, and dives to Big Apple in search of women and big kids. In NYC, JB meets with frustration, and with Ratso Rizzo, a scary but cordial artist. In a way, this inappropriate pair succeeds in surviving each other, which in turn helps them both cope with an urban, sometimes brutal, urban America on their way to an abrupt ending. Both funny and depressing, Midnight Cowboy is heading for the whirlwind of the cultural change of the cyclone and thus confirms to the 1969 spectators that they themselves have been removed from the age of innocence of the 1950s and gave up Dorothy and Toto in the 1960s Aquarius. The direction of the film is master; pouring is perfect; the act is top; the script is clear and convincing; cinema engages; and music improves all the above. It was worth it, it won the best Oscar image since 1969 and I voted it as one of the best movies of that cyclone decade.
