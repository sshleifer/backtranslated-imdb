The home room really surprised me. Compared to other Columbine High School films, this is the best one. The rest room does not show school shooting, but rather the consequences and consequences of the community and the city. The film focuses on two opposite characters, Alecia (Busy Phillips) and Deanna (Erika Christensen). Alecia is a supporter who witnessed all of the filming. He does not seem to be excited about it. Deanna is a popular girl and the only victim who survived. Alec is forced to visit Deanna at the hospital for graduation. Meanwhile, the police are investigating Alecia because they knew the shooting would happen. Alena and Deanna are very different and do not understand at first. Finally, they develop a mutual understanding for each other and become friends. (very much in the style of the breakfast club). The living room looks nice to the power of approach and turbulence after a shooting school. I would recommend this movie to everyone and everyone.
