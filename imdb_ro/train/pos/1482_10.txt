Best movie about marriage and family. This is a very interesting reflection for couples who will come into the dangerous and paradoxical fascinating world of marriage and family. This decision may be the best or worst in our lives and in the lives of our children. The real intrusion or the help of "friends" - or the executioner if we leave -. The real role of families: they can help or destroy us. The crazy priest, who probably is not too crazy, says what can happen according to statistics and reality. A couple who thinks in a "special" marriage lives a painful story in their future history. Who likes the marriage of the contract? Nobody, after the priest says his own history? if I leave the future in other hands, if I do not know what marriage is. That the problems are true, that life demands a real commitment, guarantees, from each. That the true victims of divorce are children, really named Andrea in the movie or name. That abortion is just a slight exit: sadness, regret and unhappiness will be there after abortion. That state and social security each day think less about a real problem of families. Gossip of friends, infidelity due to Steffania's weakness and despair, because Tomasso lives his life as if he were alone. Maybe someone might think this movie is a pessimistic movie, but not. Steffania and Tomasso, deep in their heart, love a marriage and a beautiful family, if not, why do they like marriage? A true and beautiful marriage depends only on the couple: on each of their decisions, on each action in their lives. The family could be a place where everyone feels loved because he or she is, only through existence. The script is great. The performances are superb: Steffania and Tomasso, the almost cynical priest! An excellent direction and a scenario. The colors and management of the rooms, superb.
