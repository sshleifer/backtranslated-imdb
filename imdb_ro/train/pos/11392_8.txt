Paris is where you can enjoy a beautiful art and music and fall crazy in love - as is the case in this movie. The boy meets with a girl, falls in love, but something is in their way of eternal happiness, the classic story. George Gerschwin's wonderful music complements the great dance of Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron. "An American in Paris" is a joyful, heartfelt and loving movie that deserves to be forgotten. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
