I do not know why some people criticize this show so much. It's an extraordinary, funny show - it's probably not the right material for the mainstream primetime, but still ... <br /> <br /> The dynamics of the family is fun, and you'll see in most of the shows comedy. The supporting characters are absolutely hilarious. The parcels of Siegfried & Roy's individual episodes and jibs are just a little over the average, but you often have sub-plots or gaskets that make you rummage on the floor laughing. <br /> <br /> The show was well worth the 8 pounds paid for it. <br /> <br /> rating: 8/10
