Who would have imagined - Hal Hartley creates a film corollary for Syriana, while preserving his idiosyncratic signature style. The merger is very fun. After I did not see a Hal Hartley movie for about a decade, I approached it with little attention. His brilliant productions in the nineties impressed critics and the audience with their unique style and dialogue. The director's previous films featured colorful characters and gave close observations of life - often in Long Island, New York or even in New York City - who were uncomfortable and inspired. resulting from the description of this film as a "spy thriller". To my pleasant surprise, Hartley manages to craft her well-established style and focus on producing an extremely original drama of international intrigue. It works in many ways than can be imagined. Hartley's film keeps the dialogue and accent of character that are his marks, along with a singular cinematic style. In addition, it is very appropriate, given the current situation in the world and the state of war encouraged by dark elements on all sides. Hartley has brought all his skills to something new - a political film worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Syriana. Indeed he enters his own. Distribution makes a good job of interpreting Hartley's vision and style. Parker Posey fans will see it in full bloom here, still with us, even better and better than before.
