As a converted in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I try to absorb as much as possible from the history of my new religion. I was invited to participate in a presentation of this film with my sons and other young men and women as well as their families in our department. <br /> <br /> On a beautiful spring evening, I headed to Kirtland, Ohio in the historic village of the church, located there. We needed reservations at the Vistor Center to see this movie. Since watching my film was limited to some church documentaries, I was intrigued. The only "long films" of the church I saw were "Legacy" and "My Best Two Years", both of which I thought were very well written and preformed. the missionary interpreter killed the tissues saying that more people were deeply moved to the point of tears of this film. I thought "OK ... but it takes a lot to move to tears." Imagine surprise when I woke up crying! It is truly a very moving and inspired test for the Prophet Joseph Smith. See him and believe in his powerful message!
