An extremely pleasant, very imaginative and film story that turns into a story, Stardust tells the story of a young man who lives outside a fantastic world that enters her to find a little star fallen just to find that the star is alive, young and beautiful. A kingdom whose king is about to die said that the king is launching a competition on some of his sons to see who can recover his ruby ​​first to be king, while a trio of witches wants the star to escape and use them to keep them young. These three yarns plot together in the whole picture mixed with good effects, dazzling special effects and a solid and humorous feeling. Stardust is a fun movie and has some fun interpretations from those like Claire Danes as a star (I have been able to look at it for some time) to Michelle Pfeiffer (I could look at her even with magical powers) playing horrible sorcery for Robert Deniro playing a nancy-boy air pirate to perfection. Charlie Cox, as Tristan leader, is kind and credible and we get some very good stuff from a group of boys who play sons to be a king constantly and constantly trying to kill each other. Mark Strong, Jason Flemyng and Ruppert Everett play well roles both in life and in death (I love this whole thread). Peter O'Toole plays the role of killer killer father and follows Ricky Gervais, who made me laugh more than anything in the whole movie, shortly after five minutes. But the real strength of the film is Neil Gaiman's novel and the script made from his creative and fertile mind. Stardust creates his own mythology and his own world and works.
