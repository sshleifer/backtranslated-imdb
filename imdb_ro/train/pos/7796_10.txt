This was the first movie I've ever seen Ashley Judd and Victor Nunez's first movie I've ever said, and I'm glad I did it. "His quiet tone, his relaxed rhythm, the realistic image of a young woman who has just begun to live, a wonderful image of the struggles he must go to make his mark alive, the decisions he makes on the reality , the people he meets - is nothing wrong with this movie. It's just as close to the magic of movies as I've ever seen outside of Star Wars, and, considering what those movies are, it means that this film really deserves a high rating. Ashley Judds' actor, Mr. Nunez'writing, and his simple story, deserve to do this a great story and a wonderful movie.
