If you like adult cartoons such as South Park, then it's almost a similar format for the little adventures of three teenage girls at Bromwell High. Keisha, Natella, and Latrina gave explosive sweets and behaved like females, I think Keisha is a good ruler. There are also small stories with school teachers. There's the main idiot, Mr Bip, the nervous professor of mathematics and many others. The distribution is fantastic, Gina Yashere from Lenny Henry, Chris Eddie Chrissie Watts, Tracy Ann Ann, Smack The Doon Mackichan from Pony, Mark Perry from Dead Ringers and Nina Conti from Blunder. I did not know she came from Canada, but she's fine. Very good!
