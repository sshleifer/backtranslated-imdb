I came across the re-syndicated show of this show a few years ago and I fell in love with it. He presents TÃ©a Leoni and Holland Taylor and laughs, one episode after the other. I think it did not make it so big and it was canceled after a few seasons, but I think it was a good run and would suggest I look at her ... if the opportunity arises.
