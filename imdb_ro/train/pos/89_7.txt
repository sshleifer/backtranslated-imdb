To be honest, I had no idea what this movie was like when we started it. That's how I watch movies whenever possible. No preconceptions. I thought it would be a movie about stoners in the woods or something like that. I was wrong, kind of like. Loaded was a bit boring at first, but once it started to go, I really went mad. I know the feeling of being blown into something dangerous in which you feel helpless but doing things you do not want to do. Another user commented on how bad and implausible it was, but we begged to differ. This kind of thing is happening. I'm sorry, but not everyone lives in a dream world where nothing bad can happen and crazy situations are "implausible." I'm sorry, but the reality of the world is that it's happening. The creator of this film as well as the actors have done a wonderful job of describing how things can go wrong and how people can make very bad choices. Sometimes things turn out to be good, sometimes they turn out to be bad, and so is life. I highly recommend this movie.
