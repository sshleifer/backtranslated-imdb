I remember this game. He always stood on the shelves until one day I decided to try something new for a change and I took this game. I was looking at this amazingly, because it was the first PS1 game I ever owned, with 4 discs. When we played it, we could not put the controller down, seriously. The story of this game is so good and twisted, it's almost as good as Final Fantasy VII Story, and that's hard to accomplish. When you play the game, you get so involved in the characters it is incredible that it's just a PS1 game, as it feels like a movie. And I think it should be done in a movie. Too bad this game is a very unusual game and hardly anyone played or liked because it is one of those games that stands on the shelf heads, with a 50% signal standing, trying to sell. Well, I'm one of those people who always looks at the end, trying to get them and most of them prove to be very good. Heck, so we finally got Fantasy VII, looking for a catalog and finding it. But this is different from Final Fantasy. Legend of Dragoon is the only game or RPG that is better than most Square Enix games, surprising. I would not be surprised if it was done by Square Enix, but it is not. Almost all the games they play are better than the Final Fantasy series or the Dragon Quest series, but that's it. But what really bothers me is why it's very little known and not praised that should be. Graphics is pretty good for a PS1 game, but what can you expect from it? It's PS1 man, made in 1999. The story I've already mentioned is amazing, almost beating VII. Characters are amazing, you get involved so much in them and in their actions. A definition of 10 out of 10. Certainly deserved more praise and a very good RPG made by a company other than Square Enix.
