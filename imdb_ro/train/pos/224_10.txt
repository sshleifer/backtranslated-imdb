The Sunshine Boys is one of my favorite movies. I saw it for the first time when it was the Christmas attraction at Radio City Music Hall when it first came out and loved it ever since. I've come to see him six times in the theater, and if he played today, I'd go see him again. Many of the comments mentioned here mentioned the wonderful performances of the leaders. Matthau was brilliant, but he was unlucky to be nominated for Jack Nicholson's Oscars as Randall P. MacMurphy in "One Flew Over The Cocoon of the Cuckoo." Burns won, although Richard Benjiman deserved to be nominated at least. roles have been played to perfection, such as Fritz Feld's audition for potato chips advertising. Which brings me to my reason for reviewing this film, the direction of Herbert Ross, who has greatly underestimated. played the character "The Owl and The Pussycat" on screen and made a full movie out of it, doing it again. Opens the game pieces without making them a scenic shooting game. <br /> <br /> Here we have 20 minutes in the movie before it reaches the stage that opens the play, where Ben Clark comes to see his uncle and tell him about the special comedy. play in the first twenty minutes, the sequence itself is totally new. A few years ago I saw the resumption of the game with Jack Klugman and Tony Randall, which was great. But I think Ross and the screenwriter, playwright Simon have improved. It's just a great movie.
