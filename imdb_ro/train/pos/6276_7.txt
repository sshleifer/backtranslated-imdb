Weak, fast and multicolored, this is Valvoline's movie, you can actually see this brand of oil in a lot of scene. The real protagonist is the cars, the poor performance of Cage and Duvall. An intriguing Angelina Jolie is an unlikely mechanic. For lovers of dream machines (LAMBORGHINI and FERRARI everywhere).
