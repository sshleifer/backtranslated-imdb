This movie is so cheap, it's full of charm! With Ron Liebmann (Major Vaughn) offering the most fun diatribe on screen in the history of the film. I own 2 copies of this video on the video ... once, Ralph Macchio is actually caught up in the background at Major Vaugn while laughing at "Hash." Obviously, they forgot to edit this mistake in the film, but it shows how funny the movie is when actors can not keep a straight face!
