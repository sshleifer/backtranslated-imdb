First of all, I just want to say what a big fan of Bette Midler is. Stella is a great movie with a wonderful cast (Bette Midler, John Goodman, Trini Alvarado, Stephen Collins, Marsha Mason). This is one of my favorite movies of all time. She is dealing with a mother who grows up the baby on her own, goes through a lot of things that are not about to bring her daughter Jenny played marvelously by Trini Alvarado. This movie is very good and I suggest you pick up a copy to watch it. Roger Ebert gave 3 1/2 stars! And it's worth 4! WONDERFUL! I give him 4 of 4!
