I think they were telling the truth all the time ... I could not trust anything in the wild ... The family went through hell. These poor boys too young to understand what's going on around them. But we still have to deal with rumors. In addition to dealing with the loss of their younger sister. I can not believe this case has gone so long. It seems that the jury was unable to see the truth, even if it hit them on the bottom. I felt for this family and if I could say I hate what happened to them, I would.I have no idea what they went through, I can not even imagine. After watching this movie, I was in tears and I had to check my little girl in bed ... I think everyone should look at it.
