Mama Night is one of my favorite novels and will see that we are waiting for great disappointment. Instead, I got a film that portrays irony, humor, elegance and, above all, the crushing sadness of Vonnegut's novel. This is certainly the best performance of Nolte so far. He steadily captures Howard Cambell Jr.'s defeat and self-molare from the subtle intonations of his speech to the twisted tears behind his eyes. Alan Arkin is absolutely hilarious like George Kraft. Sherryl Lee haunts herself in her detachment of reality as Cambell's young boyfriend. John Goodman is undervalued and more than effective as Cambell "Blue Fairy Godmother." This Pinncioesque story by Cambell trying to be his own ideal hero and without becoming his ideal tragic villian is a mature and alive look at what we are like people. And, besides, it's one of the deepest romantic movies I've ever met. Cambell is the incarnation of both crazy love and wisdom. And to the painful conclusions, finally, he finally finds out what it means to be a true boy, just as God-mother of Blue Fairy gives him his wish. And he realizes that ... well, watch the movie and you will see. Mother Night is no doubt in my mind one of the best movies ever made. It's a beautiful poetic story that deeply digs into our emotions and is completely faithful to its original author.
