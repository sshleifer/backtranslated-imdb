I sat with my children when I watched this movie. We all have discovered that it's a very fun movie. When Billy goes to a new school, a fifth grade bully begins to end him, and that leads to worm eating. <br /> <br /> A bet is made and Billy has so much time to eat 10 worms or something else. From this point, the bully and his friends are trying to find ugly ways to cook, fry or bake the bulls to try to make Billy sick so he'll lose his bet. Billy remains strong and eating was much more and more of everyone, even of good friends. <br /> <br /> I do not want to tell you if you win the bet or not ... you just have to look at it to find out but I will think if you like good family movies, you like this . PS Let me add that this movie is not just for the boys, I have all the daughters and liked it very much.
