This movie is great. The plot is very true for the book that is a classic written by Mark Twain. The movie begins with a scene where Hank plays a song with a bunch of kids called "when I'm quitting your feet on the moon." It reminds me of the song of Sinatra High Hopes, it's fun and inspired. The music is great and my favorite song is played by King Hank (bing Crosby) and Sir "Saggy" Sagamore. OVerall a great family movie or even a great movie Date. This is a movie you can always watch. The princess played by Rhonda Fleming is gorgeous. I love this movie !! If you liked Danny Kaye in the Jester yard, then you will definitely want this movie.
