He enjoyed taking this movie on TV late late and kept my interest in the whole picture. This wonderful, yet mysterious scary journey with scary and mobile decorations and rooms that make you wonder why someone would like to rent this house or even own it. There are four (4) stories about this house and every resident of the house encounters all kinds of problems. You will notice the beautiful lake and pond around the house and also the sweet singing of the birds, but do not let you trick you, there is horror everywhere. Peter Cushing, "Black Jack," "80 gives an extraordinary show as one of those living in the house and even Christopher Lee, The Curse of the Purple Shrine," 68 and her daughter Chloe Franks (Jane Reid) a wonderful exciting story together , her daughter, for some reason, likes to read WITCHCRAFT BOOKS! If you like creepy, horrible and mysterious movies with lots of surprises, this is the movie for you !!!!
