Say what you want about schmaltz. A beauty of this film is that it is not pro-American. It is a morality about the fact that some Americans are called to high goals and how they came to this occasion. It's inspired because it's people of noble purpose. For me, the most interesting part of the film is the education of Fanny and David Farrelly (Bette Davis's mother and brother). As Fanny says, "I was shaken from magnolias." In the political climate of today, led by a president who lying shamelessly and who used 9/11 to reveal the most serious characteristics of human beings, we sank into the September 11th murderers to seek revenge thirsty blood. Bush can not be blamed - after all, we have allowed him to lead us in this direction and even rebuild it after his lies have been exposed. Now, with complete justification, we Americans are being blamed all over the world. Today, we are watching this film with a new consciousness: that the rise of power to the Nazis in Germany is not due to an error in the German character but a defect of human beings that allows us to rationalize anything that will justify our committing degrading and degrading acts . I do not compare George Bush with Adolf Hitler. But I emphasize how a leader can whip us into a frenzy of terror, hatred, and hyper-nationalism to do clever things. Unfortunately, the blackmail, which will do everything to be done for their own aggression, no matter how immoral, resembles the most with the leaders of our country, with those who support them and those who have buried their heads so deep into the sand, that they can not even be bothered to vote. A movie like "Watch on Rhine" reminds us of what we wanted to be - a force for improving humanity - and that we have in ourselves to aspire to high goals again. <br /> <br /> Geoff
