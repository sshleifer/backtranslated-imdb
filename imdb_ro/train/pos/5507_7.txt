I would not be surprised if Soderbergh was pressured to avoid the pre-revolution of Cuba being corrupted graphically as it was. Simply reciting some statistics will not do so with the younger crowd. However, the first part, which is almost shot in the jungle, captures the sensation of that place, especially when crossing the mountainous areas of Cuba. I liked Del Toro's interpretation of Che Guevara's personality. And the actor who plays Castro, Bichir, has also done a great job against all the chances. It is clear that Soderbergh does not regard these people, but it is clear that he will not leave the yanquis case away from the recent past. Some of the more important historical aspects contradict what I read. As far as I know, Castro has not judged the Soviet Union until all attempts to be accepted by the United States have been exhausted. But, in other respects, he is right, especially as regards the expulsions of the expatriates, as the island went through other rebel controls. The country's treasury was empty.
