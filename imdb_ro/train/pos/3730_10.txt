If you want to watch a movie and feel good watching it, then Tigerland is the movie for you. I like this movie from top to bottom. The perfect pictures of the scene of this film look so real; is almost like a documentary about something that happened in real life, but with drama. Boy, I tell you ... real drama, in fact, that they "fought" on one of the scenes (bring it on DVD to listen to its comment, it's not obvious). I see this movie as a bunch of desperate young people trying to get rid of a malicious destiny after watching Private Ryan I have an appreciation of what is a "distraught destiny" and I know exactly how the men in the movie feel. I see this movie as a cross between "Stand By Me" and "Save Private Ryan". What do men do when they are in a situation that is "hard pressed" in real life? Some men go crazy, some people cry, some people through their fists, others do drugs, some sleep at random with prostitutes trying mercilessly to remove the meaning of love in their lives, some try to drink pain, some jump off buildings or bridges, feel guilty, and others feel so agonized that they make them so bad they collapse - physically. This movie has all these desperate emotions rolled into a ball. But I do not misunderstand my depressing, realistic film, a very humorous film, Bozz (the character of Collin), full of amusement, and there are about 5 female actresses in the film; I'll let you know what's out there! Through dialogue, war / action sequences, perfect scene images along with the right music; this movie has everything, as I said: from top to bottom. I do not know why Tigerland is strongly under-credited. The best thing you have about the movie is that on the cover it says in the boldest writing "The Best Movie of the Year" and nothing falls down. Keep the rare stones at Hollywood, 10/10.
