This is an incredible comeback from film director Tsui Hark. It is one of several films that deserves to fit with Steven Chow's Shaolin Soccer. Since the beginning of the film, astronomical foundations have been moved to each edge and have been deposited in superb style. If you are a science fiction or Chinese martial arts "geek", you will love the excess amounts of many 3D effects and realistic weapons generated by the computer. There, there comes an excellent show (as always) from Ekin Cheung playing Sky King. He joins Louis Koo (Red), who was very impressed by his flexible "wings" that deviated from the attacks. The combat movements of these actors were perfect in all respects. Not only is the action superb, but it has a rather complex story. Many critics in this film complain about the lack of story / theme or just "scattered into random desert pieces" and even describe it as "Legend of Poo". However, the viewer can not rely on watching Dragon Ballz and other similar Manga Potters to understand this movie. Others who are familiar with Wu Xia will have a better name. Respectfully. there may be only one deficiency that may be foreseen. The blow that was delivered to the enemy at the last battle scene could be more and earlier accomplished. Despite all these things, we have to see them.
