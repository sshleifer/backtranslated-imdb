Marion Davies plays in this remarkable "Show People" comedy, released by MGM in 1928. Davies plays a hick from Savannah, Georgia, who arrives at Hollywood with her father (Dell Henderson). The jaw in which they arrive is a hoot - just like Davies's southern scandal. Davies sets up a job in the slapstick comedy, not what she wants but brings her success. He meets his colleague, William Haines, who is hit immediately with her. Well, Davies gets a job in a more prestigious studio ("High Art Studios") and places a job in exhaustion. A beautiful but fake actor (Andre Telefair) showed her the crap about being a typical Hollywood contender. Davies abandons her girlfriend and father for a good life, but of course she learns she is not who she is. Marion Davies is wonderful over time, while she - remarkably - runs the range of emotions needed for a "serious" actress. William Haines is his wonderful comedic comedy, and there are cameos by Charles Chaplin, John Gilbert and other celebrities of the day, including the director of the film, King Vidor. This is a silent movie with a few "sound effects" as the sound images just come in their own. A treasure of a movie.
