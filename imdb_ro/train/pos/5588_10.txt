The first time I had the opportunity to see that this classic, yet forgotten, was again in the early 1980s, at one of our art houses as a rebirth. When I looked at the fever dream about an exercise in sexuality in the 1930s, I thought about YOWZA! They disappeared with murder in Europe that day. Unfortunately, this film was severely cut off in the original US release by Hayes Blue Bureau (government censored government, begun by the more holy bible than you, Will Hayes ... a former official of the Post, if you can think) due to the general theme of human sexuality (Heaven's forbidden men did sex in the 1930s). Ecstasy refers to a young woman (played by Hedy Lamarr) who marries a much older man and then regrets. She (Lamarr) meets a prettier man and has an affair with him, resulting in a divorce from her previous husband (another not in the Hollywood movies of then --- Divorce!). Despite the fact that the film was produced in 1933, it was probably the first time the director worked in sound format (that is, the film seems to have techniques that were mostly used in silent movies - 1920s Expressionism). It is still worth looking for a window in the early photographs of Europe, along with Luis Bunuels L'Age Dor (1930) and "Vampyre" (1931) by Karl Gustav Dryer. It is not rated, but it contains the infamous nude scene of naked swimming and some thin sexual references that would be no less than a PG-13 according to current standards (but would have succeeded in easily landing the "X" back in the 30's , if it existed then)
