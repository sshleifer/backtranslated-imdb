I remembered seeing this movie when I was a kid on a wonderful day in the wonderful world of Disney. This movie has been in my memory for over 30 years and I've been looking for it. I should have said that out of all the children's films I saw then, it was more than all, and after seeing it just once, I hoped to see it again. The story and pictures of this movie were burned in my memory. Until now, I have never seen it since that day in the 1970s, in fact, I never remembered the title until an Internet search revealed it to me today. I liked it and I want the kids to see it. Does anyone know where to find her?
