This is simply the most funny movie I've seen for a long time. Worry actors, inappropriate scenarios, bad landscapes, bad outfits, inappropriate camera work, and bad bad effects are so bad that you find yourself laughing. So you won 't win an Oscar, you got beer and friends, then you can not go wrong.
