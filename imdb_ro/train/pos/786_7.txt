Andie MacDowell's facial expressions are again great in this film. When you are 40 years old and you have been alone for a while (or all your life), you may feel lost. The film is a sweet reminder that love can be found anywhere if your antennas are actively active. I liked the quick sex meeting, which must be out of character for a schoolteacher, normally reserved (MacDowell). Her former student is pretty cute, who still has a defeat on his teacher for so long. <br /> <br /> There are a few parts that I considered quite unrealistic or impractical. For example, in a scene where the jealousy of other women is overwhelmed and a scene was made to make Andie MacDowell take the young man, a mature policeman (MacDowell's other friend) will allow his girlfriend to make a act so sinister? Is it so easy for nobody to stop in front of a car? Of course, the accidents happen all the time, but I hoped to see the heroine marrying happily with the first man he was involved with (that was the hardest to believe! Because a woman so beautiful to stay alone for so long) ... Perhaps movie makers are aware that a lot of romance between an older woman and a younger man does not last long. Apart from them, I know that a happy end would not appeal to the public, especially to jealous women over 40, who are waiting for miracles to happen. The sadness that ends with a look of hope for the sad woman who has lost her true love is sweet, but if man were to continue to live, would it last? For how long? Nobody knows. However, it is a movie that makes you want to look back again later .... a year later.
