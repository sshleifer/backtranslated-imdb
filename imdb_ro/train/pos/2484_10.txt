Olivier, Kosentsev, Richardson, Coranado, Zefferelli and Almerayeda directed Hamlet, but only Branagh is the one who succeeded. This is the only "Hamlet" film that contains the entire four-hour story of William Shakespeare and offers a unique feeling to the whole story. Not many directors could do this without bothering their audience, but Branagh's abusive use of bravado film style and stunt casting allows people to see the importance of scenes that are usually cut. Examples of this include Gerarde Depardue as Ranyaldo who the whole purpose in the movie was simply to say "yes my lord" as Polonius asks him to spy on Leartes. This also includes Billy Crystal as a grave tomb, Robin Williams as Oscar, Jack Lemmon as Marcellous, and Charlton Heston as actor. The performance of Branagh Act 4 scene 4 soliloquy (which again is usually cut out) is just a cinematic miracle, as the room slows down while increasing intensity. It's a scene that made me want to get rid of my chair and start applauding. Branagh is the only filmmaker to understand the importance of each scene in this movie and was able to convey this importance to the general audience. This is an idea that must be seen for all those who enjoy a good story saying, a brilliant action and an incredible direction. All these parts of William Shakespeare's greatest triumph.
