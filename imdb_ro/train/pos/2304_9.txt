I thought this movie was very well done. Made in the mid-1950s, everything seemed right to me. It was well discarded and credible. Usually I do not care much about this type of movie because they have no depth, but I felt that this movie came in characters and you felt how they felt, you got to know them and care about them. She took me back to my youth and allowed me to remember a more innocent time. This movie could be enjoyed by both men and women and by all age groups. After the movie was over, I wanted to be a part two. I wanted to know what happened to Dani and her family. This movie is bound to be a classic. If you have not seen it, you should try to catch it when it's on TV or rent it ...
