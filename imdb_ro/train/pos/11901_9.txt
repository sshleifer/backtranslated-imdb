As far as I remember, Balanchine's changes to Tchaikovsky's score are as follows: 1. The final section of Grossvatertanz (a traditional song played at the end of a party) is repeated several times to give children a last dance before their stage completed. 2) A violin solo, written for but removed from Tchaikovsky's Sleeping Beauty score, is interpolated between the end of the party scene and the beginning of the transformation scene. Balanchine chose this music because of his melodic relationship with music for the growing Christmas tree that appears shortly thereafter. 3) Solo for the Snow Cavalier of the Sugar Child is eliminated. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that Balanchine has somehow misinterpreted Tchaikovsky's high score.
