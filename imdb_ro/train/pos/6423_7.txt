This film is a tremendous laughing revolt that incorporates all the usual ingredients of a comedy Dawid Dhawan - scary heroes, scary characters, heroes made for heroes, evil villains, wisecracks, rock soundtrack + choreography and a small dose of action. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan and Govinda both are in double roles of cops and men. Amitab's heroine, the policeman, is Ramya Krishnan, and Raveena is against Govinda, the cop. Heroines are simple rouge props, as usual. Humans do not have heroines. Paresh Rawal performs his evil act in DAUD before (played a similar Don in KHOOBSURAT as well). Asran shines in a short role. He makes a resumption on his famous act "Angrezon ke zamaane ke Jailer" in SHOLAY. The Govinda is impeccable, as usual - as a benevolent policeman, Pyaare Mohan and a conman Chhote Miyaan. It mimics the style of the binaries of Hindi speech with hilarious results. Amitabh Bachchan, believe it or not, stops in comparison with him. But AB is still good. Madhuri Dixit makes a cameo like herself in the song "Makhna". Dance like the wind. <br /> <br /> Viju Shah's music is great. Check out "Kisi Disco Mein Jaayen", "Makhna" and title track. Do not go looking for a LOGIC because it's a comedy and the script is completely comfortable. Enjoy yourself.
