It's a shame that she did not get screen credit, she has by far done the best job in the movie, she has the face on the cross, the best part of the film. It had a far greater impact than Avril, or almost anyone else in the movie. Almost made S / M look fun! She was really credible with the S / M model that is scared of her situation. Although they seem to be really confused with that sense of feeling to look for a bad guy, those sets were very well built, but they just pulled the surface of what was shot. This is a movie in which both cuts should be made available. They seem to have left some of what was shot and almost all the very dark things that would have made the movie much more demented. In the way they prevented them from stopping the mark that he was going to make during the filming. What was shot would not have obtained a R rating, probably a NC-17 or X, but that would have been necessary to make the film as it should have been.
