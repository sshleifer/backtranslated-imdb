Some of the features of this movie give it right away. The sound is rather shining and it is clear what progress has been made in reproducing sound in the years to come. The language of the dialogue is quite strange and unnatural, and the acting still remembers its transition from the stage techniques. Bette Davis always offers strong performance in all of her films, as she does in this early period of her successful career. However, I feel that somehow the cockney accent does not match the expression of the face. I think it's the cockney accent that does not sound true to me. Somerset Maughan likes to enlist in human relationships of extremely dramatic intensity, which will delight all those who strive. As in many of her character's roles, Bette Davis can move from a beautiful seductive woman to a hateful viper. Leslie Howard is well interpreted as the retired English artist with a club foot desperately looking for a partner and making a bad choice in a small waitress. Before the end of the film, the young doctor meets his true love on a crowded street. He crossed the traffic without realizing a lot of horns and whistles screaming at them. This scene may be fun, but I find it ridiculous in this very serious film. He's probably sending you home with a smile on his face. And after all, as we can see (and hopefully), it is a happy ending.
