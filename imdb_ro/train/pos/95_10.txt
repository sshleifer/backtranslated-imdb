I have a copy of it on the bad VHS in good condition that I transferred to DVD and if anyone wants to bring back the memories of a classic Christmas please send me to dmd2222@verizon.net.i searched all over and I have not found nothing on this and I thought I could not be the only one on this planet that has this classic on tape have to be other people and if they fit with them being very few that has this classic, so i feel lucky and i have all Christmas muppets except one that John denver did with muppets again think it's called a fumos mountain vacation im not to be sure but close.
