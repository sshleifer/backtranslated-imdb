I was so excited to see this movie because I always heard it was very scary. What is interesting is that it's a Japanese movie they've decided to bring to America, but they actually shot Japan with the original crew! I think this has made the movie ... more Japanese (probably for what it managed to be quite successful, unlike most Japan-America horror flops), but made it a little inaccessible to the American public. The difference in what scares Japanese culture and what scares American culture has been felt throughout the film. This worked well when they wanted to capture the nervous fear of the main character: a frightened fish in a large, busy, unusual pond, Tokyo. The story was pretty confusing. Typically, Japanese is extremely complicated and confusing. The beginning of the film is actually the middle of the story and from there we constantly move back and forth until, at the end of the film, we see the end and the beginning of the whole story. This constant overturning of time was very confusing to me. I also did not think that some things explained so well and had to ask my friend to explain them (she already saw it, and the sequel that apparently reveals more of the story). <br /> In general, there are plenty of American publications to love, tons of strange images and macabre details that a healthy splash of jump scenes.
