This is a decent example of noir film. The setting is the early 50's with the Communists trying to steal the weapons secrets from the US government. Richard Widmark is the pocket of unscrupulous suave. It offers quite decent performance, but there is nothing A-List about it. The interesting thing was that he was not just an anti-hero, but by most of the film, an inappropriate anti-hero. That's not very normal. Jean Peters has made such a good performance as the prostitute with the heart of gold. This great actress Thelma Ritter shines like the dove of the seat. The plot had a fair share of overturning and misinterpretation, noises, and tough talk. There is a battle scene close to the end of the movie (in the metro station) that was pretty quaint and interesting. I think noir fans (like me) will enjoy this movie. In the case of viewers who have no night vision, it might seem a little dated, and the whole thing of Commie was upset.
