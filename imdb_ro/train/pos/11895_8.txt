Tea Leoni plays Nora Wilde, a serious photographer who goes through a bad divorce. He wants freedom, but it comes at a cost. He wants to photograph legitimately, but he's committed to working for tabloids as paparazzi. Her boss is interpreted by the wonderful and divine Holland Taylor. The show was well written most of the time. Nora from TEA began to develop into a memorable character, but the network simply did not support the comedy and I still do not. Even when they brought George Wendt from Cheers, they made unnecessary changes in casting and characters. The show was good at the beginning, and the audience got used to it, but then the network makes it a bad plastic surgery.
