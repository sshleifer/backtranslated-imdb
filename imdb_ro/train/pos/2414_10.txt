Monarch Cove was one of the best Friday evening drama that has been featured for a long time. I ask the writer to write a long series and transport him for life, SOON. Each person was very interesting and did a great job, the plot becomes reality. However, the movie must continue for a long time. I would love to see Bianca's and Jake's child grow up and have a major role in the film, alongside the new grandmothers who are planning the educational future. Also, bring Kathy back to see her niece and help her develop her life. It was great to see that grandparents are solving their problems, but the family business needs to be restored to work and see how Jake and Bianca survive marriage years.
