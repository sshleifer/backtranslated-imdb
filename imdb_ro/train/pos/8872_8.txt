This is the first movie I've seen of John Singleton and he's a pretty good director. The movie begins with a bunch of arrival and shows what's happening to several of them. Omar Epps plays a role with a partial scholarship and has a hard time keeping up with his work. He is a friend of Ice Cube and beings who meet Tyra Banks. Kristy Swanson is a rich girl who is raped and becomes a girlfriend with Jennifer Connelly, a lesbian, and she is not sure where to go. Michael Rapaport is a child from Idaho, who falls with a group of neo-Nazis, and their leader is Cole Hauser. These are the three main characters, and Laurence Fishburne is a professor of political science who is trying to help. It's a great movie and it's regrettable that the studio had to make more movie cuts.
