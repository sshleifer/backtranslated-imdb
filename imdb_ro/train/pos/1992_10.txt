I'm in the midst of watching this 40-year-old film and wondering what my grandchildren are going to watch 40 years ago, an old saying, but they do not do it anymore ... they're not just the story, her music, acting so both young and old ... it seems that they were born to play their roles, the young oliver, the old Fagin ... to name them all, the role played by oliver judge standing before, I saw in other roles over the years ... artfulful Dodger, Ron moody like Fagin, Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, the film not only won 5 Oscars, but also got golden prizes at the Golden Globe too ... if you decide to see this movie .. do a favor, take a few if not all the children, to see this masterpiece
