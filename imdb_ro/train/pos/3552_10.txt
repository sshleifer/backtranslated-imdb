I just want to add my two values ​​and forgive me if I repeat something that has already been posted, but I feel it worthwhile reminding people of the genius of Damon Runyon. Without the wonderful streets, the hilarious writings of Damon Runyon, this film would never have been accomplished - not even most of the other classics dealing with gambling and the like before 1960. Damon Runyon worked as a newspaper man and was from Colorado, but he certainly made the street scene of the east coast. If you are not a fan of Hollywood old comedies, I would recommend some other films from Damon Runyon's writings; "Lemondrop's Child" and "Little Miss Marker," both present to Bob Hope, who, in addition to his politics, has always been a funny man. (As a liberal on the west coast, I find the politics pretty funny!) Damon Runyon lives !!!!
