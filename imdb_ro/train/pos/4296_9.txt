This would have been my first film for 1991, except for being beaten by JFK brilliant. This is a great movie! I liked. I like stories where the lives of different characters intersect with others and how they deal with their lives. Kevin Kline is good here but he is brilliant by Danny Glover and, above all, by Steve Martin. I did not like Martin or his style too much, but here's great. I enjoyed all the speech he gave to Kline near the end of the Grand Canyon. The writing was excellent. Larry Kasdan is, IMO, a great dialogue writer along the paths of Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino. Here, he has formed several three-dimensional characters and thoughtful thoughts and messages that give a positive feeling to our lives. A really great movie. 4 of 4 stars
