Judy Davis shows us why she is one of Australia's most respected and beloved actors - portraying a lonely and unmanaged nomad is of prime importance. Claudia Karvan, a teenager, also gives us a look that might make her the most popular actors in this country in the years to come, with future roles in THE BIG STEAL, THE HEARTBREAK KID, DARING ENEMY, RISK and the TV series SECRET LIFE OF US. (Karvan, in his childhood, was a young girl whose Panda toy had been stolen outside a chemist shop in the 1983 drama GOING DOWN with Tracey Mann.) If these movies come in the way, make sure you see it! Rating: 79/100. See also: HOTEL SORRENTO, RADIANCE, VACANT POSSESSION, LANTANA.
