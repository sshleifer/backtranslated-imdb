What a real and quite unexpected experience. This is a true thriller movie. I rushed into the video store, grabbed a movie without reading the whole blur on my back and hoping to have the best results. I was completely surprised and delighted. I really liked their actors and their characters. I thought they all gave great performance and made their characters realistic. The plot was well thought out, well written and directed. I've been interested in you from the beginning to the end and I've never been bored for one minute. I highly recommend the film to those who like thrillers, especially the thrillers that are well-placed and those that cut your attention. Definitely a 10 out of 10 from me.
