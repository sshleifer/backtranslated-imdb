I grew up on this film and I remember when my brother and I played in the back yard and we pretended to be in the Care-lot. Now, after so many years, I'm going to see the movie with my daughter and see how she enjoys it. If you are a parent and you have not watched this movie with your children, then you should just to keep them in your arms and watch them be excited by bears of care and batch care! The songs, especially "Forever Young", are very sweet and memorable. Parents, I recommend this movie to all children so that she can learn how good it is to care for others! When it comes to all the trash cans on the TV, you can raise your children to have the right frame for life with movies like these.
