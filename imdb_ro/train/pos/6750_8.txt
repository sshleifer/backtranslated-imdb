This is a very well-done film, directed with meticulousness and excellent behavior that sometimes moves deep - for example, the stage with the loyal but unsophisticated policeman and his wife. The land is convincing and interesting. The gangster character is particularly interesting and plays an almost metaphysical role in the hero's life. It was made clear that the cops are as harsh and ready as the characters of the underworld. Some light bookings: I found it to be unilaterally terminated because it celebrates the hero's successful integration into the structure of the police and justice system, which collapses the ambiguity of the police characters that have been maintained until that time. We also found that a main female character is weak: a little more than a catalyst for the hero's salvation, all he seems to do is cry and bend, because the good boys fight him.
