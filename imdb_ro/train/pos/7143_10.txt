"Holes" is my favorite movie all the time! So far I have seen this movie three times in theaters and look forward to buying it on DVD in September. I read the book after watching the movie and I was amazed at how similar the book and the film were. The director of this film has done an excellent job of re-creating the film in the form of a film. Also, all the actors selected to play the roles played their characters, especially Max Kasch as ZigZag. Props for all involved in making this film was a real success! 10 out of 10 stars, I definitely recommend for everyone to see!
