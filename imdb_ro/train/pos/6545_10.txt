I really liked this movie. Most reviews were bad, but most critics think a movie should be like a drama of ideas. This movie has a bit of drama, but the rest is just fun and fun. Look at Julia Roberts being a beautiful woman, Emma Roberts is a beautiful young woman and she has more for her than for her. Emma was so fun to look at Nancy Drew's role. It is good to see a new face. I think she will go away. Nancy Drew may not rely on books, but the story is still good. There is also a good combination of other actors and supporting actors such as Pat Carroll, Barry Bostwick, Rachel Leigh Cook and Chris Kattan - were not credited. I'm surprised that Disney has not released this movie. Some people may not like this movie because it does not contain sex, violence and curse. This is a good family film that is rare in this day in time. So take your family, watch this movie and judge for you how well it is. I can not wait for the continuation.
