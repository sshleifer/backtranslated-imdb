Why a good actress like Elizabeth Berkley plays in this regular movie ??? !!! The cast has a good performance (Elizabeth Berkley as a girl with Barbie, They Keats as a girl without a mother and Justin Whalin, an eternal type less affected by his annoyance) but the direction is extremely dull and the story is NOT so interesting and original. I can not believe a movie like this was produced for the big screen! Julie Corman (producer): Are you CRAZY ??? !!!
