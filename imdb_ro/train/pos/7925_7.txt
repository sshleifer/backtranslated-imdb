The horror movie is indeed very funny. Yes, he has his dead moments, it may be a little too obvious, he's getting a bit lower in the second half, and the story is an incoherent mess, but he laughs noisy all the time. And it's worth seeing Ed McMahon just like a right wing. This movie is in the same class as Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, another incredibly funny, under-appreciated movie.
