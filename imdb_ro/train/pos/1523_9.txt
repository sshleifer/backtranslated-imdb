GBS has written his own adaptation of the Nobel Prize for this award, but has not lived to see him (he won an Oscar in 1938 for the brilliant adaptation of his play PYGMALION in 1914). When Otto Preminger created this production in 1957, seven years after Shaw's death, he remarked that British author Graham Greene made this adaptation and was a solid choice. Taking a sign from Shaw's own script, Greene uses the epilogue of the scene to create a framing device to combine the two pieces of the play (one early and one late in Joan's story) into a unified whole and the most satisfactorily whole. If the pitch change is buffered with a pause, it works just as well on returning to KING Charles Balois' bedroom (where the man Joan puts on his throne dreams of the events that led to his current situation ) and more material from Shaw's Epilogue - introducing Warwick's shadow, John Gielgud ("the English director"). Most of the language is solid GBS, and the performances of the Sushi falcons (such as Felix Aymler's Inquisitor or Harry Andrews of Stogumber) for the new relatives (Jean Seberg's career) are the first rate. It's possible that some, familiar only with many villains of Richard Widmark's movie, to see him play a fragile Dauphin and somewhat foolish, but the performance - strangely top - is professional, even if it is a mischief. the opening credits symbol and the director's choice to use the visual vocabulary of black and white filming all serve Shaw and the story well. Go wait for quality entertainment and you will not be disappointed.
