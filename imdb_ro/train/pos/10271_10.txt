This film is not to be compared to "The Sting," or other caper / heist / con movies. What makes such a great film experience is what it has to say about relationships, deception and trust. It is also a rather shy critique of psychiatry, as the female protagonist is a psychiatrist who is so easily deceived and then acts in such a primitive manner in the final. Did Mr. Mamet have an unhappy experience in therapy? Highly recommended!
