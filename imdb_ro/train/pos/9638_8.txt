This movie was more of a man-made passage for a gay man and how he has to deal with everyone. His mother is depressed, his younger sister is a pain, his older sister accepts somewhat. The relationship looks good with his lover / exhooker and lets his family try to live with this first guy. Unfortunately, the new guy revolves around him and says he really does not mean anything. Our young homosexual goes and ends in the trash and finally leaves, taking his new lover and starting from the beginning. I stayed with him starting and looking, without participation, in happiness. So maybe things will go better for him in the future. The end was a kind of downer, but the movie was completely realistic, so I'll leave this true high-end sliding.
