I liked this movie. It was fun, cute, silly and fun. It had a fine distribution and it was really knocked by some critics for reasons that I really do not understand. No, it was not "Grapes of Wrath" or "Casablanca" or even "Moonstruck," but it was a nice film. Julia was excellent playing the psychotic man behind the man. The story is a little stupid to be sure, but that's not great drama, folks. I met a review of the movie, probably the only one she received, and then ran the night she searched for a movie. I did not hear it should smell until I saw it and I'm glad I saw it. Eventually, he bought the VHS tape on the bargaining pile, and I track her a few times a year.
