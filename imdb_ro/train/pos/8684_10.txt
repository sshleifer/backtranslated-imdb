This is one of the first and best Columbus, with Robert Culp and Ray Milland. Robert Culp appeared on another Columbo, as well as other villains, including Patrick McGoohan, William Shatner and Jack Cassidy. Ray Milland also made a later appearance. In this case, Ray Milland is convinced that his beautiful wife, played by Patricia Crowley, has an affair, so he hires Culp to investigate. Culp has a blackmail business, so he gives Milland a false report and threatens Crowley with the real if he does not pay. They enter a huge fight in Culp's house and she's spinning killed. Enter Columbo. Culp does everything he can to get Columbo off the case, including giving him a job, but Columbo is from him from the start. Excellent episode.
