The Titanic movie makes it much more than a "night to remember." She writes a tragic historical event that will always be discussed and will never be forgotten. Why was he so criticized? I have no idea. They could / will ever make a movie like the Titanic, which is so exciting and exciting every time you watch it. It could ever replace such an epic masterpiece. It will be almost impossible. The director undoubtedly had the major impact on the film. A simple disaster movie (boring to watch) turned into an unbelievable story. Yeah, I'm not a romantic guy, but that should not bother you, because you'll never see a love story like that. Guaranteed! Everything for stunning effects, for music, for the sublime actor. <br /> <br /> The film creates an amazingly visible and a wonderful feeling. Everything looks very real and alive. The legend itself "TITANIC" is shown brilliant in all classes, looks too much, and accommodation. The act was the real effect. Dicaprio and Winslet are simply the best in their roles. Nobody could have done better. These are partly the reason why the movie is so great. <br /> <br /> I think it's not too much to talk about. The film is simple, the act is brilliant, based on a true story. Perhaps more than half of consumers watching the movie will share tears, thanks to an imaginable end that can never be forgotten. Well, if you have not seen this movie, you miss something Hesterical and a Hollywood idol movie. Could it be better? Not at all. The most moving film of all time, do not listen to people, see for yourself, then you will understand. A landmark. (do not be surprised if you cry too)
