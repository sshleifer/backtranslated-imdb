After seeing Arthur on television countless times, I laughed so hard that Dudley Moore's role, in which Arthur was a drunk beat millionaire, was hysterical, but John Gielgud as his servant brother / father Hobson was just as charming. I bought the DVD a few weeks ago and I saw it, despite the passing of nearly 27 years, is still as enjoyable as ever was Liza Minnelli's role because love interest was fascinating in terms of chemistry of the two was magical. /> Arthur Bach, (Moore) is a drunk, drunk millionaire who has a bill that reads as a national debt he does not want to raise and enjoys acting like a child. His activity is supervised by his English heiress, Hobson (Gielgud), apparently no one cares about Arthur, except Arthur's father (Barbour) offers an ultimatum if he does not marry Susan Johnson (Eikenberry) weeks will cut her son's inheritance of $ 750 million. However, Arthur meets and falls in love with Linda Marolla (Minnelli), a waitress and a working class companion, now confronted with a difficult decision to marry for love or money. When Hobson dies, Arthur grows up and stops with Susan before the wedding, leaving him to keep both his money and his true love. Arthur is a truly romantic comedy for everyone
