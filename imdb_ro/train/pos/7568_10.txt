He saw the last day of the festival and I was glad that I was around for two days. Poetically, moving and, most surprisingly, funny, in his weird way. It is so rare to see directors working in this style who are able to find true strange and humor in a hyper-realistic world, without seeming precious or upsetting the balance. It seems to be both improvised and completely controlled. She has hesitated to make comparisons because these directors have digested their influences (Cassavetes, Malick, Loach, Altman ... the usual suspects) and have found their own unique style, but if you like modern directors in this tradition (Lynne Ramsay , David Gordon Greene), you are looking for a true living. This is a great movie and I hope more people come to see it. If this movie plays in a festival in your town, go! go! go!
