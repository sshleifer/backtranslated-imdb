My 14-year-old is extremely happy that they are now able to make fantastic fantastic movies and that they are all angry, what with Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and the Chronicles of Narnia, money at the box office. This year he will see (and already saw) more, especially the Golden Compass, which has the most interesting trailer I've seen this year. Stardust, based on a novel by Neil Gaiman, appeared in theaters this week with just a little more than a viewing. I have not seen any previews, just a few ads. The critical reaction is a kind of blah. I would not even have seen it if not because I had to wait for a friend to see The Bourne Ultimatum and that nothing interesting was opened this weekend. If you forgive the horrible game, the stars should have been well aligned, because I went to see Stardust and liked it. It's not a huge movie like the Lord of the Rings. The parcel line is your very fantastic basic quest (the hero begins to look for a fallen star) full of obstacles. But, within this basic sketch, the story is lively and imaginative. It simply aims to be a lot of fun and a charming love story. And he succeeds with marvelous. This summer there were a lot of great movies, but none of them was as fun as this one. There is much happening, but the story is well said and is almost entirely coherent. It's not a masterpiece, but it certainly can handle the same kind of field that has something like "The Princess Bride" (although I do not like that much like the previous movie). A lot of fun to have here if you're a fan of the genre.
