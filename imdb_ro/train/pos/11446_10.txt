Right now I watch this movie for the second time (on TV) and for the second time I fell into it when it was running for an hour already (I think I saw 2 more minutes this time) This movie it's really impressive, the way Goldsworthy looks at nature, change nature in a way you never would ever think, it's really amazing. The whole movie gives you a warm feeling, seeing him play with the world around him with such love. Or just seeing your hands, covered with dirt and broken nails, only touches you.
