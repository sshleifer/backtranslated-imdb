Along with Star Wars and The Wizard of Oz, it remains one of the greatest fantastic movies ever made. It is a real shame that it is not as well known as previous films (perhaps because it relies on a story based on legends rather than on contemporary or science fiction and is British, that is, a smaller market for movies ) I know it deserves this reputation. Like all the great family movies, it can be a kid, an adult or even a teenager to enjoy this movie (currently there are 18), but we have to appreciate classic movies first. I absolutely love this movie. He has an extraordinary music score by Miklos Rozsa (perhaps my favorite classic score), rivaling with any John Williams "Star Wars" score, a fast but not brilliant rhythm, beautiful sets, dialogue and color use (both sets , and Oscar-winning cinematography) and the latest-generation special effects that have won the Academy Award (for now, and some are still stunning). And, of course, the suffocating appearance of June Duprez, in which the princess rivals Catherine Zeta-Jones' (she even looks like Jones in a way!) In conclusion, this is one of all-time film (alongside "Robin Hood's Adventures") and deserves more attention. It's a true adventure of year-round excitement and along with "Robin Hood," is the island's island movie that we could watch always without annoying me Stars: **** (excellent)
