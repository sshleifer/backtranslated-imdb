Christina Raines plays a wonderful model in New York looking for a new apartment and starting to meet with foreign neighbors and revealing a secret about the building and building herself up to a climax all the way to the end of the movie. This film has all sorts of neatly plotted stories from the Roman Catholic Church to the devil, the gateway to hell, bizarre rituals, a growing conspiracy, and finally a series of talented actors and actresses that flood the film . We have Garda, Burgess Meredith, Chris Sarandon, Jerry Orbach, Deborah Raffin, Arthur Kennedy, Jose Ferrer, Slyvia Miles, Beverly DeAngelo, Eli Wallach, Martin Balsam, Christopher Walkin, William Hickey, Tom Berenger, Jeff Goldblum. forgets John Carradine as an old priest. Many of these actors face him - especially Burgess Meredith, offering comic / dementia performance as one of the neighbors with a small bird and a cat. Meredith is memorable, like Balsam and Chris Sarandon. Some performers have nothing to do with Jose Ferrer in a novel role, even if it's nothing but a cameo. Sentinel is a horror movie with lots of psychological elements and truly terrifying scenes. The final scene is repellent and yet cold. I find myself guilty of some of the free sex and violence in the film, especially the whole scene with DeAngelo and Miles. Was it really necessary? I do not think. Also, the father / daughter thing was a little bit good, but generally the movie works and has a winning rhythm. Director Michael Winner is doing a job similar to workers and is effective to create moments of tension and scary film. Scenes with Carradine are particularly effective.
