One is tempted to define the genre of Gert de Graaf's film as an "event of thought" after Merab Mamardashvili's example. The narrative story is a certain torture attempt by Bart Klever for that ephemeral substance that is the essence of personality. The script for his new film is contoured simultaneously on his computer and his imagination. This film monologue came in response to Fellini's "8 Â½" and cost 13 years of work by Gert de Graaff. With real and fictitious emotional play, as well as with the audience, it reveals the capricious interconnection of reality and imagination, paradoxical coexistence in two different galaxies: that of Guttenberg and that of MacLhuen. For some time we are able to be part of the writer's script, who thinks the cause of misfortune is the cursed stereotypes of the mass mentality ("man," "Catholic," "window washer"). And with him, we enter into a trap when the creative author finally faces the insoluble dilemma: how can he be removed from the future film. Bart Klever? Only five minutes before the final due to the minor minor reproaches of the creator's wife, who is deeply confronted in the work, we realize that together with the main character we were again "framed". Indeed, what is the price of art, for the sake of which it is acceptable to give up your young daughter's own name and daily care? So who is he, this Bart Klever? Is he a brilliant prophet or someone possessed as Frenhoffer in Balzac's masterpiece (just like the last writer wiping everything from the memory of his computer all he wrote)? Gert de Graaff suggests that we answer this question to ourselves. <br /> <br />
