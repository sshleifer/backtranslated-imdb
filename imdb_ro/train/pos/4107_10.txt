I liked this movie! It is really bizarre, extremely funny, morbid, spiritual ... It does not make sense to say about the content of the movie, because then I will give results! You have to see it without knowing what it is! Everything is connected and has why and why. Start subtle and then things start to roll faster and faster until they culminate with the most crazy outburst you can imagine! It's even more fun to watch the movie a second time, once you've known all the "tricks". The actors are excellent, especially Ivan Trojan, whose final scenes are a real masterpiece! I highly recommend this movie, it's one of the most original I've ever seen!
