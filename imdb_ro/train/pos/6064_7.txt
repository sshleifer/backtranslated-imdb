I have to start by telling you how I met this movie. It was the winter time in Alaska around 1990. My Australian friend was with me and my girlfriend in a shoebox of an apartment. Alaska wineries can be a bit brutal, and most people stay indoors, drink a lot and watch everything that comes to the TV. I found this movie outside of an espionage shop, set in a snow bank, and immediately it was a treasure. the best worst movie. I spent the next two weeks watching this movie and drinking like the fish. We've watched so many times that sometimes we turn the TV on its side or top-down for a full fill effect. true jam. Laughter will come to an end and memories will last forever. If you see this movie for rent in a video store, steal it. You won t regret!
