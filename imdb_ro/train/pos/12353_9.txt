A wonderful, tragic film ... brings us to Japan that does not exist anymore. Despite Hollywood's technical expertise, I've seen another Hollywood movie that matches the authenticity of the atmosphere in this small town near the river near the sea ... Tom Cruise's The Last Samurai showed he liked the last installment of the Lord Rings in an attempt to surprise old rural Japan. If you like the quiet but intense lines, you have to watch the movie. There will be a laugh of naked movies, similar to those of the past 1000 blockbusters you've seen. I think this is one of Kurosawa's best stories. Even if it is a movie about geese and brothels and about the complicated rules that govern life in such situations, it did not turn into a skin blow. Characters are full of depth and work with much intensity.
