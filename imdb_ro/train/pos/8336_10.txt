This film tells the story of a love story between Albert Einstien's niece and a gas station companion. To get the two together, Einstien agrees to help Ed (Tim Robbins of Hudsucker Proxy) learn to act smarter. This impresses Catherine (Meg Ryan). Unfortunately, Einstien goes too far, and Ed is considered a genius. The hilarity occurs. Not to be missed. Filmed in Mercer County, New Jersey, Princeton University, Lawrenceville Prep School (dubbed Princeton University), and a beautiful Hopewell petrol station.
