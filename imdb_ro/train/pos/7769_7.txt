Lauren Bacall lived through the illness and death of her husband Humprey Bogarts when she made this film. Rock Hudson was close to the top of the 1950s. Dorothy Malone is in excellent shape and wins an Oscar for support. Robert Stack is nominated and subdues just for his role. The story is a little dug at another moment, but it is as deserving as most dramas. Amazing how well drunk people can drive in this movie and also how fast the stack rises in some of the early sequences of the movie. You can see why the distribution is so good and, in fact, wisdom, this movie is really good. You can tell Bacall that he's distracted during this film, while while acting well, he shows up in some emotional sequences. The sexual recommendations in this movie are so easy that many of today's young spectators do not realize what they are. The film has a good job telling a story and actually leaves a sequel to make, although it has never been done - although Written Beyond The Wind would be a good title.
