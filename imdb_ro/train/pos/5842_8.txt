Can they be as simple and primitive in my assessments as simply saying "I liked it"? It's pretty funny bit, it's great stars and it's great to look. The songs (which are around two, which are repeated then) are forgotten but have a healthy ironic treatment (such as the beautiful Fairbanks gentleman who explodes in a frenetic version of Wagnerian Miss Balble); there are not too many dances with all the 1861 crinoline drapes around Miss Grable, and the comedy could be a little too heavy, but the result is still rising. The photo (including real outdoor photos that are an emotion) is stunning, playing around with various shades of lush gold. Miss Grable is a little farther from her and the full, but still fresh and comfortable side of this continental comedy "olde worlde". It's pretty much along the "Down to Earth" line with Rita Hayworth, and one tends to be rather unhappy with many. So, I suppose that more people would consider the Virgo in the Herme as outdated and clogged. But it's a fairy tale and they tend to move into a particular pasta anyway. My suggestion is - just enjoy the artwork, the costumes, the wizard scenario and all you have to offer this movie and you will not cry anymore. The film was released on DVD in Germany, with German and English soundtracks.
