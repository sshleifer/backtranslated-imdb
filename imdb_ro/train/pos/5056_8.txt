The radio was not an hour of 24 hours, 7 days a week, when I grew up in the 1930s in England so the Children's Time was a treat for me when I had batteries and a spare battery for power. Several programs I've heard have therefore made a wonderful impression on my wonderful minds and the three they still remember are "Toytown", one about all animals in the zoo and "Gray Owl", talking about the animals on who knew them, whom he called "brothers". It's just lately that Gray Owl was not a real "Indian," but the tribute paid by Sioux's boss makes great sense to me: "A man becomes what he's dreaming." It could have all dreamed of a changing and beneficial world like Archie Gray Owl Belaney. Would a new owl influence world leaders to clean the environment.
