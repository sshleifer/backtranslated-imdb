How can anyone argue that Urban Cowboy was, and still is, the best document of Texas life for the time. Consider the following: men woo their wives, get drunk at bars every night, marry to solve a fight, commit adultery, and compete against mechanical bulls. Try and name a movie that describes real life so alive. I do not do it anymore. It seems that current movies are always about people with a lot of money, they live in huge houses, they drive expensive cars and they do not work. This movie has a celebration scene about getting a trailer for his sake! Anyway, I look at her at least once a week. No joke. I dissected this film from the end to the end. do not hesitate to send an email to learn more about why I called it a documentary. Consider the following scenes: Bud sees Sissy - they are divided - he gives amicably and waves, she throws him bird - he returns half of his peace horn to his horn to add impact then tears off. Bud's mother calls him almost. 18 hours after he entered the city on Sunday, to see if he still had a job, all he could get drunk and sit (x2), with the help of his uncle and aunt covering him. <br /> <br /> "You all live like pigs." Think about why this scene is needed. Think about this. It was necessary? Can not we realize, without showing the dirty sink? God I like that! Sissy allows Wes to help her go to the bull. Just a few days (or perhaps the next day) after Wes kicked out her husband. Steve asks - Hey Sissy, do you remember Wes? Oh, yeah, you did not beat my husband last night, so let her go to this lesson, not to mention that later he's looking to comfort him during many battles of Bud and Sissy in public - in Gilley! The photo of the wedding reception (oh humanity!) Could at least arrange or move the chairs out of the way. "My feet are the" mother "of sweat In conclusion, do not put such scenes in a movie to try to show a perspective on human psychology. ..
