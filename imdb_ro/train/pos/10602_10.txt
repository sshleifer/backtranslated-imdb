I have to say I loved the movie. It had fun moments, some parts of the heart, just fine. I personally loved the movie because it is something that I can finally refer to my childhood. This film, in my opinion, is more geared towards the young gay population. It shows how a young gay boy will be treated as he grows. All the shaking, calling to name and not knowing is something that, like most other female boys, I will always remember, and now, finally, a movie that illustrates how hard it really is to grow gay. So I definitely would recommend seeing this movie. You probably should not really follow it until a person is old and mature enough to understand
