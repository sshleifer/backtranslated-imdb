This movie has everything a fantasy film, romanticism, smart wizards, great action, and a correct dose of magic. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this film and I was attracted by his original plot (based on Neil Gaiman's novel I now want to read) and colorful characters. the most amazing things for me, in fact, was how self content is the story. Unlike so many science fiction fantasy films out right now that leave open ends and so it was a pure story, satisfying itself and without the need for a sequel. Original. Fun. Feel good.
