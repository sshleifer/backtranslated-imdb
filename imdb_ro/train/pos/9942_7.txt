A Korean film not only about Taekwondo but about what it takes to be good, as a kind of fighter can not beat a type of taekwondo in his sport because there are rules, like in life and school, and this the movie has subton notion. Martial arts in the movie are not that good, but they are acceptable and enjoyable. Friends who continue to get something that they would once beat would become stronger in mind and heart. This movie is not meant to be taken too seriously because it does not have a sock but also carries a message. A good film from Korea.
