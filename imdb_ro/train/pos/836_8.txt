This will probably not be the best comedy of the year, some too many coincidences and plot holes. However, we are talking about a movie where a food seller and a white bread vendor becomes friends, so a few vagaries should not come as a surprise too. Brosnan is excellent in this role, not James Wood Bond (a role he has lost). If he can maintain that quality, I hope he continues to make comedies. Greg Kinnear is also excellent as Brosnan's man. I read some negative comments here about Hope Davis, but I thought it was good enough as a housewife with a hand, with a dark part buried deep inside. There is a lot of good chicory as Brosnan broke his way and some scenes where I almost died of laughter. My father (consultant) almost lost it when Julian describes himself as a "facilitator." Just like "Grosse Pointe Blank," another hit-man comedy, humor can be very dark. If you're ready to enjoy yourself.
