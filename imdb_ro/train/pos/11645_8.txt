I was in France around March 5th and I like to go to the Film Festivals. I knew about this Cinémas d'Amérique Latine of Toulouse, but I never went to him. I decided to go and then I caught Cero y van 4. The movie is amazing. It has not caused my impact as with Mexican users, because it was subtitled in French, but it is still shocking. This film is a satire about urban violence, kidnapping and murder in the streets of Mexico. It's a crude portrait of the city. From a Metropolis. Secuestro Express, with an amazing Mia Maestro, which was also a satire of kidnapping, almost, but with a more serious tone it had, and I think, a certain connection with Cero y van 4. A redemption story as much much is too much? The man on fire, which was amazingly strong, was also not a satire, but a cruel portrait on the streets of Mexico. Or it's like The One Brave One. A movie that shocks you and it hits you courageously. This is like the usual suspects, has some twists and turns, but that makes it even more credible. Verdict: A movie that shocks you and makes you think there is no security in the streets. Amazing dialogue, impressive direction and breathtaking performance. Cero y van 4 is a movie that you will not soon forget. It lets you shake and forget.
