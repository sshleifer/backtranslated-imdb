I had the pleasure of watching this wonderful movie last night, with the wonderful addition of a session of questions and answers to the director after watching. I suspect that the first commentator never lost a parent or a person close to them in death. I've had a lot of this kind of loss, and this movie told me. One of the major themes is how we do not deal with questions / issues / stories with loved ones until it is too late - they are too incapable or dead before that happens. Talk to loved ones, listen and record stories, tell people that you love them, solve differences. I liked the message that there are no mistakes. I like the portrayal of the director about the relationship of the two daughters - as one of the six brothers, it is clear to me that he understands how complex these relationships are. His history as a cinema also comes out loud and clear - what a beautiful movie! Casting is remarkable - a movie that should not be missed!
