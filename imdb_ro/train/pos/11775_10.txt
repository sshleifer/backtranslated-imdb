This, along with "Hare Tonic", is among the best cartoon Bugs, indeed one of the best bugs ever. There are some comments on how Bugs in these cartoons are "basic", which means, I think, that he is not yet fully developed. In fact, I preferred this "base" version of the mid-1940s (Chuck Jones was the best version), which is actually more rabbit and more fun than the long-legged version that rises over Yosemite Sam and Daffy Duck. The bugs of today have become too sophisticated and sophisticated for my pleasure. Also check "Hair Raising Hare" (1946) and "Rabbit Punch" (1948) for wonderful examples of classic Bugs and classic Chuck Jones.
