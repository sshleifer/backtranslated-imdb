This movie is amazingly visual. Who cares if he can act or not. Each scene is a work of art composed and captured by John Derek. Locations, patterns, and costumes work perfectly to convey what lies in a love story composed of beauty, youth and wealth. In some respects, I would like to see this film as a tribute to John and Bo Derek's story. And ... this comment would not have been completed without mentioning Anthony Quinn's role as a father, mentor, boyfriend, and his portrait of man, of people lost in a past era when men were men. There are some of us who find value in strength and in the direction of being wrapped in a trust that contributes to a sense of trust, isolation and security. Yeah, I do not make men anymore! But how often do you find women who are made like Bo Derek.
