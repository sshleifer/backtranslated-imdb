Wow! this is a good movie! The act was not at all good, but if you look at the moments in the movie, back and look at it again, it's a genius! The man at the beginning of the movie goes with his suitcase against three. I've never waited for that. Then put the coke in a suitcase and run away. I bet the type of smoking against the three was one of his colleagues who sold the drugs later. And the genius cites: '' Beautiful shades, I need a pair of '' '' of their ... if you think you can take them .. '' .. Just Brilliant! And fighting is the best I've seen for a while. Look at the second guy he takes after he hit the head of the first table. What happened! And in the middle of the movie, a guy in a car shot once, then three guys fall, he's very good at targeting. It costs a lot of money to hire these guys like him. The end was brilliant, it was so exciting for James Cahill to go 5 minutes up and down the stairs and shoot jason peters after the distraction moved. Jason Peters falls and pours back as he's dead! I can not say with a lot of words how big this movie is!
