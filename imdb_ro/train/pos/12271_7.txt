Talking about an explosion opening, "Trampa Infernal" has the hottest opening credits ever! Guided by musical tones that are probably slightly inspired by the legendary theme "Friday 13" (Tsh-Tsh-Tsh-Ha-Ha-Ha), the names of the main players appear on the screen divided into huge syllables. The intro promotor of a Mexican survival thriller that is completely hidden, and gets colder with every passing minute. Two extremely competitive and overloaded testosterone enemies provoke each other at the last showdown in a disturbing bar. According to a newspaper article, in the nearby forests there is a wild bear that has already killed several hunters who have tried to catch it. The challenge includes the fact that the one who kills the bear will be declared final macho hero with the largest set of balls. However, on arrival, it becomes obvious that I am not against a bear, but a stunning and completely manic warrior veteran with an arsenal of weapons in his hiding place and numerous fighting tricks in his sleeve. After a decade of unprecedented and derived US slums, this Mexican effort of the 1990s seems and feels very refreshing and alive. The formula is simplistic, but effective, lead characters are quite plausible, and building up before confrontation with the sadistic killer is reasonably suspicious. The maniac must have been a fan of Freddy Krueger and Michael Myers because he also uses a self-made glove with attached sharp knives and a white mask to cover his face. Killing is pleasant ugly and barbarous, which we really hope of the wonderful opening sequences mentioned above and free blood waste. The forest region and, in particular, the camouflaged traps are spectacular. "Trampa Internal" is a Mexican slasher / survival hit that is warmly recommended for fans of genre.
