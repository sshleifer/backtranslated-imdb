I have been looking forward to seeing this since I saw her for the first time in her work. Eventually he found it yesterday 2/13/02 on the Lifetime movie channel. Jim Larson's comments on the fact that it was a "funny sweet story of two people crossing the paths" have died. Writers probably should not get a bonus, all the other SROs to make the movie. Anyone who appreciates a romantic movie should see this. The presence of the Natasha screen is so hot and her smile so electrified that I do not say anything about her beauty, that anything in my favorite list. His television and print interviews that I've seen are just as refreshing and well looked after. God bless them, family and future efforts. seem to be available on DVD or video yet, but I would be the first one I bought and I think others would be.
