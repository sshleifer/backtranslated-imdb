I was impressed by Shelley Adrienne's "Chelnerita" (2007). This film only confirms what was clear from that movie. Adrienne was a talented writer-director, an original and unique artist. She managed to show the miseries of everyday life with absurd humor and a real optimistic and humanistic trend. Ally Sheedy steals this movie with great performance like a woman who has fallen over the edge. The male lead Reg Rodgers, like Judd Nelson, is fine. There is also a great cameo of Ben Vereen. The song at the end of "The Bastard Song," written by Adrienne, may be an optimistic beloved: "It is a world of suffering, in a sea of ​​sorrow, no matter how much sun you bring, <br /> <br /> You are bombed by the rain ... <br /> <br /> Do not let your heart get you down, do not greet the heart without the heart, you do not live among the hearts "
