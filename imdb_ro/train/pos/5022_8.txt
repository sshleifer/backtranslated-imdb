Frailty - 8/10 - It's a non-sensual title and "Bill Paxton Direct" title aside, this is a pretty good old rip snorting brilliant brilliant thriller. Eventually, it might just be Kubrick's gothic Southern Gothic cousin "The Shining" - but hey, that's a fun fun idea. He also has a cute plot of overturning ... and a very ambiguous moral message. This is the kind of movie that people will catch last night on the basic cable and scare the beggars themselves. Too bad, director Bill Paxton had to commit to staying to play ... oh well ... yet a devil with a good rent.
