How can you rate this movie with 10/10? I admit that this movie is not very fun, but the purpose is not to tell you a story but history! This is the first real movie in the history of cinema ("Prince de Galles was the first, but not technical enough?") And it is undoubtedly of international value. These people who you can see by finishing their day of work in the movie have had the chance to participate in a historical moment, becoming the first people to see on the move! And above all shot is a nice shot! And it moves a lot when you think about the first people who saw that! What time! First of all, history for science (for the Lumiere Brothers first invented the cinema for scientific reasons) and later for art. A venerated movie!
