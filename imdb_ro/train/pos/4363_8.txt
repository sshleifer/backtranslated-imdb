It's a bit disturbing to have a character named Gig Young in a movie ... played by Gig Young. But this film is where Gig received his name and also a beautiful career incentive, after playing small pieces under another name. I'm going to go against most of the other comments and say that I really enjoyed this movie, mainly because of Barbara Stanwyck's vibrant performance like Fiona. She was amusing, angry, vulnerable, caregiving and feisty as the oldest of the three daughters whose mothers died on Lusitania and whose father was later killed during the Woar I war. As a "man" house, Fiona has remained firm over the years against the resolution of her father's will, which would therefore allow a Donald Trump guy named Charles Barclay to take his family home. But Fiona keeps a secret why he hates Barclay so much. Geraldine Fitzgerald is a middle-aged, flirty sister who is married to an English but wants the friend of the youngest sister (Gig Young). If you're a fan of Stanwyck, he does not miss you.
