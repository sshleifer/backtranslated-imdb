A very tall Columbo story, which was actually the first episode of the long-lasting series, but was originally second (after "Murder by the Book"). Robert Culp makes his first of three appearances as a serial killer and plays the owner of a private detective agency who blackmails his wife (Patricia Crowley) of a rich and influential man (played a lot by Ray Milland) after faking a report in his favor, after discovering that he has an affair. The wife later rebelled against the blackmail scheme but was killed in a state of rage .... A very satisfying episode in many ways, especially since the plot is so strongly installed and subsequently developed, and also from the cause of the rare Columbo ingredient that murder is an unprecedented killing. The whole thing is further improved when the widow's husband uses the killer to help Columbo in his investigations: a feature that facilitates numerous good-quality scenes, especially in the first sequence where the three central characters meet, and the essential qualities of deception of Columbo are wonderful. <br /> <br /> Born with fury by Bernard L. Kowalski and acted on a high level, this really set the tone for the whole series (since "Murder by the Book" was disappointed by a poor end). Columbo Creator Scenario Richard Levinson and William Link is precise, well-structured and well thought out and supported by a stable and productive rhythm and significant sequences that really demonstrate the unpredictability of the story. Finally, the ending fits perfectly with the fact that Columbo has always been one step ahead of the killer. Generally, this is a very fine piece of work for detectives for Columbo and strongly suggests that the production team has worked positively and constructively to make a polished Columbo story.
