I'm thinking about the best version of Quo Vadis? ever made. Well, yes, the intrigue is not as strong and obvious as in the book, sometimes proud, and loses suspense between aesthetic subtleties. But the movie is really "beautiful", it has an enigma and style, that other versions - with R.Taylor and the new one in Poland - are certainly missing. It has the air of Roman decadence, the beauty of paganism in decline, and infantile Christianity. At least I think it existed.) Brandauer, Forrest and Syudov did an excellent job of portraying their characters. Petrett's Petreth appears to be the greatest success of distribution (not to mention Brandauer, who is one of the greatest actors ever) and accumulates the essence of this dead world (IMHO). That's it. That's how it happened, boys ...))) IMHO
