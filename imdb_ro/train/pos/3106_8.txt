After I had never seen the movies before (and I could not stand up to Matt Damon), I was reluctant to go see The Bourne Ultimatum when we were asked to see her for AS film studies. <br /> <br /> However, I was pleasantly surprised that even a movie with Damon in it might be nice. <br /> <br /> Rapid battle scenes, crazy motorcycle blasts and BIG explosions have been what has thrown you out of place in UBB. The advances between the CIA and Bourne kept you on your toes and amused me a lot. However, a few things really tightened my cheese. First of all, the fact that the film was just a series of Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA. This sequence was repeated and finally boring. Although Damon kept us entertained and always seemed a step ahead of the CIA, I was a little annoyed by Bourne's constant survival. A car collapsed and it came out like it did or something like that! Very unrealistic. And secondly (inevitably) - SHAKY CAMERA. It was so weird that it was completely visible and made me and all those who went to see him in my class (even the guardians) on the seashore. We were told that if we ever use this in a movie we made in class, it would be automatically wrong and would have told us to use a tripod. Pretty right if Greengrass wanted to look like I was there watching Damon and Stiles holding a conversation, but we certainly would not have shaken our head so violently! But everything in TBU is a nice movie and it's worth a watch. But I did not think it was the best movie of the year, despite the fact that it was a play. 8/10.
