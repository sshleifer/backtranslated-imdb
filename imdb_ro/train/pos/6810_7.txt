After reading the book, I walked along this DVD to Wal-Mart for $ 3, and I thought, of course, what the hell ... I got the DVD and watched it last night. When I started watching, I checked the running time and it was about 90 minutes. I thought, okay ... It seems like she was running pretty slow, knowing the story and how much it was. Until I got to the real crimes, I felt, "how long is that left?" Check. "One minute? What the hell?" I felt incredibly cheated, thinking that the film had only one third of the story. But then I noticed happily that the DVD selection menu included part 1 and part 2. I still had an hour and a half to go! Then I was very happy and I enjoyed the second half of the movie, even more than the first. I admit that I did not see the original film in 1967 (despite my sincere wish), I did, however, read the novel and thought it was a pretty descending movie for a two-part TV miniserie, that is. I think casting Perry's part was completely wrong, and some minor inconsistencies jumped over me, but still very well done. The first half draws on a bit, while the second half is much tighter. I think he should have proportioned the film more as Capote did his book: 1/3 before crimes, 1/3 after and 1/3 after the murderers are arrested. Instead, the film makes it more than half past the killings, 1/4 after and 1/4 after the murderers are arrested. Again, this makes the second half more interesting, but at the same time, less convincing, while we make the first half on and on ... Now I look back and realize that I just did the same mistake in doing things to be attracted, so I will close the hell. Go look at the movie and make your own mind! <br /> <br /> Nick Houston
