Level One, Horror. When I saw this movie for the first time at 10am, I knew it would give me nightmares. Did. Surprisingly, as I remember, the sound was as much as the view of the monster that caused them. <br /> <br /> Second level, psychoanalytic theory. Later, as an adult, I saw the story of what it was: What happens if the wild, unrestrained instinct that we all repress is manifested. Level 3, Pure Science Fiction. The best way to accomplish the plot "What if" is by science fiction. This is a pure scientific fiction, not "cowboys in space" that passes for the genre of today. After 43 years, the Forbidden Planet remains the largest of all science fiction movies. If you are planning a remake, SKG or Lucas, be careful!
