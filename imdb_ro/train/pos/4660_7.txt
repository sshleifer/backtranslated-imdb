"Hot Millions" is a well-written and well-written story about a stealing smuggler (a type too small for an embezzler, according to Peter Ustinov's main character) a "hot million" from the London branch an American corporation by creating corporations on the continent and using the company's secure computer to transfer funds to them. (Remember, spoiler police, this is a comedy, not a mystery.) Since 1968, the image of this computer film may seem na√Øve to today's more numerous population; but as one who worked with computers even before the release of this film, I would say that even then, it seems that it was written by the illiterate computer, perhaps with the purpose of enhancing the comic aspects of this British film. <br /> <br /> If someone has a little taste for this type of entertainment, the film seems to shoot in spots. Fortunately, it has a beautiful wrapped end; Unfortunately, the final credits do not give any indication of the classical music used there - the symphony piece at the end of the year and the piano-flute duet in the middle - only the melody played by Lulu that I do not entirely remember.
