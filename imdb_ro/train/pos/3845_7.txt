No emotion, erotic thriller, slow rhythm, with many graphic and "blasphemous" scenes that will undoubtedly disturb some viewers. However, it will be difficult even for them not to appreciate some of the imaginative sequences contained in this film or to ignore Krabbe's first-class performance. Verhoeven keeps an intriguing ambivalence throughout the film, playing with the sense of human heroic visions. Unfortunately, in the last 5 minutes everything turns into blur and the unsatisfactory end is not as good as the rest of the film. (***)
