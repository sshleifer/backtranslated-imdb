This movie was worth it. It's a great fun, it has some great jokes and gaggle watching, some stuff for "geeks" among us (and we know who we are) and the effects are really effective. Watching Paul Reubens fart in front of an Oscar winner deserves the price of admission itself. I have not read the comic strip before seeing the movie, but since then. as good as they are, I still recommend MM film MM. Although Greg Kinnear is also amazing as the amazing captain, and NO OTHER ELSE could be The Shoveller except William H. Macy, my favorite line in the movie? "We have an unseen encounter with Destiny and it seems he ordered the lobster." See this movie. Buy this movie! There are only $ 5 and some are changing to Wal-Mart locally. You'll thank me. You really will. Oh, and Mrs. Garafolo is in it. THE CELL is GOD
