I like this movie. It is well written, acted and has good cinema. The story combines action, humor, mysticism and tenderness with wonderful sets and wonderful pictures. See, buy them, show them to your friends. The actor is good and Murphy performs a great job, portraying the reluctant / unlikely hero. I enjoyed all the characters and found them interesting and well-developed, with dynamic interactions. I cared about what happened to these people and, while the result was quite predictable (the good boys win, the hero becomes the amazing girl and the holy child saves lives - who do not see this coming), yet I was happy when everything went on well in the end. We thank God that the dignity of this film has never been destroyed by a serious continuation. Take some popcorn, cradle your couch and watch this fun, fun and fun movie.
