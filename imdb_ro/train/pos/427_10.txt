one of the best ensembles of movies I've ever seen. There is not much for the plot, but the act - incredible. You see that the characters change so subtly, do not influence the villa rented in Italy and I love. And happiness. The film throws you a witchcraft, as the villa does with all the women. Really "delighted".
