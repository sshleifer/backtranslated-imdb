When I looked at this movie and started to see her characters, I felt it would be an excellent picture. When you get that feeling, and the movie really will fill these expectations, the experience is rare. I had that very feeling alongside this movie. Robert DeNiro and Cuba Gooding Junior played riveting and amazingly powerful pieces that were both Oscar-worthy. Support support was just as strong, creating a winning foundation for the image to grow. I can say without any hesitation at all, see this movie will not disappoint.
