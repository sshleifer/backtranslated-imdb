Someone who loves the photo needs to see. amazing and stunning, it leaves you in the ore. saw it twice in a movie theater and now on DVD. it's good on DVD, but on the big screen this was something else. I took my two daughters to see this and they liked it, the old one shouted at the end.but she wanted to see her again tonight when she saw her at the video store. its simple storytelling of the child's love for nature and especially a fox is well said. in some respects he reminded me of the bear in telling a story not the documentary format. which works very well for children. not being preached that it is very important, you make your own mind. But the star of this movie is cinemas, as they did what they did. amazingly just amazing.
