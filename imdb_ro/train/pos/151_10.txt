The film is designed to affect the audience and this film left me speechless. Wonderfully photographed and well-behaved with dialogue that addresses poetry the film involves appetite, hate, murder, rape, theft and deception. She is weaving an intense network that has left me unable to take my eyes off the screen until the closing credits. The story is sweeping. He takes his audience from the atrocities of the Spanish Civil War to the remaining human remains. Roger Casamajor and Bruno Bertanzoni are two young actors who command the screen. Players who support the game are very well distributed and give a real sense of authenticity. Sets, lighting, landscape and cinema are great. I really like the photo.
