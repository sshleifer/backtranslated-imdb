Road Rovers was a wonderful show about the super-heroes chosen by the Master to fight crime around the world. The show was hilarious to say at least. Simple and complex jokes that could appeal to all ages. Running jokes throughout the series that could cause a drinking game. The action was mesmerizing and intelligent. The characters were very original, each with a very different personality. But what made me enjoy the show was the depth of the characters. Each of them has fights and emotional difficulties that are never expressed, but implicated in the subtext. We hope that someday will be a way to track again the Rovers action.
