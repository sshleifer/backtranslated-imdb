When tradition dictates that an artist has to pass his great skills and magic to an heir, the old and very proud street performer, known to all as the "Masked King", becomes desperate for a young disciple to adopt and cultivate. His warmness and humanity find him paying a few dollars for a small person displaced by China's devastating natural disasters, in this case, a massive flood in the 1930s. take the new 7-year-old companion in his straw house to live with his cherished monkey, "General," just to discover that he-child is a child. <br /> <br /> life is instantly transformed, the love it feels for this little slave becomes rooted in the stupid tradition that requires it to transmit its art to only one young man. There are many stories inside it ... many people are touched, and China's culture opens to observe the western eye. Thousands of years of heritage is thrown into a theater cup, and few will leave this DVD behind with a dry eye. The technical transfer itself is not so great, as we have found sound levels all over the counter and can see video transfer lines in many parts of the movie. Highly recommended :-) 9/10 stars.
