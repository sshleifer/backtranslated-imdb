This comedy with much pain and underlying sadness fails if most others fail. There have been many such films with several notable actors trying to make this elusive blend that have not come anywhere in the depths and starvation of it. This is for sure because the remarkable casting of Reg Rogers and Ally Sheedy seems so spontaneous that the reality of their characters quickly attracts interest and emotions and keeps them throughout the movie. In the beginning, the action seems rather than wall and harebrainate, but gradually teaches that these two foolish people, quite pathetic, are trying desperately and unwillingly to heal, even if boringly, one with the other. Rogers's facial expressions, of numbness and wrathful eruption by Sheedy, are so eloquent that they feel as he notices them. You will take care of these two planners, but deeply suffering and hopefully they will succeed, because they are in doubt and all is stuck on a thin emotional thread. We hope the audience will get to see more reg Rogers and Ally Sheedy, as this film proves their merit as highly accomplished actors beyond question.
