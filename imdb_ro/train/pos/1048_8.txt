For Muslim women in West Africa, married life in the hands of abusive husbands can be very difficult. The community can not explicitly approve of such behavior, but it may also not be ready to consider it criminal, an attitude that of course allows it to continue. Fortunately, the Cameroonian letter promises equality for everyone and this documentary follows the real exploitation of the various female practitioners in the Cameroonian legal system as it seeks to ensure justice for a number of women and children. What is remarkable (apart from the uplifting central story) is how, despite their informality, the courts are in fact pragmatic, if a case is actually bought. The program also offers a fascinating insight into the entire Cameroonian lifestyle, which (in addition to the terrible crimes committed in the cases presented) looks amazingly emotional and glad in comparison to what the inhabitants of Europe or North America enjoy. And while I accept that this comment can betray naivet√© on my part, this attitude seems to be captured in the delightful pidgin-english that I am talking about. Generally, this is a great movie and much more fun to watch than you can imagine.
