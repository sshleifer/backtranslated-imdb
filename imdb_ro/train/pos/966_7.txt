2005 Toronto Film Festival Report Official; "Takashi Miike" is killed. Midnight movie of the new Takashi Miike, Big Spook War, Yokai War, Yôkai daisensô. Call yourself what you will do is a fanatical journey. Colin Geddes, the fearless programmer, said the film was originally aimed at children in Japan. Think of "Lord of the Rings" or "The Unfortunate Story" for Japan. After screening I can understand where I'm going with, but after all, that's Takashi Miike. He directed the movie "Ichi the Killer" in '01 when he was screened at screening at the festival bags. And no, it was not just a marketing game. Summary: A boy with a troubled home life becomes "chosen," and stops in the midst of a Great Spirit war, where he meets a group of friendly spirits who become his companions through his journey. This is not really for children, not too "young". Make sure they are scared unmoving with some of these spirits (even friendly ones) displayed. This is different from anything I've ever seen in the previous cinema. A natural fantasy, a very funny (but dark) material. You will not be bored to guarantee this. Has North America ever hit you? Questionable. <br /> <br /> My rating = B
