More like psychological analysis of movies, but Psycho sounds better like a header. The man who directs the movie (the narrator if you want) presents films here in his own way. Most of them are classic, but all of them are listed here at IMDb and I would strongly advise you to see them (especially Hitchcock, Solyaris, Conversation and Lynch movies) because Slavoj Zizek will refer to them! <br /> <br /> Or in other words, he can spoil them for you. I do not remember if he spoiled more than the ones I listed (I think Chaplin movies too), but as I wrote, it would be better to watch them all before! In the IMDb list there is a missing film that I reported to them, so it could get there pretty soon. It's a Meg Ryan movie, but it's just a big snippet of a big deal anyway. Zizek opinions and opinions are crazy and fun to listen to, if you are open minded to see things through another perspective (even if that will destroy a little favorite movie for you ... it does not mean it will do that, but it could)!
