In the celebration of Earth Day Disney released the movie "Earth". Starking away from any stark message of darkness and contempt, we are treated with excellent animal images in their habitats without feeling too bad about ourselves. The stars of the show are a herd of elephants, a family of polar bears, a whale and a calf. The narrative begins at the North Pole and continues south until we reach the tropics, all being introduced into the climate zones with different areas. <br /> <br /> Global warming is mentioned while we see bear polar beats; the Dead Sea islands are remarkable in recent years. I never see that the bears catch the seals, but the desperate search of the father for food leads him to a dangerous solution. Caribbean aerial photographs migrating along the tundra are one of the most spectacular photos of wild animals he has seen; this and another migrated wild birds are enough to reward the admission price to see them on the big screen. One of the disappointments I felt was that otherwise extraordinary shots of great white sharks that took the seals were shot in slow motion. You never understand a characteristic of wild animals; their incredible speed. The idea of ​​slowing the movie to convey a high speed I think it started with (or at least the first one I remember to see) the television show "Kung Fu" in the early seventies. that as the credits finally end up, some demonstrations of the cinematic techniques used are revealed. There are enough dramatic moments, humorous and instructive in this film to make a solid choice for nature lovers. Perhaps because of selective edits (which have spared us at the end of a perverse moment of prey) and the fact that this filming was released in 2007 and is available on DVD, it's a solid movie itself. And you can take your kids! Three stars.
