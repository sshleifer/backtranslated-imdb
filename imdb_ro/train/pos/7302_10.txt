From this writing, John Carpenter's Halloween is approaching the 30th anniversary. Since then it has given rise to 7 sequels, a remake, a whole misery of imitations, and every year around Halloween when making these "Top 10 Scariest" films, always there. This is amazing for a movie that was made on a budget of about $ 300,000 and had an almost completely unknown cast of talented young people. I could go further, but the big question here is: How does the movie hold today? And all I can say is fantastic! <br /> <br /> Pro: A simple yet frightening credit opening sequence that truly sets the mood. An indispensable and bullet-proof score by director / co-writer John Carpenter and Alan Howarth. Great cinema. Carpenter's stellar direction keeps suspense, gets some great shots and is careful not to show too much harm to him. Good performance from the then unknown distribution. A good sense of humor. Michael Myers is a scary, bad guy. Many great moments that will stay with you. The rhythm is slow but constant and never pulls. Unlike most slasher movies, this is more about suspense and terror than blood and a large number of frames. Cons: Probably not as scary now as it is then. Many of the garbage is really different. Final Thoughts: I want to start this section saying that this is not my favorite movie in the series. I know it's not a popular opinion, but I really feel it. Despite the fact that it is really an important film that continues to reach new generations of movie lovers. And just because it was remodeled for a new generation does not mean it will be forgotten. No way, not how. <br /> <br /> My rating: 5/5
