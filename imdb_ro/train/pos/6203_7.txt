An extraordinary weird movie with enough twists for a bag of pretzels. Parker Posey interprets Fay Grim as a sexy, vulnerable and loving mother who may or may not be what she looks like. The story is very language in the cheek, and the dialogue is subtle. Suggestions of humor and intrigue, none of them beyond the characterization, Posey moves so well. The supporting tower is stellar. The downside? This movie requires your full attention, almost to the point of stopping the movie and taking notes. Posey has more sexual attraction in eyebrow lift than most actresses have in their entire body. It deserves your time, even if you do not understand the denunciation.
