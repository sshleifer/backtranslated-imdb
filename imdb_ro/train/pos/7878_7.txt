Like the story of my family, my father, Milton Raskin, sang the piano for the Dorsey band. After Sinatra joined the band, my father practiced with him for hours. Then, at one point, my father told Sinatra that it was actually good to be related to such a small group (band) and that he should venture alone. At that time Sinatra had enough "under the belt" credits to do that! Dorsey never forgave my father, and the rest, as they say, is history. I have some pictures and recordings in this respect, and the University of Berkeley in California. <br /> <br /> I have seen almost every Sinatra movie more than I want to say and his films never grow old. . . Thank you Frank
