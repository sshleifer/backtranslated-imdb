I watched this in July and even with the theme of Christmas, I found it touching and sensitive. It is not for someone with a reality-mind, because it is full of fantasy and wonderful moments that sometimes do not make sense. William Russ made a great job like Hank. I saw him only in the remake of The Long, Hot Summer where he played a poor character. But in that regard, the expression in his eyes, as Hank watched the things that happened to him, was wonderful and delicate. Valerie Bertinelli was excellent and beautiful as usual and very credible in this role. And Peter Falk as Max was splendid and always brought a smile when he appeared in a series of important scenes. There were many special scenes, including Hank realizing that Max really was in his life. It's not for everyone ..... especially for those who are not in the movies "feel good" and this is definitely one! If you like everything to be perfect and make sense, avoid this. But I think it's good to re-watch, so I recorded it. (Yes, some of us still have video cameras.)
