How friendly, charming and cordial this old bastard is; I was glad to see the old Lugosi. It is disarmingly friendly and lively. It's the document of a long lost ship. (The best TV series today can not compete with these moderately good old series of good.) CHANDU is deep, profoundly optimistic and hedonistic. Improves the mind. It's not bad; stupid are those who do not get the terms on which such series work. CHANDU has an irresistible sense of simple, unpretentious and friendly fun. Without giving too much Chandu is a Western wizard who also goes through this eastern name and loves and protects his granddaughter's sect of murderers. Chandou exerts his supernatural gifts in a rather discreet and moderate manner. As for the fairly sexy granddaughter, Nadji, she is kidnapped by Ubasti priest: the sordid Vordhyan. The sexy poor girl is actually multiplied kidnapped in a sarcophagus after she was asleep with a flower; almost abducted from a boat; by a fake policeman; the temple of Lemuria and its strange, horrific ceremonies resemble the images of KING KONG and are a mocking beard of CCR ceremonies and rituals. <br /> <br /> Do you protect a girl as brave as Chandu? Lugosi looked like an old libido and pretty heart, drunk drunk, and this only contributed to his performance. He is the prototype of the drunk, drunken drunk and sloppy uncle. This might seem a strange tribute to Lugosi, but Burton's Wood Biopic left me with this impression of Lugosi and I have allied a strong sympathy for the fallen actor. I'm enjoying Lugosi's luxurious performance. This serial is unfairly overturned.
