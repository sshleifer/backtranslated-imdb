We have not approached "yet crazy" with any real anticipation. Just another rock'n'roll photo, I imagined ... a good nostalgia for baby boomers. This movie is partly this, but much more. Brian Gibson, director, previously led a biography of Tina Turner and is quite successful in his style. I suppose it is appropriate that this was his last film. Distribution is well chosen. Bill Nighy is perfect in his role as frontman of the band. Actor-transformed-director Bruce Robinson appears as the guitarist of the band. He does a great job, even if he did not appear on the film in the late 1970s. If you are looking for a sensational and funny movie (with some wonderful songs), you've found it. <br /> <br /> 7.4 out of 10
