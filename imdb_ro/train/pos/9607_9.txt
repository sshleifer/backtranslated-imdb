This is a movie that should be seen by anyone interested, performed by or suffering from a eating disorder. It is an amazingly precise and sensitive portrait of bulimia in a teenager, its causes and symptoms. The girl is performed by one of the brightest young actresses working in cinema today, Alison Lohman, who was later so spectacular in "Where the Truth Lies." I would recommend that this movie be presented in all schools, because you will never see this topic better. Alison Lohman is absolutely exceptional and marvels of her ability to convey the pain of a girl suffering from this compulsive disorder. If the barometers tell us the air pressure, Alison Lohman tells us the emotional pressure with the same degree of precision. Her emotional range is so precise that each scene can be measured microscopically for her trauma gradients on a scale of growing hysteria and despair that reaches unbearable intensity. Great Winningham is the perfect choice to play her mother, and she does it with immense sympathy and a range of emotions as well-tuned as Lohman. Together, they make a pair of sensitive emotional oscillations vibrating resonantly with each other. This movie is really a stunning achievement, and director Katt Shea should be proud of it. The only reason you do not see it is if you are not interested in people. But even if you like better nature movies, this is, after all the behavior of the animals at the sharp edge. Bulimia is an extreme version of how a tormented soul can destroy its own body in a frenzy of despair. And if we do not sympathize with people suffering from the depth of despair, then we are dead inside.
