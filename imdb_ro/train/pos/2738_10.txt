I have not seen this over 20 years, but I still remember things about it. The movie CAN NOT be made in color. Gray stark are what he does, and was it really so simple in the 1950s? What is most remarkable in my memory is that Perry Smith goes hanging. His breathing under the hood, just before picking up the trap. I do not think I could look again at this ... once there is a lot. It's like an unnamed guy at the beginning of "Papillon," which is dragged into horror at the guillotine. The guy who said to follow this on a double note with "Dead Man Walking" should have added the last 10 minutes of "I Want To Live" as well. Some of my ancestors were "aristocratic" at the guillotine of 1794-95, so my feelings about the death penalty are quite intense.
