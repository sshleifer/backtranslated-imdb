Very poor boss <br /> <br /> This movie (despite being on TV only) is absolutely excellent. I did not pay too much attention to the differences in appearance or accents, so I can not comment on it. The actor was so good that he had to get me together and say, "Remember, it's just a movie, this DIDN'S REALLY HAPPEN." As we sat and listened to Harris and Quinn's words, I knew exactly what John and Paul were talking about if he actually had this meeting. John's unpleasant comments and burns were accompanied by his character (especially in the restaurant!), Just like his depression, while Paul was easy to go and go back. Both actors have done an excellent job and I was thrilled to see this movie. It's a bad experience for any Beatles fan. And get ready for some surprises!
