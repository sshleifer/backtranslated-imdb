This movie is very cool. Everything seems to appear from the comic book. sets, costumes and plot are wonderful. Clark Bartram is our favorite baton again. he looked a bit better at the dead end, but he still pulls it off. the superman is also great. Flight effects are OK. but it's a fan movie, so we can not expect it to be the biggest. shot with superman capturing the car was very credible. it was cool. This is a movie that I would certainly see if it was real. has all the things he would like in a Batman / Superman movie. an exception, however, I would throw the joker instead of 2-sided ..... as a whole, I give this film a 10 because it's a great movie.
