For a low-budget project, the movie was a success. The story is interesting, and the actors were convinced. Eva Longoria, who now plays on the show "Dragnet", is sexy than ever. Locations were ideal for the ganster plot, and the director showed his talent, taking on many roles for his project. Of course, this low-budget movie could use better editing transitions and more special effects for gun scenes, but music keeps this script on the move. Although this film has some issues, such as continuity, I have to say that I will rent the next film of the director. If you were a film student, you could learn a few things from the director's commentary.
