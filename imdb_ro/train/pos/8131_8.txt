<br /> <br /> If you love rap or hip-hop, watch this movie, although it's funny if you do not get the references as a straight comedy. <br /> <br /> You have not seen much of the happy CB4, but what I saw did not have the heart of this little stormer. <br /> <br /> They have not heard from the people involved since then, which is a surprise. The film is very similar to Spinal Tap, which is not a bad thing and I think a lot of dialogue while invaluable in Tap is funnier here, probably because I'm more in rap than rock days, so my own judgment clouds that point. The rap songs are fun as fuck, and basically they're the point of reference for most of the movie, not all of them in front of you, which means physical comedy and a single lining have priority over take-offs. <br /> <br /> Great fun, one to watch twice if there ever was a movie.
