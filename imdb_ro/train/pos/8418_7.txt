Russian director of Russian emigrants to Hollywood in 1928 (William Powell) makes his epic about the Russian revolution and hires former ex-Tsarist general (Emil Jannings) to play the general role of the film, and the two relive the drama and memory of the woman they have divided it (Evelyn Brent) 11 years ago. Try how I can feel that it's hard to warm up to the "last order" for all its virtues. "Docks of New York" was undoubtedly a great movie, and "Underworld" is a movie I always wanted to see, but "The Last Command" is pretty tough. The premise is fascinating, but the treatment really does the scenario come to life, except for the sequences set in Hollywood, which describe the salubrious line of excerpts that can be hired and the machinations of a large-scale movie production with cutting-edge technology. <Emil Jannings is, in a predictable way, a wonderful Russian general, who is wonderfully different from the old general traumatized and decrepit, transfixed in his misery, and the vigorous and consistent officer of the old. <br /> <br /> The end is great and it's worth waiting, but to get there you have to be prepared to be slightly bored sometimes.
