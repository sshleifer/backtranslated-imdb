I hired this movie from a blockbuster on a whim ... I like alan arkin and the cover was caught ... I read my back and I knew it would be either the best or the worst movie I saw ever ... I think I'm lucky .. I laughed from the beginning to the end .. alan arkin brings a great character to this movie. I have since bought a copy of the rent used for my own collection and watched it all the time .. I recommeded this movie to a lot of people and everyone liked them as much as I did ... I see complaints about menus and dvd but it does not move away from the movie .. the disc was created for Blockbuster exculsivley, which is why it does not allow you to skip over previews. Besides, you do not have to leave DVD functions to prevent you from watching the excellent movie.
