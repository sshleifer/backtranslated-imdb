for a short blow, this movie is actually better than a lot in genre.yes is predictable-job resident nuts go on killing spree, people die, yada yada yoda.however there are some positive good in this movie. first off, I really enjoyed working mask with wore.it walnut is definitely scary to say the least and possibly unique (although I have not seen every slash movie ever made) also bad genesis is something what I did not see before, and the way she meets the end is a Roman concept, as far as I know. I also liked the master's weapon by Mr. was for most killings. Crime is not as graphic as most of the genre, but that's a little worry. the movie does not make a serious turn, which is the worst suffering from. quite bold, while watching the movie, I was reminded of the first films "Friday 13" seriously. There are some concerns about this movie. In several scenes, the killer wears suddenly resembles one of our horror icons. By this, I mean his movements and reactions to the shot, but also the way he went more. Still, it is a scene very close to the end, in which the madman wears more than a striking resemblance (in fact, a complete cut) of another famous horror title. And in the last scenes, we have our dear, again, showing just like the first horror icon I mentioned. In fact, the last scene is almost complete rip-off from another icon like slasher. these scenes were weak and unintelligible (obviously). That way, the movie is set in Australia, so if you're a sucker for a chicken with an Aussie accent (like me), you'll be in the sky. than to refine yourself. Another great thing about this movie: Beautiful Kylie Minogoue (just do not get too attached to it), there is a non-Australian accent, courtesy of Molly Ringwald.overall, there are more reasons to look than you did not enjoy it and had some fun.so, you have to give "Cut" 8/10, which may seem too great for some people.
