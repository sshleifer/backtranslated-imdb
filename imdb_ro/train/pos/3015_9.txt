Why can not this compact and fun mystery be filmed in the new century? It keeps the spectator thinking and guessing all the way. The tower is a big ensemble. William Powell presents a true star quality. Who knows - he probably repeats for his future as Nick Charles. It's a joy to look at. We can also see why Eugene Pallette has made more than 200 films. He is a great supporting character actor, and his excellent chemistry with Powell is fun to look at. Mary Astor deals with over-average work in a very insignificant role. All other chip hands to make this a pleasant pleasant way to spend 73 minutes. I guess Michael Curtiz had a ball that led him. Bravo!
