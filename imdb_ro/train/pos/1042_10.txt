An American woman, her European husband and her children are returning to her mother's home in Watch on the Rhine, a 1943 film based on Lillian Hellman and Paul Lukas (which I think repeats my role here) , Bette Davis, Lucile Watson, George Coulouris, Geraldine Fitzgerald, and Donald Woods. An anti-fascist, a worker in the underground movement, wounded many times and wanted by the Nazis, Kurt Muller (Lukas) needs a long holiday on the rich heritage of her rich mother. But he discovers that there is really no escape as one of the housewives (Coulouris) is suspicious of his true identity and more than willing to sell it outside. Great performances are abundant in this film, written a lot for Lillian Hellman's liberal point of view. It was certainly a powerful propaganda vehicle at the time of its release, for the evil of the war and what happened to people from other countries had arrived in safe American homes. The great controversy of the film today is that Paul Lukas won an Oscar over Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca. Humphrey Bogart was a wonderful screen presence and a fabulous Rick, but Lukas is transcendent like Kurt. His monologue about the need to kill is scary, just to mention a scene. Though this is not what you think is a Bette Davis movie, it offers a masterful performance here Kurt's wife, loyal and loving, Sara. It has the role of attracting the heart, and the scenes of love between Kurt and Sara are beautiful and delicate. The last half hour of the film had me in tears with emotional honesty. Lillian Hellman is not a cup of tea for everyone, but unlike "The Little Foxes," she has written some really nice, wonderful characters and a beautiful story, offering casting and production values ​​by Warner Brothers. Highly recommended.
