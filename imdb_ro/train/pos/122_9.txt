I began to lose my belief in recent films being flooded with Gen-Hollywood. The story lines fail, and the camera is just copied from the last movie of similar taste. But then I saw Zentropa (Europe) and my faith was renewed. Not only is the metaphorical story enthusiastic, but the use of colors and black and white colors stimulates visually. The Narrator (Max Von Sydow) takes you on a brilliant journey every step and horrifies you in Europe in 1945. We have all seen the death on the screen in hundreds of thousands of ways but the beauty of this film is how it takes you through every slow moment which leads you to death. Unlike many movies, it does not cut off (for example) a knife, but forces you to watch the devastating and yet sensual beauty of a man's final moments. I think we can take something different than what this movie is trying to say, but it's definitely worth the time to find out what it really means. I would love to talk more deeply about the movie for someone who wants to send me an email. Enjoy it!
