Kimi wa petto is a nice story about a girl who one day finds a boy inside a box that is out of her apartment one day. She decides to bring him and fix his cuts. She then leaves a note for him to eat some food that he then made to go home because he had to go to work. When she returns home, she finds she's still there. He tells him he wants to live there with her as a brother or cousin. Desperately leaving him to leave, tells him that if he were to become his animal, then he could stay. And, like a pet, he says he has no rights and does not do what he said. (not in that perverted way!) She agrees to her surprise and since then she is known as Momo, her pet pet.
