Now all the children and adolescents in Springwood, Ohio are all dead waiting for a teenager (Shon Greenblatt) is still alive. Freddy (Robert Englund) lets him leave and the teenager does not have much memory when he gets to a new town. When a tough psychologist (Lisa Zane) tries to break the new patient. She finds where she is from. He brings it to Springwood to spark a few memories, but three teenagers (Lezlie Deane, Breckin Meyer and Ricky Dean Logan) who came unexpectedly for a walk. Once they arrived in Springwood, the psychologist remembers that he lived in this town earlier than a child. While Freddy knows the true secret of his true identity. Rachel Talalay's (Ghost in the Machine, Tank Girl) director made a grim sequel, but something strangely different, with a visual style and funny moments for this horror / fantasy / thriller. Yaphet Kotto (Alien) has the role of psychologist in dreams. This has some ingenious visual effects (Not everyone will love the climax, especially in 3D) and a good style in his story. This DVD has a strong anamorphic transfer (1.85: 1) (also in Pan & Scan) and a powerful Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The DVD has its original Theatrical Trailer, Jump to Nightmare's opinion and Cast & Crew information. The "Elm Street" series of speakers, the eighth disc, has interviews with the casting team and the sixth film. The sixth film is also in 3-D for the peak of the movie, but you can also watch at 2-D. This is the last of the Elm Street movies until Wes Craven revived Freddy in a different, darker style in New Nightmare and in the terrifying but surprisingly funny "Freddy Vs Jason." Watch Robert Shaye (co-owner and co-CEO of New Line Cinema), Roseanne Barr, Tom Arnold, Johnny Depp, and Alice Cooper in funny homes. Written by Michael De Luca (John Carpenter in the Mouth of Madness). From a director's story. (*** Â½ / *****).
