This is one of the few movies released about a kind of "what if" situation that made me believe. It was amazing to hear them talking to each other and to remember all the wonderful (and not so wonderful) things that took place between them.

These are good memories for each fan to support and ask what would actually happen between them would be selfish. What a funny movie this was. The comic aspects of the movie were great. Believing that they were together to make things between them in such a way is a convincing thought for people who want to have a chance to release the air with someone they have not reached. To see John, an awful and stretched character was refreshing to hear all the rubbish that he was talking about ...
