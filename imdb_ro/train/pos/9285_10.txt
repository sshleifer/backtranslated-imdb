Finally! An Iranian film that is not made by Majidi, Kiarostami or Makhmalbafs. This is a non-documentary comedy, a black comedy, with subversive girls, that kicks the "system" in the ass. It's football and fun, really funny. The director says, "The places are real, the event is real, so are the characters and the extras, so I intentionally chose not to use professional actors, because their presence would have introduced a notion of falsity." Non-actors will immediately root you, if not. your heart is made of stone b. you are blind. Excellent scripts, the film provokes the patriarchal authority with almost absurd freshness. He won the Grand Jury Prize, Berlin, 2006. Dear reader, he is almost perfect. Where can I understand?
