Another large channel 4 preserved long before time. Convincing action by Phil Davis and the cast. Sexy, smart and funny. I remember looking at that moment and even then, wondering, nobody really heard. But trying to find someone who can remember is even harder. Perhaps Channel 4 does not do its job well enough to create the necessary enthusiasm. Both the audience and the general public are too interested in the TV spitting that is Big Brother. I suspect the latter. The release of Garth Merengie's Dark Place made Channel 4 launch a DVD of that series. Let's hope it can happen in North Market.
