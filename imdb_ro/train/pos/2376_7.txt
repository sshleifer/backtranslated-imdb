Everyone who revises this film, and perhaps many professional film reviewers, does not get it. This film was made with matte sequences and art techniques quite akin to the works of the great Czech director, Karel Zeman. If you want to know what I'm talking about, I suggest you have any of Zeman's movies, such as Jules Verne's Fabulous World, Baron Munchausen, The Coming to the Beginning of Time, or Comet. If you can not locate a movie, read the reviews from AMG. They will explain the processes used. If we had to look at Zeman's work and try to compare it with any of the other fantastic films of the time, the audience would probably never have arrived. It is unfair to compare any of the styles of these movies to the standard technologies of the day, because both Zemen and Hines "do not compute". They have a style that is unique to them and should be judged only for their creativity. If you look at this movie from a perspective where you know that you deliberately tried to create a mat paste collapsed with live action, you could easily come to the conclusion that he did a master's job. It's not easy to do a bunch of computer streams. I thought the creatures were pretty good, considering how they were made. Hines made a big bet and I think his movie will not be judged for years. Someone who promotes the film should have prevented the audience from seeing what they would rather than go blindly to the theater waiting for the CG's usual work. As for the actors, I think Hines also took a page from Zemen's book, where many of Zemen's actors were somewhat unspoken at first, but they became more involved as film and action continued . It's totally refreshing for me to have this movie in my library. I'll follow her over the years, all three of his good times.
