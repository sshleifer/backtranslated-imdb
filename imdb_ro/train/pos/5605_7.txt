This strangeness at Roman Polanski clearly shows where his concerns were at the time he did. Polanski himself plays a shy man who rents a Paris apartment where the tenant has committed suicide. He becomes obsessed with the discovery of what led to her, to the point where she was dragging and re-educating the events as they might have been. The film is anxious to a point and has that creepy horror atmosphere that Polanski excels on, but it's too much like a remix of "Rosemary's Child" and "Repulsion," two more Polanski films that deal with but for concern ... if I do not read the film too much, I have to believe that it was Polanksi's reaction to the feelings of the persecution that he felt was labeled as a sexual perversion and exiled from America. I do not think about it in one way or the other, but it is hard to deny the evidence about it in the movie itself. <br /> <br /> Grade: B +
