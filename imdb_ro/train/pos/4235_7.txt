.... after 16 years Tim Burton finally disappointed me !!!! Anything happened to the old Burton who read "The Dark Knight Returns" by Frank Miller as research for his preparation to direct Batman back in 1988-89? As Burton did not research the book or film because he got it all back! This movie is shit! It is not as good as the original and does not deal with the same subject as the original. If you want a monkey movie to watch the original. <br /> <br /> ** from star ****
