This has funnist jokes from all Cheech & Chong movies. It's the first one I've seen with these boys. It seemed very good to me. My father recommended me to get it. WHAT A LARGE MODEL, and my GRANDMA actually bought me, knowing what it was like. What a family I have. Well, this movie is pretty good and great to rent when you want to see a good classic. I have to warn you that it's not weird. She has her moments, but not as fun as anything about Mary. Check him anyway. I'm sure you laugh. Unless you're an anti-drug activist or something like that.
