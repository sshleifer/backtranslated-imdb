It was "The Night HE Came Home," warned John Carpenter's posters of making classic horror. In a small American city, the Halloween Centers tried Michael Myers' attempt to kill Laurie Strode's sister, and in this process he eliminates all his friends in a rather brutal way ... leaving Laurie the poor fights against Michael indisciplinated. This extraordinary plot inspired countless horror blows throughout the 80's, 90's and continues to do it today, as well as a remake of the remake of 2007. The difference between them, and this, is simply that "Halloween" is the best. Made on a very modest and tight budget ... Halloween changed the face of horror in 1978 and gave birth to the sub-genre of "sexually promiscuous teenagers" who are followed by a knife / ax / chain / with a psycho.
