"Elvira, the Lady of Darkness" is a sort of "Harper Valley P.T.A." with the touch of the supernatural. Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) performs her job as a host of horror television, after the owner of the new station gets drunk with her. She is now based on a show in Las Vegas that she is wearing, but finds out that she has to come up with more money to start the show. Things seem hopeless to raise that money until she receives the observation of her aunt's death, which then takes Elvira to Massachusetts to read the will. A house that needs repair, a dog and a cookbook are all left to her aunt, and again, it seems Elvira has trouble coming up with the money for the show in Las Vegas. Small and narrow city adults think things worse making things harder for Elvira. Only local career (Daniel Greene) and a group of teenagers will be friends with her. Elvira's uncle "Vinnie" (W. Morgan Sheppard) is pushing to make a deal with Elvira for the cookbook, but Elvira soon learns about her powerful legacy, including spellcasting, and a very effective couple. Elvira no longer wants to sell his chef to his uncle, but he is determined to get his hands on him knowing his power. Elvira then faces the burning of the old charge of the city's witchcraft and the confrontation between her and her uncle. The plot is quite simple, but humor and well-developed characters keep it in a beautiful rhythm. "Elvira, the Master of Darkness" is full of humorous, brutal, humble and intelligent, worn by many gangs of sight, words, props, songs and parodies. The touches of the occult film make this one of the best horror parodies ever made. It is a well-done film, terribly acting by all the performers; including Edie McClurg and Jeff Conaway (by "Grease.") There are also nice special effects. Many people (including myself) wondered if the Elvira character could wear a feature film, and the answer is delightful, YES!
