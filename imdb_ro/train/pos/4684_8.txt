Petre Mattei "Love in Money" is an amazingly visible film. Mr. Mattei gives us a living portrait of human relationships. This is a movie that seems to tell us what money, power and success makes people in the different situations we encounter. <br /> <br /> This is a variation of Arthur Schnitzler's play on the same subject, the director now transfers action to New York where all these different characters meet and connect. Everyone is connected in one way or another to the next person, but no one seems to know the previous contact point. Stylishly, the film has a sophisticated luxury look. We are going to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat. The only thing that makes all of these souls in the picture are the different stages of loneliness that each one lives. A big city is not exactly the best place where human relationships find a sincere fulfillment, as is the case with most people we face. The actor is good under the direction of Mr. Mattei. Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carol Kane, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier and other talented distributors make these characters come alive. We much wish Mr. Mattei and we look forward to his future work.
