This film is one of the most subtle films of that time. When you watch this action-packed movie, and when something does not really happen, humor is not right. Brilliant letter for a film that was made to give us a bloody mix, a show of play in which criminals are competitors and a near future in which the general public all has a thirst for blood. Also, Arnold does not leave us with some of the best liners. I do not want to ruin anything, but I tell you when Arnold gives it "I will come back" He gets the best answer of all in this movie. I hope you enjoy this jewel as much as I do.
