I headed for the bar, expecting it to be a hot beer on a day full of Texas, but it was pleasantly surprised. After I suffered through Saturday night's madness, I had no desire to see a re-make in some barnyard in southern Texas ... and I did not. John Revolta was good as a jealous red, Scott Glenn was well thrown as an ex-con thuggie, and Debra Winger was, as always, a delight. * The love of that woman * Plus, the soundtrack was dynamite [and that comes from a guy who can not bear the sound of country music]. A fun movie all the way.
