This "Age" film deals with the experiences of two young girls, Dani and Maureen, while learning about life and loving a summer girl. Directed by Robert Mulligan, renowned for his superb work in "To Kill a Mockingbird," the film never touches a fake note. All the acting is superb. As Dani, Reese Witherspoon makes an amazing film debut. Seeing this beautiful, filmed and filmed movie, I felt I was looking through a window to reality rather than watching a movie. I have watched this movie at least 5 times and can honestly say it is one of the best single movies ever made to be young, to be in love and to go through the feelings, challenges and changes of young adults. Families with children between 10 and 15 should look at it together and use it as a discussion piece because it raises a number of issues related to brothers' rivalry, how to handle being in love, a parent's responsibilities, etc.
