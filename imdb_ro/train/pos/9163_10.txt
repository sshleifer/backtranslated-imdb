When my collegiate daughter was in kindergarten, this miniseries appeared in A & E from 8-9 every morning. My neighbor and I made a pact that we would not miss a minute of Jane Eyre and our kids were late for preschool every morning for the whole week. A good choice. I forgot how much I liked this movie until I recently released the old VHS copy. Timothy Dalton is very nice but still perfect as Rochester. The dark, ragged face, temperamental temperament with humor and sensitivity were directly on the pages of the book. Although Dalton ate a bit of scenery, I could not stand by an adaptation with Wimpy William Hurt or a strange Ciaran Hinds. The magic here is that women love Dalton and are caught in love. I'd love to know what happened to Zela Clarke. She died as Jane, quiet, formal, telling volumes with a look. The sparkle in her eyes gives viewers a glimpse into the power and spiritual nature that helped Jane survive the torture she suffered in her youth. The critique of interpreting it as "wood" is wrong. A servant in a proper household in England would have kept such behavior, but she speaks passionately when she is overcome by emotion. Unlike many other Janes screens, it appears quite clear to be Jane still quite enough to allow the audience to buy Rochester's attraction to her. Bronte's dialogue is a big part of why the book resists the script keeps much of it intact. Dalton and Clarke capture the interaction between Jane and Rochester with intense intensity and intensity. Although Jane appears so clear and sweet as a vanilla cream, she refuses to be fed by Rochester's dark and gentle. The two guys play handsome one. <br /> <br /> This is the most perfect adaptation of the best Romanian novel ever.
