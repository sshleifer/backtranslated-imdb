It was released in France on DVDs a few years ago - I would like to be re-released with English subtitles. Do not confuse this with the remake with Penelope Cruz, which has poor reviews. Gerard Phillippe is a peasant who is told to marry the king's daughter. He begins to join the army and goes to war. His love, however, is Gina Lollabrigida in an early film for her. I will not hurt the end. Gerard Phillippe died a few years later, at a young age, a great loss of being moved.
