We watched the summer movie filming in a few days, the final result being just two scenes from the movie. The location was Lake Sylvan in the Black Hills. Bring the wagon, stop the wagon, etc. So this young Dakota was looking forward to watching the movie and was not disappointed. The local buffalo herd was stitched, so shooting scenes were real. (yes Doris, the animals were injured during the filming) I think the end was copied by Jack Nicholson in Shining? A Great Western / Social Commentary of the 1950s. This should be in the same class as High Noon for real Western drama or used as a social statement, such as Jungle Blackboard or Rebel Without A Cause was for the young 50-year-old.
