I went to this film only because I was dragged there and would have left again immediately because the audience was made up of older people in particular, and I felt helpless. However, the film was extremely fascinating and far from being targeted by the elderly. The characters were very real and credible and I woke up talking a few hours after the film, characters and story. There are some pretty pretty scenes, but they are necessary and help you understand the situation much better. On the whole, this is a great and valuable film - slightly outside the mainstream, but that does not mean that this movie can not enjoy those who prefer the mainstream. It's exciting and exciting cinematic experience.
