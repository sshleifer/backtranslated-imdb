I first saw this movie a few years ago during Cinemax Friday after the dark series (back when the cable was built as a keyboard) and intrigued me. Even if there is an unnecessary aspect to the film it is well-behaved. Depardieu & Dewaere's performance is great. They have good chemistry together and Miou-Miou makes a pink fur look amazing. A movie like this is probably not going to be done in these politically correct times (at least not in the US), because it seems to sensitize things like violence, robbery and occasional sex. This film proves that, with a talented cast and also a talented director, a good film is a good film regardless of the subject. I was sad to find out that Patrick Dewaere committed suicide and in the near future, I will check with Depardieu & Miou -Mai in Take your hunt.
