Just the type of movie I love. Some very good British actors, as well as the only and only Sharon Stone. Catherine Tramell (Stone) proudly manipulates a well educated group of people's lives, playing on their fragile to collect experiences to write a book about the mystery of the crime. She plays the female psychopath very well, while using her sexual magnitude to convincingly illustrate what might be considered one of the last black widows. Tramell is useful in the darkness of society and participates freely in sadomasochistic flights in the "never visited after dark" horizon of the city. From the beginning, there is only a R classification here from the dialog. Stone could also be described as a kind of female Hannibal Lecter, a woman without fatal emotion without a table plan.
