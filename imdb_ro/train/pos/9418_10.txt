I have had this movie on the band for years and I started to look back again this morning (while waiting for my clothes - how ironic!), Especially because I wanted to hear Benjamin Frankel's music again. I have come to sit around the first half an hour, excited by how wonderful it has provided direction, writing and performance. The film resembles that of the 50-year-old British character: Cecil Parker, Michael Gough, Miles Malleson, Duncan Lamont and, in particular, Ernest Thesiger, the great giant of textile factories. Not to mention Alec Guinness and Joan Greenwood, not characters of character as such, but also charming, charismatic. This is science fiction in the purest form and droll comedy. A classic all the time, and I hope nobody is trying to remake it!
