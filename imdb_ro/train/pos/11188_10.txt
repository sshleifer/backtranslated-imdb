I'm a great fan of Stephen King's work, and this movie made me a bigger fan of the king. Pet Sematary is about the Creed family. They just moved to a new home and seem happy. But there is a cemetery behind the house. The new neighbor of Creed (played by Fred Gwyne) explains the funeral site behind the pet cemetery. This funeral ground is pure. Judge says Louis Creed that when you bury a human being (or any pet) in the bottom of the tomb, they will return to life. The only problem is that when they return, they are NOT the same person, they are bad. Soon after Judas explains everything about the Pet signatory, everything starts to go to hell. I will not explain because I do not want to give some of the main parts of the film. Actor Pet Sematary was pretty good, but he needed a little work. The story was one of the main parts of this film, primarily because it was so original and captivating. This movie has a lot of makeup effects that make the film more dizzying and frightening. One of the most basic reasons why this movie made me chills was actually the makeup effect. There is a character in this movie that is really strange. This character is "Zelda". This particular character appears in the movie about three times to be precise. Zelda is Rachel Creed's sister who died years ago, but Rachel is still haunted by her. The first time Zelda appears in the movie is generally not frightening because he does not speak or not, but the second time is the worst, and to be honest, the second time scares those who live in me. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie, it is almost perfect. Pet Sematary offers wonderful scarecrows, pretty good behavior, first-rate plot and fascinating makeup. This is truly one of the most horror movies of all time. 10 out of 10.
