The ship could be submerged, but the movie did not! The director, James Cameron, from "The Terminator" did it again with this amazing picture. One of my favorite scenes is the "table" scene, where Rose's family and friends meet Jack after he saves her. Rose has a look that every woman should have when you meet "THE ONE" ... I hope I have that look when I'm in the room with my future husband. Jack and Rose have a connection that's "MOVIE STUFF," but it's a good movie. We have the greedy mother and all of her elite, who have remained in associates who live in the wealth of their husbands. Rose almost suicides, but the Gilbert Grape Star saves her. I really enjoyed hanging over the boat scene. It was a good risk. The movie is long, but it's fantastic! Good story, good flow, good actors! Go see twice if you want, it's worth it!
