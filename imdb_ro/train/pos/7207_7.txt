I entered Deathtrap waiting for a well orchestrated and intriguing thriller; and while this is something akin to what this movie is; I also can not believe it's just a Sleuth of a poor man. The classic 1972 film is obviously a source of inspiration for this film; not specifically regarding the plot, but it is certainly the case with the execution. Casting Michael Caine into the central role confirms it. The film is based on a play by Ira Levin (who previously wrote Rosemary's Child and Stepford's Wives) and focuses on Sidney Bruhl; a playwright whose good days are behind him. After his last game bombs, Sidney is at a low level; and this is not helped when a piece called Deathtrap; written by an amateur he taught, reaches the door. Deathtrap is a guaranteed commercial success, and Sidney is soon to launch a plot of his own; which involves inviting amateur writing, murdering and then passing Deathtrap as his own work. Despite all the intelligent breaths, Deathtrap falls on a primary element, and that's the characters. The film fails to give a single character and it's very hard to care for the story when you are not rooting for any of the players. This is not helped by the actor. Michael Caine performs well and fun as you would expect, but no one else is proud. Christopher Reeve is uncomfortable in his role, while Dyan Cannon manages to make the only character that can be deceiving with a frantic, irritating performance. It is lucky that the story is good; and it's good enough to save the movie. The land has a lot of twists; some work better than others, but there are always plenty of efforts to make sure the movie remains exciting. Director Sidney Lumet deserves credit too, because the style of the movie is another huge plus. The central location is interesting in itself, and the cinema fits well with the movie. Generally, I must admit that I enjoyed this film; but it could have been much, much better.
