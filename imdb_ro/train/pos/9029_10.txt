I saw that movie a few days ago. This movie is so great that it makes me feel that if you want something very bad you've always dreamed - you can have it. This shows that great desire is made real, happiness and sadness, without hope and failure. But if you are strong enough and your heart really belongs to something you love, you can do different things and be happy.
