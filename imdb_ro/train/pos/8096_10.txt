First, the only reason why people continue to fight about this movie is because they can not bear some parts of the true story being "altered." Well, guess what? Peter Jackson's film was no perfect teaching. Pretty fast. This is a very beautiful movie. The backgrounds are wonderful and taken from well-known Tolkein artists. The film covers about half the trilogy (Fellowship of the Ring and the battle of Helms Deep in the two towers) and moves at a good pace. The voice tower is top and most of the characters look as if I imagined they wanted to. Samwise is a little too nasty for my tastes, but Aragorn seems AWESOME. The film has a high score that fully supports the film. If you enjoy good fantastic stories but want to read (the books are even better) give this film a try, as it was done 20 years ago. Also a special note: the adaptation of Peter Jackson Fellowship follows almost exactly the same direction as Ralph Bakshi (Jackson often said how much he admired Bakshi's effort).
