The terrain is horrible, the atmosphere is really depressing, unusual for low-budget production, and at least for German production. A bit of Indian spirituality, a mystical thriller and a slasher film mixed together. Developing plot and characters are wonderful, the sets are very close to reality without any studio atmosphere. It could be perfect, but unfortunately some things were a bit disappointing, which inevitably should not be common for low budget films: 1.) Second, the cast does not exceed the average. Almost every actor looks like a layman. Some of them do a good job or a very good job, but some act like actors of some frightening German performances! But I was very, very disappointed with the acting of Mathieu Carri√®re! His actor (in a lot of his older films, his act was fine) was here under the media! But this may be the reason why he is currently participating in great German soaps or private channel TV shows. 2.) Dialogues are sometimes soap-level. <br /> <br /> 3.) The bad sound sometimes made it very difficult to understand what the characters say. I saw it on DVD and I was glad to come back and listen to it again. She caused the set (big rooms like in the hospital or with the esoteric group) and sometimes the strange dialect of the actors! But overall, it's an interesting movie, it's worth watching it, far beyond commercial films, which are often more terrible.
