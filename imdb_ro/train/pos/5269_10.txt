I like bad movies. Not only because they are often as fun as "good" movies (such as the Pirates of the Caribbean and other Hollywood stories), but they are often much better than those movies. And that's why I like the Italian riding in the 1970's and 80's cinema. And that's why I especially love this movie, The Barbarians & Company. Director Ruggero Deodato has made some very good movies, such as House on the Edge of the Park and also Atlantis interceptors and live like a policeman, die like a man are enjoyable action movies. But this is very bad. Barbarians are such an idiotic movie. Peter and David Paul as barbarian brothers Kutchek and Gore are very funny because of their lack of charisma and acting skills. But if they can not act, they scream and scream every time I do something important. In one scene, people try to hang the barbarian brothers and they escape in a very extraordinary way. Bad is acting, bad bad effects, bad story, bad direction, in fact everything is bad in this movie. I can not describe how much I laughed when I first looked. Barbarians & Company is a classic classic that everyone should see once. If you thought Plan 9 in outer space was a fun camp, it would be a real killer.
