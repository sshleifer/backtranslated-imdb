It's hard to describe Bug in words, it's one of those movies that must really be seen. There is a more fluid and more interesting narrative than anything we've seen in a Hollywood version lately. While his characters react to the chain of events in different ways, and as events dictate different paths for the characters that follow, the audience is just an observer. The narrative flow of thought thinking, even the spontaneity of the script, will make you stick to the screen, looking forward to seeing how everything is finally working. And, as far as the thematic elements are concerned ... there is a special sequence in the movie, which goes from melancholy, to bright and beautiful, and then to tragic, all in the range of about one minute. And this. <br /> <br /> This movie is pure magic. Somebody remembers why independent film is probably the brightest star the cinematographic industry currently has. Perhaps, with more Bug quality movies, people will begin to take note.
