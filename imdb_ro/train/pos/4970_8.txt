Some critics have found this grim movie, but for me there was enough humor and good optimism to overcome this impression. For example, the quietly positive and stoic character of the daughter is the centerpiece of the film, often counterbalancing the unfortunate aspects of the scene and the plot. The film is full of original ideas and characters, and the end result is not predictable: I felt it could have gone anyway. By the way, many reviews I've read mention the efficient use of black and white, but the footprint we saw on the SBS television network in Australia was full of color. <br /> <br />
