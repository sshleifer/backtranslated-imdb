This was the second time I watched the movie (French version, unlike the first one, which was reproduced in Italian) and I feel it improves on later viewing. a study of characters that is beautifully shot and with the Parisian settings being equally impressive. In the long run, it's not the first-class Polanski, and I would classify him at number nine in his filmography, but it's still an incredible mixture of subtle chills and, surprisingly, often a wide comedy. It also has a fine distribution, all in good shape, but especially Isabelle Adjani, Melvyn Douglas and Jo Van Fleet. Even so, I am a bit embarrassed by the sudden coercion for Trelkovsky to "change" the previous tenant; Apart from the owner of the cafeteria in front of the apartment block, where Simone was given, without asking if he wanted something different, there is not much to indicate (as far as I can discern anyway) that that's what everyone wanted him to do! Okay, so he found Simone's things still in the apartment, but what made him wear his dress and make her (even if she apparently started doing this unconsciously)? According to his secret visions in the bathroom, the last section of the movie (where Adjani disappears though) is almost anti-climatic - especially the scene where the owner and other tenants are witnessing his suicide attempt as if it were a night at Opera, a concept that was already used 46 years earlier by Jean Cocteau in SULFURUL UN POETE (1930)! The end, then, is both predictable and unresolved: what made the two occupants of this particular apartment jump out of the window? I remember that this factor made me disturb the first view, and I'm sorry to say that it's not clear now! Your mind, the first two-thirds of the film are pretty solid, but I want Polanski to rely less on the obscure plot points.
