We can only imagine the movie Mr Welles could end up without the studio interference! This movie is a bad Welles, but it's worth every minute of it because you can see the greatness of the best American film director of all time! We can see the tax that Orson Welles took on filming in this movie. The story has many holes in it, probably because of the requirements of studio directors who did not trust the director. <br /> <br /> It is curious to read some of the opinions submitted to IMDB that compares Orson Welles with the Coen brothers, Roman Polanski, even with Woody Allen, when all the directors should be considered as followers of the great master himself. Nobody was more original and more creative in the history of American cinema than Mr. Welles. It is lucky to continue to have his legacy either in a retrospective, such as the one at the New York Film Forum has just finished, either his films on tape or on DVD. Rita Hayworth has never been more loved than here. If she was a beauty with her red hair, like a blonde, she is too stunning for words. Everett Sloan and Glenn Anders made an excellent contribution to the film. The only thing that could have made this film another masterpiece to be added to Orson Welles' work body was his own. If he had been focused on director and another actor Michael O'Hara would have performed, it could have otherwise made a different film. Orson Welles must be credited because he is perhaps a pioneer in taking the camera away from the studio group in the street. The images in this movie are so stunning that we leave the theater after seeing the movie truly impressed by the work, vision and talent it gave us.
