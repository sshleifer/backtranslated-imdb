This is an excellent movie. Distribution is a great mix of characters, and the story is decent. The film is, in principle, a well executed doctor who steals the bodies of the dead brides and takes them home. Once the bodies are at home, it removes things (I do not like to use such a general term, but forget what was removed) and puts it in his wife to keep his youth. Then the reporter, Patricia Hunter, investigates the situation and begins to find answers about why brides have died. She makes a trip to doctors' home and interesting things begin to take place. Surely she's watching this old, but good one if you can.
