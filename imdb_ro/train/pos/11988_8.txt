I looked at the show when I was little. When I think about it, I just remember vaguely. If you ask me, it was a good show. Two things that I vaguely remember are the opening sequence and the thematic song. In addition, everyone has been ideally distributed. Also, the writing was very strong. And the performance was top. I hope a network will bring it back to see each episode. Before concluding this, I would like to say that I always remember this show in my memory forever, even though I do not think I have seen each episode. Now, in conclusion, if a network ever brings it back, I hope you will catch it the day before you get out of the air forever.
