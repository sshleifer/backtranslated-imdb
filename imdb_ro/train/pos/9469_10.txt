The answer to one of the clues is Murphy's Law: Everything can go wrong, it will go wrong. This is exactly the case of Dan Burns (Steve Carell, the office), a columnist for the local newspaper. Dan is an expert in giving advice for everyday life, but he realizes that things are not so perfect in his own life. Dan in real life is amazing in capturing these ironies in his everyday life and manages to embrace the comedy, tragedy and beauty of all. Besides the fact that this movie is pretty damn. The death of his wife forces Dan to raise his three daughters on his own ... each daughter in his own pivotal stages of life: the first anxious to try his driving license, the middle one in the adolescence phase, and the youngest to to move away from childhood. Things take a tower for Dan when he goes to Rhode Island for a family reunion and stops an interesting woman in a bookstore. Her name is Marie (Juliette Binoche, Chocolat) and she's looking for a book to help her avoid difficult situations ... which is exactly what's in the store when they're thrown into the Burns Family.

Dan in real life is definitely worth seeing, for one joy to watch all the funny subtleties on which we often lose in our everyday lives and most likely I enjoy it a second time or even a third. put us on my tab ".
