The part of The Grinch was made for Jim Carrey and I was extremely impressed with his performance. He was not a big fan of him, I was worried, but pleasantly surprised by the result. Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou Cine was the prettiest little girl I've seen on the screen for a long time and showed a maturity beyond her years in her acting skills. I was even attracted to tears at some point! I never read the book about Dr. Seuss's story, so I did not know what to expect, the humor was pretty dark. Overall, I liked the movie (except songs!) And I would recommend it for watching the family especially.
