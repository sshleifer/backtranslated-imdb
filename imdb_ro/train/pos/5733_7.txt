I'll end the balloons here and say I liked it. However, the cartoon is really just to appeal to those who have very absurd tendencies. It's definitely something that most people will not receive, just like the nature of the absurd. Animation is horrible, but yes, that's the point. The main character is dirty, violent and stupid. without the redemption. his wife shouts and waxes, seemingly barely capable of the most basic communication skills. most of these stories have no point. <br /> <br /> But again, that's the point;) Unless seizures, unlawful language and complete and complete sliding are yours, you will like it. It's very short, so I'd probably rent instead of buying.
