Japanese animators have a unique freedom with animation, which is why they tend to be able to come up with movies like these, films that eventually end up on hard-drive anime fans and student students, but be completely ignored by almost anyone outside their home country. Cat Supa is one of those films that, from Western eyes, should be experienced on drugs or deeply analyzed. Indeed, it is just a beautiful, super-realistic journey. There is no real dialogue, which makes it easy to convey to other interested parties who are not interested in subtitles. A cat and a half of death (brain-dead?) Sister travel through various landscapes of imagination and association. Is there a general theme of water or its lack (possibly due to the cat's drowning at the beginning? Probably because of the title?). There is an interesting genus to get Genesis. There is a pig that gets to eat. An elephant made of water. And it's great, convincing, exciting and fun - provided you do not watch it around druggies who can not experience unique visuals without comparing to an acidity journey. Eventually the movie stops, adding another convincing self-reflective level to the trial. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
