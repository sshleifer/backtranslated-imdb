Although I'm inclined to agree with the other comments made by people who have seen this movie, I'm ashamed to say that I like more. Not many times a pile of 80-year-old papyrus can be found outside of a Wham! video, so it's worth watching (Â£ 0.79 per night in your local store!). Beware of inspired stitching and zippers on the monsters' suit, the "hero" looks a lot like Keith Chegwin and such classic lines as: Evil Wizard-Type Bloke: "We finally meet Kor .. "Kor:" Funny, is not it? "I also liked the fact that, although the video box looks quite interesting with the pictures of a castle surrounded by angry sea and a dangerous shock such as a bird wearing a beautiful hero in front of safety (among other "interesting and interesting" suggestions about what's happening in the real movie, none of it actually happens.) No, I'm not kidding ... big or a ferocious bird, just trying to get you interested in ... classic in my opinion. This movie gets 10 for pure entertainment value!
