A pleasant animated film by Batman. It is not equal to the "Return of the Joker" or "The Mask of Fantasy," but solid though. I liked how the movie was to guess who the Batwoman was. It was a beautiful twist. Successful action sequences. I've always believed that Batman cartoons are better than any of Batman's serious ones. The trend continues here. <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10
