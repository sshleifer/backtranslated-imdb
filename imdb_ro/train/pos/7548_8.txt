Brief, but enough, Cat Supa is a very wild trip to watch. One day, I was just looking for an anime section on my list of requests and I came across it and decided to follow it. I spent all the time, sitting tight. Meanwhile, I was either empty of thoughts or a passing one, screaming "STOP!". But I did not. And actually, I'm glad I did. The animation is amazing. Very artistic, weird and dark. I loved him personally for amazing animation, but the seemingly naked story behind her is just as compelling for me. A boy - well, a cat - goes looking for his sister's soul. In the first part he gets sick in bed and is paid soon by a visit from a sort of grim reaper. Her soul is divided into two. One is regained by the cat boy, while the other half is lost. Then the rest of the movie is easily lost to me, honestly. I expect their world to come back ... can it break down slowly? Maybe the absence of the soul is the answer behind this situation, because the rest of the film contains different stages from which the world enters. First, there is a huge flood, and then it dries in a gloomy desert and then it freezes (thanks to whatever God or fate is, as you will see). Then they think they find the sister's soul in the form of an orange flower. After that, the whole world disappears. Haha totally did not get this, but he sent me column rivers every time. In spite of seemingly random scenes, I'm sure there's a deeper message behind it if you keep track of it and do some research. Personally, I like trippy stuff like this and I like to spend my time doing just that to understand it. But for some people it's probably not a cup of tea. She's just as disturbing, so if you like your anime straight, it's not a movie for you. But if you have an open mind, I recommend this movie.
