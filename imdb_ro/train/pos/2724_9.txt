Many of the classic films of the late '60s have not kept their ability to bother and face the public. "In Cold Blood" did not lose an ounce of power. Exceptionally well done, it forces the spectator to think. Some have complained not only about the film, but about Truman Capote's source, the "non-fiction novel", that the central message is dissatisfied. That may be true, but this is certainly a case where the lack of ambiguity does not diminish it at all. She is refreshing, especially taking into account the simplistic and manipulative moral dramas of today, to see a film with a convincing political voice, without fear of forcing the audience to consider their point of view. To be honest, I'm not sure if I agree with the central message of the film, but I admire my indignation with all that. Even if you do not agree with the death penalty message, you have to admire many of the movie. Action from the two leaderships is terrible. Scott Wilson (one of the most underestimated actors ever) cools down as a nihilist leader who uses his charisma to hide his weak points. Robert Blake also cools the more subject he is between the two and the one with a conscience. His character, obviously, has a voice of reason, but he is frightened to resist Wilson (there is a lot of homoerotic subtext from his character). Cinematography is extraordinary, thin and yet tough and gives the impression that the viewer is watching a documentary. Add another classical Quincey Jones score, and you have a masterpiece. (9/10)
