A documentary about a pair of Canadian producers, Bobby Myers (Matthew Modine) and Paul Linder (Saul Rubinek), are trying to make their first film in the late 1970s. Hollywood North is the comic story of their struggle to shoot everything together, despite a number of contradictory threads. Hollywood North acts as a movie in a way very similar to why this is Spinal Tap (1984) so ​​good. That is, although it is exaggerated in some respects, it is very close to the truth, and the truth lies in the "behind the scenes" facts, which are very different from the public aspect of the industry. It's not easy to make a movie and it must have been very difficult in Canada in the late 1970s. Movies involve dozens, if not hundreds, of people. Many have wishes, motivations and incompetent personalities. Very important are the financiers and talent on the screen, as if they were fallen or become undesirable at any stage while the film is in production, could endanger the whole business, either by requiring extensive reps or by abandoning the film altogether. > <br /> It's not surprising that Hollywood North focuses on such relationships. The result is an excellent movie that is both hilarious and tragic at the same time. The script is flawless and performance is top. This is an indispensable thing for anyone in the making and anyone who has a serious interest in making the film. It should also be more than fun for any spectator with a modicum of intelligence and a sense of humor. A 10 out of 10 from me.
