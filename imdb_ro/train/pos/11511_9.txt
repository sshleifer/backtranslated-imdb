Sometimes poor scripts? Yes! Tired special effects at times? Yes! Pretty good guilty most of the time? Yes! More about Carl Kolchak and Darren McGavin? Yes! I always enjoyed fiction as a child, but I found so much shit in Dracula / Frankenstein / Mummy / horror. I took Abbott and Costello to give me a new perspective on the universal classical monsters and I took Carl Kolchak to win the "dark side" of the entertainment. The Duke had Rooster Cogburn, Eastwood had Dirty Harry, Garner had Maverick and Rockford, Selleck had Magnum, and Darren McGavin had Carl Kolchak. Shuffled with all those weak scripts, special effects with cheeses, that baroque group of characters and supporting and seeing actors, was Darren McGavin as well as Carl Kolchak. He had a sense of humor despite the danger, he was an idealist in search of the truth, and a realist when he accepted the mandatory incompetence and the possible hiding of the government officials. In addition, as opposed to 98% of us, Kolchak was willing to keep his neck and do what he had to do, even if it meant his death, the end of his journalist career or the prison. For all his mistakes, with no taste in his clothes, Carl Kolchak was a man of charm and spirit who drove a beautiful yellow yellow Mustang (which was an old car used at the time) on his way to save the day for mankind . As good as any other fictional hero, Carl Kolchak, the man's hero has been brought to life every week for a year thanks to Darren McGavin. Now that his performance is on DVD, I hope he has so much fun watching me watch him have fun playing Kolchak The Night Stalker again!
