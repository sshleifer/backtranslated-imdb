I feel like this movie is a rare treasure. Not only is the beginning of Shirley Temple's career, but a rare look at how our society has changed. You must understand that certain things that today would be considered to be sexual are considered innocent. For example, parents of children in the movie, as well as many parents who took their children to see this movie, saw this only as children who mimic adults. Most people did not think of anyone watching sex-appealing children, except teenage boys looking at adolescent girls. For them it was not sexual. Remember this before you have internet, television, etc. Most sexual offenses have not been opened openly. Occasionally it would be a whisper about the baby with "the funny uncle." But that was often what came from it. Very sad. But it is sad today, for even I can see this film as something other than what was intended, innocent and funny. When I saw Shirley dancing like that and the boys around her, yes, I felt disturbed. I have to remember why this happened! These kids did not know what sex they were. Parents knew that both the children of the film and the followers. The thought may not have entered into their minds. In the eyes of the average adult, then there was no sex unless Shirley was playing the house. Even today, children will enter the beauty contest, many dressed extremely mature for a three-year age. However, the child just pretends. They do not blame the child because he wants to behave like an adult. Or the old movies that show this. With all sincerity, our media has done a lot of things that seem to be bad and bad. This may sometimes be the best. But I really think this movie is not one of them. It gives a rare image of an innocent mentality, which we have lost long ago.
