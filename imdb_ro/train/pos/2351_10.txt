First of all, I want to make clear that the average user's inability to appreciate imagination is terrible. What makes this show so unique is the hyper-reality it creates. You do not need to know why Ned can bring people back from the dead or why it can only be a minute. Where the wonderful stories of childhood whims gone, just like a Wrinkle in time. I say it is refreshingly original, because it is a polar opposite to the lay-all-out television masses that leave no place for imagination or wonder. It's nice to add a little escape to the television experience. Hyper-reality is my favorite look of the show. The setting of the 1950s, innocent and rare characters, as well as the landscape and physical settings that are not meant to be considered pure reality. This show masks the morbid nature of death, while others embrace it. During entertainment, other television shows have taken a shelf back to this series. It has truly restored a sense of curiosity, imagination and wonder on television. Pushing Daisies quickly made it to the top of my list.
