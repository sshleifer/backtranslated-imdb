I read Schneebaum's book (the same title as this film) when it was published for the first time and was deeply moved by its ability to see through many ways of "alterity" (of himself and of the Amazon people with whom he lived and loved) a way to live a decent life. His subsequent books were not as strong, but he showed his continued search. The description of his sexual relations with the men of the tribe was long before his time in the early 1960s, but his honesty and openness in this regard were welcome. This film conveys both the beauty and generosity of man, but also gives insight into the inevitable inevitable destruction (which is not a morally positive term in this case) that occurs when "civilized" people enter traditional societies. Even so, Schneebaum himself moved into a kind of greater innocence that suggests the possibility of saving mankind from its own destructiveness.
