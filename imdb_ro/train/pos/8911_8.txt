I have seen The Blob several times and it's one of the best low-budget invasion films in the 1950s. A strange meteorite is just outside a small town, and an elderly man goes to investigate this. A jelly-like substance attaches to one of his arms and a young couple who saw the meteor shower arrive in time and takes him to the local doctor, where the old man becomes completely absorbed by the table. The doctor and nurse are the next victims, and the mass is getting bigger. When these incidents are reported to the police, they do not believe the young man and accuses them of doing all this. They finally believe when the massive, huge gang goes back to the city cinema and everyone runs the streets screaming. Then he attaches himself to a dinner with the young couple and others in. The blob is stopped by spraying a load of fire extinguishers and freezing, which is its weakness. Then he is transported by plane to the frozen Arctic waste and thrown there. But it's just frozen, not dead ... This movie has a typical setting for its period: adolescents and a small town. The blob has a good rock-and-roll melody at first and the film is atmospheric throughout. Continue, Beware! Blob followed in 1972 and a remake came in 1988, but this is the best film in The Blob. The speech is led by Steve McQueen (The Great Escape) and is the movie that made him a star and Aneta Corsaut plays his girlfriend. I'm not familiar with any of the other stars. The blob is something you should see for all SF fans. Fantastic. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 stars out of 5.
