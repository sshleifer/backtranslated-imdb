Caution: Contains a spoiler. Corvine and in many cases terrible action. Fontaine is great, but some others, especially Richard Ney, Ivy's husband, are extremely woody. Ney is in bed, dying of poisoning with arsenic, with every hair in his place. Still the film is so juicy and so suspenseful. More faithful to the book than most films in his era. Casting Joan Fontaine as poisonous (and an adultery that was just as shocking at that time - not kidding, kids) was a stroke. She's just used to Joan Fontainey. Just as the murderers had to do, she dies "falling down the floor in an empty space".
