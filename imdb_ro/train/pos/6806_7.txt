Ernst Marischka, one of the most respected Austrian directors ever since, has made films full of beautiful scenes, delicate love and respect for everything that is precious in life. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, if people should hear about it, they associate the name Marischka with the SISSI trilogy (1955,1956,1957). However, he has made other excellent films, such as DAS DREIMADERLHAUS (1958), EMBEZZLED HEAVEN (1958) and certainly MADCHENJAHRE EINER KONIGIN, presenting the young years of Queen Victoria. Although dealing with a slightly different theme from SISSI films, I do not see many differences between this film and SISSI. They are strikingly similar. The film is almost identical. Style, music, photography. In fact, the crew is almost the same. Anton Profes, Bruno Mondi! The distribution ... Romy Schneider is one of the first major roles. It was a wonderful presentation of his role as Sissi, because this film was made one year before the first part of the trilogy about the Austrian Empress. It is also a film where Romy plays with her mother, Magda Schneider. But Ernst Marischka was not the first director to put Romy to play with her mother. The debut of Romy, WENN DER WEISSE FLIEDER WIEDER BLUHN (1953), was also her performance with her mother. Therefore, there were some voices on which Romy began her Austrian career on the basis of her mother's fame. Indeed, there is a truth in it. Again, as in SISSI, this movie shows love very easily. Victoria meets Prince Albert in a small inn in Dover. Their sympathy is based on pure exaltation in dance and gentle smile. And now...? What would he have shown? Only sex ... But is the only thing on which love is based? I am grateful to Ernst Marischka for these films. They had a soul and a message. Some people can call them kitschy, but I will never give up on the admiring of these movies. They are IMPRESSIVE! UNFORTED, HIGHLY SUPPORTED!
