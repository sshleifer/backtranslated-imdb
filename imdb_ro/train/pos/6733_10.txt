There have been a number of recent surfing movies that seem to happen to meet with no prior warning. I caught this treasure on digital cable this week and what a pleasant surprise it was! Emphasis is placed on the 60's big surf pioneers, Greg Noll, to our current Laird Hamilton, from Waimea Bay to Mavericks to Jaws. Hell, I could watch a movie about Laird Hamilton - one of the best athletes of this generation - so the rest is just the sauce. There is a lot of surfing well mixed with interviews of the past and present surfing stars, pleasantly, relaxed and unpretentious. Of all the surf movies I've seen, this tells the story of the best wave, and I think it's my favorite. Enjoy!
