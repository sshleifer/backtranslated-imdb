This movie is the reason I found this site. We could not find this movie elsewhere! I'm glad we found her here! I saw her on TV before and I desperately wanted to find her and buy and have more friends interested in buying it. Another poster commented that it is boring, though I must say it is not. Especially if you are a horse, you will love this movie. Horses are wonderful, well trained and the movie is well done. We will definitely buy it for our DVD home library. We will recommend it to our friends. The connection between man and horse in this movie was so inspiring and made you want to spend more time with your horses. This is definitely a movie that we will track several times.
