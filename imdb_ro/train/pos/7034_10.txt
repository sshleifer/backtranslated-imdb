when you add all the aspects of the movie - dance, singing, acting - the only one to be remembered as the best in the cast is Vanessa Williams ... her dedication, energy and timeless beauty make Rosie a perfect role for her. I have never seen anyone who would show Rose with such vibration! Vanessa's singing talent looks beautiful with all the songs she interprets as Rose and her acting skills never cease to amaze me! Her dance is so incredible, even if some say the choreography was bad - the dance skills were displayed better than ever! I would recommend this version during the '63 just because I found that although Vanessa's long acting is superb ----- not to mention that Jason Alexander and the rest of the play are very impressive (except for at Chynna Philips ... what the hell they were thinking when they threw it?) Altogether, I would say that this version is great and I recommend that everyone see this version!
