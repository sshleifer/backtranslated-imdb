Atlantis: The Lost Empire has some of the best, smoothest animations and cleverly written dialogue of any Disney movie we've seen. And I was convinced of it in the first 15 minutes. I love him more on Don Novello's vocal on Vincenzo Santorini and on Phil Morris as Joshua Strongbear Sweet. It's a shame that the whole movie seems to be moving at about double the rhythm that would be right - at least in the first act. An important aspect of any Disney film is a satisfactory antagonist - which Atlantis does not offer. It's the best on average. There is a mediocre turn at the middle of the movie. That's all. It's a great movie, though. Everyone should check it out.
