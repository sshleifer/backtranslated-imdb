This is one of the biggest baby-pet movies ever created. I cry every time I see the shadow crying, "Wait, wait for Peter!" because the family car is withdrawing. This is to see if you love the animals! Best movie of all time! The lines in the movie are sometimes stupid. Like Sassy tells Chance; "Cat's rules and dogs bloody!" The lines like that I could do without, but when I was six, I bet I loved that line. The story may seem crazy to some, but I like it. Shadow like the older dog that prepares the chance to take it when it disappears really moves when you think about it. He reminded me of my childhood childhood. I think everyone can find a piece on their own in "Bonded Homeward".
