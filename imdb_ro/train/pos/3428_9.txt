I saw the movie tonight in New York at the Sunshine Landmark. I did not know what to expect, I did not read too much about it, as I knew I would see no matter what. Everything in All is very well done. It does not focus on generalizing "anti-war" statements, which, for me, left politics outside of it. The soldiers spoke mainly of the degree of awareness of the toxicity in their training in the boot camp and how hard it was when they returned to civilian life. It was very good to see Paul Rieckhoff and Camilo Mejia about the difficulty of surviving not only the war, but refused the command to return when it was against personal morality. Do not make a mistake - it's not an anti-war movie. Whoever says it is, has not seen it or lives with the scars of war on their souls.
