This highly underestimated movie is (for me) what good writing in a movie should be all about. Kasdan looks for meaning in our lives and puts everyone to see and ask. The film refers to the divisions that people create to isolate themselves from the violence, hatred and fanaticism of everyday life. <br /> <br /> Along the way, we are asked a question about life. Davis (Steve Martin with a big beard) asks: "Does my violent film (and, by extension, joy) cause violence in society?" Claire asks, "What kind of world throws something as precious as a human life?" Mack is not immutable as he asks, "Is it possible to go beyond the boundaries of the race and (even the harder step) of funding? Of course, they are not quoted in the film but general, others ask questions and are honest but it is the nature of life We strive our whole life to find answers to questions that we will never respond to in all, and in some cases we have to respond to our own needs and desires. we are able to answer questions that we can not answer. Some answers are real Claire and Mack realizes that although they could go easy and let the child take the baby, they did not answer, Davis "sees the Light" and decides not to do violent movies, but the next day he returns and rejects his epiphany as being subordinate to his art, all the movies looking for answers, this film does not answer them, but simply has you remember that you have to look for the answers. <br /> <br />
