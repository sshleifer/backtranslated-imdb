Good night, Mr. Tom is so beautiful and beautiful. He is not completely faithful to the book, but must he be? Not at all. John Thaw is fascinating as Tom Oakley. His transformation from gruff to care was so well done, making it more credible than Scrooge in Christmas Carol. After inspector Morse, this is Thaw's best hour. He was seriously associated with a young Nick Robinson, who presented a totally convincing portrayal of an evacuated traumatized by the abusive relationship with his mother. The script and the music made it worth buying and you also see the thaw playing the organ. Amazing! The most exciting scene was that Willie found out about Zak's death and then about Tom, telling him about his deceased family who died of scarlet fever. Buy this, you will like it! 10/10 Bethany Cox
