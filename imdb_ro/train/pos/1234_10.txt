I grew up watching this movie and still love it as much today as when I was a child. Do not listen to critic reviews. They're not accurate on this movie. Eddie Murphy really shines in his role. You can sit together with the whole family and everyone to enjoy it. We recommend this movie to everyone. It's a comedy with a feeling of fantasy. With demons, dragons and a small bald kid with similar powers to God. This film takes you from LA to Tibet, in the amazing view of the wonderful temples of the Tibetan mountains. a beautiful view! So go get yourself a favor and snatch it off! You will not regret it!
