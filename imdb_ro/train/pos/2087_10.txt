This movie was released in the year I was born and will be, like me, 70 in 2007. I saw it again last night after I did not see it from high school. While it was full of the feeling of 30 years, and the act was a bit stereotypical, however, it was superb. The story of Pearl S. Buck lived through the magic of Luise Rainer and Paul Muni's chemistry. The novel that won Mrs. Buck The Nobel Prize for Literature is back under Sydney Franklin's wand, which along with an excellent screenplay tells about peasant farmer Wang Lung, whose father gets a bride for him, a little girl in the kitchen a local owner. In Buck's story, Wang's success is subsumed by his desire to listen to his wife, most of the times, and to the love of the country. Eventually, he realizes that his wife, like the earth, is the source of his wealth, happiness and immortality. Buck's stories were always strong women cast in a critical spot to influence the outcome of events in the prefeminist world. Luise Rainer, born in Germany, brings a tentative but determined life of the Chinese Peasant Chinese into portraying Olan. Muni also captures the naive but honorable Wang, eventually caught between the two rich and peasant worlds. Other classic characters include Charlie Grapewin, Henry's Uncle of Dorothy Gale, Wizard of Oz, Walter Connelly, as a mystery, convincing uncle and Keye Luke as Son Number One - but this time not Charlie Chan. > A classic could be defined as a movie you can watch countless times and never get tired of. If this really is the case, this movie is a classic, no doubt at all.
