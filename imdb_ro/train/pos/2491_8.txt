Budget cuts, time restrictions, scenario shooting and then cutting, cutting, cutting ... This crew is a group of good young directors; thinker in this scenario - yes, allegorically - intelligent in zero-dollar effects when time and knowledge are everything you have, relying on actors and friends and other good people for time, devotion, locations; and get a first feature in the box, 1 in 1000. These guys make movies. Good. Check out their Heartland Horrors shorts collection and see development. And I can guarantee that working with them is the most fun thing you'll do in business. I'm terrified of harsh criticism, insulting to this film, wondering if a commentator even heard a dialogue word, he thought of a thought or a concept, or if all that he wanted from this work was the visual boreholes of the bashing and blow to satisfy some mindless ones, what horror should it mean for an audience. Let "Empty Acre" bring you to you. Do not anticipate what you expect it should be just because it's set in the horror / thriller because of its supernatural premise. It's a depth drama beyond how much you can hold a blade in someone with respect for a message that does not affect the visual center of the brain but rather relies on the empathetic imagination of the person to experience the suffering of the mind and spirit of others. Mark Ridgway, Curtis, "The Empty Acre"
