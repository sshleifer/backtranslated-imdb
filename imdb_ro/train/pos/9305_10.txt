This is a superb work that is not related to anything before or after. Brat Pack crooning and club exclusivity are not my biscuits of choice, but in this world without law they make an appealing ambience. The film is packed with our boys, distinctive actors who add a distinction to this work with winning performances. Dialogue is a joy. In fact, it's a new vernacular. One of the few movies that can be watched repeatedly with a deep appreciation. Strengths include Billy Idol's British playfulness, Ben London's brassware, Kyle's squirmishness, and ad-hoc philosophy research.
