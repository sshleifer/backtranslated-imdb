Together with Darkwing Duck this is unfairly canceled. Disney has been in decline from Tarzan and we need a show like this to get Disney back on track. Ed Gilbert and Jim Cummings were perfect for the voices of Louis and Baloo (sound familiar) The tone of the tone is also appealing. Of all the bastards, who are great on their own merits, Tony Jay stands out as Shere Kahn. Louis and Baloo sound, in fact, very similar to the voices in the Jungle Book, which is not a bad thing at all. In fact, he is quite inspired! The animation was on the scene, and the script had a lot of wisdom that has been severely deprived of animations for years. PLEASE HERE! 9/10. Bethany Cox
