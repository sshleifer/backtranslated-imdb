one of the best low-budget films in Germany! is this is the dark side of the new age? if you believe in esoteric, please do not watch this movie! you throw away all the positive fantasies. this film shows that beyond the peaceful fa√ßade of spiritual spiritual pursuit lies a world of extreme crime and terror. Hope there will be a 35 mm copy soon! Andreas Marschall's first film is just the beginning of a new area, making movies with a few euros! I'm waiting for the second hit!
