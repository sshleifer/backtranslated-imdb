MacArthur is a wonderful movie with a wonderful story about a great man, General Douglas MacArthur. This is, of course, the story of one of America's great military figures and a figure I made from the very first moments of my memory. Although there is a problem of continuity (there may be others), MacArthur's portrayal of the film as a 1962 US Military Academy admission to the Thayer Prize did not contain the phrase "the old soldiers never die, but only fade." (That was in his speech at Congress after his dismissal by President Truman) in 1951 for his alleged insubordination (these two did not see the eyes!) Gregory Peck is im-Peck capable as the general who promised to return to the Philippines in the Second World War. The film moves quickly and easily with the general, his family and his staff from the beginning of the Second World War to the end of his career. This film would have a much greater significance for a familiar man both with the Second World War and with the Korean War. However, the portrait of Peck of this great man who fought the twin evil of fascism and communism and who hates the war as only a soldier can indeed be a memorable one. "In war there is no substitute for victory."
