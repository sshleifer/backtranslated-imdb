I played this movie on TV and I could not stop it. Peter Sellers plays a man that can not be found, falling for a very hot and cute Goldie Hawn (who does?). The way Goldie's character lies from the beginning of the movie to the end is unconventional even today. This movie gave me a different angle in human relationships and it also seemed very funny to me. Peter Sellers' role was a difficult sale, but I think he's doing well.
