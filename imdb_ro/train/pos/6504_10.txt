My wife and I watched the whole series at least three times. I can not imagine how it could be better. This is not the "complete" history of the Second World War, no library can hold such a history, it is the best summary of this history. A lot of details, lots of personal stories and preserves the overall picture. Olivier's misconduct is excellent and, of course, alive. Interviews are on all sides, except for the Russians, because producers were not allowed to speak with many Russians. It's great to have this full DVD program. We gathered our copy. Manufacturers are doing an excellent job of providing pictures and actions in which virtually none exists in any archive: There are almost no convoy and submarine films, for example, but the episode on this topic is still very well done.
