When I first saw the movie, I was with my dad. He encouraged me to watch this movie because he was one of his favorites. After watching the movie, it instantly became one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> A river is running through it It's about two brothers who each have another way in life. Norman Maclean (Craig Sheffer) is the oldest of the two brothers and is set on the path of education. Paul Maclean (Brad Pitt) is the younger, rebellious brother who travels on a path full of obstacles. The movie follows these characters, each following their path. <br /> <br /> There is no disadvantage for this movie. You will be entertained all the way. The actor, director and script are perfect. The two things that are exceptional are cinema and score. Both of you who are catching Robert Redford in the world create for you. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie around, which is intended to be a classic. It's safe in my book. If you have not seen this movie, watch it as fast as you can because it will stay with you forever.
