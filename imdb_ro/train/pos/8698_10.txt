He saw this movie at its launch and cherished it since then. What a great group of actors (I always find one of the most interesting aspects of a movie). She was genuinely glad to see dramatic actress Jacqueline Bisset in this role, and Wallace Shawn is always a pussy. The script is intelligent, full of charm and tongue in front, fun to almost everything "Beverley Hills". He loved "the doctor" of Paul Bartel and Ray Sharkey's servant. This was shit and raw, but thank God! Unless you are a prank, I recommend this movie. FYI for anyone who likes to play six degrees by Kevin Bacon, Mary Woronov and Paul Bartel were in the Rock & Roll High School. Mary Woronov and Robert Beltran were together in "Night of the Comet". There were all three in "Eating Raoul".
