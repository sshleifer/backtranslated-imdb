This is a complex document that shows many things about the early life of homosexuals. To put it in perspective, when Gay was the word used for the homosexual revolution and not just Gay as a descriptor. Or is it still used in this way today? I think most of the film comes from around 1968 to 1989. It was released in 1993, so it was around. I have been touched by documentary capturing a man's love for another over 20 strange years. A love expressed in ways that can only be true love. There are many scenes of incredible empathy and pain, along with joy and pleasure scenes. There are life scenes like homosexuality and life as a homosexual. The movie itself was a love work and I think it's a diamond. At least one will come out of this film an understanding of the devastating impact of AIDS. As I write this, I think how much I thought the movie was set earlier. The advances in medical, political, social and cultural sciences that have taken place since this film was established (15 years ago) are amazing. However, obviously, in the case of AIDS itself, we have not yet finished. Heck I think we're not made on all fronts. Anyway, it's just a pretty darn good documentary. I would encourage anyone who feels I do not quite understand homosexual life, gay stuff or AIDS devastation to watch this movie.
