If you enjoy John Candy's subtle actions and reactions, you can only help this movie (pronounced "fillum" by Salvatore DiPasquale). The unseen (and uninformed) observer has always seen Candy as a broad actor - a big buff. And sometimes it was (see "Stripes" and "Splash"). But when he was given the opportunity, he could be really sharp and subtle. It's too bad he was thrown in so many roles that he only showed his wide side, because we will never get to see each other. Oh, yes, the movie. You can watch "Going Berserk" always and quickly (I know I have) with the frequency "Caddyshack". It's so good. The plot, though a bit confused, is deep enough for a hoax of this kind. She allows Candy and Joe Flaherty and Eugene Levy to figure out Candy ... and they are jumping HARD. Definitely worth a look for anyone who enjoyed SCTV or other Candy's work.
