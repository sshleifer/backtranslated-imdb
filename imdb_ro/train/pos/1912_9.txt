I will keep it short and short, people who have written story lines for this show are brilliant, actors are just perfect for the roles they play (CJ's character is legendary) and they have so much chemistry on the screen that does what what is a very successful comedy. When I saw the first time I saw the new episodes that probably returned for more than 6/7 months, I wondered what happened to Paul. I was swallowed up to find out he died when I sailed on Google. He was so funny and he played his character to perfection, a too protective father who likes to keep his daughters out of the spotlight and away from the boys. I think the comedy has gone from power to power, even without Paul in it. Plus, I think most people would enjoy this by forgetting it.
