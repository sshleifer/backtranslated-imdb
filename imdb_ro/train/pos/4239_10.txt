My observations: Post-war love. Tom Drake and my grandfather in Meet Me in St. Louis two years later (the year I was born). Donna Reed charming and cute. Margaret Hamilton good as always; smaller than in the "Wizard of Oz". Spring Byington more beautiful, too, with preconditioned little nose perky lacking Hamilton. The tent scene at the end with the old boy next door was hilarious. As a two-year veteran of the army tents, he seemed quite young and inexperienced when I looked into my eyes. I worked in a universal shop and was as elegant as this one. Unfortunately, he disappeared and disappeared into obscurity. We were famous for those show windows that were used to attract shoppers to make them buy all those wonderful goods. <br /> <br />
