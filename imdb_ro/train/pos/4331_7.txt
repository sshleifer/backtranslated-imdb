Killing in Mesopotamia, I have always considered one of Poirot's best books because it is very creepy and has an ingenious purpose. There is no doubt that TV adaptation is visually striking, with a great photo and a very attractive music score. As always, David Suchet is impeccable as Hercule Poirot, the comic tip of the episode being Poirot's fight with a mosquito in the middle of the night, and Hugh Fraser is good as Captain Hastings quite naive. The rest of the cast tower in decent performance, but be careful not to shade the two heads, a danger in some Christie adaptations. Some of the episodes were pretty scary, a juxtaposition of such a tragic episode as Five Little Pigs, an episode I liked a lot more than that. What made it creepy in particular, leaving aside music, was when Louise Leidner saw the ghostly face through the window. About adaptation, she was pretty faithful to the book, but I will say there were three things I did not like. The main problem was the stimulation, it is quite slow and there are some scenes in which very little happens. I did not like the fact that they made Joseph Mercado a killer. In the book, I see him as a rather nervous character, but the intervention of the idea of ​​making him a killer and underdevelopment made him a less attractive character, though I'm glad he did not lose his drug addiction . (I also noticed that the writers have remarked that Mrs. Mercado in the book falls into hysterics when she thinks she is the next victim of the murderer.) Another thing that was not so impressive was that I felt it would have been more if the adaptation was from the point of view of Amy Leatheran, as it was in his book, Amy seemed somewhat less sensitive in adaptation. On the whole, despite some mistaken judgments on behalf of the writers, I liked the crime in Mesopotamia. 7/10 Bethany Cox.
