Full House came to me when I was 9 years old. I remember seeing the resumption of America's most amusing areas with Bob Saget and one day my mother told me she was also in a show called Full House. One day, I was lucky enough to catch an episode during my family visit. It did not seem too interesting at first, but as I look more and more, at night at 9 o'clock, I would have been so great in that. This show makes you want to be there, go out with the girls, go to places with them and maybe even join you in their "sing-alongs" family. The thing I like most about at Full House is that it's a great show for kids and adults of all ages. There will be parts that are more for adults, then parts that are intended for the children so that the whole family can enjoy it. No matter how much cheese it can be, it's still a great show, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. <br /> <br />
