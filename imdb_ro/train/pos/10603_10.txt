I'm tired of the fact that my 4 and 5 year old daughters are constantly subject to Nickelodeon, Disney, and others. Everything seems to be the same old tired old cartoon revived again and again. When my daughters could not go to the afternoon because one of them was sick, I wanted to relax and rest for a while. I turned the TV over and looking for something different, we overturned the channels. My finger stopped my channel by the time I heard Harvey's voice. I adore every single solitary thing that this man did, and when I saw he was doing a voice work for a little duck ... I could not change the channel! My daughters were instantly fascinated by cartoons and the more I watched the show TOGETHER, the more I grew to love him, along with the message that was portrayed. He is not necessarily a supporter of "gay rights", but rather for anyone who has ever been ostracized as a child for NEVER. We had friends who were selected for one thing or another ... too fat, too thin, too feminine, being a bully, not being smart enough, with only one parent ... you call it! Children, as a rule, can be very cruel to each other, so I was happy to see a cartoon that would send a LIFE message to its audience. My girls already accept others as they are and they do not take others to be different. My older daughter is actually up for her friends if they're selected (you happen to have only one mother and that little girl is chosen quite often - it warms my heart when Kassie gets up for her!). So <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Those of you who condemn this show because you feel you are a lawyer for 'gay rights' or you have to 'accept certain points of view' you have clearly and completely lost the point in this cartoon. If you need that, you've explained ... well, you need more help than any television you could ever offer.
