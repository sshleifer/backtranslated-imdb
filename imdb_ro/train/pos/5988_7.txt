This movie in 1939 tried to make a better use of Michael Curtiz's "Angels with Dirty Faces" movie. Under Ray Enright's direction, the only interesting thing is how these kids were embarrassed compared to what's happening to the young people in today's central American cities. The film is worth seeing only due to the presence of Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan, who showed that they were well joined together. Dead End kids have bigger parts, as the plot focuses on them, rather than on older people. It is somewhat curious how burning was used in the same way some scrupulous owners did in New York right here in New York. It was the fastest way to turn a property around never taking into account the social issues it has created. In today's climate with so many guns around a new reality. The young children of the story seemed simply pranksters, rather than criminals. How the times change!
