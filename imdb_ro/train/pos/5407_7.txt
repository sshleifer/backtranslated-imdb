I've always enjoyed Pokemon movies. Yes, I know, they are all very hardworking, mediocre in certain areas, and certainly, even if they are intended for young children, they are too adult in some areas to be able to guard them with the statement "Hey, it's lit up, it's a movie for kids "but what is apart is not yet good entertainment? In my opinion, I am so and I am very happy with them. This is as pleasant as the third, and certainly dearest. It has some very sweet and moving moments, because it's the introduction of Pokemon Celebi, love and fresh. It's not the best Pok√©mon movie, but I like more than the third installment, even if the third is not bad, and the whole series is fun, harmless, family fun and should not be considered anything more , nothing less. This movie has some great signs of intensity and interest, especially around the climax / final, like all the installments and characters, while a little less than the last three, I thought, are still nice and humorous. These films are the least rated and the most criticized of the four adaptations of the characteristic length and do not deserve it.
