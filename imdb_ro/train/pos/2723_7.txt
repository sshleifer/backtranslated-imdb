In cold blood is directed and adapted by Richard Brooks. However, it is so inclined to be realistic, sometimes it is more clinical than fun. Recognizing the brutal murder of a Midwest family, author Truman Capote focused on the minutiae, wrapping himself and the reader in the subjects AND SUBJECTS! Brooks moves away from this approach in favor of something closer to the docudrama. While filming in real places, they keep their distance. The killers are portrayed as depraved imbeciles, which certainly were. They are not seen as misunderstood souls (as in the Capote book), and the wilderness of their act is terribly blunt. Scott Wilson and Robert Blake are excellent as criminals as well as those who have played the role, including John Forsythe and Paul Stewart as reporter (Capote's character). The landmark photo is taken by the great Conrad Hall.
