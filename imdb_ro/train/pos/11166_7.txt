George Raft, in the role of Steve Brodie, the dance player who can never refuse a bold, is confronted by Chuck Connors (Wallace Beery) with a sentimental. A soft touch for every man, Connors adopts impulsive chances and vagabonds, "Swipes" (Jackie Cooper, complete with kitten!) And Lucy Calhoun homeless, an innocent outside town with ambitions to become a writer. <br /> <br /> In this male-dominated culture, communication mostly takes the form of violence (seeing why THE BOWERY is a favorite of Martin Scorsese). Extrusion of the cigars provides a run-in gang. "Swipes" enjoys stoning through the windows of Chinatown, on one occasion putting a laundry. (The simultaneous arrival of Brodie and Beery firefighters lead to a warfare, during which the building burns to the ground.) Beery is an annoying girl and beats someone who does not agree with him, including Brodie, who defeats a fist at night on a loose barge to regain control of the salon, lost on a bet that Brodie would not have the courage to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge. (Brodie does the jump, but only because a subterfuge with a dummy fails at the last moment.) As usual, Walsh fills the dial with details, gladly illustrating the daily life of the lamp; weigh waiters, assaulted bartenders, curses from the Suicide Hall being harassed in Maria Black, tailors who gather unfortunate clashes on the street and forcing them to buy costumes they do not want. A small but admirable movie.
