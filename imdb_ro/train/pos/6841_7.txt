This is probably one of Brian De Palma's most famous films, but it's not the best. The double body, The Fury and Carrie are better movies, but this movie is better than Blow Out and Obsession. De Palma is highly influenced by Hitchcock and this movie is a take-off on Psycho. Angie Dickinson is a bored housewife who is thinking of having an affair, and after her psychiatrist, played by Michael Caine, makes an offer, Dickinson meets a man in an art gallery and ends up sleeping with him. After this point, it's best not to know what's going on, but there's a crime, and Nancy Allen is a girl who's looking at the killer. Dennis Franz is the detective who does not trust Allen and has to find the killer. It's a pretty good movie, but it's not one of the best in De Palma.
