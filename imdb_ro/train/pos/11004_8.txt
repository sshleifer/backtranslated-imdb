In the near future, the usual man over any suspect in Morgan Sullivan's suburb (Jeremy Northam) is hired by Digicorp, a huge corporation, to be assigned as a spy and stealing secrets from their Sunways competitors. Throughout his training, Morgan is brainwashed, assumes a new identity of Jack Thursby and travels to boring lectures. In one of them, he is approached by the beautiful and mysterious Rita Foster (Lucy Liu) who advises him that nothing seems right. Morgan recognizes a new reality where he does not know who can be trusted. The well-known "Cypher" was a great surprise to me. This movie was not released in Brazil, but the interesting and interesting story is quite complex, with lots of plotting points and scenario, direction and extraordinary performance. In the last turn, I remembered Arnold Schwarzenegger's "Total Recall". This movie definitely deserves to be watched several times and I really did not like the last scene when the independent spy disputes the disc in question. You know only director Vicenzo Natali from the fantastic "Cube," and this second work I see is also amazing. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
