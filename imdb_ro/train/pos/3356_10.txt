Ettore Scola is one of the most important Italian directors. Parents and I watched together "C'eravamo tanto amati" on a summer night: we liked but did not like the way we liked "A Special Day." I think Ettore Scola is quite underrated: we often forget to remember him, maybe because his latest films were disappointing. And so, yesterday evening, my mom and I are sitting on our couch to enjoy this masterpiece. Writing, direction, cinema, score and production design were transient and accurate, but the thing I liked most was the chemistry between Loren and Mastroianni. They are both excellent actors and the roles of Antonietta and Gabriele. Antonietta is a housewife: married to a fanatical fascist, she has six children, but her husband wants to have another child to get a prize for immense families. Gabriele is simply an anti-fascist. They spend together a special day, that special day of 1938, when Hitler came to Rome to visit Mussolini. I do not want to ruin my story anymore: look for this movie!
