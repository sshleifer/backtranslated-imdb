The people who produced this master film served well a novel that is probably the best fiction work focused on human guilt and human responsibility ever published. Nolte assumes the role of Howard W. Campbell, Jr., and makes it his own, and remains valid for Vonnegut's description of a man who has lost ALL (for and) love. There are no weaknesses in this fine of adaptation.
