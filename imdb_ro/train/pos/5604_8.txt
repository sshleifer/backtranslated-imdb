If you liked Roman Polanski's "repulsion", you probably should check out the "tenant," because it's a similar concept, only with Polanski entering and playing the wacko schizophrenic role. This is, in fact, one of my favorites in his films - secondly, after "Rosemary's Child", of course - and it is a direct journey into the mental collapse of a man moving into the former apartment of a suicide victim. The other inhabitants of the building are all subtle and dominated to keep the level of noise down - even the smallest "titrant" becomes a big deal, and Polanski, who plays, is becoming more and more paranoid and yields to his hallucinations more and more much as the movie on. She gets to the point where she dresses and behaves like the former tenant, and you realize it's just a matter of time before he decides to re-enact his fatal leap out of the window ... The movie is a bit slow and dauddling for while, but if you've ever seen a Roman Polanski movie, you should know that it will end with a bang and this blow does not disappoint. It's also better if you do not question the complexity of the premise and just take it as a descent into madness, because it's pretty surreal sometimes trippy. Polanski is very good as the shy, disturbed resident, who, in a way, draws Isabelle Adjani, ever illustrated. We also see him run around, which is disturbing and hilarious all the time! Damn it makes a nasty chicken! So Polanski fans - who may be looking at their past from the thirty-year-old pedophiles - should enjoy the "tenant" as a fun psychological journey ...
