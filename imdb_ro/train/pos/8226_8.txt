We are talking about a low-budget film, and it is understandable that there are a few weaknesses (no spoilers: a sudden explosive expert and a senseless alcoholic); but in general the story interests you, most characters are nice and there are some original situations. <br /> <br /> I love movies that surprise you with some people you do not want to believe and then twist and turn your plot ... Applaud this about it. <br /> <br /> If you know what I mean, try to see also "Nueve Reinas" (Nine Queens) a movie from Argentina.
