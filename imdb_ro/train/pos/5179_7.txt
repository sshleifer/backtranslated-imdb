Indian Summer is a hot, multi-character film that would make an afternoon movie (with a little editing). The film begins in the past, with a group of children showing a loose posture that sets the perfect tone before cutting it out when a group of adults in the "golden age" of the camp is again invited to spend a few weeks of holiday to the head of the camp, Uncle Lou. The film then allows the spectator to spend time with these characters while remembering their time at the camp and creating new memories in their last stay. The movie manages in a wonderful way that brings its characters in this wonderful setting and allows them to grow without having to worry about the evolution of the plans. Watching these people remembers, and the relationships between them are what the film is about and why it works so well. Never go over top and melodramatic, always keeping warmth, charm and realism. I have never seen a movie in which nostalgia is attracted so well and I woke up I was never in one of these camps like me. For a warm, nostalgic film, I honestly recommend.
