After reading many of the other reviews for this IMDb movie, there seems to be a consensus among the purest that this film is nothing like the books on which it is based. At this point I can not comment, without ever reading any of the protagonists of the adventures. However, what I can say with certainty is that it seems to me that many of the mentioned commentators must have gone through a sense of humor bypass; Let's be honest here - this movie is just so fun! OK ... .. so I have to admit the point where the apparent film is not representative of the character / s, but do you see that a clear perspective? .. do the same people who cling to this movie also suspects that the classic series of the 1960s Batman does not remain faithful to the original comic book DC? Or maybe there is still anxiety in the same people as the version of 1980's Flash Gordon movie was too much of a departure from the original series? The point is, yes this movie is incredible camp, but that's just charm! <br /> <br /> Former Tarzan, Ron Ely plays a eponymous hero in this movie (and has more than a tremendous resemblance to Gary Busey for boot!) and is supported by a large cast that supports all having a ball with their respective roles. Also look for a very short, but very welcome appearance of Michael Berryman's favorite horror movie. Best scene? Too many to choose but check the hilarious facial expressions adopted by the waiter when Savage and his men commit the final step of ordering coke, lemonade and milk on an official occasion! Also, the scene is often noted near the end of the movie, where Savage approaches Captain Seas' anthem using various martial arts disciplines that are labeled on screen! ?? Useless! <br /> <br /> Simply, the movie does not take it seriously and it is all the more fun for it. Pleasant fun from start to finish! (and you will play the theatrical song adapted to John Phillip Sousa the next few days guaranteed!)
