My girlfriend Super X is a hell of a roller coaster ride. The special effects were excellent, and the costumes that Uma Thurman wore were hubba buba. Uma Thurman is an undervalued comedian actress, but she has proven that everyone is wrong and is acting as a crazy girlfriend. It was simply fabulous! Luke Wilson was also good as the average Joe, but he was a brave man who worked with one of the greatest actresses of all time. The supporting film was also superb, especially Anna Faris, which was extremely good (much better than the Scary Movie franchise). Ivan Rietman did very well to direct this film because if it was not for him and Uma Thurman this movie would not have done so well. This movie is clearly a recording on 10/10 (Uma Thurman), it's director, it's scenario and from the original plot line. This movie is highly recommended.
