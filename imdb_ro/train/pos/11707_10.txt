I remember seeing this movie a long time ago, even when it did not have any special effects, the actor was very good. And it still has the same message for today, even if technology has changed, perhaps it should make the remake of this movie, it would be interesting to see a remake. I also enjoyed the music in the movie, Larry Norman was a very good composer at that time, though now most of Christian music is now cult and praise music. Have I always been curious to know what happened to Patty after the series ended? Has he continued to make more movies, married and gathered a family? I would like to have an update.
