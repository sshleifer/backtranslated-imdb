Like a long-standing Barbra fan, any post like this will be biased. Besides, this movie is classed as a classic. It has flaws (highlighted in other posts), but it gives a look of a time (late 70's) that will not be there again, and it is fascinating to watch the show unfold. Streisand struggled hard to make this movie. I do not think she's ever been happy. But it gives the fans a new Barbra (for time) with LIVE singing, a fresh look of young people and a very powerful action. The story is tough but exciting and keeps your interest all the time. The "end" of an expanded framework is hard for most non-Barbra fans to come forward but speaks to the volumes of those who admire their talent. <br /> <br />
