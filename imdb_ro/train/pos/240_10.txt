Fantastic film. One to excite all 5 senses. It is not a true historical report and not all information has to be taken as factual information. Hollywood's real conferences, such as a list of heroes like Naomi Watts (Julia Cook's lover - Ned Kelly), Heath Ledger (Ned) and Orlando Bloom (Joe Byrne) and unattractive actors excited by Geoffrey Rush) plays the victorious, drunk and corrupt police force. This also inspires a very insecure love story in the mix between Ned (Ledger) and Julia Cook (Watts) to attract all romantics, the females being especially from the first scene, when Ned saves the drowning drowning young man and his father calls him "sunshine" and has a "glow in his eyes when he looks at me with his hand on his shoulder" is very romantic and convincing viewers to accompany Ned Kelly, the subordinate. In addition, not all Austin people love a madman?
