I fell in love with Emily Watson in Breaking the Waves, then I became more fascinated by her lineup and the truth about Hilary and Jackie. Now this amazing portrayal of a rich girl that frightens the reproduction and convention in favor of the mother of the tortured soul of the child of a man who obviously needs her mother appears. Her eyes are the mirror of her soul - and my eyes are gentle and beautiful. Those who take things literally will find Marleen Gorris' poetic and allegorical direction quite frustrating. Romanticism that is willing to go with amazing kinetic energy is that this allegorical poetry will be well rewarded.
