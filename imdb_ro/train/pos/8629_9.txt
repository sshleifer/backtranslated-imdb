I read a small announcement in a horror magazine from the early 90's about Liebe des Totes (love of the dead) or something similar. This, of course, awakened my curiosity, so I ordered Nekromantik 1 & 2 and Der Todesking (The Death King). Nekromantik's films are good, even a kind of interesting and unique in their approach to the subject Necrophilia (even if they are obviously entrances of works of horror, not meant to invoke fear in the minds of the spectators, they are actually quite funny. ) </ B> <br /> TODESKING, on the other hand, is, in my opinion, one of the best movies ever made. It is made up of a series of scenes showing many facets of death. Death as an enemy; Death as a Liberator, Death as Physical Decomposition of the Body. The film is a metaphor of life. It shows how fragile life is and how short our lives are. It reduces viewers to the children they (our) are. The fact that we can not truly understand the nature of death, and thus the process of dying, is the central message of the film. This is the most realistic movie. But Buttgereit never attempts to hide death behind white roses or anything else. Regardless of the moral standards you have set, death is ineffective and, sooner or later, it will not be a fiction but the reality of YOU. This is for you, dear reader, as well as for the film's viewers. Some minors do not seem to understand this, which is entirely excused, because, of course, they will live forever ... This is not a exploitative film. Why? Because death does not exploit people. It harvests us. We grow up for seven days, and then we are brought back to the Skeleton predestination state, that is, death. Buttgereit gives us his version of the oldest stories. Whether you choose to consider it "optimistic" or "pessimistic" depends on you. At first glance it may seem very dark. Keep in mind that for something to live, something else has to die. "Who wants to live forever?" I think that when Buttgereit shows a body that is consumed by worms, it shows not only the decomposition but also the generation of a new life. Is it better not to die and give life to the worms and then to the birds and eventually to become the soil than to remain a dead dead zombie, which is one of the favorite animals of the genre? When you realize, you see Der Todesking in his right context. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Seven are the days of the week (weak, mortal!) Seven times in the last hour. Do not be afraid of the reaper, says Buttgereit, because Reaper takes only what is baking. And apples that are not torn for food will rot! <br /> <br /> Have a good life, colleagues IMDB'ers! (And watch this film, which compares only with Ingemar Bergmans "Seventh Seal" in terms of depth and universality)
