Anyone who does not think that Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey are one of the biggest movies of all time needs to check their head. In this way she managed to be both ingenious and unhealthy, but terribly familiar and intelligent at the same time. One of those rare movies that improves his predecessor, Bogus Journey, can be enjoyed again and again. Important points include the duel with death and the end, which is very "emotional". Keanu wants to forget everything that's terrible of the Matrix and get off to do what she does best, Ted Theodore Logan in Bill and Ted: The Return.
