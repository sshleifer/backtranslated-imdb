What another commentator called the lack of character development, I call underestimation. The film did not bother with an exaggerated explanation or useless history. Yes, there were many untold stories I just saw, but it was primarily a one-day snapshot in an event that catalysed change in the life of all the characters. Henry Thomas's performance was a great study of the power to act, focusing on reaction rather than on action. Good rentals.
