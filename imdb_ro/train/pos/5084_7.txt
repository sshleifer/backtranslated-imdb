I was surprised that "Secret Anger" was a nice good movie ... Probably because I had no expectations for this movie ... Although the movie has plot holes ..... I would say you could not guess who was behind the whole scheme until the end of the movie ... At first, I thought Robert Ryan, using the same method as "Gaslight," where her husband tries to run his crazy wife, but I was wrong ... The main issue with the movie is that I'm heading in another direction that has not given a clue at first. ..... I thought, Robert Ryan & Claudette Colbert wore their songs well ...... Plus Vivian Vance, a fine character actress who steals scenes in this ...... who love movies that guess you, you love this ......
