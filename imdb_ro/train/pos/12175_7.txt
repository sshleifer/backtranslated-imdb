What would you say about a man who was to marry and have bachelor party with some of his closest friends at a bar type Hawaiian? All the navigation smoothly until he takes off his "bachelor hat". What would you say about him talking to one of the suggestive dancers and then sleeping with her? What would you say if that exact girl was the cousin of her finances? A new low, right? Well, Paul Coleman, comedian played by Jason Lee leads the blur experience nausea and a new low. I have to say that this is one of his good leadership roles. However, I think his role in Vanilla Sky was better off. Funding was named Karen is played by actress Selma Blair upward, while the character of Karen, Becky, is played by the lovely and talented Julia Stiles. Returning to the place where we are left, Paul now has to deal with one problem. He becomes ill, it has to do with certain people and should play games lying with stealth or any member of each family could welcome the P. O'ed, including one of his relatives who had a "intestinal movement" for 14 days. * Vomit * All this leads to the long-awaited wedding with a hilarious scene before recaptured all hell that Paul and his brother had to go. Generally, one thing Guy is pretty funny and it's okay. Sometimes the story may seem like it does not go anywhere and you're tired of scenes here and there, but it's a mixed movie. And if you're a Canadian and another fan of Brett Butt CTV sitcom, Corner Gas, recognize a small role played by Fred Ewanuick, the same man who plays Hank hanierul series. This movie is fine. There's another feather in Lee's hat (pretty much a hat so far, though). <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Eliason A.
