A simple-minded but well-born film about a simple but good-quality high school graduate who has the dreams of having the world's hottest personalized vagueness to use it as a "ballroom." <br /> <br /> Bobby, our hero, spends the entire economy to buy his dream vehicle. Shared sharing and love of making a quick start with the girls Bobby took to the local pizza salon, but he discovers a great responsibility, danger and pain that comes with being the owner of such a mechanical miracle. it is my guilty pleasure. It captures the mood of the mid-70s and has enough unintentional humor to put it in the "so bad is good" category.
