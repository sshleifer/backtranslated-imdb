It was a very cool movie. You just have to prove that you do not need silly things like continuity and scriptures to make a movie. Crossing the continents in a few seconds, people shoot and nothing happens to them, the sword lights up, the samuars fight with the gallons that sink, David Essex is the villain's symbol and John Rhys Davies is just the typical. I enjoyed this movie, but I like movies from s ** t, this is the perfect example of a very s ** t movie that just KICKS ASS. If you like Battlefield Earth you will love this movie, its swashbuckling, its fast, silly, samuaraitastic's !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! as if it had been done in 1972
