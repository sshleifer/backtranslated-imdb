If you like animation movies, this movie will thank you. My wife likes animals and animal films, especially as the parrot in this movie. She's going to the kids, but I laughed at most of the humor. The French fashion character made me laugh and add a balance to the script. It's a Disney movie, with its happy, happy, family appeal, but I like to leave the theater with a positive girl.
