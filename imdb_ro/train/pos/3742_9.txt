I enjoyed this movie very much, but it's nothing new. Everyone here is grouped with other war movies, this movie was wrongly classified! It's not a war movie more than "One flew over the cuckoo's nest" is an asylum movie or "Cool Hand Luke" is a closed movie. This is a film about individuality, nonconformity, self-confidence and the cost of that personality. The plot is the same as "One flew over the cuckoo's nest" and "Cool Hand Luke" in the GOOD company, and has its own. These films should be supported and compared, not "Revelation Now" or "Platoon". <br /> <br /> Eric
