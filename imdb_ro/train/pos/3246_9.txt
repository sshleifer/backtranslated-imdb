I first saw this movie on cable about 5 years ago and I could not help laughing anymore. Everything about this movie seemed to click, the story, the characters, the setting. As for the movie, I would not call a great movie, but for what is supposed to be fantastic. It makes sense throughout. The cast is perhaps as good as any other ever made in a comedy movie. Corben Berbson, Fred Gwynne, Ruben Blades and Ed O'Neil are hilarious. For those who have not seen it, I will give you a brief synthesis: Four criminals meet in a small town in Montana after they have received a letter from their friend about a bankruptcy. However, when their boyfriend is arrested by two police officers following him in New Jersey, they try to figure out what's going on and all hell is breaking up. The film is really a big comedy and it resembles a poor version of Oceans Eleven, with only four criminals who can not sit on each other, and rather in Montana than Las Vegas. Generally, if you like to laugh, I strongly encourage you to see this movie.
