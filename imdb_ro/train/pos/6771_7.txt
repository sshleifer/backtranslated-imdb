so yeah is pretty nostalgic watching the first episode because this is the episode I definitely remembered. I like to watch the first season and yes, compared to the action-packed shows, we now have this blade show. but I honestly like the "less violent" part of the show and the story line has more substance than the new one. I found it interesting that Airwolf and JAG at Belisario have a similar theme - the main actor (Hawke and Harm) is looking for both a broken MIA (brother, father). I wonder if Robert Belisario's personal life imitates these two shows. <br /> <br /> Question - Does anyone have pictures of Hawke's cabin. I like that cabin (like my dream cabin) and that's one of the scenes I remember about Airwolf.
