"Now, in the sunny climate of India, where I spend my time as a soldier serving His Majesty the Queen ...", Rudyard Kipling's famous poetry also goes. This is the literal foundation on which "Gunga Din" is based. If you're lucky enough to watch this legendary Classic, you'll enjoy movies as they use to make them; for full enjoyment. Taken from the novelist and poet's script, this is a story of an Indian humble native called Gunga Din (Sam Jaffe) who works as a "regimental son" during the British occupation of India in the 18th century. His greatest desire is to become a soldier. The water boy is part of a British contingent of Calvary threatened with the death of a famous Kali blood cult called "Thuggee." Three special soldiers stand out in this company, who are known for their courage and comradeship. First of all it is beautiful and delicate, Cary Grant playing Sgt. Archibald Cutter. The next is Victor McLaglen as brave Sgt. MacChesney and finally Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as Sgt. Thomas Ballantine. All three of them and their classmates are surrounded by a mountain trembling treasure led by their fanatic leader named "Guru" (Eduardo Ciannelli). In the midst of wartime chaos, he is the courageous boy who hopes to win a seat in the army by playing a gun he found. A solid story for an old black and white film that needs little fanfare for anyone wishing to enjoy a classic. ****
