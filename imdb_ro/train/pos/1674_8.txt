Lisa Baumer (Ida Galli) is the adulterous wife of a great businessman who inherits a $ 1 million life insurance when her husband is killed in a plane crash while on a business trip. .. initially she is suspected to be responsible because her husbands have been changed and has an insurance investor Peter Lynch (George Hilton) and an Interpol agent on her tail just to be sure. Baumer travels to Athens, Greece to win her inheritance, but insists on having her in cash ... a dangerous life of events. Lynch's identity, now known, is trying to protect her from a lover of her husband, Lara Florakis, who, however, along with them, Sharif, is trying to kill both of them for some of the money they think they are entitled to. And here our masked murderer starts his brutal murders. Lynch, as is customary with our hero, is initially suspected by the Greek police and is warned not to leave Athens by police inspector Stavros (Luigi Pistilli, a familiar figure in Giallo and Spaghettis). Lynch is then helped by brilliant Cl√©o Dupont (Anita Strindberg), a local journalist who helps him investigate the killing. To say that it could destroy the movie for anyone who has not seen it, so they are enough to say there are quite a few red herrings and most of them plausible to keep happy Mystery / Thriller fans in this story led by Giallo. The No Shame DVD has a superb transfer with the English and Italian soundtrack. It also has a very attractive score just for a good measure of Bruno Nicolai, who will stay in your head for a while ... all in a first rate Giallo.
