I just finished listening to the director's commentary on this film, and I think the biggest thing I got from this is that this movie, like Mann's The Insider, is completely subjective. It's from Howard's POV. So any review or attempt to look at a set of comments about him, as Ebert did, is actually about Nolte's character. If you feel, as he did, that the movie "does not work," then you say, I think, that Howard does not work. And, to be honest, you could be right. Howard's judgment and personality really do not amount to professional psychological treatments and analysis. But, hey, that's the nature of the people. <br /> <br /> Andrew.
