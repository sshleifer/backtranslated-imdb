Very different topic treated in this movie. A simple and simple description of Chinese local customs, examining the day-to-day running of a public bath, led by the old owner and his retarded son, when his older son returns home, erroneously believing that his father died. How every city guy makes his daily visit to chat, plays games, discusses personal issues, and receives honest advice, apart from the usual spa therapies. When the old man dies, the strong and loyal family ties make the bigger son to handle, so that the functioning of the public bath is not interrupted. And, finally, the arrival of modernization to end this way of spending relaxed hours and doing it. The public bath must be demolished, building a commercial complex.
