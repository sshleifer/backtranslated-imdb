In 1991, the best two successes of all time were launched: TERMINATOR 2: THE DAY OF JUDGES and BOGUS JOURNEY. Of the two, I have always liked that BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY is better. TERMINATOR 2: JUDICIAL DAY is best done, but there is nothing like Bill and Ted. Besides Chris Farley and David Spade in TOMMY BOY, it's hard to think of a bigger comedy duo than Bill and Ted. They are one way. <br /> <br /> Apparently influenced by O.C. Lampoon's National. and Stiggs, Bill and Ted were created by Ed Solomon and Chris Matheson, two incredibly talented writers who invented the duo while playing at a local theater in Los Angeles in the 1980s. The two began quickly writing a scenario around the second and, most recently, BILL & TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE was born. The film, shot in 1987 and released in 1989, has become a great success in box office and a classic instant cult. It did not take long before the work started. Stephen Herek, director of "EXCELLENT ADVENTURE," was not eager to work on the sequel because he thought he was too scared and was not the first, so Peter Hewitt, making his film debut, was brought up for to drive further. He could not have been a better director for the job. BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY is awesome. It is full of its unique style and energy that can not be right. What makes "BOGUS JOURNEY" one of the best sequels ever is that while darker than the original, it's simply fun. Do not change characters as most sequels. Bill and Ted are the same loving characters who were in the first film. This is because it was written by the original writers. Most of the sequels are not written by the same writers as the first, but since "BOGUS JOURNEY" had the same scriptwriters, it was as good as "EXCELLENT ADVENTURE" if not even better. Like the first, "BOGUS JOURNEY" is absolutely hilarious, well written, fun and, above all, original. It's full of spectacular special effects and fantastic comedy shows from Alex Winter, Keanu Reeves and William Sadler. It's an unforgettable "journey." 10/10
