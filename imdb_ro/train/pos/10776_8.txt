"Radiofreccia" is still a good surprise in Italian cinema. The film is based on a book by Italian composer Luciano Ligabue, who also directs the film and writes the musical score - of course. The film is a portrait of the life of the North-Italian province in the Emilia Romagna region. We are in 1975, the time of the first free radios - one of the boys of the film creates "Radioraptus". Youths' motives, friendship, love, sex, individual drama and unemployment are among the themes, but the film also covers drugs. - Friction, the main character, is a victim of heroin slavery. Without being boring and moralistic, the story flows very well; the spontaneity of the actors is strong and the way they are heading. Obviously, Luciano "Liga" Ligabue is neither Fellini any professional film, first he is a musician. But he manages to make a good product. Unfortunately, he will not repeat his success with the second film, "Do not Die", is not good at all. In Radiofreccia, actors are generally not very famous, Stefano Accorsi - one of the most popular young Italian actors. See in a small role another Italian composer - Francesco Guccini, he is the beautiful communist bartender and football coach!
