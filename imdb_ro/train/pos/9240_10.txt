Found this movie in a videostore, costs $ 2 to buy. The whole movie is very bad! The so-called Colonel, who would be the hero here if he could trust the cover, must be in the eighties and barely able to go. However, he manages to shoot some of the worst ninja in the world. Then the story leaves the colonel, which makes sense in view of the old man's inability to do something worth mentioning, now two frightening men of eighty-four, who were supposed to be a kind of story. I've lost a hundred times, but it did not bother me, because the movie is so bad, it's fun to watch. Low budget bin with actors who do not deserve this name. Go!
