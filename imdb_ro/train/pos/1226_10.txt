They shot this film on the long island where I grew up. My brother and his girlfriend were extras in this movie. There seems to be a party scene where everyone drinks beer (which they told me to be colorful water, disgusting, and it was very hard to keep swallowing all the time, especially in funnel scenes). However, none of us has ever heard that the movie has been released anywhere, in any form. He never went to the theater (obviously) and, as far as I knew, was never released on the video and I'm sure he was not released on DVD. However, it seems to have been seen by some people, though probably very few. So there must be something. I would absolutely like to buy this for my brother, but there is no way I can find it anywhere. Does anyone know when / where / how could this movie be purchased? And what would it be?
