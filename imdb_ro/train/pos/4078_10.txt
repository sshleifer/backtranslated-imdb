This is one of my favorite movies, PERIOD. I can not think of another film that combines so many cinematic qualities as this. This movie has everything: action, adventure, science fiction, good vs. bad and even some romance (without even an innocent "peck" on the cheek between Pazu and Sheeta). Perhaps best, you do not have to be in Mensa to "get" it and enjoy the film as if you were doing other Miyazaki movies (I do not know about you, but I watch movies to take a break from to thinking). This is just a pleasant, enjoyable movie that everyone likes, do a favor and go buy. The only slick note is American Dubbing. We found Vander-Geek as just annoying. But still is not lost, the original Japanese is on the set of two discs and it's rocks! Who cares if you do not understand spoken Japanese? If you can read at a second class level, then watch the original Japanese recording with English subtitles. You won t regret.
