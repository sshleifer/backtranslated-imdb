For starters, I did not even know about this show because of an internet of about a year. I have not seen a TV show in my country once and many people do not usually know about this show. It is a sin, however, because it is easily the most original and smarter animation that I have seen on the turn. It does not distribute very much 10 points, but this is a show that really deserves 10 points. Even if at first sight this might seem like a typical cartoon, but remember that it is not a children's show. When the complete story unfolds, you know that this is a true deep story with a spiritual message. This spiritual part of the story is largely based on spiritual animals, an old Indian thinks it has been preserved for many years. This provides an original show that is not often found in animated shows. The general design is also something very different. Sometimes it resembles Spawn's little bit of stony design, and sometimes it takes a more accentuated approach. I think David Feiss, who also created and directed Cow and Chicken, has animated a segment in the show (as he also attracted that comic segment). If you are looking for a lied show, show that it takes on different subjects such as reality, suicide, spirituality, life, then this is something you should not miss. Once you start watching, you'll probably follow it all the way. A minor fact may be that the show takes less of the comic material, but this is not annoying. The only question remains, however, where is the DVD?
