Rather a business story where Bela Lugosi is a crazy scientist (yes, an assistant Renfield and his mother, a dwarf and yes, the wife of the scholar (sounds like a Greenaway movie, actually, lol). why do he? Who knows?) so that his wife can continue to look beautiful, he gets brides after he has done a fairly clever trick, with some orchids that make the brides crash to the altar. I swear for a shell and decides to call a story, has all sorts of clues about orchids and Lugosi, and heaven knows where the police are. strange looking for a doctor who may or may not be eeeevil Everything accumulates in a plan it's quite different to have a false wedding to surprise the crazy scientist, but it seems the scientist has an X-ray vision, No, what will happen? this film as a bit of guilty pleasure Lugosi is great here, his shoulders are very strange, the story is actually pretty ugly in some places, which makes everything to be watched. A fun view.
