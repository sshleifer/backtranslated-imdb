This movie has everything. Gags of vision, subtle jokes, play on words and lyrics. It's about a group of boys from different ethnic and social classes who meet to defeat a common enemy. If you look at this many times, you will find that you read it as Animal House (and also like the Animal House, too). I put in the top 15 the most funny movies. Major in the military academy of boys is paranoid that every child is bad and wants to cause problems (in this film he's right). It is sadistic, indecisive, cruel, and must be taken down. The group of boys who do not meet at the beginning end up gearing together to survive and get rid of the major with a strange plan that only Mad Magazine could write. You have to see - you like it!
