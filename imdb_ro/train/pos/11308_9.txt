TCM keeps me awake all the time ... they continue to come up with movies I have never heard ... Senso .... now Ossessione ... a very early Visconti movie !! ... wow ... The Italian Postman of Always Rings Twice ... brilliant! beautifully acted and directed ... They never heard of an excellent leader, Clara Calamai, as Giovanna, and especially Massimo Girotti as Gino ... what a sensual man! more muscular and attractive than anyone else on the screen in 1943! His gaze was before his time ... many male stars of the 1950s were probably inspired by him ... he should have been a major star in the world! The movie is much better than the Jack Nicholson / Jessica Lange version and less glossy than the MGM version (which I really like) along with John Garfield and Lana Turner, do you remember the white outfit? who can forget .... This Italian version is different .. more realistic and with a very different end ... watch it watching ... I'm going to buy it!
