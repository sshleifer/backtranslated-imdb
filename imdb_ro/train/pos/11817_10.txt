I saw Dick Tracy when we were very young. I did not know who was one of the actors and I did not know that the movie would be different than the way it was previewed. Of course I loved her though. Warren Beatty plays the role of 1930's detective, Dick Tracy, who fights the crime, who goes after the biggest mob bosses in town. This time, Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) killed a very strong man and is about to take over the city with his girlfriend, Breathless Mahoney (Madonna), who has eyes on Tracy. It gets even worse because a new killer invades and the worst is: this killer has no face. He or she is very unknown. In addition, the famous villagers return from the comic book collection. I thought this movie was very colorful and creative. It was fun and fun to look especially like a baby. Warren Beaty was just like James Bond in the 1930s, as he played Dick Tracy. An overall movie film includes: Charlie Korsmo, Glenn Headly, William Forsythe, Dustin Hoffman, James Caan, Ed O Ross, Tommy Lee Jones, Mandy Patinkin, Charles Durning. Plus more! <br /> <br /> Dick Tracy is a film for all ages and is a fun movie for a family to enjoy. Take my word for this.
