I took it a few weeks ago and I love her! It is modern, light, but full of real complexities of life. Questions and Answers, just like other Eytan Fox movies. This is my favorite, along with Jossi & Jagger. These images are much more universal than the bubbles we live in. You do not have to be a Jew or a homosexual to enjoy it - I'm not, but the movie goes directly into my first ten films. At first it seems to be pure entertainment, but it makes you think further. The relationships we need to live with are superficial, meaningful, profound, fatal, that you call. You do not know what's going on, and you certainly do not know where this story is going as you look at it for the first time. It's worth seeing more times. Fox films include extraordinary material - here is an excellent musical video and "accomplishment" (including title explanation, interviewing Lior Ashknenazi playing in the film and Arabs with doubts about Israeli lifestyles).
