Fido is a very strange movie. And in many ways, a very good one. My first thought, after watching, was how the hell are they going to sell this? If Shaun of the Dead is a romantic zombie comedy, Fido is a boy and his dog story mixed with a comedy of fifty zombie nostalgia. It's not even a language trip. Fido has little of Shaun's flesh, gore and belly laugh. Another beast is something else (forgive the game). Fido starts with a black-and-white information film that explains the story behind - people have won a war against zombies by developing a control collar that feeds meat fools in foolish jobs. At first we thought we were parodying paranoia at Matin√©e for fifty years, but we are soon driven into a world of bright primordial colors and fifty years of classroom nostalgia. Timmy Robinon is a single child who does not fall into school. His mother is a social climber, and his father is nervous and detached. In search of keeping up with Joneses, mother (Carry-Anne Moss) has acquired a zombie. Jimmy is uninterested at first, but "Fido" (Billy Conelley) soon turns out to be a great friend for Jimmy. Until his collar does not blink ... Fido is NOT a horror film, but my problem with the movie is to imagine exactly what it is. Much of the humor is of a variety of light families, and sometimes the plot line relies too much on the boy and on his dog / family moments. However, the movie is shot with wonderful, really funny moments, which while welcome, will provide an R rating for what it is, for long periods of time, a family comedy. The movie looks great and is greatly interpreted by all those involved. <br /> <br /> Its difficult tonal problems, I hope this film finds a niche because there's quite a bit of gem in this year's movie gossip.
