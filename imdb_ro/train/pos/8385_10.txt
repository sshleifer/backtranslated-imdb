This movie seems to have bad criticism for some reason. Probably just the mass population. Anyway, this is actually a very exciting movie. The film is a low-budget science-fiction movie that actually works because of an interesting scenario and well-done scenes. <br /> <br /> This movie can not be for everyone. If there are Sci-Fi fans who read this, I really recommend this movie if you like excellent science fiction. The movie has crazy ideas. The setting includes nations who are fighting GIGANTIC machines on which all countries invest all the money! The world was divided into territories. Anyone can challenge anyone else to a war or rather to a "robot-duel." The battle method is cleaner than the nuclear war, since everyone wears these breathing masks. Definitely a movie that makes you think. Smart, well-written and good for the bad budget. <br /> <br /> I tend to like movies that have small budgets and actually work.
