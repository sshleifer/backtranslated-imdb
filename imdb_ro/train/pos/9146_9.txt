This electrifying musician has more than a beat of egotism from his star, the musical genius that is the Prince. The film is about 90 minutes of presentation, but in reality it is easy to see why it is a classic cult. Just like other films that focus around the young musician who is trying to be great, this has a hint of drama in it to add a size to the musical numbers. While this movie is not as good as 8 miles as a recent example, this is fun and the soundtrack is much better. On the dramatic side of the story, the story lies around the Kid, a young artist and a regular club spot. The club owner is frustrated by the Kid arrogance and few Kid know that he might soon be fired and replaced by a rival. One of Kid's kids has trouble, and his father is violently abusing him. Throughout the movie, the child learns a few lessons in life and learns to appreciate more friendships. All the things we have seen in the course of old age drama, of course, but this is combined as a musical, a very stylized musical. The distribution is good. The prince is actually pretty good on the drama side when he does not hit a photo. It looks human and relative. Clarence Williams is very good as an abusive father. Appollonia Kotero makes a good debut as sexy love princess interest. The main force of the film, however, is the superb soundtrack. The musical numbers are well organized and electrifying. The Prince is undoubtedly a musical master, though very eccentric. When inspired, he is great, but on the other hand he will often make songs that are only for his taste and sometimes his experimentation may be without fire, but this is the same for many musical geniuses. The soundtrack for this movie is great, but only Sexshooter is a weak point. The performance of the "Purple Rain" performance is, however, exceptional. It's one of my favorite songs. *** <br /> <br />
