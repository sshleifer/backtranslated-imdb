Of course, the original is better, but it's not as bad as everyone to say! Yes, it's done in 3 stories, but hey, so what ?! I thought it was good enough to be honest. I liked how Anastasia changed when she fell in love, showing what love can do. The stories were not that bad. I also liked Cinderella's voice. I have nothing against her original voice, but I think it sounds better here, more beautiful. I also liked the personality in it, she had more than one backbone, but she was still nice. So, I'll give Cinderella II: Dreams Come True 7/10.
