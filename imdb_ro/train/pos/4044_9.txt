I found this movie to be very good-paced. The premise is quite imaginative and, as a viewer, I was pulled while the characters grew. Pacing is done very well for those who want to think - enough is kept hidden from the viewer from the beginning and there are questions that later are answers, producing a well thought-out and very satisfying film, both in terms of the brain as well as from an action point of view. It looks like some people were looking for a non-stop roller coaster ride with this movie - one of those that comes load from the gate. This would be more akin to one of those coasters that will lead you first on the hill - creating a wonderful sense of anticipation - and finally, in my mind, I will better fulfill my original foundation. <br /> <br /> The film is excellent.
