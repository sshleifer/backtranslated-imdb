I approached this film with low expectations, but it was very pleasantly surprised. It's very well done and knocking your hands down the ballroom dancing movies in recent years, especially "Strictly Ballroom". While the music is nice and the colorful dance, for me the film is not related to the dance. This is the very Japanese institution that gives male office workers who work a lot of time to work and free time after work for entertainment that does not involve their families. Here we have a man with a complete family, a big mortgage and a happy life. He is attracted by the attractive image of a young woman in a dance studio that passes him during his journey and this causes him to try dancing in the ballroom. It is also Japanese that the lecherous motives that have initiated his new passion are made clearly, but in a way accepted, at least in the end, by the family and the public. Attitudes to dance in the ballroom, as they are transmitted in the film, are certainly non-Western, although discipline and music are clearly cultural imports to Japan. Cultural contrasts are, therefore, interesting. Even without the cultural knowledge, the color, the dancing and the enthusiasm of the players make this movie fun.
