This is a wonderful and well-written psychological drama. It's not even a horror shot, so those who look for something like Ring or The Grudge will be disappointed. What really surprised me about this film was subtle intelligence and attention to details in the plot and the effort made to be consistent internally. I also appreciated Dr. Phil Philobobble's absence or New Age revisionism. Instead of advancing an agenda, the producers told the story, they said good and left the viewers to think about it. The right paintings of memories remind Wyeth's paintings and were amazingly efficient. <br /> <br /> A great example of making a good movie on a small budget without big studios, star actors, big names executives (this was much better than most of Hitchcock's films) special or "smart" effects.
