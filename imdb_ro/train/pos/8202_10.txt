It was undoubtedly the best of the "Dirty Harry" series. From the opening credits, you are swept away in a harsh and profound revenge story. Sondra Locke is perfect in the role of a traumatized woman out for revenge. Eastwood has many "aside" sequences that have nothing to do with the plot, but he showed Harry the worst thing. Charged with unforgettable characters in minor roles, this movie is rock and should serve as a standard for detective / action movies. This is the Dirty Harry movie that is raw and devoid of any "fluff". I can see this again and again (well, not in one session) because it is a nice "out for revenge" yarn. The rhythm is fast and some of the scenes are unforgettable. "Give me a day ... Do you feel lucky, Punk? ...", the classic Eastwood, just Eastwood, with his painful, rubbery expressions and a shocking, threatening voice I can do.
