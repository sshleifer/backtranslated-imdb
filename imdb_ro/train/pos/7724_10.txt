Sure Star Wars (a movie I've seen at least fifty times) beat all the other in special effects, but this movie has everything else! He has horror, romanticism, robots, wise reputation, intelligence (surprisingly good), special effects and drama. I've seen this movie a few years ago in a revival with a recent hit and I was amazed at how well-kept today. I thought the 40-year old style electronics would look hockey, but they look somewhat futuristic and modern. Ann Francis here (mostly) short skirts and bare legs with a garland innocence hard to beat an increase from me. Monster Krell that appears in rays still frightens bejebees from me. Of course, we all know that "the great bird of the Galaxy" probably shaped much of the "Star Trek" in this movie. No one has yet robbed Robby, Robot, in terms of personality (sorry, R2D2 and C3PO). This film, as a whole, is the standard that all other science fiction films will have to measure up to! <br /> <br /> Honorable mention for the electronic score that kept us all on needles and needles.
