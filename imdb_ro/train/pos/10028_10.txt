When I saw this movie, I was amazed at why it was a great movie. This is the only movie I think I would ever give a 10-star rating. I'm sure this movie will always be in my top 5. The actor is great. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslett are just as good. I do not think anyone could have a better job than Kate. <br /> <br /> If it's a rainy day and you can not decide what to rent, well, that's one. You will love all actions, special effects and much more. If you have not seen this movie go for rent or buy now! You won t regret. <br /> <br />
