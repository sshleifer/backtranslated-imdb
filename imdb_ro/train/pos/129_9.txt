With an amazing cinema and a Kafkaesque absurdity, this film made me a simple but fascinating opening scene. The movie plays a lot like a dream and I think maybe why people hate or love her. Characters are superficially drawn, and the story itself is light and perhaps useless. But these are film failures, but conscious choices. The film does not attempt to function as a history, but rather a deconstruction of the war films of the 1940s. <br /> <br /> I would have trouble claiming the movie was a more real substance, but the movie is a cinematic miracle that I was completely swept away. This is one of the most beautiful films ever filmed, and there is a wild imagination in its style. I can fully understand why people would hate, but I give them 9/10.
