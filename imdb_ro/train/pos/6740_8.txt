The completely rounded character of the film's main role, that of the policeman broken by his past and a way of self-destruction so clear to the spectator, is unique to his 1950s time. <br /> <br /> Together with music haunting and well written plot, the film is a prime example of noir films at its best. Close to Dana's eyes reveals the pain inside, Karl Malden excels as his boss, who does nothing stupid, but also has compassion for those under his command on the premises. <br /> <br /> Otto Preminger made this type of movie just about his own. If there is any blame, it would be with the breath that takes the beauty of Gene Tierney, who seem unusually unwavering with the hardened policeman. Their scenes in the cafe are nevertheless wonderful and they are true. <br /> <br /> Tom Tully, on the side of her father, is perfect like Gary Merrill's hood. Great illumination and mood setting. The building where the deadly events take place very atmospheric, I like the old man in the basement. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
