Hold your man, find Jean Harlow, Brooklyn's working class girl who falls into the clutch of Clark Gable, and he's facing all sorts of trouble. The film begins as its film, but until the focus is certainly on its character. The film opens with Gable, pulling a conjugation game with his partner, Garry Owen, and the sign shouts for the cops. While he is pursuing Gable Ducks in Harlow's apartment and being a man so charming, she protects him. No longer she was involved with him and, unfortunately, missiles. Gable, Harlow and Owen try to shoot a badger game on a drunkard Paul Hurst, but then Gable will not go through it. Of course, when Hurst realizes he was a cone, he is still inflamed and becomes belligerent, and Gable must strike him. But then he turns dead outside Harlow's apartment, and the blond platinum hair makes it easy to identify himself. She is an accomplice for murder. The rest of the movie is her adjustment to life in prison. Her interaction with the other female prisoners gives her some very good scenes. I think some of the material was later used for the classic Caged MGM. Harlow also gets to make the title song and is made like a torch style ballad, very popular back in those days. Speak / sing in the way of Sophie Tucker and pretty good. <br /> <br /> Gable is well expressed as a man who develops a consciousness, a part he will often play, most notably in my favorite Gable movie, Honky Tonk. Harlow, who shines in this movie. I think it's one of the best that she did at MGM, her fans should not miss them.
