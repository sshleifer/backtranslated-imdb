This is one of the best meetings ever, Adam West and Burt Ward parodying and having fun while doing it. It's amazing to see the details of the 1960s, Batcave, Wayne Manor, the selected costumes and actors to play the younger versions of West, Ward, Burgess Meredith, Cesar Romero, and Frank Gorshin! This 90 minutes is worth a long time and is a delight for all the fans of the classic 1960s television series "Batman". I notice the videos in "Batman" were from the movie, not the series itself, probably because of the legal restrictions. Let's hope the three seasons of the show will appear on DVD.
