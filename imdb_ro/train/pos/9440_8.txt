"Deliverance" is one of the best films of exploitation out of that wonderful decade of the 1970s, where did many other films of operation. A group of friends is established on a canoe trip on a river in south and become victimized by a lot of hills not trying to destroy life. Is awesome. We are treated to anal rape, vicious beatings, murders with the bow and arrow, shooting, broken bones etc ... Much like "Texas Chain Massacre 1974" to say "Deliverance" is credible as immature. This could not happen again, even in the dark times in 1972. "Deliverance" is a very fun ride full of action. Is one of a bunch of exploitation films come from the early 70s and is (certainly) at the top of that heap, with great action, superb cinematography and excellent writing. 8 out of 10 children.
