Scoop *** of **** Woody Allen is definitely not my favorite director, but I liked Match Point. It was an excellent dark romantic thriller that fortunately did not play Woody Allen. She had a beautiful Scarlett Johansson in it. "Scoop" is Woody Allen's latest film and although it appears in this, it's OK. She also belongs to Scarlett Johansson, and the two work perfectly together. Johansson plays the role of Sondra Pransky, a young college journalist who receives a piece of life from Joe Strombel's ghost (Ian McShane.) Joe heard the knife as he was on a boat with a grim reaper and a bunch of other souls taken by Reaper. One of those souls is Peter Lyman's secretary (Hugh Jackman.) He tells Joe that Peter can be the serial killer who crosses the streets of England. Joe, with a piece of life, travels back to the living, and gives this information to Sondra during a magical act. Sondra is at a magical show with magician Sid Waterman (Woody Allen.) She becomes a volunteer to go into a box of extinction and, while in the box, gets Joe's visit. She does not know what to do, she calls Sid Waterman's help to help her break the case. This movie has a pleasant feel for Match Point, and yet everything works. Johansson and Allen work great together. Allen's humor fits perfectly with this story and role. Hugh Jackman is terrible like Peter Layman, the killer "suspected" in the series. This is a fun movie to see if you ever want to watch one. The cast band works well together and the story is flowing and sometimes forgetting you're looking at Woody Allen. I say I give him a chance because you might like it.
