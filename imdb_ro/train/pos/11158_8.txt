The shocking and well-done chiller is an underestimated story of atrocious crimes and evil forces. The little town doctor is trying to find out who or what makes a series of sexual violence crimes. <br /> <Incubus is a tight mystery with some horrible sequences of crime, which is based on a climatic outburst and dizziness. Crime scenes are intense and troublesome, so it's not a movie for squeamish! John Hough's direction, along with a bizarre score of music, combines to create a dark horror atmosphere that passes through the movie. It also has some sort of Gothic vibration. Beautiful levels of shooting and some elegant roomwork are also highlighted. Distribution is not bad either. The great John Cassavetes performs well as the new physician in the city. Also, Kerrie Keane's shows, local reporter, Helen Hughes, city historian, and Duncan McIntosh, as a psychological tortured adolescent. Around Incubus is a forgotten horror film that needs to be re-discovered and re-evaluated. <br /> <br /> *** from ****
