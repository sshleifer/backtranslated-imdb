Although not seen in too many films before, you have certainly seen the core themes of the plot from too many movies ever since. <br /> <br /> None of Grant's or Loy's best films make remarkable efforts together. After all, with that talent and a very good support distribution, you know the ladies will be there. The movie is light, has some dramatic signs, but keeps the plot on the move and makes you smile the whole through excellence. <br /> <br /> An excellent example of classic American film fare, which was the test of time. <br /> <br /> Defined afternoon afternoon, hard to popcorn.
