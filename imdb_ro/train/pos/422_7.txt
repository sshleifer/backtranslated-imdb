"Plainsman" is Cecil B. DeMille's regimental power to the most inaccurate and unconfactual. (George Ellison), Calamity Jane (Jean Arthur), George Armstrong Custer and Abraham Lincoln to interact, although in reality Lincoln was already dead when the story takes place. From time to time, DeMille is dangerously floating in the nearness of the truth, but equally easily moves away from him in an uncanny and spectacular show. The film is an attempt to sustain Custer's last position with a bunch of fiction that relies solely on the lives of people who were already the product of the manufactured products and the legends. Indeed, this is the world according to DeMille - a zeitgeist in the annals of entertainment, but a relic enough to camp with current standards. TRANSFER: Considering the film's age, this is a moderately attractive transfer, with extremely clean and black whites. There is a considerable amount of film wheat in some scenes and an absence at other times. Overall, image quality is therefore somewhat inconsistent, but is it never bad or good? just a little better than the middle of the road. Age-related articles are kept to a minimum, and digital anomalies do not distract. Audio is mono, but beautifully balanced. EXTRAS: Look. It's Universal! BOTTOM LINE: As a pseudo-history painted on celluloid, this vest is convincing and fun. Just take the characters and the story with a grain of salt? in some cases ?? an entire box seems more appropriate!
