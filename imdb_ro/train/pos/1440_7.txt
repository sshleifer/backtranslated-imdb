I liked the quiet noir of the first part, the action of Pacino and Cusak, especially their scenes together. The mood of configuring and juxtaposing the old pole and idealistic youth was made. I want Bridget Fonda to have several scenes in the film; she was a serious and appealing character. The film came out of the rails when the assistant mayor began to ring around the mafia to reach the bottom that his boss did not want to interfere with. No one in their minds met a mafia on an abandoned dock in Junkyard. Here the story became unlikely. Something I do not understand: why did the cop and Vito have a shootout if the latter provided information that could bring the corrupt judge?
