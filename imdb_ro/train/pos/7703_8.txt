I was surprised how a movie could be both cheesy and excellent at the same time. Frisbee Flying Saucer was beyond understanding, especially when landing, but the special effects when Krell attacked were great for a movie that was made over half a century ago! Living in the Middle East saw shades of Islam while JJ Adams suggested that Alta should dress more modestly and, as an engineer, was amazed at the imagination used for the "futuristic" gadgets and the jams vis-a-vis the department props. Overall, an hour and a half of fun, the first time I saw Walter Pidgeon and a chance to see Leslie Neilsen as a "young"
