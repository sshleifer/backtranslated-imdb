WOW! <br /> <br /> This movie is the best live testament, I think, about what happened on 9-11-01 in New York, compared to anything shown by the major media. the outlets can show you just what happened outside. This movie shows you what happened on INSIDE. <br /> <br /> Start with a focus on a New York firefighter waiting for weeks for the first big fire he will call to fight. The subject suddenly returns with ONE EXACT POWER OF THE FIRST PLANE FOR LOADERS. Then you give yourself a first-class chair as the firefighters rush into the Tower One lobby. <br /> <br /> In the minutes preceding the collapse of the second plane and the next fall of the second tower, you will see that the firefighters react to the anxious sound of the people who sit above the hallway. It's a sight that you will not soon forget. The defeat of the heart, tearful tearing and very convincing from the first minute to the last, "9/11" deserves to go down in history as one of the best documentary films ever made. <br /> <br /> We must never forget. <br /> <br />
