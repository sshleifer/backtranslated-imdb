Michelle Rodrigez was made for this film when I first saw her in "Fast and the Furious". You could say she was a tough woman. With this film, she has not only shown the act, but she does not show any fear and it's hard to be in the movie. She is a worse girl and I like her. This movie is about a disturbing girl, living her life like a toy boy and getting into constant problems with school and family. While she is interested in preparing the brethren to be a boxer, she decides to go after her love to fight and asks the breeder to train her. Even if they do not think they have the potential, they prove to be wrong. I think the movie was a little slow at the end, but it was well done. It shows that people can do anything, even if they do not think you have the potential. I recommend it to be seen.
