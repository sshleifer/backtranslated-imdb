This movie has a few things that are quite amazing. First of all, it is supposed to be based on a true story. This, in itself, is amazing that several tornadoes hit the same city in the autumn of Nebraska. I wonder if the real city name was close to "Blainsworth" (which is the city's name in the movie). There is an Ainsworth, Nebraska, but there is also a city that starts with Blains-something. Do not show the slowest moving tornadoes recorded if they saw where the boys are in the house. On the other hand, the scene in which the TV becomes fuzzy is actually based. Before the Doppler radar and the weather radio, we were taught that if you turned the TV into a particular channel (not a cable) and adjusted the brightness exactly, you could tell if it was a tornado coming in. The problem was that until then you could hear it. <br /> <br /> Since I know something about mid-century tornadoes, it made this movie fun for me. I like more than Twister. I mean, give me a break - you can not get through F5 by tying you to a pipe in the house house.
