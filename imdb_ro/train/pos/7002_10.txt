Will Smith once again played a film about a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders and crusade to correct his mistakes in a way that touches even the hardest hearts! Writer Grant Nieporte and Italian director Gabriele Muccino have joined and created a masterpiece that I recommended to buy and keep in your movie collection because you never get tired of watching / watching this movie! I have the greatest respect for Will Smith because he is not just a bright actor, but one can say he has real love for people and life that undoubtedly made him perfect for the character (IRS agent Ben Thomas) whom he played in this movie. You will find that you feel the pain and anger, the frustrations of his love for Emily, played by Rosario Dawson, which was fantastic, as usual. I found myself in love with the fact that their characters were falling in love. Woody Harrelson is also starring in the Top Notch movie. It is very hard for me to write this review without giving away key plotting points ... All I can say is to look at this and when you make sure you have nothing to stop taking the phone off the hook, to start trying to uncover the mysterious life and past of IRS agent Ben Thomas ... Thank you Will Smith for another great movie!
