Zero Day leads you to think, even to think about why two boys / youngsters would do what they did - commit suicide by slaughtering classmates. It captures what must be beyond a bizarre way of being for two people who have decided to withdraw from a common culture to define their own / mutual world through coupled destruction. It's not a perfect movie, but given what money / time the director and the actors have - it's a remarkable product. As far as explaining the motives and actions of the two young suicide / killers, it is better than "Elephant" - as far as the film under our "rationalist" skin is concerned, it is a much better film than almost anything will give. <br /> <br /> Failed but honest with a terrible honor.
