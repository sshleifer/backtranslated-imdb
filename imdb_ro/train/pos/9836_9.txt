Although not as frightening as the classic predecessor of culture (ZOMBI 2), I like this more. This is due to its faster pace, better settings and soundtrack for the '80s. It is loaded with action and has sweet gore effects by Lucio Fulci. Zombies do not look as bad as ZOMBI 2, but they still look good. It has been done quite well, but it certainly has joy; for example, some zombies are moving really slow, while others are as fast as ninja. some are brains while others say funny lines but expect consistency when it comes to Italian horror? There's even a flying zombie head! How bad is this? You definitely have to see for gorehounds and zombie fans. probably would satisfy the majority of action film fans. Also check out Zombi 4.
