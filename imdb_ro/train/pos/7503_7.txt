The movie was fine, quite fun. The distribution was pretty good and I will emphasize what I mentioned before me - Glenn Quinn was remarkable and he alone is a good reason to watch this movie. He sang the egoist "bad" friend and band manager brilliantly! There are a lot of songs made by "Beyond Gravity" in this movie, but this does not come as a surprise considering the film is a VH1 production. However, if rock rock / pop music is not to like someone might also flash before these scenes. The plot of a troop trying to get to the top in LA but having to overcome many obstacles on the road are not too original, but quite fun, with a surprising plot going back and forth there.
