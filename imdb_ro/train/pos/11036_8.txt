A prison cell, a young company director charged with fraud, a 35-year-old transsexual in the process of transformation, Daisy, a mentally challenged driver for 20 years, and Lassalle, a 60-year-old intellectual who killed His wife. Behind a plate of stone in the cell, mysteriously detached, they found a book: the diary of a former prisoner, Danvers, who occupied the cell at the beginning of the century. The diary contains magical formulations that perhaps "Malefique" is one of the smartest and smartest horror films we've seen this year. The film has a dirty and shadowy feel influenced by HP Lovecraft's work, which creates a very horrifying and disturbing atmosphere. There is a fair amount of gore involved in imaginative and brutal death scenes, and the characters of the four prisoners are surprisingly well developed. It's a shame that Eric Valette made horrible remakes "One Missed Call" after his amazing debut.9 of 10.
