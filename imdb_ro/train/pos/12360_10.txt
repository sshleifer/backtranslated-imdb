I liked the movie. he looks nice to the small bourgeois Italian society, as the 70th cessions gave up all their ideals and came to a happy arrangement that they do not want disturbed. For example, the aging psychoanalyst, who is jealous of his own son, and does not want to be reminded of his more radical youth. For a long time, he wanted to buy the video after seeing the film several times on the big screen and on the TV, but seems to have disappeared completely from the market, even in Italy, no one in the bookstores knew about the movie. a great pity. The only sex scene that everyone seems to do does not hurt the movie.
