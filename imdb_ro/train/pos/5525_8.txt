Much of the problem many people have with this movie is that they seem to think the story should have been more fun (ignoring the fact that it is based on a true story) or feeding on a film that glorifies Che what really does not). This film is very close to Jon Anderson's definitive biology on Che and he is right. Soderburgh is doing a great job of setting the mood for the unleashed landing of Che's Bolivian adventure. You really have the impression of Bolivian peasant's shyness and total astonishment over Che's revolutionary ideas or the difficulties his people have had with hunger and land. I'm sorry he paid the attention of the movie fans out there, but that's how it happened. So do not get into this movie waiting for a Rambo pull up, it's a true story!
