From the opening scene, on a crowded train with an immortal pocket (RICHARD WIDMARK) stolen from a woman's bag (JEAN PETERS), PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET is fascinatingly tireless to look at. The part is because the action is a strong uniform across the cast, the B & W is clear and adds starkness to the story and the characters, and Samuel Fuller's direction puts him in the same big league as John (ASPHALT JUNGLE) Huston. In fact, she has the same urgency as the Huston movie about a bad rape - but the gain is not so strong. JEAN PETERS is excellent as the high-grade girl Widmark describes as "beaten around many." She gives a lot of raw energy and sex to her role, the woman who is not too bright, wearing a microfilm in her purse for her boyfriend (RICHARD KILEY), something the FBI already knows about. They are on their way when the theft takes place. THELMA RITTER adds realism to her portrait of a woman named "Moe," who buys and sells everything to make a profit and ends up paying for her with her life. She especially touches the final scene with Kiley. This is guaranteed to keep you in touch with its hour and twenty minutes of operation. Good Noir from Fox and notable for the performances of Widmark, Peters and Ritter.
