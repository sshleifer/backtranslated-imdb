I played this movie at the local video store during their annual pavement sales. During the scanning of thousands of videos, hoping to find some cartoon movies for sale, I came across this movie. I read the back of the movie and I knew it was God's hand at work for me to buy this movie. You see, I have a brotherhood of three children who have adopted (and are about to be adopted) living with my family. Immediately our foster children made a connection with the three children who played in the movie. The film helped them better understand their own circumstances. For the first time, the oldest brother group (7 years old / female) decided to open me a little the past and the trauma she had lived. She has fought against the whole problem of trust. This is the first time I've seen her cry. After watching the movie, I asked them what it means for a child to be adopted. She said, "It means to be happy." They have to see for families that encourage children and are considering adopting. Of course, he opened the lines of communication with us.
