When I saw this movie a few days ago, my eyes were completely fixed on the screen. Its magnification has attracted my attention to such an extent that I have focused my attention on it for the duration. I would recommend not only to anime fans, but to anyone who enjoys a great movie time (or who likes the really strange stuff). The art style is beautiful, the sound is perfect, and the symbolism within it is astounding. I have heard complaints about the strange insertion of English text into the movie, but I think the way it was made is complementary to the strange style of the film. The self-attributed description of "Hello Kitty on Acid" does not make the film right with absolutely epic proportions. I would like to find more papers from whoever did this and see them.
