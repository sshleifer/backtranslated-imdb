It is still the benchmark for judging all Golden Age ages, and considering the limited technology and dubious ethical standards of the authorities (on screen), it is well against all generations of similar trials in cinema and television. Fast and angry with a lot of Warner Bros napkins and fortunately, without time for a love interest, he knocks along, taking his splendid fun to the end of the violent end. I did not understand why YES had to shoot Vance everywhere, I always realized they were office. Palette as a detective, but especially Girardot as a doctor is eccentricly delightful and non-PC - when looking at the second victim of the crime, he smells there are too many people in the world anyway. Of course, is William Powell like Philo Vance (and Michael Curtiz as director), who makes the film what it is - when Powell ever made a stupid thing? The army of the crime scene did not really do a really good job of finding the second dead body and the unconscious dog did it! The best thing is where Vance tells us the whole sequence of events around the murders - the set of upsetting patterns combines with the incredible angles of the cameras to produce a modern and stunning sensation of what has passed. The only problem is that, as usual, the conclusion can not fit with the global deductive processes displayed throughout, and an ending to some extent is invoked; some of Chan, Moto and many others, of course, could only be completed in this way. But because it's happening so fast and it's ... a little morally dubious, it does not diminish my opinion of KMC's status as a classic! All the fingerprints I've ever seen about KMC are (in the worst case scenario) as if you were looking at a golden bowl, so if you're interested in seeing it wearing it until you're choked.
