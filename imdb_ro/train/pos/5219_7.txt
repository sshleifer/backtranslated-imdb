Gere and Danes play the role of 2 public security workers who track down the released sex offspring. Gere, who plays Babbage, refers to them as his flock. Gere is an obsessed vigilant over which he is on his way. He is training, the new Allison, to take over his job. Gere sees his flock as very sick, troubled. He asks him questions that are not on the list and tries to act like the police and solve the crimes. He continues to be warned of this behavior, which is why he is replaced. During her last days of work, a young girl loses, and Babbage is sure she is one of her herds that have lost their way. He and Allison narrow down a list and discover that some of the offenders have left AWOL. So he decides he needs to track a missing girl, rather than help the police. This part is a little cramped. There are some sick, twisted things in this movie. Just like when Babbage and Allison go to this building where a group of sick people do disturbing things between them. There are also people who kidnapped the girl. At the end of the movie, we see what are sick strangers. However, I would not call this an excessive movie because it is not very featured on the film. VERDICT FINAL: If you like thrillers and movies about serial killers and policemen watching killers, then you like this.
