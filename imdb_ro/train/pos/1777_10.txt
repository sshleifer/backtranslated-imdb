When I first saw the Romeo division in spring, my first reaction was BRILLIANT! However, in the future, I was offered much more than a master film. This image has a singular voice that will echo throughout the film's history. The opening fitting offers a splendid palette that JP Sarro uses to set art on this cloth. <br /> <br /> Sarro truly uses the camera as a brush while taking us on a walk that surrounds the audience in an extraordinary action film that goes beyond the traditional format we've got used to and sinks deep into the homework darkness of treason, vengeance and the importance of companies. This film is the dream of any director in his center. However, Sarro was not alone in this epic action. The writing, offered by writer Tim Sheridan, was just as stunning. The dialogue was so precise and direct that it gave the actors a presence and a charisma on the screen. Specifically, the final scene (in which Vanessa is revealed to be one of the coalitions and a villain all the time) is written in such a dark tone that it is one of the coldest terminals I have ever seen. Sheridan is the next Robert Towne. In a final note, it is obvious that this production was not a small act. Therefore, a lot of praise should be given to Scott Shipley, who seems to have the creativity and genius to go next to Jerry Bruckheimer. I have never witnessed such a great production, with so much attention directed at every little detail. A producer's job is one of the most difficult in any movie and Shipley makes it easy. Everything in this movie combines creative writing, stunning production, and the master's direction. This is the art of the film at its best. When the end of the movie arrives, the only thing that's wanted is more. The Romeo Division is revolutionary, a masterpiece and, most importantly, the Romeo Division is indeed an art.
