I saw the German version of the film on German television and I was really amazed. Generally, I like to see documentary films, but I do not remember seeing one better than "Earth." I knew some scenes from YouTube videos I found through random browsing. I also remember that I have seen parts of the movie on the multimedia stores running on high definition TVs. After seeing the movie, it's obvious to me that recording is so popular among distribution users and multimedia store managers: It's so great and spectacular that you can not help watching the screen, no matter if you're generally interested in documentary nature or not. Without hesitating a 10 out of 10. Certainly, there are many thrilling movies, but in terms of documentaries, "Earth" is certainly one of the best of its kind.
