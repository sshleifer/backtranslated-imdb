I think some of the reason this movie was made ... and it's destined for our players who actually play all the computer games from Nancy Drew. Lately there have been many movies based on video games, and I think that in one of them. So this movie does not follow any book. But this is not part of the games. I buy and play all the games of Nancy Drew as soon as she gets out. And the games are from HerInteractive and are for "girls who are not afraid of a mouse!" And some of these games have in fact won the Choice Awards for Parents. They are not just fun, you can even learn one thing or two while playing. I took two of my stepchildren with me to go see and they loved it! Year 10 years. old girl started playing her first game, Nancy Drew, the day before I went to see her, and she was so fun playing the game I thought she would enjoy the movie. And I was right ... she not only loved this movie, but she could not wait to get home to finish the first game and start another. My other daughter is just 7 and she also loved the movie, but she's still a bit too young to play games yet, but she enjoys watching her sister playing sometimes just to see what's going on. The games are based on children aged 10 and older. All games usually have downhill reviews and are classified as adventure games. For more information about games, check HerInterative Games Nancy Drew. So I personally thought the movie was good enough and I will buy it when it will appear on DVD.
