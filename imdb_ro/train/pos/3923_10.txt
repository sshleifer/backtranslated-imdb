This is an amazing film for both the incredible energy evoked by the frantic dance of flamenco and the unique way in which producers intersect with the story of stage production with the lives of the characters who are preparing for it. Spellbinding is the only word I can use to describe the experience. This is not "Carmen Bizet" of any standard. This is not an ordinary movie by any standard. Every tinted eye, every foot stomp, every piece of music is so entwined that you can not take your eyes off the screen. You do not have to love opera or flamenco (I do not want) to be captured, excited by this movie. Subtle and direct; loud and quiet; One of, if not the best, movies like this because there are so few.
