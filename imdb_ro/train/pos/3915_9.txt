I've seen this movie at least 4 times since '84 and yet it's great every time I see it. It's a very convincing version of Carmen, with amazing Flamenco dancing, sets of empty bones and, of course, great music. This story of Carmen is a story in a story, each parallel to the other, until the end of the double tragic. Obviously, a low-budget Spanish production, the film contains dances by some of Spain's dancers, Prime Minister Flamenco. The combination of rising opera music and the sound of dancing boots on the wood scene makes the story of the story even stronger. It is the production of films independent of the best and probably the best preference of my foreign movies.
