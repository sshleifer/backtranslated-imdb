Life Begins is a wonderful pre-coded movie with the best moments of the era. She is in a maternity hospital, especially in the room for women who expect to have problems. She is an older woman, a tough mother (Glenda Farrell), a slender woman, an Italian woman, and the main character (Loretta Young), who spends 20 years in prison for killing. Her husband (Eric Linden) is at the hospital every second to know that everything will be fine. Aline MacMahone plays care that is great at work. This movie is very exciting and fun. It's not at all shocking, but it's interesting to see a neglected topic on the silver screen. The actor is brilliant around. Loretta Young is wonderful here in the foreground. Eric Linden comes out of nowhere and is sincere how it can be. His innocence reminds Michael J. Fox. Glenda Farrell is great as always, a pre-code basis and for good reason.
