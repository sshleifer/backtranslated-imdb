In addition, he explores the strange impulse of suicide in a very honest way, does not shoot any blows in his looks, but does not live or overestimate the subject. has documentary news about it, as well as horror and art cinemas, and deserves a place in the canon of "different" horror films such as the Blair Witch Project and the original ring (both that preceded and could be good influence unknown). It is certainly worth seeing if you are interested in the edges of horror cinema.
