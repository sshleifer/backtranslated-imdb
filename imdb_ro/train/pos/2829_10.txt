Undoubtedly, private lessons II are the biggest movie I've ever seen. A Japanese (dumb) import translated into English is a joy to watch. It makes little sense, but it does not matter. It's the greatest comedy around, never being intentionally funny. The movie is rare and unavailable on the video, but I caught it a few times late, late at night on pay-per-click. My recorded album was watched by dozens or dozens of times, as slowly, personally, I bring this movie jewel to the world. Joanna Pacula plays the tutor / lover role of Ken, our hero. (Apparently she just worked for her check). Ken is played by Goro Inagaki, from the Japanese pop band SMAP, who offers it all and has wonderful hair in the movie. Stacy Edwards, from "In The Company of Men" fame, also appears in the film and is probably happy to have found other movies afterwards. <br /> <br /> It takes at least three viewers to sort out what the plot is. When repeating the view, you can enjoy items such as the abnormal amount of pots that Ken has in his house (at least 50) or that Ken wears a shirt with corn embroidered shells in the final of the film. is predictable, but is highly quoted. My friends and I are reviewing whole scenes. Yeah, it sounds like we're bad and we're ... but we're stupid people who saw Private Lessons II. Be one of the ten people in the world who have seen this movie. You will thank me for this.
