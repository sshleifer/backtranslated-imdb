A word can describe this movie and that's weird. I recorded this movie one day because it was a Japanese animation and it was old, so I thought it would be interesting. Well it was, the movie is about a boy who travels the universe to get a metal body to seek vengeance. On the way he meets very colorful characters, and ultimately he has to decide if he wants the body or not. Very strange, if you are a fan of animation / science fiction, you might want to check this out.
