House of Games is a wonderful multi-level movie. It's a shocking mystery and thriller. He is blessed by the wonderful performances of Lindsay Crouse and Joe Montegna, as well as a strong and powerful cast of players who support him, introducing Ricky Jay, an extraordinary extraordinary, prestigious and historic magic. His dialogue, written by David Mamet, is spoken of as a piece of manners and gives the film (in which reality is often in question) a further dimension of the unreality. On her face, the Games House is a wonderful visit to the unknown world of sadness and con man, diametrically different from The Sting, which was played for glamor and yuks only. At this level, admirable. However, you can not drop the exam at a deeper level of a woman's odyssey from a satisfying professional experience to an incredible force and self-realization. The only movie I know about dealing with the issue of the emergence of personal power in a trustworthy woman is private Benjamin. This funny film, unfortunately, diffuses attention, sneaking through several themes and exploiting Goldie Hawn's fine performance of following some laughs. The gaming house is in charge of his business. As Poe once said about a short story, she constantly leads to his conclusion. There is another strain of women's films, represented by Thelma and Louise, a great money-maker with the fabulous theme that women are condemned, whether or not they realize their inner powers. What a shame. You should usually see this movie in a cinema. It should be a natural event for film festivals. Nominate it for one next to you if you have the chance. I bought the original game house and gave it to my daughter for 23 years. Better should watch it on the TV than at all.
