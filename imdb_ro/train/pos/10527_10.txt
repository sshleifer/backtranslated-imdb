This is one of the best movies I have seen for years! I'm not a fan of Gwyneth Paltrow, but she's great like Emma Woodhouse. Alan Cumming is gorgeous as Reverand Elton, and Emma Thompson's sister, Sophie, is hysterical like Miss Bates. And check out the lovely Jeremy Northam as Mr. Knightley; what a gentleman! Who said you need sex and violence in a movie to do good has never seen Emma ever. I think that's what separates it from so many others - it's fashionable. If you are looking for a movie that you can watch with your whole family or look for a love story for you no further. Emma is this movie. With beautiful decoration, wonderful costumes and a remarkable casting (I mentioned the superbe Jeremy Northam?), Emma is a perfect ten!
