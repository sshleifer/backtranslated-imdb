I did not expect too much and, frankly, I did not like this movie the first time around, but I saw it again and I realized it was pretty cool. Sure, it's a joke, but it's funny. <br /> <br /> Someone posted that it could be better written and it could be. I think this movie had the potential of being my Christmas, Vinny. But with a horror host instead of a lawyer. Unfortunately, it's a scattered opportunity. With just a little more writing it could be a classic. Children are underused, there is no reason why they should close to Elvira. Except for obvious reasons. It would have been great to see their relationship flourish. I know it's a comedy, but the differences are small that separate the good brilliant films. Elvira herself is always fun and engaged. Not to mention flirting. Every time you smile. It's hard to beat a movie when the main character is so charming. And it's really her charm, do not let her show she's tricking you into thinking it's kind of a tart. Well, it is. But she's beautiful. The type of person you let him take care of. He would not let him cook for them, though ... I would recommend giving him a way. <br /> <br /> Just do not expect too much. She is more than a large set of tits. She is also an incredible pair of legs.
