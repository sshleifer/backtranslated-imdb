This was one of my favorite series when I was a kid. The Swedish broadcasting company has decided to broadcast it once again with a few summers when we are just finishing the first semester of the medical school. I was surprised to see the depth in which the organs were explained. Of course, some things are simplified, but most of them were correct (even if they were made 22 years ago!) And pretty easy to understand. I would suggest that all students who are going to be students of a doctor should look at them. It's a great way to learn some basic medical words, for example. Now I'm in the seventh semester and I think I'll watch the show once again as soon as I bought the DVD :-)
