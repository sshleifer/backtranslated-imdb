I'm not sure how I missed this when it first came out, but I'm glad I finally saw it. The film takes place in and around London's 19th-century Okabasho, Japan. It tells the story of prostitution, caste systems and women who are strong in a society based on the samurai code of force in Japan. It's unique, Akira Kurosawa! Even if he died before he could direct this film, he shows the adaptation of the script. His vision of the Japanese world and the caste system is renowned and draws attention to how these systems interact with each other. Characters can spin around each other, but the caste system remains intact when each character returns to the world they belong to. The samurai warrior who heads to the world of good and loved prostitutes returns to his life as he embarks on another road with a man who is part of his caste system, the smallest of the lowest. Many prize the world of samurai above all others, but still, the inhabitants of the lower caste can support each other and can love without restriction. The samurai in this film prove to be the weak, while class lovers prove to be honorable. <br /> <br /> The movie deserves a higher rating. It is a story about the survival of women in feudal Japan. During this time, men thought they were survivors ... the strong ones, while women thought they were just mindless and weak properties. This film highlights the power of Japanese women and how they did what they had for survival and how their power allowed the Japanese culture to continue as it does. We recommend "Sea is watched" for anyone who is a fan of Akira Kurosawa and even if I am not a fan. It's a wonderful, quiet and soulful film, and one that will be appreciated for any movie collection.
