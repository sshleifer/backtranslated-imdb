Errol Flynn is "Gentleman Jim" in this 1942 film about boxer Jim Corbett, known as the man who defeated John L. Sullivan. Directed with a good hand by Flynn's good friend Raoul Walsh, Alexis Smith, Jack Carson, Alan Hale Sr., William Frawley and Ward Bond. Flynn plays an ambitious, selfish young man who has a natural boxing talent and is sponsored by the Exclusive Olympic Club of San Francisco in the late 1800s. Although good, his nature is "a zealous Irish" and a social climber who raises resentment in members of the Olympic Club; most can not wait to see him losing a fight and bet against him. Despite this, he becomes famous, even as an actor. Eventually, he gets the chance he waited for, a match with world champion John L. Sullivan (Ward Bond). Sullivan requests a $ 10,000 deposit to make sure Corbett appears to fight for his $ 25,000 wallet. Corbett and the desperation of his manager (Frawley) to get the money. However, the aid comes as a very unlikely person. This is a very fun movie, and Jim Corbett is an excellent role for Flynn, who himself was a professional fighter at one time. Has the charm, appearance and athletics required for the role. Alexis Smith plays Victoria Ware, his romantic interest in insisting he hates her. In real life, it does not seem to have existed; Corbett was married to Olive Lake Morris between 1886 and 1895. The film focuses on Corbett and his career, rather than boxing history. Corbett used scientific techniques and innovation and is considered the man who made a rewarding battle with a form of art. In the film, Corbett has a foot fleet and avoids being hit by his opponents; is believed to have worn John L. Sullivan that way. Good movie to catch Flynn at the height of time too short as a superstar.
