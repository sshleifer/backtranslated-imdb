When I heard that Adrian Pasdar was shot in this film, my expectations that I was watching the whole movie were low. The only reasons I gave her a chance were the magnificent Julie Walters and the recommendation of a friend. What I thought was a big farce, "Mrs. Doubtfire," turned out to be a gentle and frightening comedy. Pasdar is entirely credible and empathetic as the ambitious businessman who needs to release the feminine part of his being by dressing on occasions. He conveys these needs to the public in a completely credible way. Julie Walters is magnificent, it's like her habit, like the house that teaches her unconditional love.
