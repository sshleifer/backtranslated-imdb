These things have been floating in my head for almost ten years. Some pieces of this work were truly memorable. - I love to see another more current example of cog-showy offy stuff. In fact, I would like to be part of it. If I had the chance to say just what I wanted and that is, I did not have to write all this in addition to doing "10 lines if the text" as this site requires. Do I really mean? Almost that discourages me, that's fortunately for the guys who made the movie I liked with Minds Eye - and it took me 3 times to have enough lines, I hope you did not get used to the nausea. - Yes.
