If you enjoy romantic comedies, then you will find this story of the two 30-year-old singles who fall in love with satisfying American fan races. On the other hand, if you are around waiting for Kill Bill Volume 3 or Sin City 2, then you probably should stay away. Dad has the obligatory guy met with girl friends, the girl meets the guy's friends and the guy meets the scenes of the girl's parents. There is even a guy who meets the scene of pet dogs. That's all about the course of a movie like this one. However, what I liked about this was that intrigue has entered the decision-making process that people do when they begin to realize that their romantic interest is not perfect and is, in fact, a little strange. The plot focuses around answering questions; how much strange is too much and how much love takes to trump the weird ones? It's interesting to see that the characters work because deep down (if we recognize), we all have quirks. Barrymore does a very good job in her role, and Fallon sorta surprised me - and he's good. I categorize 7 out of 10 as a romantic comedy. Add a point if you are a baseball fan or you are romantically involved with one. Add another point if you are a Red Sox fan and subtract two points if you are a Yankees fan.
