I saw The Bourne Ultimatum last summer with a friend and, wow! I've already seen the first two movies and I liked it, but the Ultimatum, I liked it. Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne, an amnesia that suffers the CIA agent on the run, trying to find out who he is. As I already said, I liked this movie from the beginning to the end, without plotting holes, slow scenes, everything was wrong even good and fits well with other movies, but in all ways it was much more good. <br /> <br /> The best stunts, the pursuit of cars, the actors and the effects I've seen in a movie action all summer (surprising because of Spider-Man 3, pirates, etc.) just action In this film, Jason not only kills and runs. He has a soul and the audience feels for him, so the drama is included. But that does not slow him down. Of the three "triple" that came out last summer, it was the best.
