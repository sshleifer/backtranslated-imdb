This movie has exceeded my expectations. I thought and heard it would be garbage, so I did not expect too much. However, I was pleasantly surprised. At first I did not feel good about the girl and did not care if she lived or died. After a while, she certainly grew up on me and became a nice character. It's not just a movie where people die for no reason. There is a background story that takes only a few seconds of the movie, but it explains a lot. I would recommend this movie to everyone. If you're not sure you see anyway, it's only an hour and a half of your life. You'll live 80 years, anyway.
