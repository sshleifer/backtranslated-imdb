In spite of some negative comments that this film has gathered on IMDb pages, it's worth a look, as this is a story about survival and camaraderie between two different men with different mentalities while on a difficult mission in the jungle Panamanian. /> Luu Llosa, the Peruvian director, leads us to watch this thriller set up in Panama. The film has some good moments because Beckett, the marine veteran, takes a newly arrived man, recently sent to try to remove a notorious drug chief and corrupt general army, who may be the next president of the country. The only problem, Miller, has no experience what he was entrusted with. Miller, the new arrogant man arrived in the jungle and the guerrilla war between the militaries and the drugs against the American infiltrating, finds a valuable lesson from Beckett. What looks good in theory is irrelevant in the jungle. Tom Berenger is an actor who does not record too much, as demonstrated in this film, but in the context of the film, he is right as a man of a few words. Billy Zane plays Miller does what he can with a role that does not allow any glory to the crucial end. For movie action lovers, "Sniper" offers a 112 minute action that, with a bit of trimming, would have made a more satisfying film.
