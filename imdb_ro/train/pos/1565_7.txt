I just saw Saint Saint Strikes Back for the first time and I found it pretty good. This was the first appearance of George Sanders as Saint, where he replaced Louis Hayward. In this case, the Saint is sent to San Francisco to investigate a nightclub shot. With the help of his knowledge, Inspector Fernack, who descended from New York, helped a daughter of a crime boss. Together with Sanders in the cast are Wendy Barrie and Jonathan Hale. <br /> It's not a bad Saint movie. I recommend you to see. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
