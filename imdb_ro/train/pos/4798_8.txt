This is not a movie for fans of ordinary Lynch stuff. Rather, it is for those who appreciate either a good story or have been tired of things that have taken place with obvious sentimentality and Oprah-ish "It's such a wonderful movie! You have to see it!" - semantic she is right, for once!). The story unfolds perfectly and we are taken along a journey that, I think, most of us will come to recognize it at some point. A compassionate, existentialistic journey, in which we turn our attention to our past, when we are nearing our inevitable death. The action is without mistakes, the cinema is the same (occasionally quite brilliant!), And the dialogue leaves enough for the spectator to understand the details of the story. A hot movie. Not overly sentimental.
