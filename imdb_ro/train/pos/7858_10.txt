TESS OF STORM COUNTRY is probably the best film of all Mary Pickford's movies. Two hours, it was long enough for a silent film of 1922, but still keeps your interest 80 years after filming. Mary gives one of the best performances from time to time, the role seems to be a "hit with the greatest hits", with pieces of innocent Mary, Mary the little devil, Maria mother, Mary spitfire, Maria romantic heroine, etc. were used during a single movie in the past. The film is surprisingly sincere about an illegitimate child of a supporting character for 1922, and at some point our little Mary is considered the crazy mother in question! If the Academy Awards were held in 1922, no doubt the best Oscar actress for the year would have been Mary's.
