A child with ideals who are trying to change things around him. A boy who is forced to become a man because of the system. A system that hides the truth and violates the rights of existence. A boy who, inspired by Martin Luther King, stands up and tells the truth. A family that breaks apart and struggles against it. A movie from which you can not hide. See things and hear things and feel the things that until the day you die we hope never happened. Violence, frustration, abuse of power, parents who can not do anything, and a boy with, I'm sorry, balls, a boy who will not accept things that will not let anything happen to him, a child with power and a child who acts as a pro, as if he has done nothing else, has made this movie to the end and anyone who wants to see how the abuse was found in the 1960s.
