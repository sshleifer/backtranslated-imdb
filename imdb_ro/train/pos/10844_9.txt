This reminded me of Spinal Tap at a more serious level. It's the story of a troop making a reunion tour, but things are not harmonious between them. I was particularly impressed with Bill Nighy's show like Ray. You felt bad about him, but he had a certain anger about him. It's a great movie that you watch if you've ever seen your favorite band, flying, old and pathetic.Bittersweet, highly recommended.
