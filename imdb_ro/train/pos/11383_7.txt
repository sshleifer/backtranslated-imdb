This is a good music with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a pleasant "Parisien" atmosphere that gives the movie a lot of charm but in terms of a story ... well it's not even there . Or at least not very well worked. The act is also not so smooth by Caron. But I liked some dialogues, I liked the scene in Seine, I liked the character played by the Levant, the colors; and dance, of course, which is quite magnificent. A 7.5 to 8 seems to be just for me.
