Is it ironic that in the 1950s, when Douglas Sirk was the most successful audience, was virtually ignored by critics? Is he now seen, however, as a director of the formidable intellect who has done his best work in melodrama? "Writing in the wind" is about the collapse of a Texan oil dynasty, surrounded by a worthless reputation, alcoholism and nymphomania? It's about the fatal, fatal connections between sex, power and money ... Stack draws a convincing portrait of a tormented beat destroyed by frustration, arrogance, jealousy, madness and some deep insecurity? ? Dorothy Malone manages to make an attractive, sexually sexually appealing woman degrade for Hudson and other peoples in the city? The best line: "I'm dirty." In a frenetic scene, we see it trembling, trembling and sweating in a provocative mambo? In another one weeping alone over an oil model at his father's office, a symbol of excessive wealth and masculine tyranny? The frenetic atmosphere is so tasty and intensified by the magnificent use of colors, lights, and the careful use of mirrors?
