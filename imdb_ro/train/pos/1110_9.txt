I think you should be from the US to get a lot of jokes. But if you liked Princess Bride and Forest Gump, you wanted this movie. You can not compare the quality of the filming with those of course, but the journey with the cameraman was obviously intentional. Killer Tomatoes is a hundred times better than Dynamite Nepolean. Just my opinion. I'm sure the people of France would not appreciate the French caricatures. So this movie is not for a world audience. And while I'm not a trained film critic, I know what I like. I could not help laughing at the whole movie. My faces and my jaw made me sick at the end of the movie.
