I have to say I liked the point of escape. I saw the original and this is a pretty good remake of it. Even if it did not follow the original story (that's why I gave it 8 out of 10) it was still pretty good and it's probably a better story. As for the car, the DJ's final comment on the Challenger that goes in 185 mph in bulldozers is quite unlikely (and if you look, the speedometer needle turned to 145-150), but even if I did not seen on the engine in one of the early scenes where the engine shows, the original story had an overloaded Hemi, so it's possible. For those who say aerodynamics will not normally allow, the Chrysler 300C aspiration today can reach 168 km / h, and if you look at that, go on a highway with it is like pushing a wall brick by wind at 70 mph. In addition, in a wind tunnel test, if you put a Challenger airbrush, it would probably be more aerodynamic.
