I am surprised that many viewers have more respect for the continuation of this brilliant film ... I have seen all guinea pigs and this is easily the best. Even if I saw "" I still have doubts about those 35 minutes of pure torture: so strong. A 10 out of 10, because this movie has achieved perfectly what it wanted to do: be the best fake movie ever made.
