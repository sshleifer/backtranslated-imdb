These types of movies about young teenagers who struggled with their own sexuality were something unique, daring and daring a few years ago, but more and more movies like this have been done over the past few years, making them hard to keep the films under control. Also, this film has received little publicity besides the regular film festivals that featured this small French film, as well as the great festivals that have always loved these little films about common topics that are not treated too often in movies. The film premiered in Cannes in 2007 and actually won awards there. The film does not really differ from the others, since it's actually something new, once you've already seen some similar films like this, but that does not really mean that "Naissance des pieuvres "it's a bad thing to watch. The film is certainly a good watch, dealing with its subject well and telling its story constantly and therefore also effectively, at a rather slow French cinema. It is an age film that focuses on the life of mainly 3 teenagers altogether. Sexuality is a great theme in the film, which is delicate and subtle. His film and story are generally quite realistic, though probably a little predictable because the film does not offer much original in its genre. This type of French film is likely to scare a lot of people because it probably expects to be very artised with deep layers and meanings to it. "Naissance des pieuvres" is, however, a very accessible film for everyone and indeed you do not have to be in Euro-teen movies to appreciate this movie. It is a kind of sweet and somewhat sensual film because of its subjects and the visual approach. The film is also made realistic by its actors, who did not have and have a lot of experience in the business movie, but they are authentic look and feel in their roles. Strong individual characters give the film some beautiful themes and good moments. A good movie on his theme. <br /> <br /> 7/10
