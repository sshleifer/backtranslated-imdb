He went around the TV and HBO showed a double beat of incredibly terrible medical conditions, so I went back to my twin sister and said, "Hey, that's kind of fun," - I really like documentaries - so we started to look at it. At first I thought Jonny Kennedy was a young man, but then explained that because of his condition he never went through puberty, so the tall voice and the smaller body. He was on a crusade to raise money for his cause. He had the most wonderful sense of humor, combined with a beautiful sense of spirituality ... I cried, I looked more, I laughed, got up to get another Kleenex, then I cried more. Once Jonni Kennedy's time got up, he flew to heaven to be with the angels. He was more than ready; he had learned the lessons of this life and was free. I strongly recommend this. Unless you fall in love with this guy, you have no heart.
