Best-selling Cheryl novelist Cheryl (a solid and sympathetic interpretation of wonderful Virginia Bryant), her husband Tom (boyfriend Paolo Serra) and their son Bobby (beautifully played by Patrizio Vinci) go to a remote castle located in the countryside vacation summer. The local legend claims the area is cursed. Cheryl discovers a creepy, hairy, ugly monk (David Flosi's defeat in an amazingly hideous suit) living in the basement. Cheryl must overcome his fear of childhood, deep in childhood, of the beast, to overcome the wrong finding. Director / co-writer Lamberto Bava makes an expert work to create and sustain a wonderful and disturbing mood. Moreover, Bava avoids the standard bloodstream routine for a fascinating and challenging fable of how the best way to overcome what scares us is to face the head of the source. Sabrina Ferilli's solid assistance is Anna's teacher friend, Stefania Montorsi as hottie Maria and Alex Serra as the painter Dario. Gianfranco Transunto has a glossy cinematographic picture that offers some fluid tracking photos and plenty of excellent atmospheric illumination. Fabrizio Sforza of frosted make-up f / x, Simon Boswell's spooky spooky'n'shuddery score, and the dark, darkened cellar covered with spider webs that hit the skin with the face to the ground. It's worth watching.
