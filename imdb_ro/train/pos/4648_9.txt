Funny, evocative, confusing, shining film. It reminds me of Bunuel's L'Age D'Or or Jodorowsky's Holy Mountain - a lot of strange characters who were fighting and looking ... what is it? I laughed almost all the way, always taking a peripheral eye on the astonished and occasionally terrified reactions of the audience that surrounded me in the theater. Directing through and through, from the beginning to the intestines and poisonous poisoning all the way to the end if it is an end. I just want to remember every detail. She sometimes haunts me. Honestly, however, I only have the most positive memories of this film. Because he does not seem to be available to take home and look, I think I'll have to wait a few more years until Crispin Glover comes back with his Big Slide Show (and the next screen "What's it?"). I saw this movie in Atlanta almost as soon as I was involved in a rather devastating car accident, so I was a little astonished at the time, which was probably a good thing to follow the prophetic arthropods talking and retarded in superhero costumes and divine Glover, in the right setting of Q, expensive gaskets clothed from the floor like a dreamy DADAist dream. Is it a statement about Life as we know it? Of course everyone expects to be just that. I rather think the truth is more obvious in absences and in the negative space. What you do not tell us is what we have to infer, but it is much more valid than the lies that other people feed us day by day. Rather a "WHAT IS?" than 5000 movies such as "Titanic" or "Sleepless in Seattle" (shudder, gag, groan). Thank you, Mr. Glover (in addition, a fun man to watch on screen or at the Big Slide Show - smart, fun, quirky, and hot scandal). Make more movies, write more books, keep the nightmare alive.
