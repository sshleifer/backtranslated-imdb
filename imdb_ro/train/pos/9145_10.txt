The Prince plays the role of "Kid" in the semi-autobiographical film of a talented but narcissistic musical young man who has a lesser life than the star. True, the act leaves a tad to be desired (stopping on Morris Day and especially on Clarence Williams, which are both perfect steps), but the movie is still great and among the best to get out of the 1980s. the best soundtrack of any movie in the past 50 years, highly rated lines, and the dumpster scene is HILARIOUS! Plus Apollonia is simply STUNNING. On an incoherent, when I saw the Prince in concert, in 2004, he burst into the stadium. He is a show expert and was one of the best concerts we have ever experienced. <br /> <br /> My class: A Extra: DVD 1) Comment with director Albert Magnoli, producer Robert Cavallo and director of photography Donald Thorin; Theatrical trailer; Trailers for "Under the Cherry Moon" and "Grafitti Bridge" Disc 2) A 12-minute presentation on First Avenue Club; "Riffs, Raffs and Revolution: The Impact and Influence of the Violent Rain," 10 minutes, 30 minutes of MTV Premiere Music Princess Movies (Go Crazy, Take Me Up When Doves Cry I Could Die 4 U / Baby are a star and purple rain); by The Time (Jungle Love and the Bird) and a music video for "Sex Shooter" by Apollonia 6 Eye candy: Apollonia looks good
