James Stewart plays in a classic Western revenge story, which is linked to the fate of the other Winchester stars. Stewart is excellently understood by adding a heavy cold obsession to his usual cowboy stretched back. The story follows the fate of a Winchester kid and his owners after being won in a competition by our hero and stolen from the man he is hunting. We meet a selection of players, fighters, Indian merchants and bankers as we follow the rifle course through Indian battles, beatings of banks, etc. The support bracket is solid with Dan Durya standing like Waco Johnny Dean, live wire gun with a trigger finger. Also, as a note of trivia a very early appearance from Rock Hudson as an Indian boss. Ultimate demonstration is a classical tense rifle fight fought remotely in and around a rocky outcrop. Throw away old old-fashioned action, punch fights, shooting and riding hikers for a Western adventure. 8/10
