I'm a big fan of John Denver. I have a great collection of vinyl music. I saw this Christmas special when it was originally on TV and I loved it. I have the original vinyl album and CD. I have the original CD and the later version. In the later version, some songs are missing. I see it was released this year with all the original songs. To my surprise, I found the original CD for sale at $ 75.00. WOW - to think that a Christmas CD would be worth it. For me, no amount deserves to sell this treasure. It's my favorite CD for Christmas. I have never managed to find VHS or DVD. I'd love to have some version. If someone has one available, let us know. Thanks
