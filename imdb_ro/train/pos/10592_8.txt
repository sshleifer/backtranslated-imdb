The joyful story of the Pimlico community in London, which, after the explosion of an unexploded bomb, has found a Royal Charter that says the area they live in is part of Burgundy. This movie works because it appeals to the fantasy that many of us have to make our own rules and we do not have to listen to them. A strong distribution of Britons, especially Stanley Holloway, makes this more credible. There are some very beautiful moments in the movie, like when people fled supplies and other Londoners on the other side of the barricade start throwing food and other things on them. Even if you've always known that Pimlico will be back in the UK, the people of Pimlico and, as a result, the spectator has no mind when this happens, leaving a happy happiness happy. It is amazing to think that these low-budget films from a small studio in London remain so popular over fifty years later. Manufacturers must have had something right.
