This documentary (now available for free on Video.Google.Com) is a fantastic demonstration of the power of ordinary people to overcome injustice. Everyone needs to see this. Chavez was elected in a slippery vote in 1998. His platform was to deviate the fantastic wealth of middle class oil from 20% to 80% of the poor. He banned alien fishing in Venezuelan waters. He sent 10,000 Cuban doctors to the slums to treat the patients for free. He erased illiteracy and set up new free universities. But it was his 30% tax on the oil company's profits that confused him with the Bush administration. In 2002, while Irish films Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain interviewed Chavez in the Presidential Palace about his social programs, a CIA-led coup hit was launched. With the chambers, Chavez was captured and flew out of the country. On national television it was announced that he "resigned". But the poor in Venezuela did not believe in the media. They went to the palace in their millions and demanded that Chavez be returned. In front of such overwhelming numbers, the military turned to the state coup leaders and the platoons fled to the US. Chavez was rescued by the military helicopter and returned to jubilation.
