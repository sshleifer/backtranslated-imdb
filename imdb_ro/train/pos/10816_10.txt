No, it should not be a big budget glow, but it is brilliant in itself. you have to look at what it is, a low-budget masterpiece that involves a zombie rapist who has a 12-inch love rod that keeps him away. those who came to give this film a low review were probably looking for the next classic or hidden "worship" as they say and simply did not get there. I like how everybody points out obvious observations, like the "5-cent child attached to a fish pole" hahaha, okay, yes. I do not think a movie with a budget like this could allow "actors" or "good" so they worked with what they had. courage and entrails were actually very convincing. the movie was a bit tangled from sequence to sequence, but overall, this is one of the best movies I've seen lately, not following any trend or predictability. very good for a laugh.
