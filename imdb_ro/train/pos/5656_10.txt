I would never remember the name of this show. I use to see him when I was 8 years old. I remember that I was late when I did not think of watching the show. It was the best show for me. From what I remember, it's still great. This showed that he played with Lucas Black, making him the first boy I ever had. I'm from the country, therefore boys with an accent have no appeal to me, but for him I would definitely make an exception. What after seeing Crazy in Alabama, Fridays Friday and Tokyo Drift should see why. He's a great actor and has been since he was a kid. I miss this show and want to come back. If anyone ever sees where the season is selling, send me an email. kywildflower16@hotmail.com
