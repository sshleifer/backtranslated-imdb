This film is not just about a shooting school, in fact, never seen it. But that just adds to the power of this movie. These are people and how they are confronted with the tragedy. I know it was shown to students who survived Columbine filming and offered a sense of closure to many of them. The actor is superb. All three main actors (Busy Phillips, Erika Christensen and Victor Garber) are excellent in their roles ... I recommend this movie to everyone. It's one of those movies that makes you talk about it after you see it. It challenges not only school shots, but human emotions and reactions to all forms of tragedy. It's a scandal, but it's worth it and one will look again from time to time
