One of the last big musicians in the 1960s. I was 7 years old when I saw this movie and since then has always been a favorite. The musical numbers are memorable. In the 1960s, musicians actually had a musical talent (unlike a CERTAIN Academy Award nominee of current music, located in a big city in the city center). All of the main roles have been thrown away ... Ron Moody shines like Fagin, like Shani Wallis like Nancy. Oliver Reed was a threatening Bill Sikes (who, fortunately, has no musical numbers, lol), and Mark Lester as Oliver and Jack Wild as Dodger were also great. Mark Lester meets like an innocent, what Dickens wanted when he wrote the book! Then, of course, there are dozens of dancers who behave in "consider yourself", "I would do anything", "who will buy" and "be soon", many who were children! This is a great show for the whole family.
