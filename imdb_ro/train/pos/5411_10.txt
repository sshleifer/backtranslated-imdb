I do not see the point of burying a film like this in sulfuric sarcasm, if it is in no way meant to be anything other than a vehicle to entertain children and prepare them for the next commodity line to beg in crazy way. /> <br /> This is a fun movie. My children sat quietly in the whole thing and loved each minute. Okay, the bastard is a little bit over his head with his stupid and manic costume, but this is a lot easier to take than a dark, gloomy and very morbid Pokemon. My kids have been watching Pokemon since they started and they are heading for the ages to "take off childish things" and move to others. I'm glad we have to enjoy this together.
