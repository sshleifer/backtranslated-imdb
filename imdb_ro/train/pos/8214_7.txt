Dirty Inspector Harry Callahan shakes his superiors once again with his maverick approach to police work. Refusing to take a vacation is given a simple case that takes him outside of San Francisco. However, he soon discovers a link between a recent murder in the city and a murder outside the city, which leads him to the trail of a revenge killer. As an entry into the Dirty Harry franchise, the film begins with some very promising moments, including the legendary "Continue, Make Me Your Day" line, that Eastwood offers wonderful teeth themselves before hindering a robbery alone. Very bad and even what fans can expect from him. However, the film is changing speed and focuses on the mysterious revenge killer. The problem is that this killer is not as mysterious as to be as much as Harry. This really distracted the presence of the main character who led all of his earlier film appearances with, forgive the paper, Magnum Force. On the brilliant side, this new story draws more parallel to Harry's own unorthodox methods and gives him the profound depth that was not there before, but fans who were looking for another Harry party are more than likely disappointed. However, a tense climax concludes the movie in an interesting note, so if you do not mind a little different, it's a good movie for fans. --- 7/10 <br /> <br /> R rated for violence and rape scene
