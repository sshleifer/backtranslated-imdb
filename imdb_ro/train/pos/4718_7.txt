This film was created in Hungary I think. anyway, the countryside is superb, the people who play the farmers people have been totally fascinated. their horsemanship is wonderful. I entered more into the native people, in the life of the farm and how heroic they tried to hide Brady from the evil Nazis who, in search of these paratroopers. They even sacrificed their lives in several situations. the young orphan boy that Brady is friends of was a sweet child. you will marvel at the riding that I believe, and the action of trying to evade the Nazis. is fun and comic in some places and very tragic in others. Ladies can help, because you will be devastated at the end. I own it, and I followed it several times. in other words, not just a simple move. a goalkeeper ....
