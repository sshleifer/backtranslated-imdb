This is probably one of the worst movies ever made. It's terrible. But it is so good! Perhaps it is better if you do not forget that you are waiting for an aggressive plot and something fantastically smart and fun, because you will be disappointed. However, if you want to watch it to see 50 million pots and the fantastic hair of Goro / Bad English, you are looking for a real treat. The more you think about the movie, the worse, unless you have a contest to observe most holes / holes, in which case you have entertainment time. I would really recommend this movie for bored fans or those who face Smap. And even then, the latter should be a little attentive, because Japanese Goro fans were a little upset about it, they thought they were selling. (It was not even when Johnny Kitagawa (who was the executive producer) can do that for him).
