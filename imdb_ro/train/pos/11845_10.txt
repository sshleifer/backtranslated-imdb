I really do not like both Shrek movies. (Since both "PGs" have words in them I would never say, so I did not like it.) But when it comes to "The Spirit: The Stallion of the Cimarron", which just barely watched for the first time past, I've become a fan of animated movies other than Pixar. *** Spoilers ahead *** In "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron", a horse is born and eventually becomes his head heard. One night, he sees a strange light in the distance and heads toward him. This action ultimately leads to its capture, and more. Throughout the movie, we hear a story. It is through the thoughts of Spirit, though the horses never speak. This is what makes the movie so goo. They (filmmakers) have recognized true horses to make sounds made by horses; none of these sounds was made by humans. <br /> <br /> Spirit meets the rain, a beautiful sea, and Little Creek, a native american who owns the rain. Little Creek later releases Spirit and rain, they go home. I have never been a great fan of Brian Adams, but I intend to buy the soundtrack of this movie in the near future. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie and you will not regret it. My score: 10/10
