The Wizards of the Lost Kingdom is a film about a young prince (Simon) who is banished from his kingdom because his father (the king) was killed by the "evil advisor" of the clich√©. This movie is about Simon's adventures. The special effects, the plot, the action and, in general, all about this movie is BAD. However, it is so bad that it is fun. You will watch this movie simply because it is so bad that it is funny and, as the other commentator of the movie said, it is so bad that it is good.
