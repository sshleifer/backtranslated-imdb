The entire 10-15 minute presentation is done in a very non-threatening and non-medical way, which even pretentious children can easily understand. It scatters many of the myths surrounding menstruation that were happening in those days (1946). While sex is not explicitly mentioned, the part about fertilization is. It is also supposed that the first Hollywood production will ever use the word "vagina" in the dialogue. It's cute how the animated character is shown topless in the shower in a purely animated manner with no defining feature, as was the way of the day. Many of Betty Boop's cartoons showed her naked without revealing any defining aspect. Max Fleischer was a bit of a card and did so with many of the drawings on Betty Boop that required frame-by-frame viewing to find them. There is no mention at the beginning or end of the film about who the female narrator is. In fact, there are no credits other than those mentioned by Kotex and Kimberly-Clark Corporation. This title is almost impossible to achieve; but for those who are Bittorrent downloads, it can be found there in the ether. This is one of those "keepers" that will become more and more difficult to find, as the shorter topics of the subject fade into obscurity.
