Actually, this movie was not that bad. It contains action, comedy and excitement. There are good actors in this movie, such as Doug Hutchison (Percy from The Green Mile), who plays Bristol. Another known actor is Jamie Kennedy from "Scream" and "Three Kings". The main characters are played by Jamie Foxx as Alvin, who was pretty good and funny but the one who surprised me most was David Morse as Edgar Clenteen. He has a character different from the usual, because in other films such as "The Green Mile", "Indian Runner", "The Negotiator" or "The Langoliers" plays a very sympathetic person, and in the "Bait" without emotion, which was nice to see. The only negative thing about this movie is that there are several pictures of the World Trade Center, which makes this film look a bit dated. I generally thought it was a pretty good movie!
