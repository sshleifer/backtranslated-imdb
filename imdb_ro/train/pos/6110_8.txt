Like "My Sassy Girl," this film is based on a true story posted on the internet, but there is similarity. The story generally refers to this rebellious guy called Ji-Hoon (Kwon Sang Woo), who is still trying to finish high school, whose parents hire a guardian named Su-Wan (Kim Ha Neul), but it happens or the same age as he is. Add to them some obstacles, martial arts (the thugs are always after Ji-Hoon for revenge), a despicable girl, lost in love, who is after him, his inclination to take the lessons, and generally you can guess the whole story. Did I say it's a romantic comedy? This film has some good scenes of battle, visible humor and a lot of emotions, thanks to the good chemistry between Kim Ha Nuel and Kwon Sang Woo, which bring a lot of energy to the story. Romantic elements also work for this reason. And I have to say that I would like a friend more like Kim Ha Nuel than the girl from "My Sassy Girl" (at least personality). She has some lovers, but she's more on the cute, sweet and hearty path. Characters are already full of love (so it could be said that he had less than one hill to climb than "My Sassy Girl" - an obstacle that worked for that film for his credit) and the movie is smart enough and interesting for most of the time. However, the story is about two-thirds of the way (where it changes on a familiar fare where nothing really happens), but near the end it resumes a bit again. Generally, a fun, funny movie. 8/10
