It's not a bad movie. In a way, I was made to actually root for the Iranians to win the game played in the film, even if they know nothing about football and I'm not a fan. The end of the bus was extraordinary. The film itself deals with the issue of women in Iran and the way they are not allowed to enter sports arenas among men because their oath is inadequate for women to hear. Despite this law, some women try to sneak, but many are caught and detained. It is truly amazing that any society may still have such old-fashioned notions. In an interview, Panahi says his films are documents of his history and injustices and that one day we will be able to watch these films and see how Iran once lived. We hope the future will come sooner than later.
