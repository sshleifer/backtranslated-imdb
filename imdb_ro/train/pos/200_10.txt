Updated from a previous comment. Marion Davies, great and underestimated, presents her comedy in this late comedy (1928), featuring the wonderful William Haines. Davies plays a game in Georgia that collapses in Hollywood with the help of Haines, a small player in brutal comedies. They appear together in cheap comedies until Marion is "discovered" and becomes a great dramatic star. A great lamp on Hollywood and its claims. Davies & Haines are a wonderful team and guests from Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glyn, Norma Talmadge, Mae Murray, Rod LaRocque, Leatrice Joy, Dorothy Sebastian, Estelle Taylor, Louella Parsons, Renee Adoree, Aileen Pringle and Marion Davies (you have to see it) are a hohot. A necessity for any serious movie bravo or anyone interested in Marion Davies still stabbed! Dell Henderson interprets his father. Polly Moran is a maid. Paul Ralli is a thin man. It was shown that SHOW PEOPLE used Gloria Swanson's career as a model (I think Mae Murray is closer). Davies and Swanson were friends. But the story of this film parallel to Swanson's rise from Mack Sennett's comedies with a drum with Charlie Chaplin at STAR in Cecil B. DeMille's film from late teens and early twenties. Davies and Haines were huge MGM stars and friends. Strange that MGM has never talked about. They are wonderful together! A beautiful story and a delightful paradise from the beginning of Hollywood. Greta Garbo and Bebe Daniels are mentioned, but do not appear.
