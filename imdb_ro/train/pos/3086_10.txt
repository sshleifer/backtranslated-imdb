Here, Italy (I write from Venice). Why was it canceled? ABC should have given it the chance to build an audience. The prize (with Hope Davis, Campbell Scott, Erika Christensen, Zoe Saldana, Jay Hernandez, and Bridget Moynahan) is one of the best I've ever seen. We need more shows like this, which makes viewers feel like intelligent people, not mindless drones. I hope ABC reconsider its decision or another post will pick it up.
