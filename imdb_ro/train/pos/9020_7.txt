Flight theory is an interesting character study of an artist (Branagh) who is struggling to get away from boredom and mediocrity and a sick patient finished (Bonham-Carter) in the final stages of the ASL, limited to a wheelchair, wishing to make love with a man before he dies. Helena Bonham-Carter emanates spirit, defiance and independence as an ASL patient who is basically dependent on the people around her to take care of her. <br /> <br /> Kenneth Branagh, condemned by the community service to participate in her care, complements Helena's charm with painful melancholy, creating a sentimental and compelling love story where two people try to help each other for to find the way to happiness before time runs out.
