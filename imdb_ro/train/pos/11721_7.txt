Magnetism radiated by Elvira, attracting his legions of devoted admirers, has a prime quality. With a long, well-toned figure, with large busts, harmless harmony, and the silhouette of a silk bag in the valley of the generation, Elvira's character has a universal and timeless appeal. Being an aspiring folklorist and an intriguing individual interested in the structure of the story, it is obvious that the Elvira character has some archetypal elements that help transform the character into a story more than a sum of horns and big chests. As it was initiated by the way the city's children react, it represents the deep teenage fantasy of an experienced woman who can connect to them with their level: a strange mixture of one-dimensional romantic desire, boyish sexual desire and the desire for fun - slight mildness. It symbolizes an underdeveloped ideal of a woman for boys and a source of power for girls in the city. Other adults have problems with her for the same reasons. Eventually, however, her film can not move by passing more ingredients from the camp. The end result is that while Elvira is infinitely interesting, her film is limited by how poor her presentation is to her talent. Almost everything is adapted to a teenage mentality, and although it is a simple comedy, only those who can still process information with a young man's mind will be able to enjoy nonsense. Fortunately, I have such a skill and found the movie as a delightful charm. Best citation: Bob Redding: How's your head? Elvira: I have no complaints.
