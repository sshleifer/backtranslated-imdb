"A Mouse in the House" is a very classic Tom & Jerry cartoon, faithful to their tradition, but with jokes on their own. It's hysterical, hilarious, very fun and pretty funny. Artworks are of good quality. <br /> <br /> This short is not just about Tom trying to catch Jerry. Butch lives in the same house and tries to catch the mouse, because "there will be only a cat in this house in the morning - and that's the cat catching the mouse." <br /> <br /> If you ask me, there are many funny gags in this cartoon. The funniest thing for me is when Mammy Two Shoes sees two lazy sleeping cats and says sarcastically: "I'm glad you're enjoying siesta," and hoping they're happy because it's not, making two cats throw in air. Another funny gag is when Tom hides like Mammy Two Shoes and hits Butch with a skillet and then Butch does the same trick with Tom. Of course, even more fun than this is when the real Mamma comes in two shoes, and both cats think they see each other disguised as a mother and then both attack her "back" - lol. Of course he gets angry and, once he gets angry, there is no one to trouble himself. But even Jerry does not win this time, because he's also expelled from her.
