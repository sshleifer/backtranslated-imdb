TRILOGIA BEAVER is undoubtedly one of the brightest movies ever made. I was fortunate enough to capture it along with a question and answer session with director Trent Harris at the NY Video Festival a few years ago and then I bought a copy from Trent's website. This movie must be seen to be believed! Honestly, we recommend looking for Trent's name on the web and buying the movie on his site. He's an incredibly nice guy to make his boot. Do not be mistaken: The cameraman in the fictional sections of BEAVER TRILOGY IS NOT Trent! After I have seen TRILOGIA a few times, I have to admit that I could do it without Sean Penn Version. It's like a trial version for Crispin Glover's "Orkly Kid" section and it's more interesting as an element of curiosity if you're a Penn fan than being a good movie. Penn is pretty funny though, and you can see the big stars in this B & W movie. It's probably one of Crispin Glover's best roles and I'd love to see a documentary about Groovin "Gary original. Once you've seen this movie, you'll never have Gary's nervous laugh at your head.
