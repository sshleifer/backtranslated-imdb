This is one of my favorite sports videos. Dennis Quaid moves and convinces a man who gives up his dream of being a baseball pitcher when his arm kicked out. As a high school coach, he challenges his players to win the division championship, telling them he will try a baseball team if they do. They win (partly because of all the beating practices they take with a coach who can exceed 90 miles an hour), and keep their bargain - and it's signed! <br /> <br /> If you've ever decided to try something new and frightening as an adult, Jim Morris's story will resonate with you. It moves and draws inspiration, and man's relationships are true. <br /> <br /> Inspiration is not the only reason I have rented this one, though. Dennis Quaid is simply purdy in the side, and a baseball movie with a nice handsome man who changes a diaper is my idea of ​​heaven. Ladies, if you feel how they do it, check this out.
