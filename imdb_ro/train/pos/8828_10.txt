I was so glad I came across this short film. I am always so disappointed that short shots are hard to come by, so when I saw this and I saw that she was nominated for Live Action at the Academy Awards, I was so pleased I actually had a movie which I have for an incursion. The plot is quite simple, the director, writer and star Nacho Vigalondo have tried to come up with a reason why people would suddenly burst into a number of songs and dances, as they do in the movie musicals. The result is extremely fun and the song is really very appealing. It's a well made, well-edited short film, and the actors do a great job. And the last film of the movie is perfect. I recommend this film.
