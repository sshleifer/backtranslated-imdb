This movie was an interesting Hollywood movie on the novel by the same name by Pearl S. Buck. While some today may think it is full of racial stereotypes, since the very idea of ​​Chinese protagonists has been progressive in itself. I found that the white actors playing in Chinese were not as bad as I expected, that it was not the Asian equivalent of blacks. At that time there were no actor actors in America (even George Takei did not act), and Rainer did a good job of her. It was not the greatest performance I've ever seen, but for the role of the old school pre-method it was nice. The Acacia scene was very well shot and contained convincing special effects. I was wondering that the moment of launching the film during the Great Depression transforms this film into an allegory. Particularly the political upheaval that astonishes peasant farmers and how they seem to be left behind. The film had some parallels with John Ford's style, but I think eastern influence has also affected her. If it were a Western family, locusts would have won in the end, punishing the farmer for his pride, lust, and greed. However, here he learns his lesson, then he wins.
