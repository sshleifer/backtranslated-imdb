I am surprised that nobody has yet mentioned that there are two versions of the same movie. Most of the film on both sides is identical, but here they differ: in a version (the version we most often saw in the TV show), the group of clergy guarding the gateway consists of the "Protector Brotherhood" , a fictitious group of priests and brothers "excommunicated" by the Church. In the other version, which we have just seen on television, clergy who guard the gate are described as priests of the official Church, that is, the Archbishopric of New York (or maybe Brooklyn). Also in the earlier version, in most relevant scenarios, the clergy are called "brothers" (and in some scenarios, you can see where the lips say "the Father" so-called, but the double sound says "Brother" so and so. the latest version, I think everyone is called "Father." In any case, it seems that one of these two versions is more or less partial re-shooting the other with all the "Brotherhood of the Protector" scenes re-shot as (Remind me of Raymond Burr's scenes with "Godzilla") versions of the TV show, so no, I can not imagine this. Can anyone see more light on the story behind these two versions of the film?
