The silent film, Pride of the Clan with Mary Pickford, had to be set on a fictional island off the coast of Scotland. In fact, most of the outer films were filmed in Marblehead Massachusett, Marblehead Neck, near some rocky coastal geographic areas, including Churn and Castle Rock. My initial interest in the film was due to two factors: 1) the location of Marblehead in my hometown and 2) the fact that my grandfather Lizzette M. Woodfin was hired as a stand-in for Mary Pickford during the filming of May many rock scene scenes. Both women had a small stature, and father and grandmother reported that she was standing with her back to the rock scene room as part of the Chiefton shooting set. I just wanted to tell this story to future film historians and boys. The film itself (my DVD copy is somewhat poor) is very well done with a lot of expressive action and action, including several scenes where Miss Pickford portrays a strong female characterization. I liked it and I would like to get a better copy of it, though I'm not sure if there are, as we have seen in different movie sites, that the rest of the children are dark because of the damage. A very beautiful movie of the silent kind with a lot of action!
