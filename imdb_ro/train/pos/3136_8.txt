A strangely pleasant effort, combining a plot properly, involving Adam and Burt, and flashbacks to the original television series. Most retrospective scenes were taken directly from Burt Ward's book "Boy Wonder: My Life in Tights," and I imagine his book was the inspiration for making this film. Like the book, it left fans in the original series hungry for more. If you missed this broadcast, it is certainly worth the effort to borrow a tape from a friend who could have recorded it. I'm making a copy for the kids right now.
