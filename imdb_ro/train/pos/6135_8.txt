Bedknobs & Broomsticks is still one of Disney's masterpieces. It was filmed with animation sequences, actors and actresses that interact with animations. (A similar concept was used in Mary Poppins when children and Mary disappear into the art of sidewalks.) I am especially rated this movie through the eyes of the baby because I have not seen it for years. Back then, it was one of my favorite movies. It was magical and mystical, and the last scenes (the conflict starting with the ghostly armor going into battle) were my favorites. There has also been a lot of stop-animation used with spells (for example, people turn into rabbits), which can be a bit dated and silly now. (I also think the movie starts slowly.) Through the eyes of a child, this is a fun movie and it's easy for kids to put their children in the movie. It's an imaginative film that, unfortunately, is largely forgotten today.
