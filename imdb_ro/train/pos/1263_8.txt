I liked this movie, it is granted mainly because I like to see Sean Connery's act and it has the added benefit of having Ed Harris and Lawrence Fishburne in it too. The story has a grandmother looking for Connery's help because her nephew is in prison and says she was wrongly convicted. At first it seems that there were some racist aspects of the case, but later it turns out that the chief officer of the case was himself black and apparently did some bad things to force a confession from the boy. Well, the boy is trying to get another killer locked in the same prison, one to be killed. He is a particularly ugly person because he enjoys much in what he did, writing to the relatives of the victims and trying to make people send them by post. A lot of twists and turns in this case, with some of them being somewhat unexpected. I enjoyed Sean Connery's character trying to understand the whole test. The film has also made me angry in the areas, especially when you find out what happened in the end. You have a very good interaction between Connery and Harris and Connery and Fishburne, because they all shine pretty well in this. Ultimately, it makes a pretty good suspense / thriller.
