This movie is by far the most cutest I've ever seen! Wonderful animations and adorable characters (even bad boys were nice!) They made this a total winner in my book, and also in the books of those I've seen. I want to see again, but I did not have time. Better than Toy Story, which was also good but not HERE well.
