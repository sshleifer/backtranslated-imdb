I had the pleasure of seeing this film at the Rhode Island International Film Festival and was very impressed. Tess Nanavati is certainly a great screenwriter and I would love to see more movies. If he could do what he did with the budget of this movie, I'm very anxious to see what he can do with an important image. Kudos to cast for their wonderful shows (that little girl was gold), and for anyone who composed music. Your deformed "Row Your Boat" kicked me out. Very creative movie everywhere .... I really hope to see it coming out on video or DVD because I buy it in a second. If you get the chance, you should definitely see this movie.
