ShintarÃ´ Katsu, who played a blind Zatoichi sword in a total of 27 films, concludes the Hanzo trilogy with this great movie in which he falls in love with a ghost, Mako Midori (Blind Beast). /> The big stick, often used in the search for justice, is retired forever. Katsu was his usual common impudent, following those who would steal from the treasury to lend in bad amounts to those who could not pay. <br /> <br /> The astonishing astonishing astonishment and skill of the great guy was present alongside the blood. I will miss him.
