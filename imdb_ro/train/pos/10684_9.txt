Looking at DeMille's early work, it was once again reinforced that DeMille early is far superior to DeMille late. His attention to the use of light in the scenes is remarkable. His pacing is very good, allowing a lot to say in the space for about an hour. It is a pity that he was not as intuitive about the style of his soundtracks later, as it seemed in his silent films. This was the first movie I saw on Cleo Ridgely. She was remarkable, quite remembered and yet transmitted a broad spectrum of emotions. The end is wonderful.
