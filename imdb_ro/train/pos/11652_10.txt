I accidentally met this movie when I was writing all the movies I wanted my sister to record while I was on holiday and I'm so glad I included it. It deals with issues that most directors do not like, my only problem with this movie is that it was made for television, so I could not buy a copy for my boyfriend! It's an exciting story about how people who suffer from eating disorders do not necessarily get away from everyone and how much they actually have diet pals. It brought to my attention that although bulimic can maintain a fairly stable weight, it has more serious health consequences that many people do not know.
