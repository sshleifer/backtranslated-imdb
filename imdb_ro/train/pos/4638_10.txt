I saw this movie when I was in Israel for the summer. my Hebrew is not fluent, so subtitles were very useful, I did not feel lost at any time of the movie. You tend to get used to subtitles after about 5 minutes. This movie gave me away !!!!!! She describes two of the most prominent taboos in the Middle East today: a homosexual relationship between an Israeli and a Palestinian. This allows one person to simultaneously enter both areas of the conflict. The dilemma, the emotions involved. The film culminates in tragedy when anger and anger lead one of the lovers to an extremist party! an absolute must see!
