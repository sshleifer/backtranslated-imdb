Another Australian masterpiece, it is heading to the world of the unknown and the supernatural, and it does very well. Do not resort to large-scale effects such as American films, focusing more on emotional impact. A relatively simple plot that Rebecca Gibney & Co. brings it to life. It follows the story of a couple who buys an old house that is supposed to be home to a very old woman who never came out and whose husband disappeared in mysterious circumstances a century ago. Strange things begin to happen in the house, and John Adam begins to turn into the missing man, who was actually a mass murderer. Highly recommended. 8/10
