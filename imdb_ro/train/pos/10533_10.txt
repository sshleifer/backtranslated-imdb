I totally agree that "Nothing" is a fantastic movie! I did not laugh so much when watching a movie over the years! and David Hewlett and Andrew Miller are fantastic about it! really work well together! This movie may not appeal to some people (I can not say why, without damaging it!), But each in itself! I liked and recommended a lot! Direction is great and some of the photos are very smart. It looks like you might have had a lot of fun when filming! Although there are really only two main characters in the movie and not a bunch of props, the actors are able to pull it and make the movie to watch.
