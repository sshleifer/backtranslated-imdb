If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones or an action in general, this must be seen. Directed by William Witney and John English, and Reed Hadley as Don Diego / Zorro, this series delivers! I will not bother you of the plot (who cares less, but less of a fight); what really matters here is Hadley's superb interpretation of the character and work of the stunts of Dale van Sickel and Yakima Canutt. <br /> <br /> You can see the influence this film has on Lucas and Spielberg - Zorro is trapped in the original version of Star Wars a trash compactor in a single chapter, caught on a rope bridge a'la Temple of Doom in another, makes a Raiders transfer from the horsemen, and even runs through a tunnel while wreaking havoc on a huge reservoir of water and flooding the tunnel behind him, just as Mola Ram does at Indy in Temple of Doom. In addition to all this, the whip action is wonderful, because Zorro disarms the villains, swings safely, etc., with his tricky whip. Most of the sword is correct, except for the first chapter, which presents a terrible sword battle in a choreographic canteen by the sword legend / Ralph Faulkner, which makes a rare appearance as Bad Rodriguez. This was the first show I've ever seen, Matin√©e at Bijou when I was a kid, and since then I've been caught up with them. <br /> <br /> Zorro's battle legion offers "Z" goods!
