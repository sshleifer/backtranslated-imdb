I first saw Martin's day when I was only 10 years old at home on The Channel, and I still remembered the impact I had on my life. She touched me that no other film touched me, and I remember pulling my eyes out. The first time I saw her, I did not find her elsewhere. I would have asked around and nobody ever heard about the movie! I think it was one of those rare movies that did not know too many people, because nobody and nobody know what I was talking about. I've searched and searched over the years, checking the shelves of the video stores and scanning the cable television lists, but they've always been shortened. Finally, in 1996, I found out that I could order, I did, and probably followed it at least 50 times - and still makes me cry every time. Martin's day is about Martin Steckert, a man in prison (but really a good guy) who wants to go back to the special lake where he grew up as a boy. It was a special place where he lived out of nature, spent time with his dog and remained alone to enjoy life. Soon in the movie, he escapes and begins to return to the lake. Not long before the police found him and Steckert took a child as a hostage to persuade the police to return them. Soon, Steckert and his hostage (the 2nd Martin) become the best friends and have many fun adventures together - from raiding a toy truck to a train all on their way to this particular lake. /> Throughout the movie, Steckert has wonderful flashbacks of him at the lake like a boy. I will not ruin the end for you, but I tell you, this movie you have to see. It's the best movie I've ever seen in my life! I am, undoubtedly, the greatest fan of this EVER movie! I managed to find the song the two Martin plays during the movie ("I come back, where I come from ..."). I still plan a trip to Canada to see the lake and the chalet where Martin Day was filmed. Crazy, I know - but the movie just means so much to me.
