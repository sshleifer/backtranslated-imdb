in such a conventional sense of the word. This movie was one of my favorites as a little kid and I just remembered it recently and I thought I'd look for it. While many of the details are no longer clear in my mind, the overall feeling that the film gave me has remained over the years. If parents feel that their children can treat mature and sometimes violent themes, then I recommend this film. I learned a lot about life and death and brought me a lot of emotions. So far, it remains one of my favorite films.
