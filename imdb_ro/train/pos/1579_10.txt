I saw this movie at the Toronto Film Festival, where she received a standing ovation! This film tells a story I did not know earlier about the Rosenstrasse uprising (a street in Berlin) of the German German women married to the Jews at the end of the Second World War. As such, it is a unique story and, moreover, it is the only Holocaust movie I've ever seen, showing that they were good German people (the family who helped her in "Anne Frank," for example, was the Dutch) and, in fact, had the strength to oppose the immorality and brutality of their country during the Nazi regime, at the risk of their lives. The actor is very good everywhere, the New York storyline is exciting and complex, the direction of Von Trotta, mastered in every scene, and the productive values, including outstanding, outstanding cinema. Of course, the New York family could speak German. Many immigrants from this country choose to speak in their mother tongue with their family - a common event. So criticism is unjustified. To say more would ruin the experience. The movie is long, but I did not watch my watch once. I hope this film will be distributed in North America, because not only is this film a masterpiece, but maybe even helping to heal any animosity that people have about the Germans because of their support for Hitler. If this movie is playing in your area, please see it! You will be glad you did!
