After reading reviews for this movie, I understood that I began to watch it with great doubt in my mind that it would actually be a good thing. Still, this is one of the best movies I've seen for a long time. Most reviews I've read have said the complicated plot made it too hard to follow. And while some parts leave you confused, the ending ties so many freeheads that you feel that you have struck because you have lost so much. It's not like "Lock, Stock ..." or "Snatch" in the sense that it's not that funny (actually, it's pretty dark), and it's much smarter in the way you see parts of scene scenes (and in one of the best scenes of the film, Jason Statham spends five minutes in a lift with an argument with himself). The way he is similar to the two films I just mentioned is that he is full of memorable characters, especially Statham, who gives a fantastic performance to the lead role, and Ray Liotta, who spends most of the film in Speedos, but it still offers excellent performance. If you have time and have time to think about the movie and even watch it again, you will really start to see all the symbols and suggestions that are exposed through the movie. I think it's fantastic and that Guy Ritchie is a director over his game.
