I saw this movie when I was a kid. She let me go. This was before TV, so a movie of this magnitude, could send a young man to orbit. She so impressed me that I visited this film for twelve consecutive days. The special effects used at the time were long before his time. Sabu was a real delight, as Rex Ingram was like Genie. I woke up singing "I want to be a sailor" months after the movie left the city. I would recommend this movie to everyone and everyone. I forgot to mention Conrad Veidt, who was just as bad as a character you'd ever wanted to meet. June Duprez has never been more beautiful than it was in this photo. The color was remarkable. Give him an AAA movie!
