I stopped to give him "Mr. Blandings builds his dream house" 10/10, due to an aspect that makes us show up in the 21st century: the fact that a black person is a faithful servant (somewhat reminds Stepin Fetchit). But other than that, the movie is a hohot. Presenting the middle class, the young man in New York, Jim (Cary Grant) and Muriel Blandings (Myrna Loy), trying to build a home in Connecticut, this movie has something for everyone. Grant is his usual flippant, while Loy is pretty good as a simple wife. But Melvyn Douglas adds some real laugh as Jim's and Muriel's lawyer, Bill Cole, who seems to have more plans than he makes clear. As for the house itself ... most of the movie, you will probably feel ambiguous if you want to live there or not. Builders, entrepreneurs and others also offer a fair share of laughter. <br /> <br /> All this, a classic comedy. They also starred with Louise Beavers, Reginald Denny, Sharyn Moffett, Connie Marshall, and Jason Robards Sr.
