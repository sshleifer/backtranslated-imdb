Groups of people traveling on a bus in Belgrade led by a conductor terrible drunk and stupid son (who likes to drive with your eyes closed). Their journey is often interrupted by events hilarious that, with great irony, describing the fall of 1941 and the nation's spirit is so fun that are used even today as common jokes. The man who "steal the show" is a peasant high 4 meters with the four sons who are nearly two times higher than him. Finally, the film takes a dramatic turn and travel becomes more than a swan song of a dying country.
