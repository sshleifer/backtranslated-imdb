I have watched "Dick Tracy" for years and as a result has become a vital part of my life - it has been with me throughout my childhood and I have seen it quite often. Seeing him now as an adult is still a very good film - dark, satirical and incredibly incomprehensible. The only thing that can be said is the Oscar nomination that Pacino has received - otherwise it is rarely discussed and did not make much excitement when it came out. Pacino is over-the-top but for a good effect because he clearly has a lot of fun. Beatty is great as Dick Tracy and behind the camera manages to capture the atmosphere of a cartoon comic book better than any other movie I've ever seen. Just looking at a scene in the movie is breathtaking. Light, velvet and smog / smoke combine to create a great effect. There are really funny cameos, including one by Dustin Hoffman as "Mumbles," and I do not think there are any defects in terms of acting - even the child's obligatory character is much better than expected. Generally, a truly awesome movie that has become misunderstood over the years since launch and is incredibly understated, with only 5.7 / 10 on IMDb. Critics' comments are very positive (check it out on RottenTomatoes.com) and once you've seen the movie again, it's not hard to understand why - this is a perfect example of capturing the essence of a comic book from style to eccentricity. > <br /> Highly recommended. 4.5 / 5 stars.
