Wow, I can not believe I'm the first and only one who posted a comment on this great movie. Although the movie itself seemed quite interesting, the real thing that attracted me to this is Matt lillard, gave most people, perhaps either think it's too happy coffee or just sucks, but we're both of the same age and from the same generation and I've seen this type so many times that he's one of my favorites right now. This is one of the few movies in which he is shot and a main star, such as SLC Punk, another great Lillard movie. Baiscally this is the story of heist habitual movies, but with more twists than anything that begins to grow madness. Also very remarkable in this film is another great actor named Vincent D'onofrio, a highly regarded person in the cinema industry. The woman in the movie is a newcomer and she is not too bad though you know that they hired her mainly for her accent and nude scene =) It's a jack vs jill vs bob game as everyone wants to take advantage of the rewards, but to share with them. They all try to kill the others and it's a time bomb waiting to explode. Matt demonstrates his true skill as the JAck who initially installs the entire scheme. Vincent and the woman play some art thieves who need money because of lack of business. Vince's character is a bit disturbed and skitz throughout the movie, but it only adds to the intensity of the movie. The surprises left and right are welcome and the conclusion is very non-cliche and makes you feel happy, maybe it depends on the type of endings you like. This movie kept me very interested except that he was in Matt, it's a great movie and I would recommend everyone who likes the movies. The critic probably does not like this movie, but they do not watch the movies because they like movies anyway.
