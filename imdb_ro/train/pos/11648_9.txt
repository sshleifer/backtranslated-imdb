There are people who claim this is another "bad language" film of extreme Mexican violence. They are right, but more than that, this film is an appeal to create the awareness of what we have become. The miserable truth harms or revolves when you have already accepted the paradigm of the third world experience as the only possible goal. One of the most important things in "Cero y van cuatro" is the open invitation to a profound reflection on our current identity. Is that all of us? Is that what we want to be? I'm abroad and I realized how spoiled the Mexican society was when the Tlahuac incident occurred. I still can not understand the viewers who witness a mass murder. I almost caught when I saw some pictures. It was not Iraq or Rwanda, a small village near Mexico City, when the ravages were made with the rage of the press and the government. Recreating a similar situation in this movie shocked me deeply. The other stories were good portrayal of other corruption, dishonest, betrayal and violence, but I think "Tamales de Chivo" is the best film. The film is deeper than some "cabr√≥n" and "pendejo" screaming. They are meaningless compared to people's actions. With a few exceptions, all are perfect examples of human trash. Just as in real life, honesty is becoming more and more an exception than the rule in our country. In addition, honesty is rewarded only miraculously.
