Hot Millions is a great movie in every respect. A fun, extraordinary story with great performances by four of the best professionals ever to work in business. Peter Ustinov is brilliant as usual, and Maggie Smith - certainly one of the greatest actresses of all time - is a total delight. Karl Malden and Bob Newhart round out the distribution and are also perfect. If you want a movie that has a perfect cast, that's it. What is so impressive is how these people work each other in such a natural and effortless fashion, creating many laughs and fun moments throughout. Peter Ustinov was a genius with a wonderful sense of humor and this is one of his most memorable performances. Direction, photography and editing are also of prime importance, and it is a great time capsule of London in the 1960s. It's definitely my favorite list of all time.
