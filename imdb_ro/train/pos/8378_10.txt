What is a great movie. The notion of nations sending people who fight each other with giant robots is sticky. The end is not just one, it is more inspired. But I'm intrigued by the characters. It is a shame that we never see that the relationship between Achilles and Athena is more developed than just a few kisses and Athena's fear of Achilles' safety. Their romance is very pleasant. <br /> <br />
