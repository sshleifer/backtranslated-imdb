A beauty film that is hard to describe. Perhaps there is no useless dialogue, or perhaps the absolute stellar column, or perhaps only Meena Mumari's legs, but it is a joy to watch this movie again and again. I have never seen another Indian movie that comes close to him, and few in any country rival his perfection.
