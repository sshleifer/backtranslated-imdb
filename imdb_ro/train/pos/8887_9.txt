When I saw the movie, I was really shocked to see what was around 60 years old. I know I might be mistaken for some things, but it seemed that the 60s had an effect on the people then. Some people said they wanted to go back in the 1960s. From what I saw, I would say yes for enthusiasm and not for the result. But that's my opinion.
