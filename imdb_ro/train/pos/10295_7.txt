Okay, so it's not a masterpiece like the Godfather, but it does not have to be. The only purpose this movie has is to make the spectator laugh many times. If he can make the spectator laugh a lot of times, he has accomplished his goal. I laughed out loud and left with a smile. I feel like I won the money.
