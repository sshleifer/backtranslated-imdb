The final performance of William Powell, as Philo Vance, appears in the Kennel Crime Case, where killing a champion dog leads to two more crimes and a human test. It's all about how it leads to who and why. Phill Vance's murders from SS Van Dine were the most popular at the time, and Mr. Van Dine, intelligently, found a way to sell his books one by one to the greatest bidder of the studio. That's why you see so many Philo Vance and so many studios that have them. If Bill Powell did not win fame with MGM as Nick Charles in the thin series, he would have been known as the biggest of the Vance filio. <br /> <br /> It seems that Powell entered his captain in the same contest where the killed dog entered and then another rival owner became the first victim of the crime. As usual, Powell showed Eugene Palette as Sergeant Heath, whose greatest contribution to the proceedings was to use to destroy the door lock in the interior where the first victim of the crime was found. inside and it was a superior story, so it was in figuring out how. Powell has a wonderful group of suspects, as well as what is normally in a Thin Man mystery. People like Paul Cavanaugh, Helen Vinson, Ralph Morgan, and Mary Astor fill their roles well. Warner Brothers liked this version so much that they actually remodeled it again in the thirties with James Stephenson in a single exit like Philo Vance. It does not have a candle to it. Because this is the only Powell Philo Vance, on the VHS or DVD, you can see it or buy it if you can.
