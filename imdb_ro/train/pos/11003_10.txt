Listen, I do not care what anyone says, because Cypher is nothing but a 5-star movie. Cypher is not, I repeat, a B. Cypher movie is an absolute masterpiece. Suffice it to say that I am a connoisseur of the best spy movies in the world and this film is nothing less than the top flight. I can not emphasize too much how phenomenal this film is. Cypher is one of the best spy films ever designed and ever made. The technology in this film is beyond the horizon of space. In fact, I have to admit that Cypher has totally surprised me. In fact, I recommended this film to my colleagues more than any other film. Other critics, some of whom have highlighted the movie, have no idea what the hell he is talking about. Do not listen to the haters. In fact, for the most part, Cypher's reviews were largely positive. And it should be noted that Cyher is not just a good film but also a fantastic movie. Cypher is a kind of so advanced and so wonderful film that it's over the head of most critics and all cynics. There is nothing wrong or cheap about Cypher. Again, cinema, background, technology, story and acting are all 100% of the world's top class. Of course, I will not give anything. This is not a spoiler. And, while it is certain that critics say Cypher should have been in cinemas, I think it is the opposite. Cypher is a movie that seems to have been just right for the release of the DVD and not in a bad way. Cypher must be the biggest underground spy shot that ever hit the shelves. Blade Runner, 1984, The Courageous World, Total Recall, Logan's Run, Jason Bourne and Impostor and Deja Vu ... look out! Cypher also wins the distinction of being placed in AONN Multimedia Research, 5 Star Eternal Spy, Hall of Fame. Cypher is a pioneer to the absolute best. Hands down and hats down. Nothing is what it looks like, and the truth is brighter than fiction. The future is now.
