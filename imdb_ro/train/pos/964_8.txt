"Yokai Daisenso" is a Takashi Miike children's movie, but as you might expect, it's probably a little too dark and frightening for the youngest. However, older children may eat this, ie if you play it in English. The story is that of a little boy who moved with his mother to the country to live with his grandfather after a divorce. During a holiday festival, the boy is chosen as a "Kirin Rider", a great honor, but with this honor comes a lot of danger and adventure, of course. Meanwhile, evil deeds are as handy as a woman in a white white skirt, go-go boots and hive hairstyle, equip themselves with a Yokai evil to turn people's resentment and throw the objects against them. And this evil manifested itself as a flying city in the form of a monster heading for the city of Rage, Tokyo. A pretty funny scene has two deserts that track the monsters flying across the city ... one says, "Oh, it's just Gamera." <br /> <br /> The boy is friends with Yokai, who are monsters of a kind, especially benign, who have been isolated from humans, and the whole Yokai band in Japan together to fight evil. <br /> <br /> In many ways, the Miike & crew team took Yokai movies from the 60's and beginning of the 70's and transformed them into a modern adventure film for older children that combines some strange mechanical monsters that made me think of "Transformers." The look and feel of the movie are great, the effects are fun, and some of the humor will just sail over the baby's head, but still the elders can enjoy it. As far as the adults are concerned, there are not many things that they do not like, if you are a fan of Japanese monster movies, you will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Cool and fun stuff, sometimes dark but maybe that's just Miike ... and what a wild ride. 8 out of 10.
