As a "riot" like the best 100 AFI films, the British Film Institute has produced a documentary with Martin Scorsese. I'm a huge fan of the movie and I'm proud to have seen many, many movies. But now I am compared to my idol. In this fantastic documentary (though long), Scorsese walks the viewer through several stages of American history on the film. This is divided into several sections, including the West, Gangster and Noir. Completely bouncy enthusiasm, Martin Scorsese is an excellent tourist guide as well as a fantastic teacher.
