When Grinch came out, I was excited, though I thought it would be a happy film, and it was. Although he had a little nightmare before Christmas, touch it. You know a little dark and scary. I liked this film because it helped people fill up with the spirit of Christmas. So Grinch saved most of Christmas. And what happened in Whoville then says Grinch's little heart grew that day in three dimensions. MERRY GRINCHMAS!
