What a night. Perry Mason, then with pistols, will travel followed by Gunsmoke (when it was half an hour) and finally at 10:30 came "Sea Hunt", with the wonderful opening music theme and Mike's boat sailing into a new adventure. Terrific. Regardless of the story, it was the lead character (played by Lloyd Bridges), strong, honest, sincere. A man's man and a boy's man. This has brought an interest in boats that have lasted for years. Why not show on cable or make it available on video, no idea .. Too bad.
