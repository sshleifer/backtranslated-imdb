Wow. An extraordinary "journey" movie that has tons of super-realistic images, dark intentions and a black, strange feeling about how cartoon animals have to see the world. It is populated with a bunch of cute characters in the world that bend and flow with distorted backgrounds. With all the cool fantasies, the wandering plot is secondary to eye sighting and we are following a small cat and his zombie sister as death, flood, water elephants, samurai swords and pigs are fishing. I've never heard of her, but now I like it - probably because he reminded me of the surrealist brain work of the American caricaturist; Bill Plympton. It's a delightful delight for fans of strange and cute things and stuck to my screen because I miss something amazing. Simply, it's "Hello Kitty" without "o".
