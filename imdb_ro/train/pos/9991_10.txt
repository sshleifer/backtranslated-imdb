I thought this movie was hysterical. I have followed it several times and I strongly recommend it. Mel Brooks, it was great. The distribution was fantastic. I do not understand how to get this 2 out of 5 movie. I liked it. I saw other movies and it was fun too, but that reminded me of humor. I can not say enough about this movie. I'm looking to be periodic, but it's never been enough. People playing homeless were also comparable to the most fun standard. Please put this movie more often. I can not see it pretty much .. Leslie Warren was also another favorite of me since Cinderella. I always thought it was not funny, but she would love to play. In this movie it was very funny ... and she and Mel did a good job together. He should put more films on television.
