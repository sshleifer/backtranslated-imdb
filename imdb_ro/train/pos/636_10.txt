Why are so blah previews for a movie that's so great! Everyone should know what an excellent movie is. She is engaged and funny since one, original and well-acted. I want the movie to make a good press it deserves! <br /> <br /> For anyone who loved the Princess Bride, the Labyrinth and other real funny and original fantastic adventures, this is one of the best. Robert DeNiro is hysterical. Relatively newcomer Charlie Cox is an incredible lead man. Claire Danes is fantastic as always. Michelle Pfiefer takes a stroll with his recent returns on screen. There are also many wonderful moments from minor characters ... even to facial expressions.
