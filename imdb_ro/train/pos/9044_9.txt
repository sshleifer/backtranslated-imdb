I've seen this movie recently because of Jake's recent success with Mountain Brokeback. I thought I'd see the movies we lost. I did not expect to get into the movie, so he was amazed that he missed this movie at all. It's a father story and exciting son, and it's also a subconscious story. I even shed a tear at the end of this wonderful story. This film appeals to all ages. The only reason I give him a 9 out of 10 is that he slows down in the middle, but he turns back in the end. The act was great, the story was magnificent, and the cinema was engaging with the setting of the film. Watch this movie! Hire it, buy it, watch it, LOVE it! I know we did it!
