This Columbo episode is probably more mentioned for director Steven Spielberg as one of his first films. He should look at the role of Jack Cassidy as the killer who kills his partner in writing to maintain his lifestyle. Jack Cassidy would appear in a Columbo later. After all, Columbo meets his match in Jack Cassidy's character. He is a mystery writer who acts to carry out the perfect killing. After the first murder, the next victim would be the annoying owner of the general / widow who blackmailed him for money. Rather than lose more money, it kills her. It's really fun to look at Cassidy and Falk as always. Falk's family as Columbo makes him vigilant after seeing this episode repeatedly over the years. What television today forgets about the success of the years is that people will want to watch the shows again and again if they like the characters. It's not about who he's doing, how and why, Columbo's familiarity with his loyalty, which you're writing with viewers like me.
