Loopy, but whispering and formidable the mob boss "Vic" (an excellent performance by Richard Dreyfuss) gets released from a psychiatric hospital. Some of Vic's criminal cohorts, including Ben-London (a glorious mania and a hamburger portrait by Gabriel Byrne), Jake Parker (a perfect Kyle MacLachlan) and a vicious "Wacky" rival Jacky Jackson (a tidy direction Burt Reynolds) are all trying to hit Vic. Meanwhile, Mickey Holliday (played beautifully with low confidence by Jeff Goldblum) is in the midst of all this deadly greed. Writer / director Larry Bishop brings an idiosyncratic, hilarious and original idiosyncratic sensitivity to this dark and dark, delicate and unclear comedy about treacherous betrayal, loyalty, and ruthless ambition. "Bang-up" has a day of weighing with a colorful hat grotesque galley with gentle graces and deceivers: Ellen Barkin is Rita Everly, tough and frightening, Henry Silva as a trusted man of Vic Sleepy Joe Carisle , Gregory Hines as Jules Flamingo's sweet philosopher, Diane Lane as Vic Grace's lovely mistress, Billy Drago as Wells, and Christopher Jones as brutal artist, Nicholas Falco. The bishop uses the juicy secondary role as the lethal assassin and laconic as, Nick. Billy Idol is like a cursed bully, Michael J. Pollard as innocent of Red, Joey Bishop as a mortician Mr. Gottlieb, Rob Reiner as a jovial driver, and Richard Pryor as Jimmy Gravedigger. Byrne of delightfully crazy duet with singer Paul Anka on "My Way" rates as a clear starting point of expectation. A tense and funny climatic stomach also teases the funny bone something hysterical. Frank Byers' cinematic films, the indignant dialogue, Earl Rose's cocktail jazz song, and an epoch of vintage antique collection, further enrich the exciting charm of this extraordinary curiously curious one-of -kind.
