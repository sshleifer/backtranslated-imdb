Along her body was a beautiful little movie. It was decent and fun, still funny. There were a couple of clich√©s, but we found the most fresh stuff. At first I did not think it would be good at all when it started. If you can go through the first 20 minutes, the movie begins to become more interesting. This movie did not burst into hilarious laughter, and it was not great. It was just a movie that you can sit down and enjoy how pleasant it was. I do not see how this movie was bad. It's too low a rating. Would it have been 5.5, but 4.8? a 1 is shameful. It was pretty good and there was nothing horrible enough to give a 1, which most people gave it.
