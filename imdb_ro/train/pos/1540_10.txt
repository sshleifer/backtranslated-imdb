This is an incredible movie. I do not remember the last time I saw a Swedish film that I stratified. It's funny, it's tragic, it's convincing and especially a piece of Swedish life. He crushes the clichés and lives deeper. It makes you feel connected, not just to the main characters, but to all the characters. The big city girl is back to her roots, her hometown, to celebrate her 70-year-old father's birthday, crossing the paths with people she has not met in a few years. Although the story itself is not unique, it offers a fresh approach. The story center is the relationship between three sisters (at different stages of life) that are not very close. Or at least they do not realize how close they are. A key reason that makes it so easy to connect to the people in this movie is immaculate representation. First of all, I am more than satisfied with the fact that in this film there are absolutely no Swedish actors called "A-list". Usually there are a number of actors who have the ability to find their way in almost all major productions in Sweden. This time, the production company has managed to keep it real by throwing the actors who actually seem to love their job. Sofia Helin is probably the first Swedish actress from Eva Röse to prove that you do not need words to convey an emotion. Writing is also very appealing. The dialogue is more than credible and, compared to other Swedish films of the last year or two, is ahead of miles. Maria Blom controls everything from scratch, and if you did not know, you would never have guessed it was the first time you wrote and directed a feature film. I can not wait for the next one. Once you start watching this, you really want to see it.
