Ella was excellent, Franchot was inevitably over the top (but he played similar tracks in other films, such as "The Man on the Eiffel Tower"), and Alan was almost nonexistent, but the film was certainly "excited." > <br /> * Easy Spoiler Forward *: I wonder how many times Elizabeth Cook was strangled in his films, but I think he reminds me of various other examples. I will avoid appointing the killer, but I think it's obvious because of the "thriller" plot. A very well made but dated movie (for example: everyone smoked like a madman and the police really did not show corpses, unlike today's gorillas), made in the short scene family format of the scene. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
