I wonder someone who says he does not care about this movie. Some commentators said they did not have enough action, some said it was too long, etc. Do not listen to them! If you like Shawshank Redemption and / or Braveheart, you'll definitely enjoy this movie! The acting performances are great! Tim Roth, John Hurt and Jessica Lang are allsuperb, and Liam Neeson makes an admirable job and is a very imposing character because of his size. Cinematography was brilliant and breathtaking. It's one of the few movies I've seen in my life (along with Shawshank), which was almost flawless from pouring, directing, writing, acting, etc. I was amazed that it was not so in the first 50 or 100 films reviewed. I felt so passionate about the fact that I just registered with IMDB so I can let everyone know the real shell. I saw this movie about 10 times (every time with a different person) and everyone loved it! You have to be awake and watch carefully for the first 30 minutes, because I introduce quite a few characters in the beginning. If you have more attention than most of these children who write reviews for movies on this site, than you will love this movie! Come on ... all the movies 3 Lord of the Rings in the top 9 and the Matrix at # 32?!?! This should show you the age of most commentators here! <br /> <br /> This is a top 50 movie!
