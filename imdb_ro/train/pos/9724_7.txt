I like Kristen Dunst, especially in Elizabethtown. I think she's the kind of actress who should have stopped acting in front of the room, just to be herself. She did that and she seemed so natural in Elizabethtown. In this film, however, he tried to add more artificial performance, especially in the first half of the film, to look more like a sober editor. While in the other half, she turned totally into her daily play, and I just could not tell her to be an editor in any way. Therefore, its performance is not sustainable in this movie. <br /> <br /> The film as a whole attracts and inspires. Young's character is full and reasonable. However, the film tells a big and sophisticated story. <br /> <br /> The only big flaw is that he did not show a turning point of the hero and heroine love story. I am completely confused when kissing at the end of the story, because it is quite unclear to the two people.
