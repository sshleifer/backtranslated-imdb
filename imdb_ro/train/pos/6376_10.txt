If you have sons or daughters who love action, adventure, intrigue and imagination - without having to enter the songs every twelve minutes - then this is Disney movie for you! My sons have loved every minute of this movie and I have to admit that I have laughed many times throughout the movie. There are no crowded songs to prevent a wonderful story told, and the characters are all appealing and identifiable in themselves. This should go as one of Disney's "classics", thanks to its beautifully illustrated landscapes and non-stop emotion!
