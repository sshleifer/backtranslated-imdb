Lily Mars, a little girl from Indiana, dreams of doing a great deal on Broadway and her aspirations are given a lift when Broadway success producer John Thornway returns to her hometown for a visit. Lily tries everything she can to Thornway to observe her, but she gets angry with her ancestor. When Thornway returns to New York to launch her show, Lily follows (unknown to John of course) and Thornway gives her a small role in her next show, just as a favor for her family, however Thornway starts to fall for this young girl and a blossom of romance, making Isabel Rekay the lady of the show to be jealous. When Isabel gets drunk with John-Lily's romance, causing friction with the show, she leaves, and John decides to make Lily stand. Isabel returns later, and Thornway is told to tell Lily that she returns to her little role in the play, which can also jeopardize romance. The very charming film and a refreshing change to see Garland put the comic blows in her role (her reading by Lady MacBeth, while she was humorous, never threatened her singing career). I enjoyed the character of Heflin (Thornway) more when Lily was mad rather than romantic. The movie was somewhat predictable and the scenes were not assembled so well together, but a very nice film. Rating, 7.
