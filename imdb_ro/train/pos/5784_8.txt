I have noticed that a lot of people who post on "Kerching!" board seems to hate this show, which, in fact, I find very surprising. I think it is one of the best performances of British children. It's a shame that ends because it's very funny (if it's a bit cheesy, sometimes) and it has great characters. The main character is a little like Del Boy, though much more intelligent. With his two best friends, he tried to make a million pounds for his mother, starting from an online business and adopting a pseudonym of "Rudeboy." His friends are Seymour (who likes to cook) and Danny (who is the simple and wonderful relief character). Throughout the show, some characters left and came out, but they were always fun and improved.
