I like ghost stories in general, but I love particularly cool, atmospheric and elegant, creepy, British style, ghost stories. It qualifies in all respects. A young young attorney ("solicitor" from Britspeak) is sent to a small village near the seaside to establish a fortune for an elderly, deceased person. It is the 1920s, when many middle-class British go to the seaside on holiday for their "health". Well, guess, there is nothing "healthy" about Cryptin Gifford village, the creepy place of the older, thickening woman, who is in the Victorian neighborhood, which is on the edge of a misty salt salt mist. When the lawyer saves the life of a little girl (none of the locals will help everything out of the way - you'll find out why later in the movie), it inappropriately causes the wrath of an evil spirit, the woman in black. She is not a strange, filthy, but a solid silhouette of evil and evil. The visitor only sees it a few times, but you feel its evil presence in every frame. As your camera leans on the lawyer while reading through legal documents, you expect to see the woman in black at all times. When the lawyer goes to the sinking generator to turn on the electricity for the old creepy house, the camera snakes into it and you think it will also appear there. The expectation that the woman in black appears is terrifying. I have seen several elements of this story before (the closed room that no one introduces, the fog, the naive outsider who ignores the locals' warnings), but the director somehow manages to combine them into a completely new and convincing story. Watch him with a buddy so you can have someone warm to grab him while you wait for the woman in black. . .
