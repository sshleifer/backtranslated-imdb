This movie is a bit unusual in having a very thin plot and the movie itself is done at a very slow and relaxed pace. While this makes it quite different from Media Grant film, it is still very visible and fun. It's like someone said, "Let's follow Cary around and look, because he's troubled by all the little problems that come up when you have a rehabilitated house." Considering what a fun actor is in the film and the great support she receives from Myrna Loy and Melvin Douglas, the movie works very well. While the film has rather modest claims, it uses the most material. It's a great movie for Cary Grant fans or for the whole family.
