This is almost a perfect movie. The ideas will be repeated by Mamet, but they have never said so succinctly. It is the failure of trust, of the human condition. The film fuses the idea that we are all criminals, no one is innocent. Is there anyone alive today who has not seen this game in our own society every day? The film is very structured like a Hitchcock thriller. Except for innocent characters. The world is now completely polluted, ruined and everyone is participating in the con. Could it be more real? Do not miss the soundtrack. Is awesome.
