I have seen this movie many times and I like that all bad teachers want to give it ten out of ten, but I feel it would be unfair to other good movies. However, I think this is one of those rare stones: a perfect comedy. It's one of the greatest comic movies ever. Matthau and Lemmon are perfectly suited and inappropriate. The script is so sharp you have to control its bleeding. The story is well known and has already been described in other reviews. The two lead extraordinary shows, the girls are gorgeous and the situations are funny. There is no word of oath (you mark Hollywood, you do not have to swear to be funny, you have to be a wizard), and moving from scene to movie is no problem. I do not do that anymore. Timeless.
