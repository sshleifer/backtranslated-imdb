Poor production and solid performance in this direct adaptation of Jane Austen's satirical classic about marriage in and out of 18th-century provincial England. Northam and Paltrow are a salutary mixture as friends who have to go through jealousy and lies to find that they love each other. Good humor is a sustained virtue, which goes a long way toward explaining the accessibility of the source material in the elderly (which has been reduced little in its harsh skepticism). I liked the film's look and the way pictures were taken and I thought it was not relying too much on succession of photos like most other films in the 1980s and 1990s. Very good results.
