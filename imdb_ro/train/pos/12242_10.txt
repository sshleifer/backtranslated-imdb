I think this movie is a masterpiece, but it took me at least 4 times 5 times to see it, to figure out what a great movie it was. First, it describes a face of the Second World War that we do not usually see in Hollywood movies. In particular, German soldiers, the army and the Nazi government are more "humanized". One of the things that most impressed me was the mention, by the end of the film, of a crime that has taken place in a forest for the past 20 years ... that forest is the place where the final chapters of the Berlin Alexanderplatz: These are the woods where Reinhold kills Mieze. Another hint for those who like details is the representation of the doors. Fassbinder is obsessed with the changes made by people every time they go to a door or open a door. Many doors are shown on the screen, open and closed. And the characters change into their personality, their deeds, etc., whenever it happens. Did you notice that?
