I think they are part of the silent minority that enjoyed this film. Is it one of the best Nightmare series? Maybe not, but I had a lot of fun. Freddy Krueger reaches his evil, deceptive potential. Since parties 4 and 5 have remained behind the series, I felt that this so-called final cut ("New Nightmare" is the real end) took the series out of the crisis. There are a few nightmares, including one in which Breckin Meyer plays a stoner who is trashed, falls asleep and gets stuck in a video game that Freddy controls. This is an extremely original and hilarious sequence, especially when we see it from the dream, taking a stroll like Super Mario. And Freddy carries out a unique fun, "Great graphics." And since the movie was made 10 years ago, it brought memories when Freddy started controlling the Powerglove game. Anyone who remembers the first 8-bit Nintendo remembers Powerglove. <br /> <br /> The distribution is superb. Lisa Zane is perfectly expressed in lead. I did not see Yaphet Kotto from The Running Man, and I think the last time I saw that movie was about five years ago. He's another great, underestimated actor who has a strong presence on the screen. And who can forget the houses? The best is Johnny Depp (from the first "Nightmare") who plays a spokesman for an anti-drug ad. <br /> <br /> The 3D sequence at the end is great! So for those who want to check this movie - please rent it or buy it on DVD! We hope all editions come with 3D glasses, but I'm sure the video editing has removed the 3D element. <br /> <br /> I personally did not see many things wrong with the movie. She even developed Freddy's story. The film is an excellent blend of humor and scarecrows, and the brutal effects are extraordinary. Could this be a better justice for the franchise? Of course he could. But Rachel Talalay did a good job. Finding the perfect conclusion is easier said than done. And finally, I liked mounting on the opening credits. The fans of the series will be delighted and will look at it as a tribute to their beloved Freddy. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
