This long episode includes an amazing surprise surprise, thriller, mystery, and concerns about a Sherlock intelligence battle against Charles Augustus Milverton, a blacksmith master. This is an excellent long runtime of the Jeremy Brett-Holmes series. In the film, Holmes's usual cannon appears as Inspector Lestrade and Ms. Hudson, though not Moriarty, but Charles Augustus is the biggest character. It's a real scraping thread with intrigue, emotion and suspense, an exciting final twist. This is a special Sherlock movie, but we find Holmes in love with a servant, kissing, weeping and even robbing. This time, along with the episode "Scandal in Boheme" with Irene Adler, the result is the only one that is loved by Holmes. Brett's performance, along with Peter Cushing, is the best Sherlock TV, while cinema is forever Basil Rathbone. Brett behaves like a resolutive, tough and impetuous detective. Here, Doctor Watson is not a comic, botcher and blurred stomach personified by Nigel Bruce, but he is a harsh and cunning partner incarnated by Edward Hardwicke, Brett's perfect counterpoint. Casting is frankly magnificent, a special mention for Robert Hardy, as ugly. Hardy, known today as the role of Cornelius Fudge in Harry Potter, is a veteran actor with forty years of career and more success, such as The 10th Kingdomdom and Winston Churchill. In addition, there are extractors with extraordinary performances, Nickolas Grace, Sophie Gordon, Serena Gordon, among others. The film becomes a colorful atmosphere, the streets of London and Baker Street's home are well-designed. The film is well directed by Peter Hammond, director of various episodes. It's a must for fans of Arthur Conan Doyle.
