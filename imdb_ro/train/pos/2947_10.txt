If you have not seen this, you do not know what you are missing. The first time you do it, you will be in pain on the floor that laughs so loudly, and you probably also get wet. It's HERE funny. There was no single comedy performance at this time, which I saw was superior or even approaching. So many classics lining, stories, and segways .. Drinking uncle at BBQ, Gi Joe, Mr. T, goony goo goo, ice cream man, you say any of these things to anyone who saw this performance and I bet you the money that will give them will not be able to keep a straight face and will burst into laughter or recite the rest of the dialogue from the act. classical!! Shame you can not get on DVD .. <br /> <br /> Rating 10 + out of 10
