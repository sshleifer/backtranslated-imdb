Yes, as the other commentators have already said, it can not be the L & H of the epoch, but it is far from being their worst work than the Stupid of the Twentieth Century ... I mean, Fox. This movie certainly has all the basic components for things to go wrong for boys. But their serious approach and determination makes them funny. They do not play it for laughter like the other comedians, but they take their work and the situation seriously, and that is the essence of their eternal humor. In this film, they are facing some basic issues that any of us may be experiencing today, namely work-related stress. First of all, we would have been checked by a doctor and he will prescribe a certain need for rest and can stay at sea. Here comes the surreality of all this. L & H always takes a most plausible set of circumstances and exaggerates it, but it's never known to be incredible, except maybe once. This makes us laugh because we can relate to their own challenge and attempts to escape. This makes Stan and Ollie universal in their appeal. In this film, all these ingredients are presented in a deliciously artistic and graceful way. It's not the best compared to their previous work, probably because it was the last movie they made for Roach because he wanted to mirror "big" studios and go to make exclusively the features and also, wanted to hurry and complete his contractual obligations. BIG MISTAKE! He should have stayed together and continue for another five years. What the world may have missed in not considering this as an option. Watch, laugh and enjoy this as their last great interpretation.
