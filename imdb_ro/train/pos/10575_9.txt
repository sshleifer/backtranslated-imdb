Fast-paced, fun, sexy and spectacular. Cagney is always great. Blondel fascinates you with her intelligence and energy. It is obvious that this is a pre-censorship film, through the suggestions of the script, the costumes and the way they touch each other. And bikini before it's bikini! This is not a closed fun for everyone. I do not understand John Garfield's problem. Does it matter whether or not it is in this movie? If it is, the screen is so short that it is essentially a support. You have to watch him with cadres to find him even if he's there. I'm a big fan of Cagney, but I've never seen him. I found Turner Classics. I found her with a great accident. Stay back and enjoy the walk!
