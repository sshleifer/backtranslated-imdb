It all starts with a series of theft of objects seemingly unconnected to a hostel for students on Hickory Road, London. Concerned about her sister, who is the maid there, Miss Lemon asks Hercule Poirot to look at this matter. He agrees, but soon the stakes will become bigger when a girl, who has recognized that she is responsible for most (not all) thefts, is found murdered. "Hickory Dickory Dock" is a solid brain exercise without being as complicated as "one, two, my shoe buckle". Killing, stealing and smuggling with diamonds are the crimes involved, and the final twist that binds everything together is only revealed in the last 2 minutes! The characters are exciting, especially the psychology student Colin McNabb and the mysterious American girl Sally Finch, inspector Japp has his funny moments (probably in the closest this series came to "toilet humor"), and Miss Lemon becomes an integral part of the story than usual.
