I liked this movie from the opening sequence to the end. I found the director / actor's style to address directly to the public / audience very involved. What seemed to me most exciting and refreshing in this film was ignoring - and thus provoking - stereotypes of gender and class. The idiosyncrasies of the characters are portrayed as strong points, and the absence of judgment - and their acceptance of their characters and others - allowed me to embrace them and to let them into their world. Without preaching and intelligence and gentle and loving humor, this film has the power to open new possibilities and gives hope to a world where people see and accept each other as unique and precious individuals. I look forward to more offers from this creative and talented director.
