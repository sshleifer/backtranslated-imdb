After watching the WWI espionage thriller, Madame Lili (1969), who starred Julie Andrews on television this afternoon, I realized that I saw a thrilling spy of WW1. All I remembered was that it was produced by Dino De Laurentis. It took just a short search on IMDB to find Fraulein Doktor. Once I recognized the title, the memories flooded. It is, for his time, a fairly well-grounded story that revolves around real events such as Kitchener's death and the German offensive of 1918. He also has a spy woman who is more credible than Julie Andrews ! As with other reviewers, the first and strongest memory was the well-done battle scenes and men and horses in gas masks. If you have an interest in war films and especially World War I, it's a movie that's worth seeing if you have the opportunity.
