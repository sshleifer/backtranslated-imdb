For the first three seasons, Sabrina was a hidden gem on TGIF (and later afternoon afternoon school). Each episode had a maniac, an angry energy, and a rapid stimulation of fire, which surpassed the occasional joke. Melissa Joan Hart gave a special talent for physical comedy, especially in her facial expressions. The two aunts, playing "righteous men" or as righteous as two witches, would have had a time of extraordinary comedies and a general chemistry with Hart. Salem, as a spoked cat, was free to take in any crazy scheme he was interested in, and he could laugh and take it all in step, because he was, after all, a cat spoken. Sabrina's friends rounded up the social experience at school, where they also hosted the typical "cheerleader" and the "totalitarian principal." Perhaps the most interesting and unique aspect of the show was the ability to merge pop culture (eg Jerry Springer), the archetypal human condition / morality (for example, the importance of friendship, the spirit of Christmas) and the literal representation of of such related metaphors in the magic field. Unfortunately, like many other shows throughout the age of television, the show reached its peak in the first three years, coinciding with Sabrina in high school. Beginning with season four, moving to college marked what would become a precipitous decline in the overall quality of the show, especially when the writers chose to introduce Josh as Harvey's rival and build a slim apology for Aunts Hilda and Zelda remain on the screen as key players. The last season Sabrina is working on in a pop culture magazine was unequivocally disappointing. However, in the end, Sabrina (especially the high school years) remains a unique entry as a situational hybrid comedy with magical elements that raises it above the tiring tariff produced in this genre every year.
