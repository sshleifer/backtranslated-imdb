For what it is, "Victor Vargas's lifting" is as close to perfection as a movie can get. Being an absolute genius from a new auteur or just one of those lucky mixes where everything clicked (perhaps one of each), this simple simple love of urban life, the first love film, embraces young characters with a deep which you can read almost their minds. The film begins with a strong "street" flavor, but cuts its way into an adventure of the Latino family, and then focuses on a story that tells volumes about the youth's uncertainty and the deeply natural desire to love someone else. From my experience, so little has happened (cast of tyros, novice director, etc.). Praised by critics, but not for everyone, "Victor Vargas's Growth" is recommended to individuals and realists in simple stories rich in humanity. (A)
