This movie starts suddenly, it has a few moments in the middle, but it generally moves a bit, has some very good moments, and then it is at the end of Act 3. I was able to see this for the first time at LA 2 times (with 2 different terminations). Jason Lee is a star, but he is not the leader of tomorrow. He is humorous and possesses his own, but is better served as a supporting actor. Julia Stiles has "ok" in a comedy role, new to her, but she does not "steal" this movie, as should a star of her caliber. For an actress who has so much potential (10 things, Save the Last Dance, O), it's hard to watch her continue to play roles that are so "medium," and then not to take the role and run away with (as Daniel Day-Lewis did in "Gangs"). Selma Blair is also a good young actress and has an "ok" job. I did not expect an academy to give her a performance, and she did not, but her performance was appropriate. Chris Koch offers another movie that is "above average". Perhaps the problem is in the scenario more than anything else. I liked this movie! But it's not a movie where you go and say ... "It was great!" ... This "story" has been done so many times and was nothing new here. The rehearsal dinner scene was probably the best in the movie, and Larry Miller offers incredible performance in a supportive role (it could be the best surprise of the movie). If you want to go see a movie that makes you laugh a few times and have a nice evening, I can still recommend this movie, but if they did not change the end ... again ... go out during the church scene , or you will definitely be disappointed.
