I have never noticed that four hours pass quite fast as when I saw this movie. This film restores the power and art of Hamlet that she was always meant to have. Even those so famous speeches are made in new and inventive ways. And the cast is incredible, Brannagh the brightest star. It is his charisma, the power and command of the role that defines the film. Making a complete and complete version fills so many holes and allows a new appreciation of the tragedy despite its length. Where a dark, dark castle is expected, we are treated to a sumptuous eye feast. The only darkness comes from Hamlet himself, as he should. Well, it's worth the time, all four hours.
