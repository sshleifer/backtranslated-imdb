For Cowboy Urban John Travolta plays one of the strongest alpha males ever portrayed on the big screen. He is a pretty decent child who leaves his father's farm and strikes for the big city of Dallas, where his uncle, Barry Corbin, promised to find him in the petrochemical industry. In 1980, which began to boom and Texas was definitely a growing spot in the US. Travolta does a good job of making the audience care for his character, which when you come to him is a sexist pig. He meets and marries Debra Winger with the same background, but he has some ideas that women should not be the shadows of their people. And when he's beating him at Gilley's mechanical bull, a man's game, that's for him. Scott Glenn, who is a former convict, works on Gilley and this film has been his discovery role. He's a real snake in Urban Cowboy, gets Travolta's goat with one glance and moves on Winger. Travolta, in turn, deals with a rich girl, Madolyn Smith Osborne, who collapses at Gilley. <br /> <br /> Despite the characters, Urban Cowboy was really a gigantic ad for the world's largest tonky honky. Gilley's no longer exists in the Texas suburban community in Pasadena, but memories are alive. And the best thing about Urban Cowboy is the wonderful score of the country / western pieces that were featured in the movie. I'm not sure if some songs have not been written specifically for Urban Cowboy, but it's the only reason I can think of why the Film Academy ignores the musical aspects of this film. I liked more like Johnny Lee's Looking for Love, if it was written specifically for this movie, it's a shame that he was not nominated for the best song. I liked the character of Debra Winger best in this movie. She does not lose a trace of femininity, but she stands up to Travolta and does it in style. And this review is dedicated to the still unknown woman, who will be one day the first female bull in the Professional Bull Riders.
