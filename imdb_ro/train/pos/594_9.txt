13 days for Glory tells the traditional story with sympathy for the Mexican view. The major issue of this film was that while James Cowie, James Arness, played persuasively as Jim Bowie, the other actors in the distribution of Brian Keith (Davy Crocket) and Lorne Greene (Sam Houston) were too old . > <br /> Raul Julia played General Antonio Lopez of Santa Anna with the grace and dignity of the professional soldier who eventually won the battle. The scene in which officers have officers for failing to mount a guard and hinder a sorocch is one that writers did not understand. Failure is a major remission in the army. Santa Anna was in her prerogatives to be upset. River Julia wore the poor writings through the scene. Kathleen York was an impressive Susannah Dickinson, a woman who deserves to be remembered for her courage. However, Kathleen York may have been reminded that, as Dickinson has welcomed from Pennsylvania, it probably does not sound Southron.
