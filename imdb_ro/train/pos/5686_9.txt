* Wonderland SPOILERS * July 1, 1981: five people, Ron Launius (Josh Lucas), Susan Launius (Christina Applegate), Billy Deverell (Tim Blake Nelson), Barbara Richardson (Natasha Gregson Wagner) Joy Miller who are sleeping and brutally knocking their steel pipe heads in their home at 8763 Wonderland Avenue, Laurel Canyon, LA. Only Susan survives. The main suspect: John Holmes (Val Kilmer), the former king of porn, the owner of a 30 cm long chicken, and now a desperate addict. Two investigators, Luis (Frankie G.) and Sam Nico (Ted Levine), are investigating the case and trying to crack it with a witness who claims to know that at least John took part in crimes , David Lind (Dylan McDermott), Barbara's boyfriend, and trying to get a witness from Dawn Schiller (Kate Bosworth), 19-year-old Holmes and Susan, who unfortunately does not remember anything the name of Eddie Nash (Eric Bogosian), a major drug addict (who is always around ladies like Barbie (Paris Hilton) appears as a suspect planner of the Wonder Massacre. But what happened that night? And could Sharon (Lisa Kudrow), John's wife, know something about it? "Wonderland" is a deeply learned thriller, a desperate love story and a story about the sad decline of a man in one; there is an intelligent use of "Rashomon" technique (we see the events of that day and night with the eyes of David, John, Dawn, Susan (though very short) and Sharon), a beautiful direction and a great scenario, but rather convincing for the shows, especially for Kilmer's, who plays in the central scene with Holmes, Lucas, "hopeless, tortured, sometimes childish, whose Launius is oddly allusive, the powerful Zoran of Kudrow Sharon and Bosworth." Wonderland: 9/10.
