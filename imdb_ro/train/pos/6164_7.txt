Are we making "nasties video" again? Under the guise of a big-size 8MM digital remake, this is quite a ride. Unfortunately, there is too much a story, and sometimes this becomes a travel journey as our heroine searches for spiky stains in Paris, Hamburg and Amsterdam. However, I am quite churlish for the "depraved" scenes, including everything from hot wax, rough whipping and raw sex to drowning, decapitation and others. These scenes are immaculate and Bruno is a sin and his budget can not stretch to make all the personal creatures introduced become more than mere cartoons.
