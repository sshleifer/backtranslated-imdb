One of the best kung fu movies, but not as impeccable as we had hoped for after the brilliant reviews. The film starts pretty well, the jokes being visual enough to translate the linguistic barrier (which is rarer than you think for that era) and to make the non-fight dialogue sequences acceptable (for a kung fu film, this is a great compliment). Unlike other Chinese action films, which have always been epic pieces or (following Jackie Chan I's police drama), Pedicab Driver gives us a look at contemporary rural China. Unfortunately, in the last 1/3 of the movie, it takes a dark tragedy in the dark melodrama, which I thought was useless. The action is good in general, having a duel between Sammo and 1/2 of Shaw's only 2-star Shaw, Kar-Leung Lau, and then fighting at the end with that taller guy who always plays the evil guy of Jet Li. There are only 20 minutes of fighting here, which is standard, but what bothers me is the obvious acceleration of the camera cadres. I understand they have to shoot half-speed to avoid hurting each other, but there are smooth editions and then that's it. She really takes away the fights when it is obvious this movie has been confused with. That said, if you like kung fu movies, my opinion here will not discourage you, and if not, you just lost 2 minutes of your life, read that.
