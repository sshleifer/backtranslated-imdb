An extra is called to play a general in a film about the Russian Revolution. However, he is no extra ordinary. He is Sergei Alexander, the former commander of the Russian army, who is now forced to relive the same scene in which he suffered a professional and personal tragedy to satisfy the director who was once a revolutionary in Russia and humiliated by Alexander . Now may be the time for this man to break his "ultimate victory" in the end. This is a powerful film with a meticulous direction of Von Sternberg, offering the greatest irony in Alexander's character in any way. Jannings deserved the Oscar for a very moving performance, playing the general at the top and the deepest valley. Powell offers sinister support as a revenge director, and Brent is perfect in her role with the face and movements that show so much expression as Jannings love. Around the shine. Rating, 10.
