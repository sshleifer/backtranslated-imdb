Silverlake Life, the vision here, is an absolutely amazing film about AIDS, and about a gay love affair. Some images are really very difficult to take, especially when someone is gay or afraid of AIDS, and probably for any sensitive person who cares about it. It's not easy to make a movie about such terrible illness and its consequences on the life of not only one but the two people. This film teaches you how to care for each other in such difficult times, but it does not get too morbid, it shows life at all times, reminding you that outside your theater or room, life goes on, no matter the destiny of some people be. The characters are incredibly bold, while we look at their intimacy in photographs that never exceed a very strict limit, never revealing anything too private or offensive. Children should not definitely watch this movie, but adults, whether they have to deal with such situations or not, should do it and will not regret the tears they have shed.
