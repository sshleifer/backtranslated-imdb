The turning point in "The Matador" is about half the movie, when Danny, a sophisticated man in Denver, sits on the balcony of the hotel in Mexico City, enjoying a quiet moment. Someone knocks at the door and knowing that Julian, the assassin who was paid, refuses to answer. But did she really do it? <br /> <br /> Richard Shephard, director of The Matador, portrays a character, Julian Noble, who has no redeemable qualities. In fact, I've already seen him in action, doing what he does best. When Julian meets Danny at the Camino Real bar in Mexico City, he shakes the beans and tells his new acquaintance what he really does to live. Danny, who came to sell his program to a Mexican company, but apparently struggling with a local suit that seems to be in front of getting the contract. Danny is a naive person who collapses with charisma and sweet charm by the smartest Julian. It is only a while later, on a cold winter night, that the killer appears at Danny's door, asking his friend to reward a favor and accompany him on a trip to Tucson. It is at this point that the secret that binds them together is revealed in an unexpected way. Pierce Brosnan, who acts against the guy, makes a huge contribution to Julian Noble's irreverence. Just to watch him walk through the hotel lobby in Speedo, and boots give the right impression of his character. Greg Kinnear, on the other hand, plays the right side of this odd couple. Hope Davis appears only in a few scenes, letting us complain why he did not stay longer. Philip Baker Hall appears as the connection between Julian and his missions. Richard Shephard leads with a style that works with his own material. The musical score is Rolfe Kent and David Tattersall's clear cinema improves everything.
