Since I first saw Anchors Aweigh in 1945, watching the video projector holds a lot of nostalgia for me. At the age of 15, it was easy to be attracted to the first of MGM Technicolor's greatest musicians. Now, probably, I'm most interested in thinking about the future career of top players. Although Sinatra made some negligible shortly after his appearance after Dorsey's days, as a soloist, it was his first major film appearance. As another spectator noticed, this seems to be almost a heating for On the Town. Sinatra would have had to work hard but his dance with Kelly is credible and he would do better in the following pairs. However, by observing his physique, it is easy to understand why he was caricatured like a string bean. Who would have imagined that over the course of a decade he would win a film prize and play more roles as a tough detective or a leader in the fight. Although Gene Kelly's character and dance dominated this film, his spectacular performance did not suggest that he would become a major creative force, almost the iconic figure for MGM musicians, where he developed a dance style complementary to that of Fred Astaire. Finally, it was strange to see Dean Stockwell face to face and remember that he would later play a killer in Compulsion, based on the 1920s killing of Leopold-Loeb. An additional note: Un commentator appreciated Betty Garrett's performance as an interest in Sinatra's love. Later he starred with him in "On the Town," but Pamela Britton was featured in this film.
