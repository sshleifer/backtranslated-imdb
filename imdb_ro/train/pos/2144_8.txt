A sweet and charming movie, Sunday? made me laugh and cry. At first appearance, Sugiyama-san was not appealing - a lofty salary, apparently dedicated to his family, but too easily captured by one face in a window. The subject of his obsession is distant and cold. But by the end of the movie, I was in love with him, with her, his wife and daughter, all dance instructors and dance students. This uncomplicated story of transformation and renewal is a small jewel that I would love to see again.
