This is a Finnish film this year, although Tango Kabaree is approaching. Director Lampela made a few years ago another beautiful film, called Rakastin ep√§toivoista naista (I was in love with a desperate woman) .Joki is really a beautiful movie from a Saturday afternoon in a small village / city. The actors are perhaps not so beautiful or beautiful, but behave nicely. I hope many of them get the statue JUSSI (Finnish OSCAR) in the coming spring. could do abroad.
