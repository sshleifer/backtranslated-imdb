One of the many Merrie Melodies cartoons that had the opportunity to entertain American movie moments during the Second World War, Bob Clampett's "An Itch in Time" describes a hobo flea settling on his dog Elmer Fudd. The little one turns into a real sadistic while doing a house on the back of the dog, but Elmer warns the dog: "Another spit and I'll make you bath!" Meanwhile, the fleas install the dog dynamite! * And that's not the end! I noticed that in a scene, Elmer reads a comic book containing Bugs Bunny and Porky Pig. Obviously, Elmer and Bugs played frequently, but Elmer never played with Porky (unless you count very short "Any Bonds Today?"). But for me, Elmer's thoughts about these other famous characters of the same genre underline the metaphysical nature of his world as though he knew of their existence in his universe, even if they did not appear in this cartoon. > Of course, I'm probably going too far in my analysis. I'm sure the cartoon was for pure entertainment, and it's definitely fun. Regarding the line "I would like to like", it sounds like something that the censors would not allow, but somewhat missed; I, for one, do not really know what it should sound like. Was it something sexual? Finally, if I thought I'd seen everything, I would have been tempted to look more than to do what the cat did (although it was a very good trick). <br /> <br /> * The guys behind these cartoons had a thing for TNT, did not they?
