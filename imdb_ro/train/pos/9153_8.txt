I finally came to see this after I heard great things about it. In fact, it exceeded my expectations. Considering the budget involved, it was a surprisingly competent and well-done film. Lack of finances has actually helped this film in a number of ways, especially given the plot. Like the Blair Witch project, this movie was all the better to be shot on film instead of film. Another bonus: While most low-cost horror films (even the best of the best) suffer from mediocre and unintentional hysterical attitudes, this film actually has a talented cast (one or two characters). The only thing missing from the film was an original story. It borrows a lot from more popular films such as "Deliverance" and "Turn Wrong," but if you are like me, movies of this nature never cease to be terrifying. In addition, the director keeps things interesting all the time. I would be very interested to see what the director would do with a larger budget and I feel that it will be just a matter of time before he learns ...
