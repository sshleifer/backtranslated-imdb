A very good movie and a true story. Dan Jansen the greatest skater ever. An exciting and beautiful movie that the whole family can enjoy. The story of Jane Jansens fight with cancer and Dan Jansen love for his sister. In an important promise made by Jansen to win a gold medal to prove that Jane's sister was right to believe in her talent in speed skating, she was justified. This image is worth it. I would like to make more movies of this quality. Thank you for a great movie with great actors and a great story. It is a very moving story about a beautiful family support and faith for their children and a special dream for the youngest son and sister.
