As an adult in the mid-1940s, I'm not even close to any of Nancy Drew's key demographics, but I was pleasantly surprised by the film this afternoon; so, I could say, were the sixty ladies with brown hair on my thread. The eldest, who left the theater right in front of me, praised the film in particular to 20 women (who said he saw the movie the previous evening and enjoyed it very much). Yet, in front of me, there were nine - count them, nine - ten year old girls lined up side by side, passing popcorn and warm dogs and candy back and forth and giggling the preview. Once the movie started, they immediately decided to look ... ... and did not make it as peep until the closing credits began to roll. This is not a perfect movie; he does not pay enough for the high school subtleties, he is not confident enough of his own tone, and her thugs are just hair too far away to sometimes inept criticism. But the adaptation of source material is essentially respectful, the plot hangs quite well, and it easily moves between sins of excessive brutality and excessive modernization. Last but not least, Emma Roberts plays the movie with amazing grace - despite the fact that Josh Flitter is a gorgeous moment, this is Roberts' movie, and she shoots him nicely. Nancy Drew is Kristen Bell's great ancestor Veronica Mars, and the film is also the quiet descendant of Jodie Foster's early and undervalued Candleshoe. On the market today, it's a rarity: a family film that respects the intelligence of viewers. As such, it will not be the taste of everyone - but for what it is, it's the best movie of its kind in decades.
