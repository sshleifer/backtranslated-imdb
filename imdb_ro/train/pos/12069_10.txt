Yes, it's wrong - especially if you're in Hollywood movies that require many effects, a pure or fantastic story or a plot, and you can not really think. Roeg's films are for smart film and Insignificance is a perfect example. Characterizations are brilliant, the story is excellent, but like all Nic Roeg's films - you're thinking at all levels about aspects of reality that you would never have seen before. His films always make you think and, personally, I like this in a movie. So, do not expect to get out of this movie and feel happy, because you're likely to be disappointed. But I think he's excellent.
