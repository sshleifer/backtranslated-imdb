I agree with everyone who says that this series was the best of the spy type. My husband and I were captivated when he first broadcast in the US and watched each episode. I tried at that time to buy the series (I did everything), but WGBH said it was not available. I even thought I'd write to Ian Holm to see if he could have a copy! Like others, I bought and read the Deighton series (partly to understand the complicated plot.) If the original version will ever be available on DVD, I will be among the first to create a copy. Ian Holm's representation of Bernard Samson, vulnerable but courageous, was amazing. (He is always amazing.)
