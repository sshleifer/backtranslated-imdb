I'm certainly not in the target audience for this movie. I am a 50-year-old man who has only recently been in the world of independent film. This happened quite accidentally, with the discovery of a movie called Late Cribers one night on television. The first two things I noticed about this movie were that they were 1) technically amateur and 2) brilliantly written. When I read an interview with the director in the local newspaper and he said that one of his influences was Clerks, I started to become interesting. When he said his main influence was the station agent, a movie I saw on DVD a week ago, I decided I had to go check it out. The result could be described in the same lines as clerks, although the two films are not wise. Both films suffer from technical blunders that are overcome by stunning writing. While officials are a day in the life of a man who has nothing in his life and is afraid to ask difficult questions about him and his situation, Less Like Me is about a man who seems to be forced to be constantly occupied, it is always running in some way or another, filling his life with small things so that he will never have to deal with the big ones. The themes and ideas of this film are powerful and painful. I can tell you that since I grew up, not much has changed, young people still have the same problems they always have. The writer is dressed in these problems and themes of the most modern vernacular, craftsmanship, and makes them totally credible things. Regarding indie cinema, this can not be technically perfect, but from an artistic one, it is very close.
