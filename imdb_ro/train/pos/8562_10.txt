I liked! The intrigue was strange, Drew Barrymore and DC who made it strange for both of us. Drews' actress was met in places, but she might be in her life at the time. Dennis Christopher, as a psychiatrist, was pretty cool and as usual does everything he can to do - I'm a Dennis fan, so I bought the DVD. I'm not finished! that strange animatronic red skeleton looked like it would have been from movie movies, which is OK I guess, but it could have been more. <br /> <br /> ... and the whole thing with the knife - if it was uncomfortable why they did not get out of it? <br /> <br /> Was it really confusing when it was strange Doppelganger or DC or was Dennis all the time? Because Doppelganger did it with Dennis and Patrick. In scenes with Patrick, if Dennis was like Doppelganger, then I think Patrick would notice. The music was OK, but in tedious places the whole orchestral score seemed to rotate around a theme, but this theme was overwritten. A great mix of blood and free pictures of Drew Nude. <br /> <br /> All in all a bit of a GPM-Guilty Pleasure movie. Do not read too much in it, do not look for secret messages and a fantastic script because you will not find it. There are a few moments of diamond and goofs enormous - See it and they just have a bit of food with it!
