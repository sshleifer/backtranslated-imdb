The Black Woman (1989) is a TV adaptation of Susan Hill's fantastic classic story, published just a few years earlier by the film. Unfortunately, this movie was not released on DVD and, as far as I know, was deleted on VHS. The availability is in direct contrast to its popularity among those who know about horror movies. The story revolves around events in a seaside community at the beginning of the twentieth century, where a young applicant is sent by his firm to conclude the business of a recently deceased widow who died in her isolated marshland estate. What she believed would be an ordinary and perhaps boring task turns into a nightmare when she discovers that the old man was haunted by her death and that the ghosts of her past are not content to rest. The story is spoken in a subtle but concise way, never being indulgent, brilliant or exaggerated. Of course the budget may have contributed to the meaningless approach, but it's just what the story needs and why it works so well. It's what you do not see scare. That being said, there is a particularly frightening scene, which is based on vision and works to perfection. I watched this movie during the day and still gave me nightmares almost a week later. If you like to be horrified, do what you need to keep and watch a copy of the Black Woman.
