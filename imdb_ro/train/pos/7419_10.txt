Based on the preview that I saw, I went to the "Shower" waiting for a sweet comedy; what I discovered was a deeply dramatic drama of family life, referenced in some of the most luxurious photographic images I've ever had the privilege of seeing. In addition, a later reflection has made me appreciate steep cuts in past scenes (in northern China's rural area and in Tibet's high plain): is not that how memory often works? When I'm here in the next year, I'm in a landscape of the past, just like that. I would not just recommend this movie, I would love it between two or three more beautiful films I saw him at 60. By the way, a few years ago, another Asian "comedy" was released in the United States as "We Dance?" (Japanese). As with the shower, the preview did not give the slightest indication of the depth of that film, which turned out to be a subtle psychological study (though filled with funny moments). Is there a fear from distributors to make movies look too "important" or "deep" to appeal to US spectators?
