I think it's a beautiful movie; I think it's a Romanian film through landscapes and atmosphere; I think it was not meant to be sensual (sensuality is a result, not a goal); I think it is very natural; I think it is human; I think it was interesting; I think the actors did not make me think ... I'm not thinking (I'm not Sean Connory & co), the movie is not a buster block, I'm like the ... normal ppl movie that can act ...; I think the movie has reached its intent; I think it made me feel things (or feel it again :)); I think I'm not objective; I liked it a lot ... I know that.
