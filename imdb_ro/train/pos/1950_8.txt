Diane Keaton sang a few "heavy" parts in many years on the big screen, but is known mostly for "light and fluffy" with Woody Allen, such as Annie Hall. She deserves an Oscar for the best actress in a drama for this effort, and it does not matter exactly what the competition was in the year she was first introduced. Try to find a scene that does not appear. And it was a heavy drama, exhausting in its rhythm and replay, action, all at maximum speed. Make-up has made it as young as possible, and it matched the 30-year age group even in close-ups, but she played at half age and at a very fast pace. The film, as a whole, was pretty well done, staged and shot well with a strong cast, but Keaton carried the cargo.
