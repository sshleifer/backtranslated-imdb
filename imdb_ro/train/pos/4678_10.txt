I chose to watch this Tribeca film based on Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen and considered one of the best films of the festival. Both top actors offer a sensible, rounded performance that seems to fit the characters personally. The director has done an excellent job, bringing the characters and the story to life with a skill that is usually not seen in a production for the first time. An interesting aspect of this film is love for woodworking and the city of New York (Brooklyn in specific). The film revolves around family furniture, doing business and weaving the delicate cinema and brooklyn cinema life? again kudos to the director on this fine choice. This is a jewel and I would recommend it with all my heart (I'm sure it will make it on screen).
