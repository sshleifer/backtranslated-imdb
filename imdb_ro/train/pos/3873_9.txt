This movie is easy, fun and beautiful. The lightning is absolutely gorgeous and the colors remind him of Vermeer's paintings convincingly. This is a sentimental comedy at the highest level, above US and French standards, and probably better than English. <br /> <br /> Each character touches, and the interpretation is close to perfection. Isabelle Blais is splendid, Sylvie Moreau is better than in the Catherine series, Stéphane Gagnon is charming, Emmanuel Bilodeau is great in his strange role, and Geneviève Laroche is the best perfect friend! <br /> <br /> Continue hours before finding a negative comment on this movie, give it a chance and add your own review.
