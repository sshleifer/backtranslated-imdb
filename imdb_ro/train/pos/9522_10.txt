This is Tom Hanks' first film, which I got the privilege of seeing in the theater, though he is my favorite. When I heard he was going to play a hit man, I was a little overwhelmed thinking "Maybe Mr. Hanks get this out"? And he did it with great high. This 1930s depression era is a loyalty, redemption, and a way you do not want your children to stand by. Tom Hanks leads a starring piece like Michael Sullivan. Being the man of the family and the secret life of the contract killer for the nominated Oscar Paul Newman. This film, Tom Hanks, is based on reaction and gaze rather than dialogue, which offers a knock-out performance. One evening of one of his jobs, Michael Michael Jr.'s son, played by the newcomer, Tyler Hoechlin, witnesses the blow. And Michael Sr.'s partner in crime, scene actor, Daniel Craig, can not have this information. So he beat Michael's son and wife, except Michael Jr. So they are heading for Chicago to get Conner Rooney (Paul Newman's son, Rooney). Drama and intense plot really get thicker from their father, trying to put things in shape, even if the son is heading for a walk. During this deadly trip, someone hired a shot for Michael Sr. The assassin would be the photographer of the deceased Harlen Maguire, played by a jurist Jude Law. <br /> <br /> The film will feel the old days. And with the Oscar nominated to Thomas Newman to go with him, you can only appreciate this Oscar-winning film, Sam Mendes. Stay so and enjoy the wild walk.
