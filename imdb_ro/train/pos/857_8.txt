Greetings again in the dark. The long awaited comedy, twisted by writer / director Richard Shepard, is a party for actor Pierce Brosnan. The bond disappeared. This new guy is something else entirely! They read that Shepard believed that Brosnan was too much a boy for this role of plum, but Brosnan proves to be the perfect Julian Noble, "Facilitator" ... and it's nothing but beautiful! Do not underestimate how to turn humor into this. If you go, wait for punch lines and gags for all kinds of sex, killing, religion, sports, business, and anything else you think politically incorrect. Brosnan takes an excellent script on another level with his wonderful facial gestures and physical movements. Even sitting on a hotel bed (with or without sombrero) is a joy to look. Greg Kinnear is the right guy to Brosnan's comedy and has a depth and a comedy time to make this partnership click. Hope Davis has a minor but subtle role in supporting Kinnear's wife (who is her name "Bean"?), Which happens to be a little excited when she has a facilitator in her room. <br /> <br /> The visuals and settings are perfect - including a bullfight, a racing track and a suburb of Denver. And how often do we get The Killers and Xavier Cugat on the same soundtrack? This is definitely not for everyone, but if the sense of humor is a little downtown and you like risky filming, it could be for you.
