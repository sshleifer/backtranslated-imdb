If I did not read Nabokov and knew nothing about chess, I could only see "Luzhin's Defense" as a movie. <br /> <br /> It works very well as one of my favorite 'romantic sports' genres. Chess comes alive as a more difficult competition than in, say, "Bobby Fischer's Search", showing how much hard work can be playing, which requires thinking, training, resistance and planning. I really liked the special effects on the chess board as they expect an alternative play. Through feminist director Maureen Gorris (from "Antonia"), Emily Watson with her big blue eyes gradually strengthens her transformative relationship with John Turturro's unique, mindless chess genius. Settings in Italy and Hungary are beautiful. <br /> <br /> (Original Writing 5/27/2001)
