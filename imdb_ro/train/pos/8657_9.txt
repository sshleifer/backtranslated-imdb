it's amazing that so many people who know they have not seen this little jewel. everybody I went back to her came back with the same reaction: What a great movie! I never really cared for Brad Pitt (although he turns 12 monkeys and the Fight Club show for improvement), but his performance in this film as a psycho is nervous, dark and directed to the target. All the others in the film offer excellent performances, and the slow and deliberate rhythm of the movie greatly increases the procedure. the sense of horror for the characters continues to grow as they come to realize what really happened. The only thing that keeps this from a 10 in my book is that, compared to what came before, the end is a bit too long and overlapping. but this is the only defect I can find in classical worship. If you check this movie, try getting the cut-sheet cut-off for the best viewing option. <br /> <br /> rating: 9
