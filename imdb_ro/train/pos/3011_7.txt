One of the best movies Vance manages more on an interesting plot and an artful direction of none other than Michael Curtiz. This time, a forgotten general financier is found dead - shot in the head - in his locked and vaulted bedroom on the upper floor. Philo Vance, hearing the situation as he prepares to go to Italy, decides to end his vacation and try to solve what he thinks is a crime and what everyone else is thinking of a suicide. William Powell is just as friendly with a Philo Vance, as you will find. He does not seem to press on and is always very smooth in what he says and does. Powell is helped by a bunch of talented actors - first-class actors and actresses like Mary Astor as a niece who hated her uncle, Ralph Morgan as the secretary of the dead, Paul Cavanaugh as the winning singer, Arthur Hohl the mysterious assassin, Helen Vinson next door, keeps blonde and two very good shows by James Lee as Chinese and Portuguese chef Eugene Palette as a pungent police detective. Add in the mix a wonderful comedy line by Etienne Girardot as a public forensic writer who is always missing his table. This is the depth of the suspects and a story that has many twists and turns that make the Kennel Criminalistic Case a quick and moving mystery.
