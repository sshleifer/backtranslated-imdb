As in his previous film "In a Glass Cage," Agust√≠ Villaronga realizes an intense and very poetic canvas that is even more refined visually than its predecessor. This is one of the most visual and haunting images you may ever see. The intense drama, intensity and subtlety of violence threatens melodrama or farcism, but never enters it. In this way, he makes a girl almost impossible: to be so overburdened and yet so painfully restricted, to be so charged and yet so undervalued, and even the explosive finals are the virtuous feasts of the eye. Fearless, gorgeous and very tense ... this movie is simply gorgeous!
