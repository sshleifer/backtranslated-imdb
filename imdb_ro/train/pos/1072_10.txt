I would like to comment on the series as a great effort. The story line, though requiring some improvement, was pretty good, especially in Season 1. Season 2 became more of a strange show and lost the original DA charm. The season a story line was more exciting, an easy part for life from pony jam while a serious plot manticore focused on banning the X series. We look forward to new seasons, in fact they are still. I hope the FOX guys and DA production team realize that a lot of ppl is still waiting for YES to make a comeback. Even after 2 years of cancellation, DA can do great if it worked properly and I think a name like James Cameron should take this challenge.
