I really love Miikes' movies about Yakuza, which I saw two years ago and really made my head. I've never seen something sick and twisted. The story is good and the actors do their things very well. I have not seen the British or Japanese version, but I have to say that I think the German DVD is a little censored. If you have not already seen the movie and live in Germany, it would be better to watch a DVD from Nederlands or Austria. The I-ON DVD contains lots of harsh and ugly scenes, but at the showdown I felt there was something missing about one or two very short scenes. Everything is a good movie perverted with crazy characters and a high level of violence, that I like Miike for!
