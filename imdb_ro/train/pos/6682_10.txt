I saw this in theaters and I absolutely worshiped him. Geoffery Rush gave the best performance as a super villain I've ever seen from Gene Hackman as Lex Luther. Kel Mitchel and Paul Rubens were a heavenly service. This movie was presented to me by William H. Macy, who is now one of my favorite actors. Hank was great as Blue Raja, and I especially loved the character was not really British. The scene with him and telling his mother that he was a superhero almost brought tears to my eyes. I liked the fact that The Bowler spoke with the ball. Some of the funniest things involved Stiller and the fake character of his brother Furious, and the fact that his threats and planes were totally insane and that they never made any sense. I could barely stop myself from applauding when he said "fraculater, Freinken-puss", it was said. But one of the things I liked most was the fact that Captain Amazing actually dies in the movie. I really recommend this film for every occasion and I give my own staff with two fingers.
