With Ralph Bakshi, most of his films seem to be like two-edged swords. You will get something wonderful from it, but only if you put yourself in front of the stupidity and the useless noise. Lord of the Rings was a great adaptation of the story, which probably did not always shine in the animation department. Fire and ice are a great achievement from Bakshi in terms of animation. The rotogravure is much more detailed, and the animation has a vibrant look on it. You will still get some of the stubborn cells and backgrounds that are slightly blurred, but the whole picture has certainly become better than Bakshi's last fantastic epic. The animation has almost a realistic-naturalistic style and, unlike LOTR, where this style has often contradicted real content, the unique atmosphere of the film improves here. Unfortunately, the movie fails to create a meaningful story from its simple set-up, and in fact, most of the character's motivations are rather blurry. Lorn and Tigra are easy cases, but even Necron's main character was hard to follow, not to mention Guy with Furry Face Mask (also known as "Guy"). Even though most of the voice actors were fit, there are strange strange oddities in the audio department, and Tigra sounds very terrible every time they cry. However, I believe that the value of inherent entertainment goes unnecessarily to the wrong execution of the plot line. The character's dressiness is something you will never find, but it helps to remind you that perhaps this movie is not even meant to be taken too seriously. It is still a cool and very funny.
