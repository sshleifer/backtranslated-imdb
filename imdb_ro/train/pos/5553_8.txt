A slow but beautiful story of the American revolution. Griffith's story seems to be much less difficult than in the past, and his painting work is fully integrated into action. Lionel Barrymore is an absolute pig, Neil Hamilton is poor but cute and Carol Dempster is ... well, Carol Dempster is the biggest part of what's wrong with Griffith at this time, but she does not appear quite often to slow down rhythm and drama. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind that trivia for this movie says it originally came in just over two hours when it was released for the first time, but there is no discount running for more than 90 minutes. However, the launch of the DVD was presented at a lower rate of fps that increases tension and brings it back in just over two hours. Much better in stories than sound versions, such as PATRIOT. While not even in the best Griffith league, such as WAY DOWN EAST and BROKEN BLOSSOMS, a great way to spend a few hours.
