I almost did not rent this because of all bad comments, but I did anyway. I thought it was like darkness, which I liked too. The only part I hate about the tooth ferry was the two brothers of the red neck at the gas station. They were funny and the dialogue made me laugh, but that was not a comedy. He destroyed the movie for me because it was useless. The rest of the movie was the way it should be a horror film or suspense. Make-up was good and I've seen worse movies than that. It was a simple story with credible action. It's not the most frightening or weirdest movie, but I was not checked or wanted to be refunded after I saw it. On DVD there were previews of other movies that look good and I'll check them out.
