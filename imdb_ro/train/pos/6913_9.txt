As a community theater actor who works hard but does not take a very serious attitude, I am always amused by those who treat him as a great art. This movie distorted "Actor's Craft" ruthlessly while doing a lot of good laughs. A backyard actor for a movie has a likeness to the dictator. When the dictator dies of a heart attack from too much beverage and food, the actor is kidnapped and forced to play the "role of a life" by the neo-Nazi chief of the secret service. He plays it on the handle, makes the dictator's girlfriend fall in love with him and vice versa, and turns the tables to his beautiful captors. A lot of big shots from the rulers, a lot of good work by some unknown actors, especially the housekeeping staff and two members of the palace guard, and the countless cameos abound. Sammy Davis Jr. makes it himself, Jonathan Winters plays a semi-retired American businessman with something else to do, and Raul Julia, Sonia Braga and, above all, Richard Dreyfuss are exceptional. but has a lot of beautiful locations (in Brazil), a humorous screenplay and good actors who do their thing and show that they really have fun and do not go through the usual existential anxiety about what the game is just playing!
