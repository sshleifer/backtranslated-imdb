Misfits at a military school? Hmmmm, it sounds funny, maybe offensive to some. You have the characters there, the Arab thief, the crazy adolescent, the intelligent mouth, the smoker and do not forget, the guy who burns things up. Throw into a wreck no nonsense Sergeant, a homosexual sergeant and a professor of sexy ammo and make a crazy movie adventure. I've seen this movie and it's funny because the comedy rotates around that if you try to work together, things are done. That band of students at the Weinberg military school was here because, as Sgt Liceman quotes "because you are escaping, the embarrassment of your families and communities, it is ashamed." One of Ralph Macchio's previous performances before Karate Kid and My Cousin Vinny, with appearances from Barbara Bach, also touches this film for adolescents and young adults. A good soundtrack keeps the movie on the move.
