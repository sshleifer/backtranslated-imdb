This is a great movie, show what our government will do in other countries if we do not like their government. This is not as bad as what Reagan and Bush did in South America, but the US still has no problems with other countries like this. This film also demonstrates that American media risk government propaganda. That's exactly what they did to Aristide in Haiti. The reason why this coup against Chavez failed was that Chavez was elected with over 90% of the vote. This film is not just a political documentary, it would be an extraordinary movie if it was a drama, it's amazing that this is real. The other commentator is lying when he says that "Chavez faces the air waves", the private media is running anti-Chavez propaganda all the time.
