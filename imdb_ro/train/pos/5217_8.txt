I caught the movie late at night and I was pleasantly surprised. I can only imagine why this movie was not better known because the subject is very disturbing. But if you can deal with the subject of sexual abuse, it is a well acting, suspense and very interesting film. Both Richard Gere and Claire Daines are very good at it. And although the subject is not for the weak of the heart, the film does not go out of its way to be brutal either (such as 8mm, for example). I strongly recommend to anyone who enjoys serial killer and suspension films.
