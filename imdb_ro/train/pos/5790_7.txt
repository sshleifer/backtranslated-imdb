Wow! All I can say is that if Elizabeth Montgomery is the enemy (she speaks Russian), then I will surrender right now. In her short skirt, top boots and busty line, she is a real babe, even if the zombie-like eye shadow comes and goes. This 30 minutes is undoubtedly the most sexy of the series. Take note of the realistic and revealing fight with Bronson until he kills his chin on his chin, destroying the fun. Okay, maybe I should leave my hormonal response. This is half an hour very well produced by that undervalued force behind the success of the series, Buck Houghton. Of course, manufacturers want to lead the third season with a higher average input. It is America's nuclear-holocaust post (we know because it is part of the invading force) and only the Bronson and Montgomery Americans are left behind, along with about twenty tons of realistic wreckage. They are wandering through shifts in alternating states, while we ask how long biology will take to trump politics, which, of course, eventually happens (fortunate Bronson). And that's about it. No real talk, except what Bronson has to say, which is quite exaggerated. However, the screenplay is still fun and bold for its time, even suggesting that not all Russian women looked like truck drivers (a popular Cold War stereotype ever since). rather curious that Bronson (Buchinsky) showed very glorious would be cast as Montgomery American and glossy as Slav. The appearance should be the reverse. I think the producers did not want to throw the American in the weaker physical role of the woman, regardless of appearances. However, there may be little fear or usual TZ atmosphere, however the episode remains very, very visible for 30 minutes.
