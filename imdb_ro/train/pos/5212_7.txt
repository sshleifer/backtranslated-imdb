STAR RATING: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning A particularly bad actor, accustomed to his appearance (now fades) rather than a strong dramatic talent , Richard Gere has always been quite curious about the American Hollywood scene, always a sure bet in the leading roles of man, who still has a notable presence today. But nowadays it seems that more has been established in this type of DVD directly / limited release roles and as such may seem to be better established in its forces now. He must rely on some of the strict work here as a cynical worker, Earl Babbage, such a designated worker for several hundred sex offenders in a US area who, along with his new prosthesis, Allison Allthrop (Claire Danes) to take in her last case, to take revenge in kidnapping a young woman while trying to forgive herself for a case he has failed in the past. This is a certain immersion in the darker part of mankind, trampling on the material, certainly not for those scandalous or those seeking light viewing. And as such, it's a pretty strong, convincing, steadfast film and not constrained by its direct budgeting. The only thing that pulls it back is the too-used jitter, the fast cutting sequences used in the most dramatic moments that look a bit later after a while. But it's still one of the most solid materials I've ever seen in Gere, making darkness more and more over the edge as it happens. ***
