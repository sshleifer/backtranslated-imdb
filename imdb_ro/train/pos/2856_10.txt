This is one of the movies that improves every time you see them. It is full of so many original and unconventional ideas that you always find a new detail. As in the later films of Sabu (I have not yet seen the "Unlucky Monkey," but the others are equally large), failure, chance and humanism play big roles. Cutting and editing are inventive and artistic, without the film being an "artistic" one, but a very fun one. When you compare it to "Run, Lola, Run", you have to keep in mind that "Dangan Ranna" was done a few years ago and has been shown on German TV since 1997 ... so it's more likely served as inspiration for Tom Tykwer's Movie, and not the other way round. In addition to the other reviews, I must add that I like to play and end very much. This movie is very fun in many ways, and it manages to broadcast a message without being annoying or pretentious.
