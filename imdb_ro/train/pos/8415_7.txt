If "Dr. Caligari's Cabinet" is the father of all horror films (and German Expressionist Cinema), this pre-World War movie is grandfather. The student student, hungry in an empty mantle, makes a deal with the devil - the devil gives him a golden bottom bag in exchange for "everything in this room." The devil chooses the student's reflection in his mirror. He goes with the student's doppelganger, who commits crimes for which the student is guilty. The film is ruined by some limitations stemming from the primitive technical state of the 1913 film; the plot cries for effects evenoschuro, but the film is necessarily practically shot in natural light. But the scene in which reflection comes out of the mirror still holds a wall. More exciting for the tendencies he has forced than for his own love, the student in Prague is still meritorious.
