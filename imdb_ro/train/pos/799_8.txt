he is the quintessential narcissist and manipulator; in this case, the portrayal of lawyer Tom Capano. Kathryn Morris is sympathetic to the victim, Anne Marie Fahey, but at first she is too much a victim. Sorry for the situation, but at the same time we become disgusted after seeing the victimization of several women (including Rachel Ward) as well. The sad part is where she gets help with self-esteem, and Capano killed her psychologist. Pretty hard to believe, but this is based on a true story. There is a Cameo with Olympia Dukakis (excellent) as Capano's mother. In general, an interesting story because it is based on a real crime and you will want to read the Ann Rule book to get the exact details. 8/10.
