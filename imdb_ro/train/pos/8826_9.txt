If you are amused by face-to-face travelers who are logical in a certain illogical situation, you will enjoy this capricious Spanish film of 8 minutes. A woman enters a small cafe. The scene seems to be common, but the counterman, the customers and two musicians seem somewhat oddly slim. Suddenly, the musicians play and a man begins to sing the title song, dancing over the whirlwinds of the table with musical comedy gestures. Customers, at the beginning of the real estate, intervene at intervals (bad, but all) with phrases from the song, read from paper slides in the palms. In addition, they are jumping and dancing (strangely but seriously) in choreographic movements such as reserve singers. But why ??? the woman asks. The answer is revealed that the solo jacket opens and sees what is tied to the chest - just before the explosive climax ... Even if you do not catch the songs (probably ironic) of the song, the perfect performance situation should give you a grin and a chicot ... I would love to see again!
