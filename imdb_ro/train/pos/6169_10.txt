Rohinton Mistry, the multi-layered novel, seemed unable to adapt to the screen, but the resulting film is full of passion, emotion, humor and pathos. The story moves somewhat slowly, but there is always something on the screen to capture the audience. The film captures a precise time and place with precise precision. All actors are Indians - few if they are known by the "western" audience - but they are a joy to watch, especially the little girl who acts very convincingly. Do not be fooled by the title and summary of the plot - this is a movie that will be seen on the big screen. We have a lot to learn from this.
