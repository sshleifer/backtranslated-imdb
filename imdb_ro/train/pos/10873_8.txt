This film really deserves more recognition than getting it. It is indeed an amazing and rich representation of blood, favors and loyalty in the world of crime. The film is beautifully shot and penetrates into all classical criminal themes such as betrayal and power. This movie is a movie goers movie, requires attention and understanding and full rewards in the end. He is the god of hong kong and is a welcome change, rather than another combination of wire, the martial arts epic, which seems to be the major contribution to the cinema world in Hong Kong and China. It has an arrangement of characters, actors and development, although it is fair to say that I had to look twice only to see what happens to some of the characters, because there were so many interactions in the film. In all 8/10 big characters, but there are characters that are not quite different and music did not do me at all and sometimes I felt they did not sync well with the action (there is action mode), so they lose some points for that.
