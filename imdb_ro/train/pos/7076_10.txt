A very powerful movie. Bruce is good and Brad too. As I think there are two cities lost in the list of receptionists on the list Bruce remembered. That means the woman was a real assurance, and she did her job. Well, the Novikov property seems to be working in this movie. However, I believe in Back to the Future Theory of Multiplicity of the Worlds. So Bruce could save the world, but not his world. In the theory of parallel worlds man can meet. And I think there is no problem in this regard. Here I do not agree with Dr. Brown from the back ... But the story of 12 Monkeys has its own beauty. Despite all these theories of a single world or of many or continuies, one can think that he is really crazy and the doctor - his girlfriend was just lost. A series of events that might make her believe he is from the future. The bullet - it might be a mistake, a falsification. Okay, I like this movie - I have to buy a DVD.
