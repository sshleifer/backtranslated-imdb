Another remarkable foreign movie that shines incredibly the endless harvest of Hollywood! This is a story about life and life. No, certainly not the perfect life so often presented in truly Hollywood movies, but rather real life, filled with real characters, each with strengths and weaknesses, just like the real people in our lives and in us per se. The dynamics of all these lives, interconnected inside the wall of this bath, and especially of its elderly owner, are magnificent, touching the hearts and causing great thought. Sit down, relax and have a simple and beautiful life. There is a true wisdom to be learned in this film, if you only open it to it. You will not be disappointed.
