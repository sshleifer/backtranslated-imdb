This effort is based on the true story of Jim Morris, a high school science teacher / baseball coach, who is inspired by his players to try for professionals and fulfill their dream of life to play in major. Dennis Quaid, great for sports movies, plays Morris with enough conviction to play the role, and the producers are doing a credible job of recreating real-world events that led to Morris's brief period of time as a rescue pitcher for the bad Tampa Bay Devil Rays. The first half of the film, dealing with the group of baseball players in high school (all looking too old to be in high school) is less effective and probably too long. On the whole, the film suffers from some stimulus problems and some additional subplots that we probably could have done without it. Still, it's still a pretty involved film with an inspired theme, which again proves that baseball is the national game for a reason. Grade: B-
