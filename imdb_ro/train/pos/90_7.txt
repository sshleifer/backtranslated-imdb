Yes, the poster is a horrible piece of work. I thought the movie was okay ... nothing really remarkable ... I was hoping it would be a hardcore tree and it would completely destroy life. But can not this happen to rich children now? Not for the son of a wealthy businessman who has big ball parties and has a beautiful manicured lawn on the front of the mini-mansion. No ... the baby is too good to live his life completely. After all, who will drive the new SUV and who will go to law school? <br /> <br /> Ah, the poor little rich children ... in their strange house, with their schools of grass ingots, ultra-clean houses and social parties ... what will the world do without them? <br /> <br /> I hope everyone becomes addicted to drugs, to lose their lives and get to jail ... so we can see movies that do not spin around the boys and poor girls in the surreal world.
