I like this movie because it has shown that they were not killing for fun but saving the ones they loved! Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom did a great job in portraying Ned and Joe. It has some inappropriate quick scenarios, but it has nothing but that. The language is very easy and sometimes it does not even know it is there. This movie shows that just because they are scandalous does not mean they are vicious criminals! I hope people watch this movie and learn about important moments in history like this one. There is one thing that fascinates me about this movie is that they have inspired her for their armor from a book that Ned was watching! Likewise, they remind people of their armor. I hope people will watch this movie and become interested in me.
