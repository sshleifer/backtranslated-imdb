LADY FROM SHANGHAI is proof that the great genius Orson Welles could lead a mainstream movie if he wishes. Compared to other artistic works, this film has only a moderate amount of craftiness and almost no esoteric element. The exception, of course, being the final scene in the mirror room, has widely accepted to be one of the biggest scenes in the history of the film. It is only worth the cost of a rent. The sweet surprised to have been a great watch on the pitch, the ripens played Rita Hayworth. It acts in the beginning and middle of the movie is so good that it made other actors appear as cartoons instead of characters. Even the great Mr. Welles.
