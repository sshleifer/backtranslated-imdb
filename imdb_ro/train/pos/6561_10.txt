Honestly, this is the best reality show anyone ever came to. To earn money, you need to be INTELLIGENT. Not only do you have to be courageous, athletic, cunning, etc. In fact, it takes skill. Not like these shows that are these days. And yet, they only have two seasons! Bull .. need to bring this show back! <br /> <br /> Although, it will be hard to shoot Anderson Cooper away from CNN. It was great. But seriously, it was an amazing show. You never knew who would go when. And it was so fun to try to figure it out for yourself! It was a show you could actually play if you wanted to bring it! MEING THE MEEL !!!!
