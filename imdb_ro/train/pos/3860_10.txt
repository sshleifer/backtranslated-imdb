In the Netherlands, a Gerard homosexual writer (Jeroen Krabbe) gives a lecture. He stays overnight with a beautiful woman Christine (Renee Soutendijk) and has sex with her (imagining she is a boy). He plans to leave the next day, but looks at a picture of Christine's beloved boyfriend, Herman (Thom Hoffman), and decides to stay to try it. Then things get bizarre. A great art house worth X hit in the US in 1983. Why was X rated? Let's see ... there is a strangulation, male and female frontal nudity, castration, mutilation, simulated sex, scene in a church with a cross that will shock most people, a homosexual sexual scene in a crypt ... and everything is comedy !!!!! Paul Verhoeven did this after "Spetters". "Spetters" was attacked by critics for his extreme sexual sequences and denounced as garbage. So Verhoeven filled this movie with a very obvious symbol, thinking that critics would think art is also a praise. He was right! Critics have loved the film not knowing that Verhoeven was playing a big joke on them. Still, it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> It is beautifully shot by Jan de Bont (now a director) and there is so much symbolism and hidden layers hidden in the dialogue you never get bored of. All the acting is great - Krabbe plays a profoundly disgusting character, but (somehow) you are rooting for him; Soutendijk is just amazing to look and play her part in perfection - the small smile she gives when Gerard agrees to stay with her is cold; Hoffman is extremely beautiful with a great body - deserves to be faithful to make the church sequence and go with Krabbe in the crypt. This is not for people slightly offended or weak of heart, but if you like the extreme movies that make you playfully (like me), that's for you! All the way.
