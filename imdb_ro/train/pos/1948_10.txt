This is a wonderful ending for the show. The fact that Adm. Janeway managed to make a double switch on the Borg was great. The fact that she was allowed to be infected, infecting the queen with a "poison" that essentially ended the Borg was great. The way it ended also left some, not many, for a reunion movie. However, they brought them "home" and the way they did it was fantastic! It was sad to say goodbye to some of my family. Ending with Tom and B'Lanna having their baby at the entrance to the Alpha quad. it was a great way to show a new start. It would be nice to have a sort of reunion movie - just to see where their characters will be today.
