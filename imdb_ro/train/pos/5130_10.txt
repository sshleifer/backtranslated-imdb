... may seem overestimate, but it is not. What is so hard to understand is - why did not they make more musical pants like this? Was not his beauty obvious to all involved? I think not. So many shorts were made only for commercial reasons and, with some luck, there could be artistic value there. Is this an exception - the only one? - if it seems they were the director had a vision and clearly could appreciate the music as art. Why did not he ever think of dragging Lester or Charlie Parker to a live meeting? Crazy, man. It was a shame that they were not followers.
