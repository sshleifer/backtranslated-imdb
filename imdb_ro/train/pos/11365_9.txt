Okay, let's start by saying this movie is not an exact extradition of the crimes and legal pursuit of Andrei Chikatilo. While there may have been "official politics" in the Political Bureau that the USSR had no serial killers, in fact the legal system handled others, and "Killer X" (as it was actually called) to was already requested when Fetisov brought Burakov to the case. In fact, as soon as it was realized that he had several murders on their hands, the authorities attributed to a working group of dozens of officers to trace down and put an end to the slaughter of a man who does not fall into what is perceived as a normal serial killer parameters. It is good that the director and writers constantly remind the viewer that the story is just "based on real events," for a docudrama this is not. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> That being said, this is a damn good example of a fast-paced Hollywood thriller that is still getting over the basics of what happened. It's easy to follow and has enough truth behind its version of events to make convincing viewing. Yes, Chikatilo raped and killed both children and adults, both men and women. Yes, unconditioned lab work has let him continue to kill for years. Yes, innocent men have been charged with crimes and "confessed" their crimes to urgent police. Yes, the homosexual community was harassed while the crimes were committed (though with the help of Burakov). And yes, Chikatilo was brought to confession not by the harassment of the special prosecutor, Gorbunov, but by the gentle understanding of a psychiatrist named Bukhanovsky (though Gorbunov was not far from the selfish martin in this film). However, all these events are dramatized in a way that constantly strengthens tension and fear. It does not hurt the fact that the director and co-writer Chris Gerolmo has a perfect casting. Stephen Rea's growing emotional involvement in the assassination and development of censorship expertise, the stunning manipulation of Donald Sutherland's Soviet party and spine, which becomes evident when Jeffrey DeMunn's furious undercover is hidden by behavior fearful, Max Von Sydow's boyar affirmation to be part of a criminal investigation improves sharp dialogue and clear editing in ways that can not be underestimated. Taken for what it is, "Citizen X" is almost perfect "almost" because of a self-congratulating moment at the end of which does not fit.) Highly recommended as fiction well said, not actually presented ... but considering junky "serial killer," the Hollywood movies, which usually spit, that's good enough for me.
