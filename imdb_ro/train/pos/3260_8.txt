People call this comedy, but when I just saw it, I laughed only once. I think the problem was that I first saw her when I was 14 and I was not old enough to understand that she was not taken seriously. There were quite a lot of scenes that were meant to be fun, but I cared too much about the characters who laugh at them. <br /> <br /> I suggest you watch this movie the next time you fall in love, trying to take it seriously. I think you'll find that, despite some flawed defects, it's one of the most exciting love stories you've ever seen.
