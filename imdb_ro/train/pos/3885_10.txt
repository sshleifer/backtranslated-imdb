I was first introduced for "Eddie" of friends from "fish-pond" who know I like smart humor. I prefer comedians who can think provoking during entertainment, such as George Carlin and Dennis Miller. In "Dress to Kill", Eddie offers the same kind of social observation humor that stimulates your thoughts on a subject, while causing your party to split at the same time. There is a wide range of topics in this stand-up and are simply hysterical. The song about how to decide the name of Englebert's stage will leave you in seams! Thanks to Andrew and Catherine! ... and "Do you have a flag?"
