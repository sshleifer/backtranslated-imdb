While many, unfortunately, have passed, the ballroom scene is still very alive and continues its inheritance. Some are still very vivid and pretty good, Octavia is more radiant and more beautiful than ever, Willi Ninja is very accomplished and provides great support to the entire homosexual community, Pepper Labeija has just passed the natural cause last year, can rest in peace. After passing Anji, Carmen became the mother of the Xtravaganza house (she was on the beach scene) and she looks more and more beautiful. Some balls have categories dedicated to those who have passed, they can all rest in peace. There is currently another ongoing project known as "How do I look?", You can check the site at www.howdoilooknyc.org.
