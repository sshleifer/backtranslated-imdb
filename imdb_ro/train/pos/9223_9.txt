Ashanti is a 70-year-old film (1979, to be exact). He remembered The Wild Geese in a way (Richard Burton, Richard Harris and Roger Moore on a mission in Africa). It's a great movie, and I really enjoyed it. David (Michael Caine) is a doctor who works in Africa and is married to a beautiful Ashanti woman named Anansa (Beverley Johnson) in medicine in America and is also a doctor. While doing drugs, one day she is snatched by slaves working for an Arab slave merchant named Suleiman (played perfectly by Peter Ustinov, by all people). The rest of the movie makes David try to bring her back. Michael Caine is a brilliant actor, of course, and plays a character who is very determined and ready to do anything to get his wife back but hopeless, with a gun and action. He first helped an Englishman who fought against the slave trade, which no one admits to happening (Rex Harrison!), Then shortly by a helicopter pilot (William Holden), then by an Arab named Malik Kabir Bedi). Malik has a score to settle with Suleiman (he is very intense throughout, a very engaged character), and so he moves away with David to find and return Anansa - it implies a wonderful scene in which David fails to get sick of the camel Then there's a lot of adventure. There are also many moral questions. Progressing the story is unpredictable at this point, and there are some liberties taken with the plot to move things along faster, but they are all quite forgiven. The question is that David will reach Anansa before Peter Ustinov sells to Omar Sharif (yes, of course Omar Sharif is in it!)?
