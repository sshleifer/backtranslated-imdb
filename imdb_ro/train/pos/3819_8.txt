I've been waiting to see this movie for a long time and finally I've been able to see it at the Istanbul Film Festival. Maybe because I expected too much of this movie and that's why I was a little disappointed. I was not the best movie in Korea, but it's worth watching. The subject was beautiful and the movie makes you look without getting bored, although it's long. But there are gaps in the movie and skip from one point to another. However, Jeon Do-Yeon's act is incredibly beautiful. It was one of the best performances in the history of early cinema and I think this movie would not be so beautiful unless it was in the lead role.
