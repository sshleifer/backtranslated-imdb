Many of the reviewers have shown that Pinjar is different from the role of Bollywood's filming movies. Although this is true, Bollywood movies are generally aimed at a particular audience and should be appreciated for achieving their goals in this regard. However, Pinjar is an excellent movie for those who want a change from normal to Bollywood film equations. During the Partition between India and Pakistan, Pinjar focuses on a Punjabi girl who becomes a victim of social and cultural attitudes towards the treatment of women during her time. Paro, the protagonist, has to choose between a lifetime with a man who kidnapped him and the passing of a life with her family back to the Indian-led Punjab. More than a problem of the Hindus and Muslims, Pinjar approaches and defines the role of the woman as a daughter, as a wife and as a mother in India and Pakistan in 1947. Unlike the typical Bollywood movies that are escaping in nature, Pinjar is a film that makes the public to consider these issues during and after the film.
