Winchester '73 was the movie that moved Mann from b-films to the big league, saving James Stewart's post-war career pitches in casting him as a conflict hero (though since he inherited the project by Fritz Lang, maybe Lang deserves the credit for that). Both men would go to much darker places-Mann, with Devil's Doorway remarkably bleak gate, which was refined by MGM until Broken Arrow's success convinced him to release him? but a movie about a man who hunts his brother while the title shotgun is hand-to-hand on the route before being hit by one of the director's strikes is still a stronger mass than you did await from the studio system. Excellent dialogue, an impressive distribution? Dan Durya, Will Geer, Millard Mitchell, Stephen McNally, Shelley Winters, Charles Drake, Tim McIntire, Jay C. Flippen, Tony Curtis, Rock Hudson among them? and Mann's remarkable visual sense raises the bar with it.
