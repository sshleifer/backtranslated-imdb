The main reason to watch this movie is Warren William, who is in the top shape as a shyster campaign manager. He is electric, constantly finding ways to fool the audience and defeat the opposite party in the midst of the biggest disasters. William is a great actor - I feel he did not realize it. Bette Davis as his girlfriend also shines in a sub-written role. Personally, I found Guy Kibbee as not William and others trying to face the crowd. It looked more like a blank cloth than a person. I would have preferred to see a true character, rather than a non-character. The story itself is unlikely, silly and clich√©. But Warren William and Bette Davis are well worth watching.
