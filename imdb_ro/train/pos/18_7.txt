"Stanley and Iris" is a heart-warming film about two people who find each other and help each other to overcome their problems in life. Stanley's life is difficult because he never learned to read or write. Iris is a widow with two teenage children working in a bakery where he meets Stanley. She decides to teach Stanley how to read her home in her spare time. With time, they become romantically involved. After Stanley learns to read, she goes to a good job in Chicago, just to return to Iris and ask her to marry him. It is a very good film, without nudity, violence or profanity, which is rare in today's films. A good movie everywhere. <br /> <br />
