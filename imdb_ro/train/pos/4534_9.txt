Intentively intended as a satire by D.W. Griffith's Intolerance three years, was the first attempt by Buster Keaton to have a long length comedy. The only similarities are intolerant scene "of" opening and that similar stories of centuries are edited together into a complete movie. Keaton's argument to acquire this style was that it not succeed as a feature film could be reduced to three ree≈üiere. Fortunately, The Three Ages succeeds brilliantly as a comedy and contains some of the funniest routines we've seen in films by Keaton. There is nothing unique or bold about story lines. They are simple boy-meets-girl, boys-lost-girl-gets-girl boys, but satires periods are riots and set the standard for future work by Mel Brooks and all movies of this genre. Still, I do not think anyone has ever surpassed this comedy. No one can sing as well as Keaton, and the stunts in this movie are some of the best. Additionally, Wallace Beery's appearance as a rival of Keaton adds to the appeal of this film. Anyone who thinks comedy from the 1920s can not be appreciated by modern audiences needs to see this movie.
