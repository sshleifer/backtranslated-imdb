We thank God for not based on a true story, because it's a story. Populated by despicable characters whose corruption does not know limits, before the Devil is a Magnificent, a perverse trip that would be ridiculous (and sometimes even - or perhaps because of - the underground tragedy of the human dysfunction, over) jaw-dropping if they were not made with such magnificent and overwhelming conviction by her stars. Kelly Masterson's excellent scenario and the superb direction of anyone other than Sidney Lumet does not hurt. <br /> <br /> The main dysfunction here is of a family nature, the two major brothers screwed up (brilliant portraits by Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke) decide to rob their own parents' jewelry store, an attempt that works in a pathetic part the story is told with time-shifts (which are marked on the screen, such as "Charlie: two days before the robbery" so that no one is confused); some people said they did not like this device, but I thought it worked perfectly, adding skeweredness to the whole business, as the two brothers in question are hard to play with complete packs - you could not do it decent poker hand to save your life. Throw into these extra sympathetic tips: one of the brothers is a drug addict, married to Gina (Marisa Tomei also excellent), who has an affair with the other brother, throws in some rivalry of monumental brothers, along with the fact that she said the drug addict hates his father (a hangover show by Albert Finney), which caused him apparently pain alone with serious, and you have a Shakespearian / Greek tragedy on your hands. Proceed with caution.
