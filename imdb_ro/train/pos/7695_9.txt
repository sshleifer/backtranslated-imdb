The Times Good Times was an innovative comedy about the first nuclear black family living in Chicago's projects. Whether you live in inner cities, ghettos, suburbs, or in the countryside, this show is still a treasure to watch and see that a family is just a family rather than a show about a poor black family. But they do not deal with it. They find humor and have strong family values ​​and morals. Despite the story behind the scene, this show deserves to remain in the air except I did not like to kill the father we agreed with Esther Rolle, who fought hard to keep the family together . But despite all the battles behind the scenes, Good Times was a show about a family. We all loved the dynamite of JJ and his ancestor. I watched Penny of Janet Jackson grow up a little. This show was innovative to show despair in drugs, gangs and alcoholism. Without preaching, Evans has always tried to do the right thing, rather than doing something wrong to get out of the ghetto.
