Sure, it's been 65 years since Thalberg's last production was shot. But other IMDB members, come on, this movie is certainly one of the masterpieces of the 30! It's a 10. It was the first movie I saw at the Modern Art Museum in New York, around 1970 (I was a teenager). With an expensive looking still with scenes of poverty, photographed retail, often thrilling and always hired, for me it was the best movie for MGM. What did the audience feel when they saw a locust attack, the destruction by a person of a mansion, horrible poverty and then the splendor of wealth. Last week, Academy Awards saw "senior" Oscar winner Luise Rainer. How great it is to see an actress who undoubtedly played one of the greatest performances in history, choosing to return for a holiday. Okay, so he should not have won a year before (Grand Ziegfeld) but he does not blame Luise. The discussions were only ten years old when she was released and her dialogue was limited. But as Olan, her visual and vocal use is memorable. Wide-scale and touching, how much more a movie lover might want!
