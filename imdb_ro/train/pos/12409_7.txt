Prison is not often raised during the horror horror conversations of the eighties and there is good reason why it is not one of the best ... but as you get through the classic movies the decade has provided, among the best known / lesser movies. The film has some links to successful films; for the beginning is an early director effort for Renny Harlin; the director able behind a number of action films, including Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger and Deep Blue Sea; and, second, we have a prime role for Viggo Mortensen. The movie is not exactly original, but the plot line is interesting. We are focusing on a prison that was reopened in a few years. This was the prison in which a man named Charles Forsyth was sent to the electric chair after being assigned to the prison governor. Naturally, the dead man's spirit does not rest in peace; and when the old execution room is reopened, the spirit of the dead condemned escapes for revenge. The film is not exactly The Shawshank Redemption, but it takes care to build different characters and while the main point of the movie is always horror, the prison drama behind it all makes for an exciting base. This is a good thing, because, other than the basic premise, the film does not really have a "plot" to go from and rely exclusively on the interaction of the characters to keep things interesting. The horror in the movie is sometimes grotesque, but it's never over the top, which might be the reason why this movie is rarely mentioned, being released in a decade of excess. The crimes themselves are pretty good and imaginative, but they offer some major underlings. As the film continues, we begin to focus more on the back story of the rebellious convict's ghost and, while interesting enough, some things make sense and pull it a little lower. However, it all comes down to a climax, and as a whole I have to say that prison is a film worth finding.
