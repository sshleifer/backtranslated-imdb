Garde à Vue must be seen several times to understand the sub-parcels it contains. If you are not accustomed to French-based, voice-based conversations and intelligence, you do not even try to watch it. You will get boredom just to death and you will enjoy the view that French movies are not for you. Garde à Vue is a word-filled movie based essentially on dialogues (written by Audiard) and the cross cuts the veil of appearances. Why does Maire Martineau (Serrault) prefer to be unjustifiably accused of being a child killer, rather than telling the truth? Because at the time of the crime she was with an 18-year-old girl with whom she has a 8-year sexual relationship. His wife knows her, she is jealous and prefers to be executed (there was death penalty in France in 1980) than to reveal the unique, "pure and innocent" aspect of his miserable life.
