This pleasant and enjoyable sequel to the success of "Boggy Creek Legend" is a follow-up only in name. Stories abound in a sleepy, autonomous fishing community of an alleged Bigfoot creature called "Big Bay Ty," which is deep in the uninhabited swamps of Boggy Creek. Two bratty brothers and their older and more sensitive sister (a sweet fetish of the future of Dante Plato, cute, pigtai, "Various Strokes") fall in love with the treacherous swamp to see if the creature of the local legend can actually be a living being. The trio is hopelessly lost in a fierce storm and the blond, bear-like, humongous Sasquatch, but very gentle and benevolent comes to saving the children. Tom Moore's usual, no-beat direction refers to this simple story at a dizzying pace, the careful capture of rural towns in precise detail, the drawing of assorted country characters with great warmth and affection and, fortunately, the development of sentiment, in an ecological, narrow, non-forceful manner that never degenerates into sticky - a poor mushroom. Adorable Dawn Wells (Mary Ann on "Gilligan Island") offers a joyful portrait of the mother of the only loving working class of the workers, while Jim Wilson and John Hofeus offer a kind of supportive support as a buzz. Robert Bethard's capable sound film displays the woody atmosphere in all tranquility, quiet, painful and fragile, untouched by the splendor of civilizations. Darrell Deck's score really combines the vibe of the crawler in the flesh and the banjo-pluckin blue jubilant banquet in a tune-up sonic summer. In addition, this image justifies a special praise for how she predicts unexpectedly the 90-year-old Bigfoot Vogue with a good 15 years in advance.
