Hello, I was alanrickmaniac. I'm still crazy. It was just another movie that I watched partially on TV. Then I had to get the video tape to finally find out how it is done. Then I wanted the DVD because the tape showed the first signs of decay after a few weeks. After DVD, I had to put my hand on the soundtrack. Then on several film posters and film script. At the moment, it's worse that I try to push other people depending on my site and the still unknown parties. <br /> <br /> How could this happen? What led me in dependence? OK, it's one of those smart comedies, but somewhat sad and melancholic, which only the British can produce. <br /> <br /> Well, the movie is worlds apart from things like 'This Is Spinal Tap', because of the characters that are not childish or ultra cool but true. This is a story about aging men. A story about the men who meet each other. Or not. It contains some of the best possible actors. Tim Spall. Stephen Rea. Bruce Robinson. Jimmy Nail. And Bill Nighy. Bill Nighy, who puts one of the best performances I've ever seen in a movie. Hi, the soundtrack is unbelievable. Foreign Mick Jones wrote the songs for the imaginary band Strange Fruit. Jimmy Nail, who plays bassist Les Wickes and Bill Nighy, portraying Raymond Simmons singer but strange singer. We know about Jimmy Nail, but if you only heard Bill Nighy singing in Love Actually, you have no idea how big and powerful his voice is. <br /> <br /> Well, you will be fever for every scene to come for the xth time, especially those concert scenes. You die to really sit in the dance crowd when Strange Fruit does it "all over the world," singing on the top of your lungs. You want to cry and celebrate with thousands of people the rebirth of the really strange fruit at Wisbech's festival stage. <br /> <br /> It's hard but ... I'm addicted to this movie. I'm addicted to Strange Fruit. If there is a world in which this band really exists, I would like to move there. <br /> <br /> Are you still crazy ... someone?
