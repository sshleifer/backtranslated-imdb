A lawyer is drawn into a deadly cat and mouse game when involved in a fatal female in this adaptation of a Grisham novel. Altman creates a Gothic atmosphere, but the script is weak. Sporting a south route, Branagh is convincing as a lawyer, and Davidtz is appealing as an object of his desire. Downey is pleased to be a private detective. Duvall has a small role that does not allow him to do much with his strange character. Hannah and Berenger round out the impressive distribution. After an interesting installation, the movie gets worse and does not respect the initial promise, but Altman always deserves a look.
