This was one of the first CREEPY movies I've ever seen ... I was 5 years old at the time. It scares me well! But tonight I put my chewing gum in one eye like a monster ... and my mother was very upset. I had to clean my eye with alcohol, and the next day I smelled my eye as double! NOW IS THE FILM! Hey, because it was time, it was a great movie. The head of the laboratory was as real as that. And if your 5 is really big! Children a few days ago are indulged in special effects that look too much and leave nothing for the imagination of your mind. Your mind can imagine things more frightening than special effects! (IMO)
