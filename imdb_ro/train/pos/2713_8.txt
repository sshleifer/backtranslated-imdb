Wilson (Erica Gavin) is endowed with policemen and sent to prison in this amusing and fun example of exploiting the first 70, marking the directorial debut of Jonathan Demme. After writing and producing several films by mentor Roger Cormans "The New World," Demme was given the opportunity to make his first appearance and offered a film that not only provides the expected and tasty doses of nudity and violence, quality the tongue in cheek at her; is often as amusing as it is brilliant. Exceptional scenes include a vehemently vague and cruel style act for prisoners, as well as a strong dream / fantasy sequence for the survivor and, obviously, highly repressed, superintendent McQueen horror icon Barbara Steele, making a wonderful transformation in this antagonistic role ). I also liked a bank robbery scene and a career scene that was simply stupid. As in other films of this kind, it is also commendable that it is just as much a portrait of empowering women as it is pure exploitation. These women are heavy, do not take garbage from anyone, and are more than capable of handling themselves. Our appealing cast makes the biggest part of their roles: Juanita Brown as aggressive Maggie, Roberta Collins as Belle Saxe, Rainbeaux Smith as cute and shy Lavelle, Gavin as newcomers, and Lynda Gold (alias Crystin Sinclaire ) in a brilliant appearance as an accomplice on the outside. <br /> <br /> As our climax ends, Demme comes up with a time-lapped end as our heroine races save Belle from being lobotomized by Dr. Randolph Warren Miller), the kind of man who thinks nothing of taking advantage of women. <br /> <br /> Bouncing with John Cales' careful score, Caged Heat is an optimistic way of entertainment and a good guaranteed time. <br /> <br /> 8/10
