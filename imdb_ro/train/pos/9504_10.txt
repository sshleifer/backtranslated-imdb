Many people know that Mexican cinema was very poor after the so-called golden age of Mexican cinema, fortunately, in the late 1990s and early 21st century, great movies like La Ley de Herodes, Bajo California, Amores Perros, Y Tu Mamá También and, of course, El Coronel No Tiene Quien le Escriba, have appeared. El Coronel ... is a wonderful film that portrays Gabriel García Márquez's classic story by removing the elements of magical realism and replacing them with the brutal reality lived in Mexico, not only by people like the Colonel who are waiting for their pensions but with more more than half of the Mexican population, living in total poverty. The characters of the film are classical characters found in Mexican society, such as the Nationalist Colonel, the cold and even ambitious priest, the hypocrite, but at the same time loyal compadre, the tolerant and patient wife, the hidden homosexual, etc. movie, is a must-see if you want to know more about Mexican society and especially if you want to watch a great movie by one of the best directors in Mexico
