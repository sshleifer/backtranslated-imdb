I read Holes in the 5th grade, so when I heard I was making a movie, I was ecstatic! Of course, being my busy self, I did not have the chance to see the movie in theaters. The pits were at the entrance to the city, but unfortunately we were too busy. I was surprised to hear that all my friends saw her and none of them invited me! Everyone said it was good, but I read great books that made terrible movies, so I was certainly worried. Suddenly, the perfect opportunity came to see her. It was that week and my parents were on a cruise and I was left in the babysit. My sister, who is 9 years old, I looked at her and I really liked it! Then I took it to the other people who had the children's home and their children, 9th and 4th, and they also liked it. My parents really liked and are critics of the film. Generally, I recommend this movie is for anyone who understands the morale of the family and loves a hilarious casting! This movie should be on the top 5 "list to see" !!!!
