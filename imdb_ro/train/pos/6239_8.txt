A film / documentary about different people in Austria on the hottest weekend of the year. Follow what I do and maybe more what I do not. The tempo is very quiet ...... so you have to relax ....... breathe ... expire before you see it ... <br /> <br /> First I think .... but nothing happens and you are a bit upset about it .. and that's the problem, because the film's mood and the realistic realistic social pictures that are beautiful in this movie ...... .... a lot of people will say disgusting ...... but not so bad ... I think it's more used to marketing ... and there are some really funny moments ... a 60-year-old woman stripping ... .. I guarantee her the most non-selective striptease in the history of the film ...... his movie, which is real .. I think this word ...... right in front of you ... .... and that's what a little scary.no computer manipulation here ..... real life ... and how do we all know that movies can win over reality when it comes to doing sick things ...... .... so much worse in the real world .... If you survive the movie, you can start looking at your neighbors and think ... maybe there are people in the movie ... I bet there are a lot of them there ... ... sick ... crazy people who live with a nice facade ........ after seeing the movie I feel more interesting to look at my neighbors ........ <br /> <br /> But maybe you should not see this movie at your first date .........
