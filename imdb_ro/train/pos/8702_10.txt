A woman built a boy in this world and was alone. They were both alone, because a boy had a gift and a curse in a single package - he was able to pull his sword out of his arm. It has always been a wound on the wrist because of this "gift" - the wound of the most dangerous weapon inside the body. First he kills his drunk daddy who hurts his mother every time. Then he grows up and decides to find his real father. As simple as ever for a superhero - he gets to justice ... but society decides that this justice is not necessary and dangerous, which is really right because it's not like in Hollywood movies that the character does not try to kill someone - Sasha (he is the main hero acted by Artem Tkachenko) kills if the person who, in his opinion, deserves to die, but is blamed by the authorities and is running. In such a run from the authorities and the mafia she meets a girl (Chulpan Hamatova) and falls in love with her. Everything else has to be pursued ... it has not been said. Be aware that this movie is more about feelings and emotions, but not about actions. This film is full of the pain of the main character full of him and his vision of life.
