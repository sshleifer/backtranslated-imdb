We lived with a roommate trying to commit suicide, and our apartment was in a building where you could end up breaking a fifty-dollar noise for sneezing after midnight - so without saying , I can easily refer to Polanski's "Tenant". <br /> <br /> But I also enjoy the film for other reasons. I'm not sure it works, overall - the descent of Polanski in paranoia and madness, lasting for the last half hour or so, seems rather offensive and bizarre. Ebert, for one, was not convinced at all, and hit the movie with a one-year vicious review. But I think individual scenes and moments work nicely, so even though I do not quite understand the whole movie - what does Egyptology do for example? - I still have a positive general impression about it. I like the unpleasant friend portrayed by Bernard Fresson, for example. God, how many times have I decided to have such stupid friends instead of a friend? I like the cinema scene - the funniest moment of "doing" in the history of the movie, I would say. And baby, I like Isabelle Adjani - she's so fox in this movie, it's almost unbelievable. And it gives great performance, as always. Polanski is also a good actor; I disagree with the occasional remarks of contempt for his performance here. His character is supposed to be key and caring, so his low performance fits. For the first time, I found him perfectly sympathetic - though he lost me a little when he started dressing for no clear reason to see. Yes, the movie is obscure. And slowly. But it captures the alienated qualities of an apartment's life - something I have done in its entirety - so I dug. It's funny how all you need is a common point of reference and suddenly a strange movie that it becomes deeply significant! It's obviously worth taking to change your DVD pocket.
