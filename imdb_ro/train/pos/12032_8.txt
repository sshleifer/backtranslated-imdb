The film I'm going to review is a small television film made in 1996 and starred on Melissa Joan Hart and Daniel Baldwin. Main protagonist / antagonist Jennifer Stanton (Hart) is a typical American teenager who feels pressure to have such a control father (Baldwin). However, when he meets an ex con, nicknamed Nick Ryan (Jeremy Jordan "Never Kissed"), they "fall" instantly for each other, but Jennifer has a different idea of ​​where to take the relationship. she manipulates him to kill her parents to protect her love, but has just used her to get rid of her parents to be with Brad (David Lascher's future, "Sabrina" for Hart). Melissa Joan Hart actually surprised me with her role as an evil manipulator, and she also bears the movie with friends and Nick, so she can literally go with murder. The rest of the support material works well and each retains their own when they have screen time. I also found it interesting that this movie was made and released the same year, Hart, began to portray Sabrina, the Teenage Witches, and this shows she can act in my genres of film and television. has somewhat given a series of photos that stand out as one of the best works involving drama or thriller and I look forward to "Nine Dead" coming out in November because she shows she can be seen as other people who are not called "Clarissa Darling" or Sabrina Spellman "We recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Melissa Joan Hart or Sabrina. You can see this on the internet, so I suggest you check this out.
