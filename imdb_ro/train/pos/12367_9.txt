Well, after a long anticipation, after seeing some clips on the 100 more beautiful moments of Bravo's movie, I was looking forward to seeing this movie. The plot was a simple and beautiful model, Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) moves into an apartment building that is a gateway to hell. Sentinel is a scary movie, even if it's a bit slow. It's a mixture of baby Omen and Rosemary. The actor is fine and there are really bothersome bits such as the odd orgy scene with the dead father and the confident woman in the middle of the orgy cake and laughing. The end is a strange mixture of deformed people and cannibals. It's a strange movie, but in the end, I really think a great movie! One of my favorites in the 1970s, even if nothing is original. It's weird and extremely creepy! Probably one of my favorites. 9/10
