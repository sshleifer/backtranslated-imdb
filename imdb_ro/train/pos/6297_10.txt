My friends and I just discussed how frustrated we are with the way romantic movies and comedies are made. We feel offended by the scandal that Hollywood serves in these days because they behave as if it were good. Everything is not good ... except for some bright spots, like this movie. He does not have big name actors, the big budget, I do not think he had a great launch (we rented the Hollywood Video) did not really have anything in the comedy of the biggest romantic budget. <br /> <br /> But it had what most of those are missing. He had a great chemistry between love interests, "Parker" (Jonathan Schaech) and "Sam" (Alison Eastwood). Their love story has not been forced upon us like many. The director spent the time to let these characters really know each other. Their story reminded me of one of my favorites, "Tootsie". The supporting cast has added not only comic but funny moments in the story. The character of James LeGros was absolutely invaluable. Sam's homosexual friend was hysterical. Parker's interaction with his colleagues in a psychic phone line was very fun. I laughed, I cried, I remembered how great it was to fall in love.
