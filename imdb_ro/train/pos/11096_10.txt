Based on Elmore Leonard, this is a violent and intelligent action movie. The story: a businessman is blackmailed by three criminals. Roy Schieder does an excellent job as a main character and special credit has to go to John Glover who plays a kind of naughty psychopath. I have to mention that the characters of the bastards are very complex and interesting - something very rare for an action movie. also some beautiful and sexy women - most notable are Kelly Preston as young beats for Schieder's character. Vanity offers a very good performance and looks like the prostitute who is linked to the three blackmailers. I'm glad to say that Ann-Margaret has not yet lost - this lady is a real babe. Do not look at the rate of this movie. I really do not know what the audience and the critics of this film have, but my suggestion is to ignore them and watch the movie truly captivating and undervalued. You will rejoice, it is a promise. Recommended A +.
