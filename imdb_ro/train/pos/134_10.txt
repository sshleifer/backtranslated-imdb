Someone is releasing this movie on DVD so that it can take the saint's place as one of the greatest movies of all time in ten to twenty years, when critics and film historians look back at the so-called films of the ' 90 and see how the vapors were most and how Lars von Trier tried to revolutionize and revitalize the international world of the film with this masterpiece. Currently, Zentropa (or "Europe" as it is done outside the US) is one of the most fascinating and artistic views of the near-psychotic temperature and uncertainty that erupted in post-war Europe, namely the decimated German landscape, whose physical horrors have been compensated only for the damage caused by the psyche of his people. Von Trier sings his shine on the screen. You will feel that you are looking at some classic noir espionage lost in the late 1940s with perfectly lit black and white scenes, while feeling that you are about to overcome the cutting edge, especially in scenes such as the assassination on board of the train. Literally, when you see this movie, you deserve the evolution of a form of art. <br /> <br /> For some reasons, Von Trier was caught in his own dogma movement shortly afterwards. While "Breaking the Waves" and "Dancer in the Dark" are classical in themselves, with "Zentropa," he has really built the art of filming at new and exciting heights. 10/10, ages like good wine and wax releases a DVD.
