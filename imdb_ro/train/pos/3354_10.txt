This movie is finally on DVD in Italy (completely restored). I have seen this film so many times and even these days (2003), when Italy suffers again from a brainwashing dictatorship (or the US). I'm glad there are surprises like the one played by Mastroianni in this movie that can sing from tuna; maybe they can teach Sophia Lorens of this world how to be strong and fight to be recognized as human beings. Back to the movie: Like most people you already mentioned, the act is great, but the background is amazing. I have to assume that, unfortunately, something is lost if you do not understand the Italian language, but I can assure you that the revelations of machismos, the distortion of reality in that radio-chronic Hitler's visit to Rome can make you sink! <br /> <br /> A masterpiece!
