True, the idea for this television series broke out from the huge success Ally McBeal enjoys throughout the world, even here in Germany. However, this said, Edel & Starck is very different from Ally McBeal in many ways. The two main characters working together together nicely. Felix Noble, played by renowned German actor Christoph M. Ohrt and Sandra Stark (Sandra Strong - Noble & Strong) played by charming Rebecca Immanuel, are changing fast and constantly spying on each other while engaging in criminal cases similar to the sitcom in Berlin and the surrounding area. Moreover, they are helped by a magnificent cast of co-stars, especially their secretary, played by Isabel Tuengerthal, which is a rare jewel with great comic potential. Also, the shadow merchant, Otto, and the noble childhood friend Felix, Frank, work very well, not to forget the best friend of Sandra, Patricia, played by beautiful Barbara Demmer. <br /> <br /> Everything is a joy to watch on Mondays: no wonder the series and its stars have received many awards. Will it be Felix Sandra? I hope you will have to wait for more episodes to find out ......
