Long before Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins shake the world of Christian subculture (and make millions in the process) with LEFT BEHIND, MARK IV Pictures, Christian Evangelist Films Distribution Company Billy Graham gave us this artwork. What I like the most about this genre is its incredible detail, sitting in a living room. Instead of taking dramatic scenes of this "post-abduction" trouble, we are sitting in the living room listening to the news because producers can not afford to show them. The premise of the film is based on pre-millennial eschatology, pre-tribulation, believing that Christ comes once for the secret takeover of the true church, and then comes again at the end of seven years of hell on earth. What used to scare me junior makes me laugh. Patty's fascinating adventures and her trip during trouble (and two of the three sequels of the film) tell her her remarkable story of unbelief and, ultimately, condemnation. I do not like to admit it, but I'm still very happy to look at it. It even scores are EXACT by Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I think I'm the only person in history to make this observation.
