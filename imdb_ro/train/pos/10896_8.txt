At first I thought that Ben Affleck could shoot a Christmas movie really funny boy crazy me, my daughter invited me to watch it with her and I was not disappointed at all. James Gandolfini was funny, I loved Christina Aplagate and Catherine O 'Hara was also good, the story is what really sold me "I mean ,, too ,, table with family for people who only see him but once or twice a year, and probably not understand anyway, you need much alcohol as you could sit in the system to Christmas, so I thought the premise was right there, buying the family with $ 250,000, was slightly on the far side, but has proved to work quite well for me, because it was a riot the way, show the class struggle of different families. has many funny moments, including embarrassing stuff on the computer for a teenage boy. in all I loved this film and I'll watch again next Christmas or earlier if my daughter wants.
