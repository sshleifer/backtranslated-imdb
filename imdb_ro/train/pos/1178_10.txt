It could be WWE's second best PPV of the year after Wrestlemania, it was a good surprise! John Cena had an excellent match in which he upset Chris Jericho. Jeff Hardy kept his IC title in a short match with Willam Regal. Bubba & Spike Dudley won a massive match for Benoit & Guerrero. Jamie Noble had a very good fit with Kidman, which was surprising to me. Booker T defeated the Big Show in a match without a match, at one point Booker T gave the scissors to the Big Show and immediately sent it to the table. In a bad decision of WWE Christian and Lance Storm, the jealous anti-Americans defeated Hogan and Edge with much help from Test and Jericho. RVD and Brock had the night game filled with big seats and the RVD managed to keep the title through a DQ, so I was happy to keep the title. Triple H also signed with Eric Bischoff and Raw, which means little to nothing. And in the main event, Rock became the world's first 7-year WWE champion, defeating Kurt Angle & Undertaker in a triple threat match. Generally, this is probably the second best ever PPV of WWE 2002! 7/10
