A number of factors make it easy for me to say that I still believe this is the most important fiction science ever made, despite some of the current, outdated dialogues, etc. First of all, there is a scale of imagination in Krell's description, a native humanoid race of the planet, now all dead, who were 1 million years more advanced than people on earth (new) and their technology, especially the 8000 of cubic miles. /> Secondly, there are musical and sound effects that are inseparable from each other. It creates an extraordinary, alien feeling, unlike "2001", which has traditional classical music. Thirdly, his "monster" is not only the strongest and deadest ever imagined, and it does not destroy the laws of physics and biology. Ultimately, and most importantly, Forbidden Planet is the only ever-made movie that tries and, incredibly, manages to make a fair, intelligent and ruthless logical statement about the limits or the ceiling of human development (or any other biological entity ), no matter how long we will survive as a species. In other words, we predict the inevitable destiny.
