The film - like the book - loses its anchoring in some of the historical history, but describes a unique American dilemma directed against the American institution horrible and unique tragic (and funny and touching) consequences. <br /> <br /> And the young Robert Ri'chard, cast as the main figure, Marcel, whose idealistic enthusiasm really is universal as he begins at the beginning of "coming" only to be cruelly disappointed by what turns out to be his true education in the planting modes in the South of the Louisiana world, at the tip of the antebellum period. When I saw the previews of Ri'chard (terrified) with blond hair, I was expecting a buffoon, a flip, a caricature - I was pleasantly surprised. Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Ben Vereen, Pam Grier, Victoria Rowell, and even Jasmine Guy give vivid impressions and a formidable ability as actors in plaid wallpaper, voodoo, Christian "aristocracy" and packed rebellion woven into this story of hatred , love, family, and racial perplexity in a society that is supposed to disappear, yet somehow it is still with us.
