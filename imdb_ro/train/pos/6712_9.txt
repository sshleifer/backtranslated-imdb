I like Sabrina! It's one of my shows! My favorite episodes are; the one in which she turns Libby into a geek, the first episode, the true love episode, and most of the rest of the first series. I think the college episodes were not as good as high school, but they were better than the last horrible series. Valerie was a good character because she was more rounded than Jenny, but Jenny was in some great episodes. Hilda and Zelda were amazing and there seemed to be no explanation for where they went! And Libby was a good character. I never liked Morgan or Roxy, they were not as good as other friends.
