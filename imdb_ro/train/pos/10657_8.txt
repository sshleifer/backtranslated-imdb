Jeopardy has the feeling of being a stock-type movie - one of the movies the studios have pumped between the big budget and the box office. It's only 70 minutes and does not have many sets, and the only star is Barbara Stanwyck. But what the star, of course. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck is a tough lady once again when she is in an escaped convict while seeking help for her husband trapped in the Mexican desert. Most of the film focuses on how she handles her captor, who wants to obey in return for his help. Some psychological beats there. <br /> <br /> It's a bit surprisingly effective movie - its short length makes it tilted and Stanwyck is awesome should go without mentioning (but I will always praise it).
