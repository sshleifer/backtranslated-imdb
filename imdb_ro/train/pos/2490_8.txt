Those in the "Instant Gratification" era of horror movies will undoubtedly complain about the rhythm of this film and the lack of free effects and body count. The fact is, "Empty Acre" is a good example of how independent horror films should be made. If you avoid indie racks because you are tired of annoying teens or twenty something who are killed by a baddie whose story on the back could have come from behind a Chocula box, Empty Acre is the movie for you. Set in the fallen remnants of America's rural dream, "The Empty Acre" is the story of a young couple struggling with the disappearance of their child for six months. As the weak relationship of the couple breaks apart, a bigger story is played in the background. During the night, a dark, informal table rises from a sterile sour on their farm and apparently devours everything in the way, leaving no sign of ever being there. The film is loaded with enigmatic characters and visual clues about what is going on and ends with a well executed end that resonates far enough left over questions to validate the writer / director's belief in an intellectual audience. There seems to be a subtext about the death of the American dream, but I would hardly call it an allegory. Striking, well-acted and technical, "Empty Acre" is a fantastic little indie that horror fans have to love.
