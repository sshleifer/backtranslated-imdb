This movie is very underrated. She is very imaginative, creative and intelligent. It's simply fun and, in my opinion, this movie is over the first film. But the movie was forgotten when it came out for the first time and it has become overlooked over the years. "Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey" also bombed the box office, while the first was a good and very popular hit. <br /> <br /> I think the problem could be that this movie was only released a few years too late. In 1991, Bill and Ted already seemed "in the 1980s." Even though the 1980s were only a few years back then, the landscape of music and style for children changed so radically with rap gangsta, hip hop, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, grunge and sound in Seattle. Bill and Ted with their Ozzy Osbourne, Van Halen, and Guns N 'Roses, along with their 80s style seemed so untouched and outdated in '91, and I think it's a BIG movie bombed at the box office. Nobody, but the surfers still say stuff like, "Excellent!" and "false"! in 1991. "Gremlins 2", which came out in the early 1990s, suffered a similar fate as it was a good movie that bombed at the box office because it was too associated with the '80s. The transition from the 1980s to the 1990s was a much faster change, now with the '90s and '00s. 1991 was nothing like 1988 or 1989, while at present, 2002 and 2001 still show / looked like 1995 or 1996. If only the "Great Adventure" produced in 1988 instead of 1989, and "Bogus Journey "was made fast and launched in 1989, then it would probably have been as wildly as the first.
