As the first of the TV specials on the set, "Barbra Streisand: Special Television" released in November last year, this disc is released separately for those who do not want to sell the dollar for all five promotions. As an investment, this is indeed the best part of the group, if only because it is Streisand to the purest and eager to impress. That she succeeds so brilliantly is a key component of her legend. Signed on a long-term contract with CBS to produce hourly varieties, almost existing in the present day, Streisand was 22 people in this first special CBS show in April 1965. At that time of her career her notoriety was limited to a handful of best-selling albums, some amazing television shows and talk shows, and her successful performance on Broadway in Funny Girl. Filled in clear black and white, the program is divided into three distinct parts. With the creative transition utilization of Disney's "I'm Late" from Disney's "Alice in Wonderland," the first segment smartly shows that she grew up from childhood through varied numbers such as "Make Believe" and "I'm Five." Opening with a cartoon monologue about Pearl in Istanbul, the second part is headed for Bergdorf Goodman's Manhattan location where she is elegantly dressed in a series of glamorous costumes while playing the Depression, such as "I've Got Plenty of Nuthin" and "The Best Things in Life are Free" with comic irony. Back to the basics, the third segment is a direct concert that opens with a tortious version of "When the Sun Comes Out," includes a funny girl song and ends with the classic, melancholic melody "Happy Days Are Here Again "over the final credits. Also included is the short introduction recorded in 1986, when the special was launched for the first time on VHS. For those who know Streisand just for his expensive concert tickets and fundraising, this is a real eye that opens his eyes because she is so revered now.
