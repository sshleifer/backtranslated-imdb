Rocking is definitely one of the best independent comedy films ever. You have to have a sense of humor to fully enjoy it. This film, for some reason, did not get its job. First of all, let yourself start with the story line, everyone loves a good treasure hunt. When a dead father leaves letters behind counseling a hidden treasure, he not only brings two families together, but starts a windy adventure. It blends into a Polish translator, a comotic mother, a twin brother, a twisted homosexual hypnotist, and a dear queen, money not only makes the world browse but can turn the family into enemies. My favorite character in this movie should be the sister / turkey's syndrome addicted to turret syndrome, her sudden outbreak will make you cry and mimic for a few weeks.
