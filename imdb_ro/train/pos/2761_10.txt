I saw the first film on his way home from Paris to Newark at Air France in August 1996. The film itself is a true masterpiece. It's the kind of movie people ought to do. I still think Daniel Auteuil is one of the sexiest actors around. In this French film, he plays a divorced father and a businessman who has lost his life until he is in a Down syndrome who lives in an institution with other Down syndrome patients. The actors, including the actor who actually has Down's syndrome, create a credible friendship and relationship between these two men. Our lives and changes change forever with Down's Syndrome. He realizes that life is not just a work and not a play, but a living and a loving one, and life must be about it. The end is a kind of stupidity, but I still think it's one of my favorite movies. It's enough to bring a tear to your eyes.
