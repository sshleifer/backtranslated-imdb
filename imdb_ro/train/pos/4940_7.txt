This film is about human relationships. Beautiful, funny and well written with meaningful text. It seems Morgan Freeman is definitely having fun on stage. Good music. Paz Vega is a beautiful and intelligent woman. I really like to act. The woman like her is a good motivation to learn Spanish. From the moment Morgan Freeman meets the cute Paz Vega, there is an intimate visit, with two strangers learning how to care for their lives. 10 Articles or less is about the dime of life. If you enjoy this movie, check out the Search for Happiness with Will Smith and his son. This is not an action movie or a nude comedy. Everything about human relationships.
