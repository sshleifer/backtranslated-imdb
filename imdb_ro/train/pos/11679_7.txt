the beauty of the bow and the wonderful appeal are the main reason to watch this movie. "hula" is not quite consistent with Clara's best movies, but it's still nice. she dances, calms her horse and watches the man she loves. this film is over an hour longer and was directed by the future winner of the Oscar winner (who left with the wind). The movie moves fast and clear the bow has a lot of screen time. if you like clear, I would recommend "hula".
