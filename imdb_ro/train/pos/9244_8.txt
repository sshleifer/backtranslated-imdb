If you just read a summary of the plot, this movie would sound like one quite typical of the 1930s. The story would seem quite controversial, the maudlin object. The power and beauty of this film are found in the direct, earthly performances of the cast. I have rarely seen Jean Harlow display such a palette of sensational, rich and subtle nuances that float over her face. If you watch your faces during the wedding ceremony in the chapel, there is such a profound depth among the main characters. Cruel emotions are so sincerely portrayed that they are true. The final sequence is almost unbearable: when Clark Gable looks with surprise and joy at his son, he raises him and says proudly: "My child!" I could not remember that Mr. Gable's son was born postum. This is one of the best examples of the Depression era cinema.
