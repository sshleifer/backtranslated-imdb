In the spirit of the classic "The Sting," this movie hits where it really hurts ... in the heart! A first female psychiatrist, hungry for adventure, meets the dirtiest and the rotten of the wizards. The vulnerable physician falls for the career badman and asks to be involved in his operation. As the movie moves slowly, the top and the end are amazing! You will especially enjoy the way the doctor "forgives"!
