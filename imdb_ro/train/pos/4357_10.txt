I saw the movie at the Nashville Film Festival. It was beautiful, from cinema to acting. It's the story of a father and son, and how they come to appreciate each other during a family crisis. Beautifully written with dialogue that never sounds fake, the film features the talents of actors Paul Reiser and Peter Falk, among others, in this remarkable cast. The film begins with an elderly father (Peter Falk) trying to figure out why his wife (Olympia Dukakis) left him. The father presents himself, unannounced, at the door of his son and the daughter-in-law. Father and son take the next day to look at a property and get on a classic journey. They fish, play at the pool, watch a baseball game, get drunk, get involved in a beating at the bar, and dance with strange women. But more importantly, everyone faces unwanted tensions that can affect any family. It's a kind of film that touches the heart and makes people appreciate those closest to them.
