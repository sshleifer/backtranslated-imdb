I like to see "Sabrina, the teenage witch", Friday nights on ABG TGIF. I think it was one of the best shows about TGIF. My friends and I met every Friday just to watch this show and did not miss an episode. My favorite character was Salem. It was adorable and funny. I liked Sabrina's lover, Harvey. It was HOT. I think Melissa Joan Hart also played a good adolescent witch. My favorite episodes were "Sabrina through the glass seen" and "Hilda and Zelda: teenagers." These episodes were great. I generally miss this show. I hope one day ABC will bring it back with new episodes. Give this 10/10 star star show.
