Someone can not enjoy this jewel, Ray invisible 1936, many times. But he can not forget it. The story is elegant. Karloff, the austere and fenced in the retreat of his Carpathian Mountain, is Janos Rukh, a genius scientist who reads brilliant light of light to set events from the great geological past, especially the collapse of a heavily radioactive meteorite in Africa. Along with him is Lugosi ever stylish (as a rare hero), who studies "astrochimia". Frances Drake is a wonderful, unused woman; Frank Lawton romantic temptation; and the violent divine Kemble Cooper is Mother Rukh, in a performance worthy of Maria Ospenskya. The story moves quickly in bold episodes, with special effects that are still beautiful. It also contains some wonderful lines. A Rukh restores the sight of his mother, he asks, "Mom, see, can you see?" "Yes, I can see more clearly than ever and what I see scares me." Even better when Mother Rukh says: "He broke the first law of science." I am not alone in my knowledge that has been puzzling for many years exactly what this first law of science is. This film is definitely the island's desert material.
