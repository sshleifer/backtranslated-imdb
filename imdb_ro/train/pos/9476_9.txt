For romance, as a married man. The following two movies are recommended. <br /> <br /> 1. Short Lead by David Lean (1945), UK <br /> <br /> Well, when a woman goes to a train station, something can happen. And it happened! How she longed to be there in a small tavern waiting for the man of her dreams. But she was married ... the man was a stranger to the fantastic woman. <br /> <br /> 2. Xiao Cheng Zhi Chun de Fei Mu (1948), China When a woman goes to the market to buy fish, groceries and medicine, passing through the ruins of an ancient wall in a small town, there is much to think about, the melancholy of her life, her husband sick in self-pity and the lack of a future ... Only when a young jubilant doctor arrived, something happened ... the doctor was a high school honey in both films to the great directors of the UK and China, the passion vs. the restraint was so intense, but ultimately, intimate feelings did not develop in any physical contact. That leaves you with a great taste, pulling it out, not biting it.
