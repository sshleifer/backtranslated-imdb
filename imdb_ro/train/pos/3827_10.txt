I have no idea what the other reviewer is talking about - it was a great movie and created a feeling of the era that feels like a journey in time. The characters are really young, Mary is a strong match for Byron, Claire is minor and an annoying tad, Polidori is a convincing bully-down, sycophant ... All are beautiful, curious and decadent ... Not frightening wrecks are in style Gothic. Gothic acts as a shock-independent movie and I loved it for different reasons, but this works like a Merchant and Ivory movie and was my best surprise reading of what summer should have felt. Romantic, yes, but I completely reappear my interest in Shelley and Byron's life every time I think about the movie. One of my favorites.
