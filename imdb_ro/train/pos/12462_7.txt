The noni Hazlehurst turbo-performance performance (which won an AFI Award) is at least equal to her FRAN effort after three years. Colin Friels is also good, and for those interested, Alice Garner appears as a child of Noni, and Michael Caton (best known for CASTLE) is a bearded painter. (Also interesting, Hazlehurst hosts better house and garden style programs, and Caton hosts proprietary programs, including HOT PROPERTY, HOT AUCTION, etc.) This film reaffirms popular belief that Noni is the most female actor from Australia during the early 80s and 80s. Rating: 79/100.
