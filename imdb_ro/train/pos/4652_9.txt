I think this movie is well done and realistic. I am accustomed to watching action movies from Hollywood and using this right as a standard to evaluate this movie, you are disappointed. This film is much closer to real life than 95% of what Hollywood can produce, and it raises it above the average action film. I have no experience with the Swedish army and therefore I can not point out any mistake in the way it works. But, as we have seen "extraction," I am convinced that much has been done to avoid any mistakes. This is a movie I will recommend for others to see. Realistic magazine and high quality film.
