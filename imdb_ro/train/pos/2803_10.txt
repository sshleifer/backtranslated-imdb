As a world champion 2 times on Okinawan Karate, I like movies about sacrifice for sports. But this movie is about much more. This movie is so good and so profound. Recently I suffered a very serious injury and a disastrous lack of passion. Almost bright for me. And this poor little film touched me so deep that, like a daze, she remembered what life should be like. This is a movie about life. You lived your life for you and your respect for others. Empowerment. God bless "Bend it like Beckham" I think it's a real jewel.
