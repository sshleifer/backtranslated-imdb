I really can not say much about the plot of the movie that has not been said before. I did not see the movie in about 25 years and my memory never left me. I searched her everywhere. We did net searches in the past, but I was naked. Last night I thought about the movie again and tried to remember who was in it but I was only 10 or 12 when I saw it last time and I was not sure if I had the name of the film so I decided to do it another search and I finally found this vision. I was right. If anyone knows where I can get a copy of this wonderful movie to share with my family, please leave me now at tawnyteel@yahoo.com I would really appreciate it. And for anyone who has not seen this movie and has the chance to deserve it.
