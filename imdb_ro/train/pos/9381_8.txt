A job seeker is confused with a man hit in a small town in Wyoming, leading to all sorts of complications. Cage is perfectly thrown as an unfortunate schmuck hoping to make a quick buck and get out of town but finding that he can not get rid of the city by the title. Hopper does what he does best by playing a psychopath known as "Lyle of Dallas," the real man of the coup. Walsh as a crooked sheriff and Boyle as a fat female round the fine cast. John and Rick Dahl's scripts include delicious twists and turns, and John's direction creates a terrible "neo noir" atmosphere. Cute and very fun, is suffocated by the spectator from the beginning and never leave.
