THE CAMERA ON ME is a cute little movie. It is actually a brief presentation of children's psychology and provides interesting insights into the development of adults and an artist. On the surface, this is a nostalgic look at some home movies made in the 80's by a group of upper-class children. One of the film's directors, Darren Stein, had access to a video camera and quickly assumed the role of artistic leader for all films. Sure, these are just nice kids who have fun. But it is even more. This is a look in a few moments while the children are struggling with a series of confusing issues that we all face in our lives - fear, sexual awakening, unremarkable love, loneliness, and just trying to understand the adult world that seems to explode around our. As we grow older, we tend to forget how exaggerated the realities of life were when we were young. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie all the more true is to look at a young Darren Stein transformed into a little general of a director. It is clear that Darren is leading this show, and these small films are his vision, but they are all informed by his friends, their problems, interpersonal dynamics, and general confusion about the horrors of adult life. Many children make movies at home, but I have never heard or seen children creating "small" films about holocaust, homosexuality, nuclear warfare, and the inability to fit and make friends. These children face and face some heavy things! <br /> <br /> The power of this film is how Stein and Shell shoot together scenes together so tightly with interviews running with kids - all now adults and all friends. This adds a new angle to the movie. How many of us have kept in touch with our childhood friends? These guys have. And many of the problems they are facing are still taking place two decades later. <br /> <br /> Among the conflicts - a confession of a crush reveals a still broken heart, a very normal childhood sexual experience continues to be a "sticky" subject between two men, some continuing resentment on the dynamics of relationships and there is still a member of this team who remains very responsible and at the center stage! Which has a perfect sense when we look at these home movies over the course of a few years. Darren Stein is a director. There is no doubt. <br /> <br /> Stein and Shell turn from time to time in chat and can imagine the inconvenience of allowing us to look at the young lives of these people. This is especially true for Stein, who has gained great success in the entertainment industry as a film producer, writer and director. From the first moment of filming MY CAMERA, we can see the appearance of a homosexual boy trying to figure out everything. We also see the sides of the artistic mind and personality that are not always "cute" or "caregivers" - and it is a bold move for any artist to share with an audience. There are so many revealing moments, but the most disturbing and complex moments involve a film in which we see that a victim of the Jewish concentration camp is tortured and murdered by a Nazi. We find through interviews and stories that the Nazi is played by a Jewish child and that the victim's part is played by a gentile child. It is a troubled moment of pain that enters the dark face of fear and the way children work through the horrors of the adult world that are beyond the understanding of adults much less than that of a child. <br /> <br /> This is much more than some home movies. This documentary captures the pain, beauty, joy and sadness of growth. Strong things - and well worth seeing! <br /> <br />
