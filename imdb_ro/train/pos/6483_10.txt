This excellent series, reported by Laurence Olivier, has to say, brilliantly, the beginning until the end of the Second World War. The origins are not fully examined by the fall of Germany in the hands of the Treaty of Versailles, which helped to lift Hitler's demonic rise, but, as a commentator says, it must be difficult to do in a series of 26 parts , with so much to feed. Apart from the expected fight / action, there are plenty of personal people, emotions and human tragedies that are said to give the spectator a stunning perspective, especially if you are not necessarily a boy / fan of the Second World War. Episodes showing "testimonies" and life on the main front of the main allies / adversaries, Great Britain, Germany, Japan, Russia and the United States, were quite open. Showing the extreme wilderness of the war on the front and, of course, the sufferings of civilians, death camps, etc. were well handled and exposed. I would fully recommend this in any class of history for the younger generation (Of which it could be said that I am one at 47!). Certain things are strangely left out, just like the beginning of the new era of airplanes, Frank Whittle's experimental Gloster and the debut of the Gloster Meteor, as well as the German Messerschmitt Me 262 - especially as V-1 was seen in his debut and was surprisingly mentioned by V2. This is probably a little oversight, not referring to the most sensational secret and fantastic weapons that the Second World War presented in an older old science. But a serious series that has made its mark and made it from time to time repeated happily. <br /> <br /> A series of property as a box set in terms of history, on DVD for anyone especially who happens to be a military fan. Jeremy Isaacs and Thames TV should be very proud.
