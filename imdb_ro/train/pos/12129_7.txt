This is a film directed by John Cromwell, who was not a great director, but who made some fine films, including the 1937 version of "The Prsoner of Zenda." Established in a London that only Hollywood could manage, atmospheric, but not as a real thing, is a story of obsession and love lost in Somerset Maughan's novel. I look forward to seeing him on DVD, as I have never seen before and being a great admirer of Bette Davis, he wanted to see her in a role considered one of her great first. So I bought it. Well she looked good, but I'm sorry to say her accent in London that made me laugh. Bette Davis was one of the biggest film actors, making no mistake, but here he did one. It was impossible to take their character seriously. It was not as frightening as Dick Van Dyke's "Mary Poppins" cockney accent, but close. In the other major role was Leslie Howard and he made it superb. He was a subtle and intelligent actor Supporting actors are paying off well. It is worth watching despite Mrs. Davis's vocal gymnastics.
