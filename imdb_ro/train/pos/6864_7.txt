He saw this movie the first time while drinking in a motel in Canada. While channel flipping came over the Easy Lube side. My friend continued to overthrow, but I told him to come back. Something about the name of the light lubricant did not sound good. Watching the rest of the movie was pretty funny. Jotted a few names in credits and got home to look for him. It turned out to be Chevy Chase's first film. I did not remember him. I did not remember much about it, so I rented it and gave it a second message. It's pretty funny and pretty graphic. It's like the Kentucky Fried Movie, except it's not that funny. I love my fingers, easy to lubricate, and they are the presidential parts. Skit dealers are pretty cool too. I give him 6.5 or 7 out of ten
