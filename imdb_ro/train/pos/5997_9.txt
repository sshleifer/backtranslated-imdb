Let me start by saying that I have never seen a movie on IMDb before; however, I am myself in the video. And coming from that perception; I can say without a shadow of doubt that this film is what should be a short one. It has a very good story and another thing that I love - (it ends even more twisting). The opening was very good, I liked the chosen video and how it was edited. I'm not a fan of B & W, but how this movie uses the effect it has. And with any movie that matters. The movie stream works perfectly and the editing was very well done. From a technical point of view (where I work normally) everything is also very well done. There is no major technology. things to emphasize. Only a minor one that I have is that the final credits are a bit of bouncy. This is probably due to a playback issue. Let me also say I'd rather see more of the scene of love, but I'm a guy (so you can handle that with a guy type). . It's worth the watch if you're a fan of India and / or short films. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for the wrong grammar or spelling.
