This is a wonderful classic monster hit of the 1950s! I really like the look of the 50s in general, like cars and music. Anyway, I like how it looks like stain. I like when everyone is in the horror movie last night at the theater, and the grain comes and the party collapses. Another thing I love is that it takes place in one night, just like Halloween II. When Steve and Jane are doing, they see a meteor out of space. Inside the meteor is the gravel. Whenever the blob consumes a person, it gets bigger and bigger. He tries to persuade the people of the city about the scary monster, but no one believes them until later. Can something stop this blob creature? I highly recommend BLOBUL!
