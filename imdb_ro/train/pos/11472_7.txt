As a fan of deeper study of the phenomenon that is shot at school, this film approached an interesting and different idea. Presented as a series of videos made by the two troubled men (I can not refer to people killing boys or adolescents), the training days leading up to day zero (the code name for the day they will attack) the movie tries to to present the situation at the opposite end of the weapon. Apparently he intends to describe the pain he suffers, but he focuses on literacy. The problem is that little in terms of emotion is delivered directly. The only point where emotion became overwhelming was the end, as expected. But to this point, it is never very clear why it is planning this. We are told the story that they have been mocked, but the film seems to contradict this. Without ruining the movie, it is easy to say that it was a great attempt and that it had intentions as great, but it is reduced due to unwanted filming. All directories are amateur to continue the concept of home video, but the story and continuity are weak. The film seems to want the audience to decide very much, but fails to provide information for such an event. The end is steep and does not feel that everything that started the movie ends.
