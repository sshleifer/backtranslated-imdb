It's great to see Jorja Fox in a role where she gets to smile a lot. She also loved her hearing sing. Change nicely to see her from CSI / West Wing / ER roles. The movie itself was fun, but it seemed somewhat an explanation in a lot of parts. Some characters seemed to be miserable in a minute and happy in the next few years and stayed at your imagination to figure out why. Each character was weird and in some cases I could not wait to see what they would do next or hear what they would say next. This film was not full of clean people but complicated, complicated people who could make mistakes, feel bad about them, and then find a way to fix them.
