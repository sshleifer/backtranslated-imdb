I liked this movie. It was harmless, charming and very colorful. You can see that MGM looks outside Technicolor. There is almost no color that does not appear in this movie. Every scene is full. The choreography was great. Gene Kelly is a miracle. He is so talented. The dance numbers in this movie are perfectly executed and perfectly designed. He understands that dances can tell the story as much as anything else. The last section of the movie, the great dance sequence, is very impressive. What makes this film very special is Gershwin's music. Few American composers had a better gift for the song. I'm very happy with Gershwin's music. It's delightful. Ira Gershwin is definitely one of the greatest lyric writers. It is so enchanting and charming. This was a very fun movie.
