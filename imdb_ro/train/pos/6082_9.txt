I have always enjoyed Kenneth Branagh's classic versions of Shakespeare, because he always does a very good job, but in this film, the one who raises the whole movie, is nothing but "best actor" Laurence Fishburne. He certainly made some poor choices in movies, even if he is a wonderful actor, but in this we really get the true Othello: the passion, the intensity of jealousy, as it gets stronger with Fishburne's well-represented paranoia, and in Plus, I finally got a black Othello! I do not think he could have picked a better Othello. Who else could have given that mixture of sympathy / antipathy, love / hate and, let's not forget, those eyes of fire ...? Branagh is good as always, but not at the top, Desmond's Ir√©ne Jacob is pretty good, but a bit bleak, while Laurence Fishburne really raises it and makes it a very interesting and enjoyable film. Watch it.
