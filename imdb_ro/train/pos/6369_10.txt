I loved this movie! I'm biased seeing myself as a big fan of Disney, but I enjoyed it very much. Action starts at the beginning of the movie and continues to go! This is a bit of a departure for Disney, they do not spend enough time on character development (my husband has pointed out this) and there are no musical numbers. It is a strict action adventure. I liked it very well and recommended it to everyone who loves Disney, whether young or old.
