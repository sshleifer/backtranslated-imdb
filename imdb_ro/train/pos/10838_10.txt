I agree with what "veinbreaker" wrote about the "Ahhhh" feeling that you get at the end of this movie. I loved the places they chose to shoot, the songs were well written and interesting, especially the psychedelic melodic track played by Hans Matheson. E trippy. Nighy was in his role, Nail "beaten", Beano was the typical drummer, and Rea held it together. Bruce Robinson was great. Helena was a wonderful girlfriend. But I felt that Juliet Aubrey's performance was superb. The scenes between Aubrey & Robinson killed me! He played perfectly and the music behind the scene was on the scene! Too bad that no more musicians have checked this movie! I should have told all my musicians. quoted by Jimmy Nail: "It should be rock & roll, not the ghost of the band!"
