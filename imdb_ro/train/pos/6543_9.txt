I read Nancy Drew as a preteen and gathered my books as an adult. I liked the effect that was used at the end (and shortly the beginning) of the film, in which the book-style drawings turned into film scenes. It was an elegant way to show the links between the situations in the movie and the books. For example, scenes with the Oriental antique distributor were very reminiscent of many scenarios they recall from books. I thought Ned was perfectly expressed, and Emma Roberts was a wonderful interpretation of the 21st century by Nancy Drew. (Like Betty Crocker's image, she keeps pace with the times!)
