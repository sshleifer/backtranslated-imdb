That was different, that's for sure. Look at the distribution! Talks about strange things. William H. Macy and Ben Stiller were the stars, although a bunch of actors almost share the spotlight in this farce about superheroes-wannabees. The most scandalous was played by Paul Reubens of "Pee Wee Herman" fame. There is a lot of humor, garish colors and no mooring. It's a fun and easy comedy with crazy characters who want to be Superman, Batman, Spiderman heroes you call. They have talents in strange areas, however, that real heroes do (and do not want to!). It's stupid, but you know it's happening. It's also a movie that you can track in speeds and do not miss the continuity. It's a long movie for one so excited, so take a break here and it's fine. The language has been stifled so that children can enjoy it too. In fact, I do not remember any oath here, except for the one next to me, who continued to say, "What a movie, a bad movie." I thought it was fun for two hours, but I'd rather watch it on DVD and take some breaks.
