A Christmas Together actually came before my time, but I was raised on John Denver and the songs from this special have always been my family's Christmas music. For years I had a crackling tape made of a record that meant it was Christmas. A few years ago I finally managed to see a video about him on Ebay, so after listening to all the music for 21 years I saw John and Muppets in action for me. If you have the opportunity, it's really fun - wonderful music, heart warming and cheese. It's also interesting to see Muppets 70s and compare them with their newer versions today. I think that, in fact, Denver took some heat to make such a show - I think normal performers do not compromise their pictures by singing with Muppets, but I'm glad he did. Even if you can not watch the video, the soundtrack is also worth it. It has some traditional Muppified favorites, but also some original Denver songs as well.
