This short film, which inspired the long-lasting feature - Spatula Madness - is a hilarious piece that fights against similar cartoons that give more writers. The short film sees Edward Spatula, who, after being fired from his job, joins the fight against evil bullion. This premise allows funny content near the beginning but is just present for the rest of the feature. The 15 minute running time of this movie is absorbed by a certain comedy and a small number of musical. Unfortunately, there is nothing else under it. The plot that is set up does not really have time to show up. But she definitely watches her better than many Hollywood movies. This movie is worth watching at least a few times. Take it for what it is, and do not expect a deep story.
