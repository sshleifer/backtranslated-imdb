The last heavy men find James Coburn an officer who makes a long fracture of breaking a chain link. He and his friends head for the Mexican border from prison and security. No, not because Coburn has a revenge mission. He killed the peace officer who brought him and killed his wife. <br /> <br /> That peace officer is Charlton Heston who is now retired and he knows what Coburn follows. As he explains to his daughter, Barbara Hershey, Coburn was hidden in a boat and was involved in a Waco-like situation. His Indian woman was killed in a hail of naked bullets. It's not something she's proud of, she was a collateral victim in a hunt. If we do not sympathize with Coburn, he tells us to know how well a bad man really is. Heston is his most common hero, but The Last Hard Men's acting honors go to James Coburn. Hit all the others on the screen when it's on. <br /> <br /> Coburn gets the clear idea of ​​making sure Heston follows him by kidnapping Hershey and leading her to an Indian reserve where the white authorities can not touch him. He knows that Heston must do it personally then. Coburn's band includes: Morgan Paull, Thalmus Rasulala, John Quade, Larry Wilcox and Jorge Rivero. Heston has Chris Mitchum who is his son-in-law. <br /> <br /> The last Hard Men are a vague and brutal vague. Andrew McLaglen directed it and I think maybe it was an original project for Sam Peckinpaugh. It certainly manifests much of its influence with the slow use of slow movement to accentuate violence. Of which there are many. <br /> <br /> For a bit of Peckinpaugh lite, The Last Hard Men is your movie.
