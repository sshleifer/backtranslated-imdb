It just came out of an angry preview for this movie. I laughed every 30 seconds. The end was so funny that they broke my tears on my face and wanted me not to buy that big coke. There are certainly some levels, but in general, extremely fun. The film allows Steve Carell to shine after he has stolen Jim Carrey spotlights in "Bruce Almighty" and Will Ferrell "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgendy" in their films. Paul Rudd is hilarious as always. I like it can be so funny in these wide comedies and continues to work in indie dramas (like P.S.). I think Seth Rogen should do more work, because he was so talented and attractive. Leslie Mann also had some incredibly funny moments. I highly recommend it to those who just want to laugh like a maniac. However, if you are slightly offended, you do not see this movie. If you are a crazy feminist, you do not see this movie. And, please, no matter what, even if you think you are one of those hip parents, do not take your children to this movie. Sure, you should let adolescents see this movie, just do not look at them. It would be for incredibly strange moments.
