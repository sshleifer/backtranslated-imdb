This is a very early Bugs Bunny cartoon. As a result, the character is still in a transition period - he is not drawn as elongated as he later and his voice is not quite right. In addition, the chemistry between Elmer and the Bugs is unusual. Elmer is a poor seed who buys Bugs from a pet shop - there is no pistol or desire to destroy the bunny! However, despite this, it is still a very pleasant film. The early bugs were certainly more glorious and crueler than their subsequent incarnations. In the later films, he went with Elmer, Yosimite Sam and others because they started walking with the rabbit. But in this film he's more like Daffy Duck in the late 30s and early 40s - a bastard who just loves others by irritating! A true "anarchist" instead of the hero of the late cartoons. While this is not among the best Bug Bunny cartoons, it is certainly fun to see and it is interesting to see how much has changed over the years.
