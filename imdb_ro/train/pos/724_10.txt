The movie is simply fun ... maybe more fun for those of us who were young and fans of "The Ramones" during the movie. I've watched the movie several times, by myself and by my friends, and it's still fresh and funny. At the risk of being too serious, the concept of being a great fan of a particular band is endless, and high school students with the boredom of classes are equally endless. some lines / jewelry scenes ..... references to how "our permanent recording" in high school will follow us through life. (Let me assure you that I went out of high school for a few years and does not follow me) ..... the famous "static" line ("I'm something static" ..... "Not as much as you will "Togar's director approached) ... the board member of the school, who is so fallen that he was assisted by nurses ... Nazi monitors love for a" body search "...... The main Togar announcing: "I give you the final solution" and burning Ramones records (note: the recordings were what appeared before the CDs) ... and of course, Joey Ramone observing: "Things have changed since we were hit the high school, "followed by Togar, asking:" Do your parents know that you are Ramones? "Just one tip ..... do not look up where the stars are now ... Joey Ramone sadly died young. Dey Young, who has been a great hot act in the movie, today reminds us that we all elderly .... PJ Soles career never advanced, as we could have expected ......... Marla Rosenfield as one of the other students apparently appeared only in this film (one of my male friends dies over her every time we watch the movie), although I claimed that her performance was more than adequate and should have brought him more film roles. And does anyone know what happened to DJ Don Steele? <br /> <br /> So watch and enjoy ..... you do not believe .... just have fun!
