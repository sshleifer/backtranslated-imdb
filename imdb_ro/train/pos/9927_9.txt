Domino is a great movie. It's a young woman who calls Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley), who becomes a reward hunter because of her boredom with her lifestyle. Joins two hunters (Mickey Rourke & Edgar Ramirez) and begins adventures. The scenario is good. Very close to the earth and realistic with the tone of the film. The only problem I have with this movie is that it focuses on the different things I do, instead of Domino's character. However, Kiera Knightley offers a fierce performance. It shows the right amount of anger and dedication in this performance. Mickey Rourke follows Oscar-Worthy's performance in "Sin City," with another harsh interpretation. Edgar Ramirez is doing nothing but talking Spanish occasionally and staring at Kiera. Delroy Lindoi offers good support performance. Mo'Nique was herself, though I was surprised at a certain scene. Lucy Liu has a great chemistry with Kiera Knightley in her scenes with her. The best thing about the film, however, is the direction. Tony Scott, the fast paced style really brings the movie to life. Cinema is one of the best I've ever seen. It takes a regular film and puts it on the acid. All blacks are blacker, white is brighter and has a kind of green glow. Scenes of action are exhilarated. GENERAL: If you liked Sin City & Man on Fire, you'd love Domino.
