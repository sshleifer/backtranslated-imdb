I found this movie very funny, I liked how she did from modern sports politics. This movie is not as fun as South Park, but it's funny. And since I'm a fan of the sport, I enjoyed having fun with some of the more ridiculous things in the sport. This movie is great for sports lovers, perhaps better for them in fact because they have to go through life wondering why people watch sports so closed when there are so many crazy rules and intricacies to sports and the fact that it means absolutely nothing. I also discovered that the real game came to be interesting, it is a kind of horse with bases and psyche outs (for the person who pulls). In general, we recommend watching this movie and you think you'll end up loving this movie. However, if this comedy style is not your favorite, you probably will not like it. (but that's with any comedy movie)
