I think this is a way of rebuilding or updating "Beauty and the Beast," but I can not say I've ever seen a movie that started with a few minutes of graphic sex. Wow. Anyhow it looks like a young woman and her aunt? They traveled to this castle in France, where the woman is about to marry the son of the castle owner, who is the man in charge of ensuring that the horses are losing their rocks. There seems to be legends in that area of ​​a being that was rather frisky, I think you could say with ladies, or at least one, especially. There are all sorts of hidden references in this regard, but each time the young bride who gets old gets her hand in her curious hand, the groom's father removes her. Anyway, the young bride goes upstairs to sleep while the family waits for a cardinal to attend the wedding (a family member, I think) and, as he dreams, dreams of a beast in the forest that has it. The effects of this leave little to be desired, and any attempt of eroticism (not knowing much about it) is a kind of laugh, especially when certain appendices appear as realistic as a bed or baseball bat . This has a pretty strange and sudden end, but still twisted, with no clue or too much built up to it, but it was a kind of assembly and certainly not what I expected. I do not know, it's kind of hard to pass, but it has its moments and it's certainly weird. 7 out of 10.
