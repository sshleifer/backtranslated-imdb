I read the book in the 5th grade and a few years ago I saw the movie. There are a few differences: 1.Billy was oringinally supposed to eat 15 worms in 15 days, not 10 worms one day until 19:00. 2.Billy is supposed to get $ 30 after eating all the worms. In the movie, after Billy eats all the boars, Joe has to go to school with worms in his pants. <br /> <br /> 3. Joe is supposed to fake one of the worms, but in the movie he does not do it at all. Even if there are changes, this film is still one that kids will enjoy.
