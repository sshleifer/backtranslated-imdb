This is the biggest movie I've seen in 2002, while I'm used to integrating movies. He is rich and makes a beautiful artistic act out of the 11 short films. From technical information (elected directors), I feared it would have an anti-American base, but ... it's a kind of personal tribute (11 times). The weakest point comes from Y Chahine: he fails to "swallow pride" and considers this event a well-deserved punishment ... It is indeed the weakest part of the film, but this proves true freedom of expression for the whole piece. The strangest comes from the almost conceptual-artistic Mexican movie ... I'm still not sure what A. Gonzalez Inarritu meant. The other nine are perfect (K. Loach, S. Penn, S. Makhmalbaf, ...), or almost perfect (C. Lelouch), and they either made me smile or cry or left me at least astonished. I still do not know if S. Imamura's fabula is really linked or not by the September 11 catastrophe, but she is so cute that the final position makes them "profound".
