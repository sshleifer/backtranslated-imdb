I just looked recently at this 1954 film that first played Vincent Price on Turner Classic films. Price describes Don Gallico, a magician / inventor who is led to murder when his boss steals many of his magical inventions (and also his wife portrayed in a short role by the wonderful Eva Gabor). Even if Price is a killer, I actually found him rooted for him, he is a sympathetic character who is mad at the greedy people around him who continue to take advantage of him. Although this movie does not have the "horror" factor of some of the most famous roles (such as my favorite "House of Wax"), it has plenty of intentions to keep viewers interested. <br /> <br /> This is a must for fans of Vincent Price.
