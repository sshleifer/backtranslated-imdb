While filming at a Florida National Guard site, "Tigerland" totally reminded me of Fort Polk, LA, burning areas, maneuvering areas, deep water, and everything. The film was quite authentic and characters similar to those of my AIT in 1974. The difference between Tigerland, 1971 and mine in 1974 is precisely drilling sergeants and the instructors knew they would not return to Vietnam, it was pretty much everywhere, so the training was very relaxed - it's not at all a challenge. This was the precursor of all our problems in the 1970s and 1980s, which I actually know as we stayed until 2004. I never heard anyone mention "Tigerland", but the army had training villages in real Vietnam, at different US bases. Veterinarians in Vietnam tell me that by 1972 Basic & AIT could be quite tough and injured because the instructors were there and were forced to train Vietnam-related men to those abilities to do this, although it has not always been the case. Both a Polk drilling sergeant and later one of my veterans in Vietnam, when I became instructors at a basic training brigade at Fort Bliss, told me he could do nothing to make someone ready and people had to find out for themselves. This movie high rate.
