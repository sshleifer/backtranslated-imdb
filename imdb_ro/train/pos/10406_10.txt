Abu, Baghdad's Guess, helps King Ahmed to regain his kingdom from a wicked sorcerer. As Europe went to war and important sections of the world flared up, Sir Alexander Korda's London Films revealed this grim exit from the legends of the Arab Night. Fearing with swords and witchcraft, he gave audience in 1940 a short rest from the titles. It's also a good piece of filming that has good action and smart scenario. Conrad Veidt gets the billing top and it's worth playing magician Jaffar bad. His sleepy face with the eyes of the piercing makes him remember the macabre roles he played with such joy during the Silent Days. Here's a bastard who deserves to look. As Thief Boy, Sabu is perfectly expressed in this film, the third film. While he is not a hero in the typical sense of the word, his character is certainly heroic in deed and action. The rest of the distribution is doing a good job. John Justin is both energetic and sensitive as the unshaken king, who must learn about the realities of living hard; Sabu receives an important part of the action (when it does not turn into a dog), but Justin is properly athletic when it is needed. Wonderful Jun Duprez plays Princess of Basra endangered, coveted by two very different men. Appearing late in the movie, Rex Ingram massively shakes things like a cute with an attitude. Allan Jeayes uses his fine voice for a good advantage like Storyteller. Miles Malleson receives another eccentric role, like the sultan of children in Basra, who had always been distracted by his mechanical toys (Malleson was also responsible for the screen and dialogue of the film). Morton Selten, aged years old, portrays the benevolent king of the legend. Mary Morris, later an exceptional actress, plays the double role of Jaffar's accomplice and the six-arm silver dancer. The film began in the UK, but wartime difficulties made Korda move to Southern California, which probably explains the presence of American Ingram in the distribution. The art direction in the vibrant Technicolor is the most attractive, especially the fairytale, white and pink fairytale architecture. <br /> <br /> ****************** ******* Born Sabu Dastagir in 1924, Sabu was engaged in the Maharaja stables in Mysore when he was discovered by Korda's company and was put in front of the cameras. His first four films (ELEPHANT BOY-1937, DRUM-1938, FALDUL BAGDAD-1940, JUNGLE BOOK-1942) were the best and were discovered to work from Hollywood when they were finished. After distinguishing his military service in the Second World War, he resumed his film career, but became extremely limited for years playing ethnic roles in undefined minor films, BLACK NARCISSUS (1947) being the only exception. His final film, "A Tiger Wals" by Walt Disney (1964), was an improvement, but it was too late. Sabu died of a heart attack at the end of 1963, only 39 years old.
