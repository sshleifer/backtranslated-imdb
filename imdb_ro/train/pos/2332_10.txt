"Imagine if you could bring things back to life with just one touch." As soon as I first heard, my attention was stuck on Trailer, and after the first episode, I found myself in love with this show . A day of modern story that brings my Spirits on the move and keeps my attention throughout the show. I think act and pouring are perfect, each character brings something unique to the performance that adds to its perfection. Even once, the bad guys manage to overcome with a unique meaning, from the bee man to the guy who can swallow kittens, I never disappoint. And Death that would normally lead to a Depressing Moment, often end up being simply Comics (like an Exploding Scratch & Sniff book) Even with the great amount of Crime shows that we have a few days ago, Daisies is one of the few who are really different from the rest, Being not just a Mystery, but a Love Story, Comedy and a Story Story with a clue of drama, all baked in a wonderful pie ..... err show. > <br /> What really shocked me was that she was on ABC, for years I never had a reason to go back to ABC, but that brought me back every week with a Smile on my face. It was like Pushing Daisies brought ABC back to life for me. But so, after two seasons, a few awards, a great base of fans and positive feedback from critics, the show was abandoned. It seems that Ned has touched ABC again and killed him forever for me. I will always be a fan of this show, though, and I recommend this to anyone who likes to talk and a lot of love from the shows they are watching.
