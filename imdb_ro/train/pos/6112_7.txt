It's first and foremost a chicken movie, it's a romantic comedy. There is a fair balance between the two. This particular movie adds some pretty sweet scenes of battle, I do not think they used the yarn or if they were they were not steadfast. It's not an extremely complicated film, so it's easy on the brain, there's no need to analyze anything to get a deeper understanding, a fairly simple chemistry, good between the leadership and a fun watch. I would have liked it if they made them bring the full potential of the girls show only once, because it can be amazingly nice, but it keeps pretty pretty throughout the film. I'll follow him again ... with a girl.
