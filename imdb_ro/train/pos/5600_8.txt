This is my movie. I am fascinated by strange psychotic nightmares, and this movie is so. But it's also a dark comedy. While I see him more like a horror / thriller, there will be others who might see him as a black dramatic comedy. But anyway, it's a fascinating breakthrough in madness. The end caught me guard, but what's over! It lets the viewer think a lot. Strong performances, a complex and detailed plot, a great scenario, full of horror and humor, and a strange atmosphere make this movie a movie worth watching. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think I will have to look at it several times to understand and understand all the subtleties that are in. But it is such a film that it will be a pleasure and not a task to do.
