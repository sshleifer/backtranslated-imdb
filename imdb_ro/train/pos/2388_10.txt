I like Doodlebopii. My son has been following them for over a year. We went to the Doodlebops concert last year, as well as a concert yesterday (connecticut). He loves them. Doodlebopies do not teach the alphabet or numbers, but who cares? are you serious? TV does not mean teaching children about figures or alphabet. parents should. Move on. In fact, Doodlebops can sing. Deedee has a beautiful voice, and in concert you can say that all three have beautiful voices and sing. Imagine, they dance, jump and still sing. have the talent, the children love them I really enjoy watching the show. This show is by far the best show on television for children. AND a rock band for children. How amazing is this? Why do people say Chad (rooney) is homosexual? Where did you hear that? Whether it is or not, He is wonderful! Leave him alone. Not that he or anyone else promotes the homosexuality of our children!
