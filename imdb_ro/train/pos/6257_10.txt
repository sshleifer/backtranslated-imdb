This documentary by Marian Cooper is absolutely amazing. I saw her tonight on the Turner Classic Movie channel. I think I'll see if I can order a copy of it on DVD. The film does not look so unclear and wrinkled as if you could think of the silent 1925 B & W movie. Located in Iran in 1925, nomadic tribe people leave their desert home and cross a scary river, men, women, children, animals ... Then up and over a mountain of snow pass all Barefoot. It's sink or swim and climb or die. Looking for the grass for their animals. They have cows, goats, dogs, horses, mules. In a scene, a man wears a mule that is too sick to climb the mountain. The children in the documentary seem to be happy and healthy. They had such a life. I wonder if the nomad tribes in Iran still live like this. It makes you appreciate modern life in the US.
