An excellent movie and an excellent example of how frightening it can be a movie without showing anything to the viewer. It's a set of four stories about the tenants of a charming old-fashioned house and their various terrible and terrible destinies, all related to a story about a Scotland Yard inspector looking for a horror film star. It starts with a story about a mystery writer, whose main character becomes a bit too realistic, followed by a story about two old Romanian rivals who become obsessed with a wax figure in a museum, then a story about a little angel, sweet, which is different from, and ending with the story of what happened to the missing movie and what the inspector does. It's a great print that really lets you appreciate the work of director Duffell and what he managed to achieve with a very small budget. Add to this talent talent Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Denholm Elliott, Joss Ackland, Ingrid Pitt and Jon Pertwee and you'll have a movie that can be enjoyed from time to time. Do not answer the phone if someone from Stoker Real Estate calls you to offer you a business on a beautiful country house in England?
