"Slaughter High" is probably the most understated slash hit of the 1980s. It's one of the few movies of genre that is enthusiastic around the world. That being said, it is also based largely on the standard formula of slasher: A group of young men and women are killed one by one in an amazing way until the end of the showdown. The reason why "Slaughter High" films of his kind is that it goes more above the top. Marty, the murderer, has good reasons to prey to former classmates. They electrocuted him as he stood naked in a dressing room of a girl, knocked at his feet with a spear, and at first made an experiment in the science lab so that he could disfigure him. the victims in this movie are as inappropriate as you. When they meet years later - in a high school meeting by Marty himself - you realize they have not matured too much. They are a lot of sociopaths. It's great why they do not wonder why they were the only ones who showed up at the meeting, which by the way is held in a school that has since fallen into despair. And who would think it is a good idea to drink beer and alcoholic beverages found in the abandoned building in a room that happens to have the old cabinets - like those of Marty - displayed? There are many leaps of faith that the spectator has to take to enjoy this film. The end makes little or no sense. And the screenwriters have a strange understanding of how the April Fantasy Day works: The film says farsions are no longer allowed in the afternoon. Overall, the movie is one of the best examples of the slasher genre, despite all its flaws. It is hard to understand why he has not yet found his way to DVDs, when many other films of "run-of-the-mill" songs are decorated with special editions.
