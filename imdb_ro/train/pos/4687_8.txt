Lizzie Borden's Love Crimes is an important film dealing with the dark side of female sexuality (including feminine full-frontal nudity, which certainly beats the male guy). She flirts with sadomasochism and the captive who falls in love with the theory of captors. This treatment of female libido is sometimes a bit deep, but Borden traveled far beyond the feminist dogma of females that gain power through their insatiable lust. <br /> <br /> A striking scene exposes the female fetish for horses, when the antagonist, a counterfeit fashion photographer, seduces an older woman wearing trousers, asking him to show how a horse walks. He pushes a crack between her legs, pushing her over her legs, and this greatly enhances her enthusiasm. Then, suddenly, he left home and pissed at the closed door. <br /> Patrick Bergin plays the artist and although he falls a long distance from the beautiful, he simply chooses Janes and has a screen enough presence to make someone believe that women might He swallows the line. Through all the reports, Sean Young turns out to be a strange person, and she is not at all beautiful. However, in this film, as a district attorney, her intense face and thin body with long tongue and her hips accentuated and periodic dissociated movement alchimize in erotic fascination. Its performance is forced and complex. Borden has a vision of the intriguing world and the fact that it is so in contradiction with the modern, groundless zeitgeist, whom I truly appreciate.
