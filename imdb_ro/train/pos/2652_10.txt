Why can not I create more directors in these days horror movies like "The Shining"? There is an easy answer to this: day-to-day executives are not Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick once showed up with this film that he is truly one of the greatest directors and cars of all time. So the plot is pretty simple. A man named Jack Torrance (played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson) and his family moved to a large, isolated hotel to watch out of season. Kicker is that the hotel's previous caretaker killed his wife and two girls. The following may be the easiest to sum up the title of the movie, but you have to watch it to see what I mean. This is the first movie in a very long time that strikes me as "scary." These are the wrong things but in a good way One of the things that adds to the scare factor is the amazing music Music was an important part of the movies Kubrick (2001: A Space Oddysey and O Clockwork Orange, just to name a couple) and certainly not disappointing with it. "The score totally sets the tone and this movie would not be the same without him. Nicholson's legendary performance, Jack is terribly convincing as a crazy killer, in fact, just his gaze steals some of the scenes of this film, this is a first-rate action that must be seen to believe. that suits it enough.
