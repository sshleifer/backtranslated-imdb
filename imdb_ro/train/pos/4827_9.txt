And that's why historical / biographical films are so important to us all, more so when they are so well made, like this! Before seeing "The Young Victoria", I knew a few things about Queen Victoria, but eventually I have more knowledge about it. <br /> <br /> Emily Blunt is simply GREAT like Victoria (who would guess this!) and she will probably get an Oscar nomination this year. Personally, I applaud ... As far as the technical problems are concerned, I'm glad to say that it is a very successful production with a wonderful direction of art / decoration set and, of course, expected to either, a regular costume design! <br /> <br /> One disadvantage is that I want to see more and know more about this exciting queen, but first, an incredible woman and a mother! <br /> <br /> BRAVO: 9 out of 10!
