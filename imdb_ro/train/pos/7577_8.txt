WHO WERE THE GOLD? is (unfortunately) the last of the films HANZO THE RAZOR, starring Shintaro Katsu as a title character - the samurai officer with multi-weapon authority, with the "unique" confession technique of confessions from female informants who do not want to "beans "and begging for more ... This entry begins with Hanzo" discovering "a woman who represents as a ghost to guard a lake full of bamboo that is filled with gold stolen from the Treasury. This leads to the discovery by Hanzo of a shark loan scheme and an orgy ring run by a blind monk. The need for sword and rape / interrogation ends in a decent end for this strange movie trilogy. Not as strong and pleasant as SNARE (the second part of the series ...), but still big for sleazy samurai fans and pinky-style Japanese fans. 8/10
