This police procedure is no worse than many others in her era and better than a few. Obviously, it is followed in the "Dragnet" and "Naked City" steps, but appears as a nice programmer. The best thing about him is the unadulterated look he offers in a world that has long passed ... the lower class New York in the late 1940s / early 50s. Here he is in all his full glory, from tattoo parks from old school to cheap hotels to greasy spoons. These old police films are like traveling stories in a past and very bitter day for anyone who does not like the city disinfected today. Also intriguing is the emphasis on the scientific aspect of solving the crime ... in this case the killing of a tattooed woman found in an abandoned car. Our main heroes, Detectives Tobin and Corrigan, do the job, but without the tedious and painful efforts of the "lab boys" they will not get anywhere. Although the technology is not in the same league, police use persistent persistence of a C.S.I. investigator to track down their man. The way some commentators wrote about this movie, you think it would have been directed by Ed Wood and worked out the excerpt from his films. What the hell! I enjoyed John Miles as ex-Marine, who became Tobin boschette ... he had a lucky, lucky and easy approach to the role that is a welcome change to the most common film historionic of most film policemen of the period. Patricia Barry is cute and delightful as a friendly friend who helps solve the crime. Walter Kinsella is clogged and eager as the older detective Corrigan. I liked the chemistry of these two and did something different from the "Dragnet" robotic approach. The mystery itself is not too deep, and the ultimate tracking and shooting-certainly will not be classified as a crime class, but during the short period of time, "The Tattooed Stranger," more than I cared for.
