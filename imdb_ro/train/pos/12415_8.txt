This was obviously the prototype of Mick Dundee, but "Barry McKenzie's adventures are funny." I was amused and laughing many times, terribly central performance by Barry Crocker in the lead role, an Australian invading England for it has upset the pigeons with its freely-flowing paths.A few British will be angry with Barry's frequent gross remarks on his hosts.The relationship between the two countries is a strange but friendly one and this is highlighted by the final line of the movie by a McKenzie somewhat detained while on the plane. "I just started to like my cuta."
