When I started looking at this, I realized I was looking at quality production, so I was not surprised to learn that the script was written by Andrew Davis and was produced by Sue Birtwhistle, both have brought us the excellent Pride and Prejudice production since 1995! So my only crap here is that Emma did not run for 3 or 4 or maybe six episodes like Pride and Prejudice. The actress was gorgeous and I think Prunella is excellent as Miss Bates, but I loved Kate Beckinsale and Mark Strong just as much. Language is a delight to listen, can you imagine this day and age being entitled to go to someone without really saying a word swear? Samantha Morton was excellent while Miss Smith actually took place as much as Pride and Prejudice. I liked it so much that I saw it twice in two days !! So once again, thank you to the BBC for another quality television piece. I saw the Paltrow version and it's okay, but I think the BBC version is far superior. A great production that I am very happy to have on DVD!
