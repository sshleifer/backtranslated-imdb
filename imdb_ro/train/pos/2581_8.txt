People are too hard to shoot. Sometimes we should go back and enjoy the story without trying to "revisit" it. The whole thing comes together when Hackman decides not to pull the trigger, but his target continues to descend. Then the fun begins as everyone around him also "go down". Just think that JFK and all the people associated in any way with his assassination, life has ended abruptly and in questionable ways and you will appreciate what is involved in this movie. I think it's an excellent interpretation of what might have happened. Although the story line EXACT was not followed (after retrospection, after reading Jim Maars "Crossfire"), but what is involved is of interest. I'd love to get a copy of it again. In light of what is known today, the Domino principle is on the right track.
