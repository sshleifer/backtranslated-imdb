The first scene gives you clues about what can happen here. It becomes more and more obvious as the story continues. The actor is excellent all over the world and these actors touch your soul. Even if I knew what was going to happen, I was extremely puzzled by the reason. I'm still puzzled why Ben did what he did. I could see before him "secondary thoughts," but the ultimate sacrifice seemed to resist his emotions and feelings. It was an interesting and moving story, but it left me confused. Perhaps that was the point of the movie. I liked the movie, and Wil Smith can make another choice of the movie. This guy knows how to entertain an audience!
