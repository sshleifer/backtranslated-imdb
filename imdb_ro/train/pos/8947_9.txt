Kim Novak is a witch he leads for a mortal lover, and James Stewart's choice. Scandalous comedy of manners on the Broadway stage; shot by James Wong Howe in Witch Color and performed by a sterling cast. Ernie Kovacs is wonderful as the writer Redlitch. I like this movie, although few others seem to. Only Kim makes him the winner in my book. Ha! My film in 1958.
