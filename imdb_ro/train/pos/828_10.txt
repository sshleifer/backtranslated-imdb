I have noticed that a new hope and a movie "EMPIRE STRIKES BACK" are in TOP 10, but it is not even in the top 100. This movie has a bad reputation due to Ewoks, but there are so many reasons to love this movie: - Saving Han Solo from Jabba: This official packs Han Solo into the sub-plot debt, which was set when I met the character in a NEW HOPE. - The Emperor was finally revealed: Okay, all right, this may not work as well now that the prequel is out, but this was the first time I saw the Emperor as children. <br /> <br /> - Speeder Bike Chase: Okay, so it was a moment of special effects. But it was definitely one of the most memorable and exciting moments of all the movies! Climax 3: 1) Endor Battle (led by Han and Leia) 2) Luca faces his father & The Emperor's Fall 3) Destruction of the Second Star of Death (Lando's Moment) - The Final Celebration with our heroes: As I said, this movie gets a lot of nonsense about Ewoks, but I think it's cool enough that while the entire galaxy celebrates FALL OF THE EMPIRE, our heroes have their own private party in the woods with each other. Everything was a great final chapter for our heroes and a good end for the STAR WARS story.
