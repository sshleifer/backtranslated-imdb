One of the most beautiful pieces of television drama in the last decade. Throughout the five hours, perceptions and sympathies are constantly provoked because they explore many aspects of modern British society. David Morrisey is, as usual, brilliant. At first encounter, as a hard-to-handle copper in conflict with the heroine, then she turns out to be intelligent and thoughtful while working with her to discover the truth. I've never seen Surrane Jones. I think it comes from the TV soap world. Her performance was magnificent because she keeps her humor and calm while trying to balance the demands of the case and the stress of her mother's care. I could go on and talk about every member of the band that is contributing to this magnificent drama, but their efforts would mean little without a script so absorbed that constantly provokes your hypotheses about any of the characters. Programs like this restores their confidence in television drama, making it almost impossible to solve the majority of garbage that fills up radio channels more and more.
