Australian Fred Schepisi (A Cry in the Dark) leads this comedy / love story that is fun, relaxing and set in the spring. You will laugh as you watch this movie. Tim Robbins is a car driver, Ed Walters, with a high IQ that gets bigger with Albert Einstein, Walter Matthau (Grumpy Old Men) and his friends Nathan, Kurt and Boris. You can tell them about their shoes. Meg Ryan (Sleepless in Seattle, got mail) is Catherine Boyd, Einstein's granddaughter, who is a competent mathematician, but not so confident. Perhaps it is because it is surrounded by the whole genit. She thinks if she marries someone with a big I.Q. her children will have an I.Q. but he does not know what he wants. Between Mr Robbins' cute smile and Meg's delight, this is a refreshing film. I like sweet stories. People of all ages should enjoy this movie. Catherine is engaged to James Moreland, who works in animal behavior but is very stuck. This is a love, a first sight, between the mechanic and the mathematician. Soaps and subliminal lines! Cinema is nice. Princeton, New Jersey is beautiful in the spring. With much help from all the brilliant, Catherine falls for Ed, not knowing he's a car mechanic. Favorite scenes: Ed taking a test of choice in front of a crowd with the help of Einstein, Nathan, Kurt and Boris. Ed and Einstein are on the motorcycle. Nathan, Kurt and Boris leaving all the research animals free! Favorite quotes: Albert Einstein: "Do not let the brain interfere with your heart." Ed Walters: "When was the last time he said" Wahoo ""? Catherine Boyd: "Well, I'm sure I do not know." This is a refreshing film, I recommend it. I have the band and I will once again look again.
