This is an absurd comedy in Belgium. Born in black and white, Beno√Æt Poelvoorde (Man Bites Dog) is in fine shape as Roger, the angry and obsessive father of a family in a small belligerent and bleak mining town. Roger is a photographer who, along with his father, Luise, visits road accidents to take pictures. He is also obsessed with winning a car by participating in a competition where the competitor has to break a record - and decides that his son, Michel, must try to break the record of always walking through a door - even hiring a Coach overweight trains him. Michel dresses as Elvis and has a spot on a radio show called "Cinema Lies," where he describes the mistakes of the movies. Luise is friendly with neighbor Felix, a breeder of pigeons. Roger is an unpleasant figure as he pushes Michel over the limit during the recording attempt, which results in his death. Interpreted throughout the film are surrealistic Magritte images. It is undoubtedly charming and worth your time.
