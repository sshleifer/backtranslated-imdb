Grand Canyon falls into a very low category: it's a very smart movie with very smart dialogues and food for thought everywhere from start to finish. I have the impression that she has never managed to be worth it (and never) because of its simplicity. This type of shooting needs sensitive observers. Pity thought IMDb made me write ten lines, because this is by no means necessary in this particular case. Anyway, to meet this request, I will tell you that the weak point of the film, if ever, is in acting: not that it is bad, but it could have been done much better. Exceptions made to Kevin Kline, which was perfect. Go and look at it.
