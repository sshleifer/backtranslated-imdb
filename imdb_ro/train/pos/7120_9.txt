Most war films made in the US during the Second World War were very fun to watch but suffered from severe loopholes in realism because they were more of a propaganda value to raise spirits at home than anything else. I do not beat these movies, because many of them are still very visible. However, because they often lack realism, they are prevented from being truly wonderful movies. A perfect example was John Garfield's Air Force - in which a B-17 almost unilaterally removes half of the Japanese air force! However, Pride Of The Marines is a welcome departure - marking great marks to illustrate a true story in a reasonably accurate manner. When I first saw this movie, I thought it was not a true story because it seemed too unlikely to be true. However, after studying further, I found that it was, in fact, quite true of the stunning story of two men who did so much to win the "Medal of Honor." This is a case in which real life seemed too incredible to be true!
