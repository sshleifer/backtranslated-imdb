I really like this movie. I can follow him regularly and not spit on him. I suppose this is one of my criteria for a great movie. The story is very interesting. It introduces us to 6 characters; each has a unique kung fu style that is very secret and very deadly. Each of these characters is trained by the same master, but their identity is kept secret to each other. The dying Master sends the 6th Venom, his last student, to try and make good the mistakes he suspects that some of his students have committed. How will he find the last pupil of the other venoms? How will he know which one is evil? The way these questions are answered is part of what makes this movie great. We also see venoms fighting each other in every combination. It's fun to see how their styles fit against each other. If you want to see if you like kung fu movies, this is a good start movie. It's not better than that.
