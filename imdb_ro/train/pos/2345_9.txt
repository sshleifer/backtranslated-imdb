I really liked the first episode and I look forward to more. A bit soft on the front of the crime (it's almost a later idea and it's not terribly suspensive or fleshed out), but thinking about the angle of romance was wonderfully charming. He'll be sure again! <br /> <br /> I hope they will have a bigger role for aunts who are wonderful actresses and have been somewhat unused this time. The actress who interprets the assistant / waitress (also from Bewitched I think) is very sweet and full of bubble and comes just as cute and sweet instead of stupid and annoying, which is very beautiful.
