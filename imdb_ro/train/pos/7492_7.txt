Although not a horror movie in the traditional sense, this terrible movie brings the goods. It seems that a vampire is weakened in a small town in Germany that is extirpating its victims of blood. Police Inspector, Karl Brettschneider, Melvyn Douglas, in one of his first roles, is skeptical believing that a mad killer, not a vampire running amok. The only one who believes in him is Ruth Bertin (Faye Wray), the inspector's friend and laboratory assistant to Dr. Otto von Niemann (Lionel Atwill) who, although seemingly an eminent scientist, goes along with vampire theory. The city suspects the strange Herman Gleib, played with Dwight Frye's usual frenzy, who seems to have a lot of fun with his role. The film contains a bit of humor, which helps to ameliorate the intensity involved with all the crimes committed. A funny part has Gussie Schnappmann (Maude Eburne), aunt Ruth Bertin, believing that the strange Herman did not turn into a bitch but in a dog. Maude Eburne and Dwight Frye make a good comedy team. This budget movie brings elements from Dr. Caligari's Cabinet with Dr. Niemann using the power of suggesting a sleepwalker to fulfill Frankenstein orders by using human blood to help create life in the lab and "Dracula" , because all assassinations are considered by everyone, except for the inspector and his face, to be a work of suffering. Thys elements are well blended by director Frank R. Strayer, with a little comedy thrown to a good deal. The composition works. The restored version saw the temptation used to enhance the scary atmosphere. So try to see this version if possible.
