A detective (Dana Andrews), with a reputation for violence, accidentally kills a suspect in a murder (Craig Stevens) and then tries to cover him. The film directed by Otto Preminger has a lot of atmosphere, but the story gets wet when the dead man's wife (Gene Tierney) falls for Andrews. She was doing pretty well digging into a big hole, but there was too much light at the end of the tunnel for a noir film. Gary Merrill is great as Scalese, a murderer of the crime that Andrews obsesses to bring him down, and the tension between him gives the movie energy and strength, especially a scene in a bathhouse with Merrill, Andrews and Neville Brand , and the night time outside the Bellevue Hospital, which sets out what the film should have concluded. Attractive markings for the atmosphere, Andrews, Merrill, etc. ... and the general portrayal of the underworld, although the angle of love and the sympathetic elements of evil policeman do not help their cause.
