A great piece of good cinema. This is one of those movies you see smiling and you do not know why. Well, one of the reasons could be that we are in front of one of today's most astounding directors and he is capable of filming emotions. When you look at the movie, you can feel what Mr. Straight was when he made the decision to visit his brother with John Deere's "wonderful". What changed in his mind? What changed in your mind when you watched this movie? A beautiful story of brotherly love.
