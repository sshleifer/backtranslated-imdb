Thanks to Kevin Smith, a lot of geeks are running around saying that Jedi Return is no good because it's actually fun to watch. And oh no! Muppets are involved! That is bad! Everyone liked the Jedi Return until someone in a Kevin Smith movie made a negative comment. Now all of a sudden, people look at you as if you had a disease if you mentioned how much you liked it. This movie is much better than anything else, Kevin Smith has ever thought of creating the fact that the man is going to even think about denouncing him. This movie is fun! It's just as wonderful as I remember when it was six! Enjoy this movie for what it is and stop stealing Kevin Smith's opinions! He is not right! And that Ewok song at the end has led! I bet people do not even enjoy "Ewoks: Battle for Endor" !!!! I'll give you all!
