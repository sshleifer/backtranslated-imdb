I'm sorry I have no idea what Hollywood is doing. Sure, give us movies like Batman Begins. Oh, from Hollywood, I think it could cover the story line in the Batman movie, but please do not have fun what we really want to see with Batman and Superman. I really hated this trailer because I let myself want more. I looked around to see when it came out. It was like a terrible practice joke. Graphics from where the story line seemed solid and had all the traps of a great movie. Unfortunately, it will not happen for the moment. For producers, directors and all actors, but I hate you because you did that to me. You let me want more.
