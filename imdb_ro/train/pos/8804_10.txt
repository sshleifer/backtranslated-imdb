Ten of the 11 short films in this film are masterpieces (I found only the disappointing Egyptian one). All Mexican directors, apart from the Mexican director, chose to describe the problems of individuals or groups related to 9-11: Afghan refugees, deaf people, Palestinians, Srebrenica widows, AIDS, African poverty and corruption, Pinochets blow, suicide in Israel, Muslim Americans struck by paranoia and persecuted Muslim Americans in the US, the elderly living alone and the consequences of World War II in the hearts of the Asian soldiers. This could say something sad about the limits of empathy in both directions: directors might feel that Americans ignore the pains of the rest of the world and care only for their own tragedies, while they actually do the same thing with their short films. Surprisingly, I found Sean Penn's song one of the best in the collection and *** SPOILER AHEAD *** I also imagine that Ernest Borgnine's portrait is like an old man, a plateau in New York who lives the happiest moment of his widow's life when the Sun shines through the window after the WTC crashes out of the light I think it could be one of the most delicate as the general audience American will see it.
