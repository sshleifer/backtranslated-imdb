Nowadays, most people do not watch classic movies like this. Most friends only watch movies from the '90s to the present. He's pretty stingy. <br /> <br /> The oldest films of this kind are masterpieces, unique in their own way. Just because, back when these movies were thought and made, when the ideas were fresh. Now people are just trying to think about new ideas. <br /> <br /> Anyway, at the movie. For true fans of classical horror. This is for you. The film is based on a Scotland Yard investigator who investigates the disappearance of a film actor and hinders three other strange events with the past residents of the same house. <br /> <br /> I will not say, because I will ruin the movie more than I already have. But it's a great movie for how old it is. And I would not be disturbed to follow her again!
