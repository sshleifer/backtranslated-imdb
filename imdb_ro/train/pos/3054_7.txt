"Panic" is a kind of comedy-comedy crime with William H. Macy, Donald Sutherland and Neve Campbell in the lead. Alex (played by Macy) is a guy who kills people for life. But for the time being, she is confronted with a depression and she sees a therapist. There she meets Sarah (Neve Campbell) and falls in love with her. He also faces another problem: he wants to give up his family business (crimes), but now he does not know how to tell his father. What follows is a guy's story during midlife-crisis, with which he's confronted with the usual problems: the love of a pretty young girl and everything that's going on with it. Pretty good acting performance. Macy is great as Alex depressed. I had great expectations for this movie and it was a good movie, but he does not offer it completely. The story was pretty flat and clich√©. <br /> <br /> 7/10
