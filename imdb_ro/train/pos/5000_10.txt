Creature Comforts in America should have been released on a different network or at least given the chance to run all of the episodes. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Considering that the American public (seemingly) has the attention of a gnomes when it comes to humor that does not consist in damaging diatribe with profanity or which has a scatological concern (sound and smell), such shows will be few and far between they. One of the main issues was that, however brilliant it was, it was made for a rare audience who knew what to expect but was seen by an audience and boardrooms who had no idea what they were looking for . Which is sad, but not unexpected. I would have liked to have seen at least three more seasons of this show, even if it was produced for direct DVD release. The material and interactions between the creatures were rich in subcontext and there were other conversations that were waiting to be worn under the surface. But because of political correctness, such conversations happen only in my mind.
