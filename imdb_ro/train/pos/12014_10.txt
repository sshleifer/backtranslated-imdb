This is by far the most incredible film I have seen for a long time. The actors offered wonderful portraits of film characters. The story has been accurately presented. The story starts with a young woman from the British Isles and her father traveling in Nauvoo, Illinois. She became a member of the LDS Church and did not. He thinks it's ridiculous to make the trip and that it's daunting. Encourages them to read about Joseph Smith, the Prophet. Here begins the story of the Prophet Joseph Smith. The film accurately describes the life and history of the LDS church at the same time. It was graphic sometimes, but it was needed. The emotional expression was very credible, which caused my emotions. Filming was wonderful. The way the story was presented was emotional. After the movie was over, we were unable to move. I was surprised. For those who know little about Joseph Smith, Prophet Mormon, I encourage you to see this. If nothing else but to gain an understanding of his life. For those who are members of the Church, I encourage you to see it. He will confess the testimony of this incredible man. We need to see this.
