8 Simple Rules is a funny show but also has some lessons of life, especially a mature lesson about moving after a loss that was the episode in which Paul died, which was the first episode I've ever watched about the show which comes to ABC. The Hennessy Clan - Mother Cate (Katey Sagal), Bridget (Kaley Cuoco) and Kerry (Amy Davidson) and Rory (Martin Spanjers) - look for each other for guidance and support after Paul's death), the patriarch of the family. Cate's parents (James Garner and Suzanne Pleshette) offer a hand. I enjoy later in season 2 of this show, decided to put David Spade in this show when it was finished with the NBC series Just Shoot Me! But everything and this show is pretty good. This show reminds me of a lot of classical family sitcoms from the 1980s and 1990s that were at ABC.
