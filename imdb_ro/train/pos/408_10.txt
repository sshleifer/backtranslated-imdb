I can not tell you how much I like this movie. I've read reviews that say this movement is "too confusing" or "like swimming in the drying of concrete." I say these commentators have no imagination! For anyone who loves Fantasy Fiction, this movie is for you. If you ever enjoyed playing Dungeons & Dragons ... this movie is for you (especially if you went into the Oriental adventures) I'm sorry I could not see this movie on the big screen. (Just more incentive to get your own big screen tv :-)
