I am the parent of a child with special needs and I really enjoyed the movie! It was loving, warm and fun. I learned a long time ago to see humor in things. I especially thought it was sweet like all other characters worried about Frankie and who would take care of him after his grandmother's death. I participated in an examination of the film with other parents and brothers of children with special needs before editing the film. Everyone enjoys the film and actually inspires wonderful discussions. We talked about the way our children make us laugh and talk about how we worry about it. The writer talked about how he works with children with autism and other children with special needs as volunteers for many years. She founded the character of a real person. Our family is blessed by a sense of humor that brought us through very stressful times. Give the film two fingers up!
