Michigan, Edgar Allen Poe, a toaster and a pan. . . If you do not mind the kind of psychological movie or thriller and you have a special place in your twisted heart, this is the movie for you. An amazingly well-developed film, "Hatred of a Minute", has as many hits as "Laughter of lambs" and classics of the cult, such as "The Army of Darkness". Edition and effects are well done, better than many genre films. Kallio weaves a complicated story of torment, drawing both the writings of the Bible and those of Poe. At a time when the big budget, the big name movies do not have much substance, the independent film has risen that dying trait. If you like Michigan, a good story or a decent thriller, check out "One Minute Hate".
