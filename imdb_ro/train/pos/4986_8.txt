Lensman is an anime less known from Toho and MK studios. It is based freely on the novel, but it reminds me more of the "Metroid" game. If you want to see this, see in Japanese with subtitles or just Japanese. The double English version was almost cut and edited to death. There are not many new things, despite being the first animated feature to combine CG graphics with hand-drawn animation, but it's fun to look at, though.
