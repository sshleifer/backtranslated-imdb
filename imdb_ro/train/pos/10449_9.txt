I have never heard of this movie a few weeks ago, but my concept interested me when I heard it: an American man meets a European woman last night in Europe and spend the night talking together. I was interested in it, but I never expected it to be so wonderful. Before sunrise is a masterpiece and is also one of the most romantic movies recorded. To my surprise, cynicism in the 1990s was completely lacking. It is impossible to talk too much about it because there is no real plot (although there are a lot of very interesting things to talk about, it's something like My Supper with Andre, where there is a conversation, but it's not even the CONCURSION which matters), but let me just say, you see it. See!
