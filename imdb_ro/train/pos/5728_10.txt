I went to this film waiting for an artistically frightening film. What I received was scared after scaring. It's a horror film at his base. It's not boring like other horror movies where a haunted house has only ghosts and ghosts. This movie does not even show you the majority of the deaths that the fear of characters shows. I think one of the best things about the concept in which it's not just the house that haunts those entering the house. They become haunted no matter where they are. Office buildings, police stations, hotel rooms ... etc After reading some external reviews, I'm really surprised that critics do not like this movie. I'll see him again this week and I'm excited about it. I gave this movie 10 stars because it did what a horror movie would have to do. That scared me.
