I agree with the previous comment on naming the content of the film "daily madness", but I would like to say that: "Dog Days" refers to how women are treated in a male society. The episodes we see here show a variation of the daily discrimination of women, mostly classified by age group. There is an elderly man who makes his new partner look and behave like his late wife, treating him as a doll that will act "worthy to wear" his dress. There is a middle-aged couple in whose relationship there is almost a slave and he is a master (violent). Moreover, we find a younger man who does not communicate with his boyfriend and wife, and instead of being really jealous in his affairs, he even does friendship with the competitor (s). A young adult man explains to his friend - a girl who is really troubled to be eager enough for him - that she must be the jewelery beside him and follow his narrow label rules. Finally, there is a fifty-year-old man who calculates his own advantage, offers him a simple traveling woman for an angry client who - taking her guilty when she scratches his car - naturally knocks it. To complete the examples, we find the man's girlfriend in the "slave master" - after collectively abusing her - threatening and humiliating the former "for her sake" because she will get rid of her partner and be considered new " master". All the while, the inhabitants of the recently built neighborhood, where the action takes place, rest under the sunshine - absolutely still (sic!). Unfortunately, we have not seen the last minutes of this shocking and authentic portrait of the archaic structures that still reign in the relationship between women and men, but what we have seen has convincingly analyzed the repertoire of discrimination. Perhaps a useful tool to teach even less sensitive viewers who do not work well - thanks to a good visualization.
