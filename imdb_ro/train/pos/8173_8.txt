The brilliance of this film is that even a competent dentist is quite scary. It is one of the primary fears of man. This movie is the nightmare that every child has to do in the waiting room. Corbin Bernsen gives a surprisingly unclear performance as a crazy dentist who thinks he's trying to kill people, but he only works on his teeth, so he's not really working. In a particularly difficult scene, we find both actor Earl Boen, teeth completely destroyed with exercises and what not, which I think is the worst absolute you can do when you are a killer dentist. It is a typical situation of Brian Yuzna, it is not well written, but there is a gore. The plot is unclear and sometimes seems to be done, but hey, it's a murder dentist, we all thought, but they did it first.
