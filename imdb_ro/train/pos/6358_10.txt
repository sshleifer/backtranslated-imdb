I like this movie but I can not get what it is in this tht movie is not to like. People who do not like the movie must be Richard Roeper and Roger Ebert. But I can not believe that Mr. Carrey is behind this makeup. And I'm sure most of the actors and actresses in the movie made a movie before that. And there's a new face in the movie. Taylor Momsen who plays Cindy Lou Cine. As he opens, Grinch (Jim Carrey) goes out of the way. And it's fun to Whoville. Sicne we know that those who love Christmas. While Grinch does not like Christmas. And she even has fun with little Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) who is the daughter of the postmaster of the city (Bill Irwin). The film was directed by Ron Howard. And Anthony Hopkins's narrator's voice. And Jeffrey Tambor (Muppets From Space) is distributed as a whoville mayor. Who does not like to talk about Grinch close to Christmas.
