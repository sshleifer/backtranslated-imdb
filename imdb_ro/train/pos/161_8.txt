This silly movie is very fun for the younger audience. Her heroes are a few detectives whose sophomorical attitudes lead them on silly roads. Chasing the big crime case, you will see that these detectives go everywhere to solve the crime. It's not a nudity, but a lot of sexual implications, a fool of horror ... all that adolescents do. Reduced budget, but very fun. Classic classic worship potential.
