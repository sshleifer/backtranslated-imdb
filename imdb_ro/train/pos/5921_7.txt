I was the production accountant in this movie, and I also have to do a voice work on it, so I'm not completely impartial, but if it were terrible, I would say. I thought it was a fun movie, not a critically acclaimed masterpiece, by any means, but there were plenty of laughs along the way. The Bible says that laughter behaves like a medicine, so viewing this movie could be good for your health. So many actors in this picture have not reached the peak when we made this movie. Susan Sarandon, of course, is one that has since earned much greater fame. Melanie Mayron was seen on television weekly as a photographer in the TV series "Thirty-something". Robert Englund later became known as Freddie Krueger, still haunting people's dreams. One of my favorite actors in this show was Dub Taylor, who played the sheriff. He was an excellent comedian and a really beautiful and honest person. We all had fun on this show and I think the fun goes through.
