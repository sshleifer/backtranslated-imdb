When two writers make a horror version of the Tiffany's breakfast, you know something will work fine. Drew Barrymore, Patrick Highsmith, Leslie Hope and Sally Kellerman are excellent actors. The FBI agent was a terrible actor. The scenes where Patrick watched Holly up and down as a kind of object were strange. Drew Barrymore is very hot. Intimate Strangers, where Sally Kellerman worked, was a big part. The weird worm was odd. Nathan was a very beautiful cat. But what was that scene where Patrick followed Holly in a box and Mr. Gooding attacked him? And the scene with Dr. Wallace? What was he doing here? And not every man has a woman, as Sally Kellerman said. And when Patrick and Elizabeth saw Drew outside Victor, it was weird.
