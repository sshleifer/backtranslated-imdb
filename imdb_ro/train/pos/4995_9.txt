I do not think most of us would have applied the term "must-see" to action movies, but I was very impressed with how good this movie was and why it is worth bringing me the "must-see" stamp ". Mandy, played by Shannon Lee (the daughter of the fair and great Bruce Lee and his sister Brandon Lee), is recruited by Martin, a professional thief who helps to get a diamond hit at a museum for a criminal syndicate, and be rewarded for this thing. Only they know that another pair of thieves (Lucy and Tommy, a pair of lovebirds) that earlier were told by Mandy and Martin to enter into business, also intends to steal the diamond. <br /> <> The way each pair of thieves plan heist is a being to follow. Things get wrong because Martin and Mandy are disobedient standing behind Lucy and Tommy. You will find yourself rooted for these thieves because they discover that they need each other to stay alive from the crime syndicate, who are not happy at all that the diamond is not in his hands. Action fans will not be disappointed, because there is a healthy dose of gun fighting, martial arts, and fights between sequential hands. What is surprising is the fact that it is not just the action that carries this film, it's romanticism and laughs (and I do not mean your one-suited guy, predominantly in action movies) that sneaks in. <br /> <br /> It's not easy to roots for bad guys, but we get to see the human side of these thieves and the chemistry it develops. A great movie and one do NOT miss! <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
