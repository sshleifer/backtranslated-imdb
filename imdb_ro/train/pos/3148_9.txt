I like this show. Period. I have not looked too much, probably just six months in fact, but now it's my favorite show and probably will be for some time. I like all the characters, except I do not care about Donna. I'm not sure why. I just ... I did not find it funny and I do not think Laura Prepon is a very good actress. Besides, it seems to me that the rest of the camp is pretty good. Kurtwood Smith and Debra Joe Rupp, who played the Erics parents, were extremely funny. Topher Grace is also a great actor. Unlike a lot of fans, I did not completely hate the 8th season. I'm still looking, and making me laugh. But if you compare it to the previous seasons, it's not good. Randy's horrible. The final was decent, nothing amazing, but good. =] I think it would have been better to cancel the show after Ashton and Topher decided to leave, but fine. I have the fourth season on DVD, and one day I hope I will have all eight seasons on DVD. Some of his most hilarious episodes, in my opinion, were "Dine & Dash," "Grandmas Dead," "Red & Stacey" and "Streaking," but I love every episode I've ever seen. =] 9/10 stars, I would certainly recommend. =]
