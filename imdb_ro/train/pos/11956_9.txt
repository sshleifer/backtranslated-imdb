I'd even say some hitchcocks from Hitchcock ... this is clearly better than MMM, which is regarded as a guilty pleasure by some, if not by most Woody fans. By the way, do you know that Annie Hall was conceived for the first time as a murder mystery? Anyway, Woody claims some relevance in the movie comedy with it. The plot tower is beautiful and tight. I will say that in the first 20 minutes, some actors are a bit too quick to take their lines, but stay around. Scarlett Johansson proves to be well-liked as Diane Keaton, and at no time there are no discomforts between her and the much older Woody. No one could imagine a more perfect actor for Peter Lyman's role than Jackman.
