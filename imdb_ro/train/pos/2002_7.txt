To some extent, I liked this film better than the original VAMPIRES. I find that the movie is quite misogyny. As a woman and a horror fan, I am accustomed to the fact that women in danger are a base of gender. But they just hit Sheryl Lee too much. In this film, Natasha Wagner is a more complete character, and the main evil guy is a gal! Arly Jover (who played a vampire in BLADE) is very strange and deadly. Jon Bon Jovi ... well, yes, no great actor, but he does well. At least he does not start singing. Get him on the cable if you can. This is Encore Action this month.
