A brilliant film about family, blame, sacrifice, betrayal and love. Macy is such an actor. It was almost ashamed to see him in the same scenes as Campbell, showing a part of a neurotic sexual object, but he does not have the chore to work with him at the level that the screenplay called him. But he is such a good actor that he has come down to her level to make the scenes work. He very much applauds Tracey Ullman's casting as a neglected wife. Who knew? Sutherland is also very good. The way it moves makes the character look taller (and even younger in some scenes). Almost everyone knew what they were doing. Macy's representation of the only situation where his character is not capable of being careful is nothing but a complete mastery.
