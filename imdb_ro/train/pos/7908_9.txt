I recently found a copy of $ 5 at a video store and I hit him impatiently. While the music and graphics (obvious) are not the standards of my favorite "Beyond the Mind" series, I'm still excited by a segment: Stanley and Stella in "Breaking the Ice". Music is brilliant, and emotions feel real. The video on Odyssey's website does not have the story or the music, unfortunately.
