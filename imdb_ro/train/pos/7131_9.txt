This movie made for television is extraordinary. This is probably the best and preferred role of BAFTA winner John Thaw (Kavanagh Q.C. and Inspector Morse). Tom Oakley (widow man), lived in a village for a while since his wife and son died, and was now landed with an evacuation named Willaim Beech (Nick Robinson). As she meets this child, she begins to develop a friendship. Until Willaim's mother (Annabelle Apsion) wants him back. After Tom worries that William does not contact him, he goes to London to find him. Eventually, Willaim has his own home with a loving family (or father). Located during the Second World War, this is an excellent movie. He was nominated for the BAFTA Lew Grade Award and won the National Television Award for the most popular drama. John Thaw was number 3 on the 50 major TV stars. Very good!
