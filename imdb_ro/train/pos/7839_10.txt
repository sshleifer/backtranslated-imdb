Panned by critics in time, but loved by fans, this movie has now become a classic. The supposedly "surreal" movie shot at John Lennon's home, among other places with live images of Marc Bolan & T.Rex in the best way, is not only a necessity for all who liked it to Marc Bolan, but it offers a fascinating insight into the era. These were the moments when Marc was hobbobbing with Ringo Starr of the Beatles [who directed him] and you can even find a short spot from a Reg Dwight [Elton John to you] bashing adventures in a Tutti Frutti's stunning [and never officially released version] and Rock and Ballad versions of the Children of the Revolution. There are wonderful scenes with Chelita Secunda [she said she created "glam rock" with her glitter use, etc.), Mickey Finn and even the actor at Catweazle! The best scene for me is in the garden when Marc leaves the table, sits down with his legs crossed in front of a string section and beats acoustic versions of classics such as Get It On and The Slider. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended! Five stars [out of five]. <br /> <br /> Rory
