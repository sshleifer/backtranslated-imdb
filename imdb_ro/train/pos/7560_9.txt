Starfucker (who reads Starstruck on my box) was the most amazing movie I've ever seen. I thought it was one of the best movies I've ever seen. So why not a 10? Nothing is perfect. Jamie Kennedy proves why he is one of my favorite actors in this very exciting aspect, to a darker part of Hollywood. We forced several others to watch the movie and they all agreed that it was a remarkable movie.
