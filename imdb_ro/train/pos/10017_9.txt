I absolutely loved this movie! I'm not referring to all the other comments I've read about it. I was completely excited every second! <br /> <br /> I discovered the close, intense story, and the spot-on direction. It would literally jump every time the phone rings near the end of the movie. Even if there was nothing "frightening" about the story itself, we were really on the edge of the whole movie - and for the rest of the evening. <br /> <br /> We have found that so many perfect choices have been made ... casting, script, small pieces of humor splashed into it. There were so many points where the film could have gone for the cheap emotion, but it never did, and that's why I put this film on top of many mediocre thrillers that have come out lately ... and for the last number of years.
