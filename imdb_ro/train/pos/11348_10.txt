I really liked this movie when I was a kid. I cried every time I looked at her. I was not weird. I totally identified with the characters. I would love to see again (and I hope I will not be disappointed!). Pufnstuf rocks !!!! I was really attracted to the fantastic world. And for me the movie was bad. I wonder if I saw the series and confused them? The act we thought was strong. I liked Jack Wilde. He was so dreaming at the age of 10 (when I first saw the movie, not in the 1970s.) Still remember the living characters, the flute was totally credible and I still can feel the bad forests, I pull the path.
