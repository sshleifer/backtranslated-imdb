You can discuss Prince's talent for action or even his choice to parody his own life in this movie. There is no debate about his musical talent, neither now nor now. Apparently it was shady - it was twenty years later, but music remains relevant and fantastic. <br /> <br /> After lived through the hype of this film (high school graduate in 1985), I can tell you that there was nothing bigger at that time. From Tipper Gore (Al's wife) trying to censure "Little Nikki" and everything else under the sun through the PMRC (Parent Center for Resource Centers) to every "air band" at the time, For at least a few weeks, The Prince was bigger than Madonna and Michael Jackson. <br /> <br /> We all waited the movie and I was excited by soooooo when she had the premiere. He did not disappoint. Everyone was caught. I was an MTV drugmaker at the time (actually, they played the music then ... all the time) The Prince played at least once or twice a hour. We have to qualify this comment by saying that at that moment my favorites were Billy Idol, Oingo Boingo, The Fixx, Flock of Seagulls and others like Punk / New Wave. "Prince's music then went beyond all types and styles. for which some of them seems to be so cheesy and controversial now is that it was SOUOOOOOO great then ... All the things that remind you of the 80's were iconic then ... It was the main stream and it seems to be a clich√© now. It's like a Wendy grandmother's advertising for Hamburgers. It looks stupid now that everyone was caught in it (unfortunately, like a bizarre violet macaron or something like this, I hope this gave you a little perspective.
