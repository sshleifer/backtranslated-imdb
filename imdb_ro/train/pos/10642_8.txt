I just saw Detention last night and I liked what I saw. It was a fun movie. Dolph looks super cool on Bike. He also looked good in this film compared to other recent movies. It's now in pretty good shape. This story was ok and the other actors were also acceptable. I would not call this movie the best, but it's still a good movie. But it also had Problems. The first was how bullets fled everywhere, and even when they were fired at the naked point, they lost their target. You should have shown him that PPL is bullet-proof in a better way. Another problem I had was how the students swore. I do not know which school students can swear at their teacher and even in the classroom. The third problem was that the bad guys were very few in number. There should have been more evil. The last problem was certainly that the set looked cheerful, but that is due to the small budget. Overall, the movie was a good movie. I liked. I would recommend to others to look at it. P.S. Now a DEAD beats a cop. (Some lines were also cool) <br /> <br />
