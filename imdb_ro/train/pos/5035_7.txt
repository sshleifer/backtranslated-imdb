McConaughey in a Horror / Thriller? I had to see this. I was pleasantly surprised. The plot is said in flashback mode, and it refers to an otherwise normal and happy family of three who go through a very bizarre situation. I can not say much more, without damaging the whole movie, I'm sorry. You just know that if you decide to follow, you will, at least, be surprised. All the main players are very good. Bill Paxton did a great job of directing these children, and his acting is wonderful. McConaughey's action is solid and fits perfectly with the project. <br /> <br /> This movie challenges you to think. Is Daddy crazy? Is there a God? Are there demons? How far you are going to mistake. And what is "right" anyway? I'm still thinking. And, therefore, I recommend "Fragility". 7/10 and this is one of those films that deserves and rewards a second or even third watch.
