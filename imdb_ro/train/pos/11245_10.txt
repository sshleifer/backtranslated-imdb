I first saw Breaking Glass in 1980 and thought it would be one of the "Classics of the movies." This movie is a wonderful look in the music industry with a wide variety of performers. This is a movie that should be in the collection of everyone and anyone who wants to enter the music industry. I can not wait for it to be available on DVD.
