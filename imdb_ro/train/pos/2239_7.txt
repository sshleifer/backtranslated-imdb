I think this movie will only work for people who have been stopped by the giant hype of Lord of the Rings. Well, that's how it was. And so I really like this movie. Especially since I like all the impeccable LotR heroes so perfectly parodied and disrespectful. The brightest is Gandalf's counterpart (brave and wise and fully humorous expert): Almghandi, cowardice and deadly transvestite brain. Sauron's correspondent ("East Germany" Sauraus, of course) simply carries a bucket with eye holes like a helmet. Aragorns alter ego is another accident prone idiot who tries to fix his broken sword (legend "Ulrike") with Scotch tape. And "Strunzdumm" (Wormtong's counterpart) really has a strong resemblance to Brad Dourif! And do not forget about Grmpfli and Heidi ... huh-huh
