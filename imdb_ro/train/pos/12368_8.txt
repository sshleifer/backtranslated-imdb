I had the TV for a white noise partner and heard "400 dollars for a fully furnished apartment" So I ran into the TV room waiting for another 70-year blow and I took a lot more. Fortunately, I could go back to the top (DVR buffer) and press the recording button to fully view it. (Cinemax untreated and in HD no less!) In addition to some holes in the story and intermittent intermittent / intermittent events, thriller worthy of time to watch. Pretty creepy and progressive from time to time: Beverly D'Angelo's character masturbates in front of Alison Parker, played deeply by Cristina Raines, Parker, very upsettingly, her father, an explicit man, a trio scene. watch) The film is full of 70 bad clothes (polyester costumes and sticky ascoto) and decor, bad hair, swirling music score and familiar cinema. The distribution is great, take a second on the homepage of this movie to check it out. It was a surprise to see Christopher Walken, Jerry Orbach and Jeff Goldblum so young. Sylvia Miles - always awesome creepy! Enjoy!
