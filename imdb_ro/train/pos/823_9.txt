Until the sixth and last episode of the Star Wars saga, which eventually ended in 2005, I have always looked at this entry since 1983 as my favorite long-haired movie. Various action scenes and genuinely different characters (Jabba The Hut, fur creatures with fur, etc.) made this film an attractive film. None of the actions focused too much in one place. The last half hour exemplifies this most as the scene goes from every few minutes from the forest to the spacecraft battle to the individual laser duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. Another beautiful feature of this film was that the two precedents was not the lack of fighting between two stars. Gone was always between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford. Finally, everyone is on the same page! It was nice to see. In the end, it was simply a wonderful adventure story, more than anything else.
