I do not think this movie is for everyone. But I saw it on the weekend in Seattle and I thought it was so funny. I have not laughed so hard during a long time. I thought all the distribution did a great job. You will find the laugh from the first moment through the last scene. I suspect some viewers (especially those who take too much seriously) will be stopped by this brand of humor. Not I. The film was a real surprise. And the whole theater was laughing along the show I was going to, which made me think a lot of people were enjoying themselves and were happy to have a good time at the movies for a change. I can not wait to see him again! If you like LOL, then this is for you Funny funny funny funny!
