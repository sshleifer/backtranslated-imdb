When I went to watch this movie, my expectations were very low, but I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> I thought I was going after a boring teenager, but in fact the plot was interesting and well executed, the act was somewhat convincing - especially from Melville, who shows his talent in this film, and the battle scenes were - for a low-budget movie - very well done. I think this film deserves a wider audience than it has received. It's a movie that can be seen by the entire family - perhaps not the smallest of the children, because it contains some pretty tough scenes. A movie about love and the issues that can arise when you go against your family's traditions. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is very similar to 'Bend it like Beckham,' but I think this movie is better.
