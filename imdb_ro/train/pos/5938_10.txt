Another refined taste of what should be a superhero after Batman: Dead End, which just helps us to stimulate our tastes and leaves us to want more! It should look like a true superhero movie and feel that way! Even hard is a fanfilm of a kind. The attention to detail, character and action is undoubtedly real. Although this is a limited production of resources, it puts into shame the big "other stuff" related to the superhero in the budget. Here the main characters and support act and look as if they were real people. Finally, a Superman who actually looks "super" and looks like a real thing! Batman, as it should be, without being made of fake rubber, broke his armor to hide the physical stress of the paid actors who do not deliver them. I wish that a good Warner Bros. performer gives OK to produce a complete adaptation of this jewelery. I do not care if he goes to the theater or directly to the DVD, I would not bother to see him. Only the plot itself deserves my hard-won dough for that. We hope the Marvel & DC "bigwigs" take a look and see what a true superhero should look like. There is no fiasco "Batman & Robin" or Hulk, Daredevil etc. Learn from these little time directors and learn that there should be no reason to reinvent the film hero just to have a "bomb" in theaters. Mr. Collora ... We need more directors like you!
