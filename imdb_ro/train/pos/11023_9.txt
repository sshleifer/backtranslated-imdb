Sylvester Stallone's choice to play the protagonist by Renny Harlin is commendable because Stallone is a kind of tricky and confusing person who earlier offered a versatile versatile aura for the characters of Rocky Balbao and Rambo. But to compare Die Hard with Cliffhanger is a long notion. The excellent artistic opening scene introduces audiences into thrill, suspense and intrigue that will bury them in bleeding and dangerous encounters with criminals. Heist and the transfer of high-altitude hard money in the case of suits from one plane to another is something has not been filmed before. The cold snow bite covered Alps and deception unfolding and betrayal between the antagonist forces make the tremors. Wonderful adventure and relentless murder forces hit the drama to the end. Good movies are not made every year and people do not get an eye feast to watch from time to time. In addition to dirty language / language that gives enthusiasm during certain scenes, the film can be regarded as a film that will not disappear from its addictive attraction even if it follows it after so many years.
