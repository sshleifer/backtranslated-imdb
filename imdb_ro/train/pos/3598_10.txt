Being a person who usually does not enjoy boxing movies, feeling that he focuses only on the speaker and not on the characters themselves, this movie really moved me. I loved seeing the main character Diana (Michelle Rodriguez) going through so many things in such a short period that it was amazing for me. Michelle (Rodriguez) has done such a wonderful job playing Diana's role, especially since this was her first acting experience, she showed a real emotion and performed wonderful Diana. All actors had chemistry on screen and made this movie even more amazing. I recommend this movie even to those who do not usually see boxing movies. 10/10
