Definitely a very good idea, the scenario was OK. It would have been better, the Positives are not born to you if you are a lover adventure, a new idea about the lost world of Atlantis. The negatives are that I personally have this idea so much more potential than that. It should have been a better adventure than that. It was not bad at all, but it would have been much better with more runtime. You are happy much, but, Cant say it was boring or not good. A good one for those who love adventure animations like Sindbad, how would be the Road to him Dorado.This film is also recommended for those looking for a wonderful adventure with a very beautiful happy ending.
