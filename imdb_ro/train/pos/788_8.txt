Okay, I admit it. I think Kenny Doughty looks amazing in this movie - but beyond his good looks, the film is worn by a predictable but reasonable plot. Starting with us, we introduced our three leading women to the film. A director - very worried about her image and never married. A police officer - with a child and a bad guy to go on. The third - a doctor of power and hunger, with a desire for recognition and three ex. They are almost the "Club of the First Wives", and indeed there are many verbal bangs of the ex involved, and some "left the credit card behavior." Set characters - movie continues. The character of McDowell, the director, arrives late at a funeral - if a young organist who completes for the average player (Doughty) catches her eye. What will her two friends say about the evil that followed? Will they ever live happily ever after? A tissue or two is recommended if you are a tear-print - the end of the ascension, but perhaps not what you would expect. All in all a great movie, which stands out among the current action choices, special effects and horror schlock.
