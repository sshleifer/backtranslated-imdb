I have to admit that I was one of the skeptics who prematurely judged this show before relatively any information was circulated about it. I decided it would be a cheap spin-off, guided by Ronald D. Moore, wearing the retinue. I was wrong! The pilot leaves an excellent impression on the spectators. Accessibility is great! Of course, seasoned BSG veterans will be booming, focusing on the development of the Cylinders before the first war. (58 years before the events of the BSG pilot). The pilot also allows newcomers to present their plot and ideas clearly in the first part of the episode. Do not be fooled: "Caprica" ​​is not BSG. We are presented with an immersive, cerebral drama with challenging, daring and controversial ideas. <br /> <br /> Casting maintains BSG standards; Stoltz and Morales are just amazing. Joseph Adama's Morales' image, inspired by William William's portrait, offers a wonderful look at William's hero's father. Stoltz's presentation by Dr. Graystone challenges a lot of thinking and questions. If the quality of the pilot is an indication of what is to come, RDM and the creative team are ready to continue BSG's legacy - television programming with another mastery masterpiece.
