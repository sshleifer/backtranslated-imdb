This movie was amazing. It's a cinema-inspired play. The characters are fully developed by the fact that the director Lucy Walker brings to the film. I recommend this to anyone looking for the special film that shows humanity in human condition. Lucy Wlaker presents the beauty of the landscape. This film is a true example of man toward nature and sometimes human to man. The inner disorder and the triumph are huge in its object. The subject of Tiebtans's view of blindness as a sign of demons is interesting. This film brings to light a certain culture that has never been presented. Lucy Walker gave Erik Weihenmayer a voice when he would not have been heard. Thank Lucy for being true to your boss as a director.
