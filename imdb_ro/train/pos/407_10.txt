God, give me a minute to breathe. This movie takes you on a wonderful walk and does not let you go until the last blow in your head. This is the movie for fans of Stormriders and others. Zu's legend was beautiful, although I did not like a few things, they used a lot of people. I wanted to see the real fight, but, oh well ... a few small descents, and I did not like it until I saw it again, when you understand it, I hit it all! I encourage anyone ever to see a real Asian film to watch this movie. I give this film one of the highest ratings.Go and see when it comes to America !!!
