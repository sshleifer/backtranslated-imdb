Only two comments .... Seven years apart? Just the proof of the shooting force of the movie! As noted, 13 GANTRY ROW's low-budget telecoms are an attenuating factor in the limited appeal. However, things are not deserved - either as fun or as a terrible excursion per se. True, the plot at the bottom is a reworking of AMITYVILLE HORROR - only without much horror. More intrigue! Gibney could have made a more valuable impression if he played Halifax - investigating a few ubiquitous murders with "house" as the main suspect. The scenario is better than average and high standard production. It fails to engage the viewer, especially at key moments. After selecting my DVD for a week last week at my regular video store, I can not investigate my expenses. $ 10.95 would be an acceptable price for the movie. Just do not expect fireworks!
