I like it because of my recent experience. Especially the ideas that everyone is free and that everything is finished. The company's characters did not really enjoy their "real" life, but they enjoyed themselves, that is, what they were. The movie did a good job making this simple day a good memory. A good memory includes not only the romantic feelings about a beautiful stranger and a beautiful European city, but certainly a deeper discussion of their values ​​of life. Many films are so from the point of view of discussions about the definitions of life or of love or of relationships or current issues in life or of such. Before sunrise, she takes care of her in a beautiful way, which makes the spectator interrupt and think and adjust his breath and keep watching the movie. Before sunrise, you did not try to instill a specific idea in your head. Encouraged you to think about some of the problems in your everyday life and gave you some alternative options. This made the conversation between the characters interesting, not just the typical complaints of crying or the bad ideas flowing. You still think about these issues and you're interested in the next line of the story. The end was not at all important. You could get something out of it and feel something good or positive after you after the movie. Movies should be enjoyable. This is a nice movie and it's worth watching on time. And I'm on a trip. The film was somewhat part of me and answered some of my questions.
