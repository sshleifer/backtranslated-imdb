I often wonder why this series has been hit so much. I thought it was brilliant and also written very carefully and interpreted. I think he will, in time, be seen in the light he deserves, that is, if he ever emitted it. This is where many young comedians appeared, who came closer and continued to do bigger things. Perhaps this will make people aware of its value and will need to be issued. Sally Phillips, Simon Pegg, Peter Serafinowicz and, last but not least, Julian Rhind-Tutt from the successful green wing. Writers Graham Linehan and Arthur Matthews are two of the best comedy writers of the modern age. Anyone can produce a comedy that Father Ted might not be able to write something that does not deserve to be published. If it's ever emitted, I'll definitely buy it.
