A typical story through the reality of Cheech and Chong, which includes drugs, singing, more drugs, cars and driving, even more drugs, Pee Wee, aliens, gasoline, laundry, comedy standing, surprisingly more drugs and SPACE COKE !! It's not as coherent or plausible as Up in Smoke, but it's still incredibly funny without becoming as strange as the Nice Dreams. There are some classic scenes that include the opening scene where they get a gas for their car and drive to work. Also amusing is Cheech's song (Mexican-Americans) and track track of Chong. Another notable scene is the social office scene with Jones (Human Noise Machine), the Police Academy series and the old laughing man. All in all, this is a great pursuit to smoke and it is quite watched when sober or not. -Celluloid Rehab
