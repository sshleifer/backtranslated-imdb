First of all, I like almost all the movies of Neil Simon. But there is something about this, which is unique, that attracts me and I would say that it is among the most fun comedies I've ever seen. The second time I looked at her, the connection was clear. When did Neil Simon meet with my grandparents? <br /> <br /> Ah, fear that he could sue, so he changed them into people. And how boring it would be if it were just housewives, show biz stars is more fun. Well, this is a personal review, and my grandfather still alive at the age of 97 (she even surpassed Walter Matthau's magnificent impersonation with her!), He would deny it, but some of you must find resonance in these characters. > Secondly, I have a little tolerance for George Burns, but in a way it has turned into one of the best supporting performances I can remember (and her late grandmother even enjoyed it, though she did not recognize it the remarkable similarities that he shared with the character of the film). <br /> <br /> Very ethnical in flavor, and over the top, either you will laugh and laugh, or you will disable this. For me, the pleasure remains.
