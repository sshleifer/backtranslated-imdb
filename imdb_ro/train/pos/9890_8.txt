Unfortunately, this movie has never done on DVD. I saw it when it was launched for the first time in theaters in 1983 and then when VHS was released in 1992. When I recently saw a VHS copy on a flea market, I bought it immediately. I was not disappointed. First of all, obviously: Claudia Ohana is beautiful and a joy to look. But then, the film takes you into an unreal world where you have to reflect on your values ​​and decide what is really important to you. The movie is about many things. It's about how the World Bank and the big corporations exploit and enslave developing countries with their capitalist schemes to force them into a debt they can never repay. It's about how our economic system exploits us, forcing us to pay in debt with credit cards, mortgages and car payments. It's about trying to save an innocence that we probably never had, and maybe we can not really save it. It's about good and bad and how hard it is sometimes to tell each other. It creates many questions but does not answer. I think sometimes it's good. For this reason, it is a film that deserves to be saved and seen.
