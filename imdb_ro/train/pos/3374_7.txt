"Green Soylent" is one of the best and most disturbing science fiction films in the 70's and still very persuasive even by the current standards. Although mistaken and a little dated, the apocalyptic touch and the ecological premise (typical for that moment) still feel very disturbing and provocative of thought. The quality level of this film exceeds most contemporary SF films because of its strong distribution and intense sequences that I consider classic. New York in 2022 is a depressing place to be alive, with overpopulation, unemployment, unhealthy climate, and the total lack of every vital food product. The only form of available food is synthetic and distributed by Soylent. Charlton Heston (in an excellent form) plays a policeman who investigates the murder of one of Soylent's most eminent directors and stops scandals and dark secrets ... The scenario is sometimes too sentimental, and the climax does not come as a big surprise , still the atmosphere is very tense and weird. The succession of revolts is truly scary and easily one of the worst moments in cinema in the 70's. Edward G. Robinson is ultimately impressive in his last role and there is a big role (but too modest) to support him Joseph Cotton ("The Baron Blood", "The Abominable Dr. Phibes"). This is science fiction in my book: a feeling of nightmare and inevitable for mankind! There are no fancy spaceships with hairy monsters attacking our planet.
