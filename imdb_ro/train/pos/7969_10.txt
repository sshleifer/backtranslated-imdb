Homeward Bound is a beautiful movie. You know the part where Shadow falls on the trench ... stuff, I shouted *, considering I was only six, I cried! it takes a long time to make me cry! Dogs and cats are excellently trained. A nice family film, * not * for people who are not completely fluffy or animal feeders, but could also for soft-as-shit people like me. A good overall movie, 10/10!
