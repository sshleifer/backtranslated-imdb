As a person looking for a "professional" person with income earned by a BS in Chemistry and MS in Business Management, my health has always been spasmodically sustained in external indulgences in more artistic things. Post-graduate courses have always been emotionally and spiritually supported by interest in photography, stained glass, ceramics, metal forging / welding, and artwork including silk screening. with jogging, walking and lately, hiking to distant destinations in California and nearby states such as Utah, Arizona and Nevada. Jogging, walking and hiking become one close to the ground, time to stop and watch and listen and shoot or record sounds. In this context, I was obsessed with RIVERS AND TIDES. I was equally impressed with the documentary content of artist Andy Goldsworthy as well as with the skills and smoothness of director / cinematographer Thomas Riedelsheimer. In fact, I could not separate Goldsworthy's art from the Riedelsheimer room. Wonderful. Wonderful. Wonderful.
