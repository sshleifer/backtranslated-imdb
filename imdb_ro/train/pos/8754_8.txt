I watched this movie 11 years ago, along with my best female friend. I took my teeth out, so I did not feel very good. I've come to like it for a long time. It is a great watch if you take into account the fact that it deals with friendship, unwanted betrayal, power, money, drug trafficking, and the extremely difficult situation that deals with living in a foreign prison. on the first level. Two of the women I want the biggest star and that's a good thing. Claire Danes is as cute and charming as ever, while Kate Beckinsale is extremely hot and offers good performance. Bill Pullman is also awesome and demonstrates his histrionic qualities. There are many plot overturns to dig and make an interesting visual experience. In addition, it shows the difficult time in Thailand. This is an undervalued movie. Not more films like this have appeared in recent history. You should refuse many things ...
