"Casomai" is a glamorous story that describes the story of a young couple who went through the troubled waters of marriage. The story is very credible in telling the weirdness seen between oblivion and interference by others, which is quite typical in Italy (one may wonder if such happenings are different elsewhere). Pavignano and D'Alatri were very good in writing, and this is one of the strengths of the film. Stefania Rocca and Fabio Volo are awake and tight. And the figure of the sympathetic priest is funny and well rounded. In total, a truly worthwhile movie, probably one of the best Italian movies of the year.
