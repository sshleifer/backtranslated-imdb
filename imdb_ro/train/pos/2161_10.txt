How many of us want us to be able to remove our social and cultural obligations and to be free? Most of us, I guess. We Dance? it's not a movie about dance. It's about learning about ourselves, recognizing what we are looking for in life, and with the courage to go looking for it. Mister. Sugiyama is a middle-aged member of a Japanese society where dance in the ballroom is considered to be inappropriate. <br /> <br /> One day, Mr. Sugiyama sees a beautiful girl leaning from the window of a dance acadam. he is fascinated by it and eventually signs for dance lessons. He is ashamed of his dance and of ridiculous fear. He hides the fact that he attends dance classes from his colleagues and his family. There is a hilarious scene in the mensroom at the office when Sugiyama and Watanabe, a work colleague who also dances, are interrupted practicing some dance steps. There are many other fun and warm-hearted scenes. The end is not a fairy tale, but it lets the spectator feel good. This movie helped me understand the Japanese people a little better. It's a hot movie and very useful to see.
