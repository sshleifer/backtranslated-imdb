I was intrigued by this film for a while, partly because of the extremely high score here on IMDb - an average of 9.0 with over 300 votes gives her the highest score for any silently accessible movie! How did I hear about this movie before this site? Well, you can not always trust the ratings. This is actually a very good movie, kept pretty good if the fine VHS transfer I've been renting is an indication - excellent acting by directors, especially William Haines like Brown, and a good location at Cambridge with some movies fine action in the Harvard climate / Yale football game - but the story must have looked like a cheery chest even in 1926. The ordinary, selfish and charismatic guy goes to school and gets put in his place, becoming a thoughtful friend in the process slaughter; I doubt that the people of 1926 found many very interesting things in the last cylinders, the predictability factor is high. However, it starts very well and certainly deserves to be remembered, if not to praise the heavens. Perhaps the 350 previous voters are mostly men from Harvard ... EDIT Now 600+ voters and the score actually rose to 9.2! Seriously, good people, the voting squad happens - I'm advising someone to explain why it's a better movie than "Metropolis" or "The General"!
