This movie draws you so deep into the two main characters. I grabbed it in my laptop without even reading the cover (let alone the comments) and intrigued two hours of solidity. Two lost ships from two different worlds collide. The sexual tension that flows between a secretary and a murderer is almost palpable even without almost any physical contact. Toward the end we could not decide what we wanted more: our hero and heroine to take off their caper or to complete their passion. RML could have done without a curious subplot and a traditional 100 minutes would have been a lot. Still, I'm wrong. After a series of Netflix, Blockbuster and local library films, this movie has restored my confidence in making great movies.
