A boy and a girl are watched by a local warrior because the boy killed (accidentally) the warrior father (or whoever he was). And they travel through the nature of the largest areas of Africa. The action in this movie is not that good (except for that child of elephants). But it is a very good adventure and is not very censored, there is blood, flesh and nudity (which illuminates the film a little). I give this film a 7 thanks to its African character and action.
