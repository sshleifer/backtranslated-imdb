Sudden Impact is the 4th Dirty Harry movie and one of the best features of these movies is that they do not really degrade as a movie. Thus, Sudden Impact offers another journey through the life of Dirty Harry Callahan. This time, Harry tries to solve a series of murders on vacation. Harry is always at work. Clint Eastwood plays Harry as he plays all his men, slowly, deliberately and without fear. Being the first Dirty Harry movie to be released in the '80s, "Sudden Impact" lacks a 70-year feel that characterizes the first three films. This does not mean that quality is lower. Bottom line: Brimming with intensity and action, Sudden Impact is another addition worthy of the Dirty Harry series.
