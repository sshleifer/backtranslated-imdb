I have not seen much German comedy, but if this movie is something to do, I'm bound to see more! A simple but effective story takes two very different people on a trip from Germany to Italy, after Eva, a two-person unemployed mother, discovers that her husband has an affair with the wife of a wealthy lawyer. I will not reveal anything more, but what results is a very fun series of events with the perfect conclusion. My interest in international cinema has expanded since I first saw this movie. I recommend to anyone (any adult ... not to include small children to trick you into thinking it's a family movie) who love comedy - even those who do not know the language.
