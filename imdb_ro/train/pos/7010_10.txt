Before seeing this movie, I see a lot of comments that everyone has a wonderful view of the good or bad movie ... What I really want to emphasize is to act on Woody Harrelson he can not be in many parts of the movie, but when it appears or even intro, I was amazed at Will Smith's and Woody Harrelson's "message" that they tried to create, and maybe slide the whole plot to the end to really understand what happen. I'm not a very sentimental person, I think a good deed should not have remorse or pity behind her. But an act that shows the redemption, there are not many films that, in my view, can show this. This is one of them who can. I agree with a person who commented on this film showing that "suicide" acts as a fall, yet I do not think it is the "message" of the movie trying to send, but "sacrifice". A little to the extreme, but this is the message in my opinion. This movie has potential. The actor deserves every penny, the script is unbelievable. from a person who does not really like watching movies of drama ... if you like drama this is a must watch watch.
