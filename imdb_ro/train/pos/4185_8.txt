This movie has everything that makes a bad movie worth watching - inappropriate editing, little to no continuity, insane dialogue, bad (it may even say nonexistent) act, unnecessary lines of story, photos that go on FAR too much ... is perfect for MST3K style riffing, not to mention "Corpse Eaters Drinking Game": Scribble on shapes ... take a shot - Sign your name ... shoot a shot - Grab a bad Foley edit ... take many, many photos. The only reason why we did not evaluate more than eight is that there is not enough free nudity and that despite its mad malice it is only a long hour - hell, a movie like this should have been with at least 20- 30 minutes longer!
