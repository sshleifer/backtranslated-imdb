Of course it may not be a classic, but it's a classic one. One of the few movies that my friends and I cite forever, and this is fifteen years later (Maybe it was too many times on Cinemax!) Michael Keaton is, in fact, the worst actor in the movie - it can not seem learn how to play - but it's surrounded by a fantastic cast that knows exactly how to play this spoof. Looking for a movie to cheer you up? That is, but rent it with your friends - it will do even better.
