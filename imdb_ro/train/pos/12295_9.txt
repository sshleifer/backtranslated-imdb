"Hotel du Nord" is the only Carné film from the 1936-1946 era, which has dialogues that were not written by Jacques Prévert, but by Henri Jeanson. Janson was more interested in the Jouvet / Arletty couple than the two lovers, Annabella / Aumont. The latter is quite bland and their story strangely recalls Edith Piaf's song "les amants d'un jour", except that the story of the chanteuse is a tragic one. What is fascinating today is this less popular world, the Saint-Martin Canal. The film is cute for French films for another very special reason. Prosecutor Jouvet tells his protector Raymonde that he wants an air change (atmosphère). Because he does not understand the meaning of the world of light, Raymonde (the wonderful Arletty) thinks she is an insult and she offers this line, the most famous of French cinemas: in French: "Atmosphère? Atmosphère? Est-ce que j'ai une gueule d'atmosphère?" Trying to translate: "Atmospheric atmosphere? We received a face of the atmosphere? This is our French" No one is perfect ".
