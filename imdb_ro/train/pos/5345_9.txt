Yesterday, my Spanish / Catalan wife and I have seen this emotional lesson in history. Spain goes back to the political confrontation. That is why this masterpiece should be presented in all Spanish high schools. It is an extraordinary lesson in the hidden crime of fascism. The American pilot involved in the Spanish civil war chose the democratically elected Republican government. The criminal role of religion is surprisingly well presented in one of the most inventive scenes that Uribe ever did. The colors are magnificent. The cruelty of a war (can anyone tell me the difference between any war and a civil war?) It is used as a scenario of hope when two young children express their feelings and protect each other. Chasers who start abusing power even against innocent children are now active again. A movie like "El lifeje de Carol" / "Carol's Trip" tells one of the many stories that lived in the 20th century. It's a better lesson in history than any book could contain. Again, a great work on the Iberian Peninsula!
