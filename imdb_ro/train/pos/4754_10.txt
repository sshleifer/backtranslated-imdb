One of my first episodes in the Twilight Zone. And the next day I was at the Hollywood Blvd. supermarket and La Brea, my dad and me, and guess who's coming to us on the aisle! Barney Phillips, but no hat - at least, I do not think he has a hat. I asked him about the third eye and told me something like he left her home, and everyone she met that day asked about it. A friendly guy. I used to see all kinds of actors in LA in those times. BTW, I was a teenager and it took me a long time to cross the "three hands" on the other alien! <br /> <br /> Robyn Frisch O'Neill <br /> <br /> I live and live in Hollywood between 1947 and 1963.
