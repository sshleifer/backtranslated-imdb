Yes, I call this movie perfect. It is not a boring second, a fantastic cast of actresses and very little known actors, a wide variety of characters that are well defined and have all the understandable motifs I can feel, perfect illumination, a clear black and white photo , a sound soundtrack, a smart and harmonious design, and a story that is committed and working. It is one of those premium quality images that all Hollywood pride should rest, a mark that everybody should strive to achieve. Barbara Stanwyck is simply amazing. There was nothing that this actress could not do, and she always went easy on the melodramatic side. There were no hysterical outbursts with this lady - I always thought she was a better actress than screenwriters such as Bette Davis or Joan Crawford, and this movie confirmed my opinion. Always as hard as nails and at the same time to convey true feelings. It is fair to add that he has also obtained many good parts during his long career, and this is by far the least interesting. The title fits well with this movie. These are desires, human desires, which everybody understands. In fact, no one seems schematic in this movie, all the characters act impulsively, everyone wants to be happy without suffering anybody else. Sad fact that this often leads to complications makes for the dramatic content I will not go to here. I liked what this movie has to say about youth, about maturing and the need to compromise. The film that he most closely associates with is Alfred Hitchcock's Shadow of Doubt, creates a similar atmosphere of a small town in America idealized and at the same time caricature. The story has a certain resemblance to Fritz Lang's much harder film, Clash by Night, made a year before, in which Stanywck plays in a similar part. I also recommend it.
