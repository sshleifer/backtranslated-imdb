This TV series was one of those I loved when I was a kid. Even though I can see it now through the pink nostalgia glasses, I can say it is a quality, very educational, but still fun show. I did not see the original French version, only Swedish. I have no idea how good it was to duplicate, it was too much time to remember you. The premise of the show was to show you how the body works. I swear, the school has not yet taught me half of what I know from this show. It is also related to other things, such as what happens if you eat unhealthy foods and do not exercise, with beautiful examples inside the body. Who wants to have another chocolate when you know that miniature virus tanks can invade you? : D The card looked nice, very friendly, of course, but with care. Cells, viruses, electrical signals in the brain, antibodies and everything else are cartoon smiley figures, showing pretty much how you expected how they should look in the animated body. the history series (especially the scary final of the environment) were essential parts of my childhood. I'm so happy I found them here.
