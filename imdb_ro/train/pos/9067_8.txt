After being forced to sit through some real stinkers (Racing Stripes, Shark Boy and Lava Girl) - I really enjoyed seeing "Fried Worms". For once, I did not guess the end! It was fun and fun and did not resort to a ton of gross humor, despite the title. My boys (6 and 10) loved them too - oh and my 45-year-old boy had a smile on his face all the time. This is a family film that is not just tolerable for parents. The relationship with the younger brother is so close to real life. "It does not stop singing just to annoy me!" Also, the way the new child is trying to make friends and how those friends actually form is exactly how they behave. Of course parents must act a little badly - but my favorite scenes involved my dad to get used to his new job. To have fun!
