In the sixties. There were some exciting movies. I was more of a movie that came then. I now like to rent movies and relax in my house than to go to the theater. I also saw this short film, "The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle". I've been looking for this movie for years. It was really inspiring. Surprisingly, I finally managed to gather more information from your site. Thank you ........ I am surprised to find that this short film was an opening for a Disney image. And I did not remember Disney movie. I did not even remember that it was an opening film for Disney. I really want to show this on TV sometime. I wonder if Disey holds the rights to this movie? Is it available on DVD? This is a vision for all generations!
