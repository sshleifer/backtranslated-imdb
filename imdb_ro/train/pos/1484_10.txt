"CASOMAI" was the last movie I saw before getting married last year. <br /> <br /> It was also the first movie I searched for after I got married, because we promised to offer a copy to our priest. Sometimes the reality is not that apart from fiction. For all those who wrote those priests like "Don Camillo" does not exist in real life, I would recommend that my priest Pe visit me. Nuno Westwood, in Estoril, Portugal :-) <br /> <br /> For all the others, I would just recommend seeing this movie before and after "I do!" day :-) <br /> <br /> Rodrigo Ribeiro Portugal
