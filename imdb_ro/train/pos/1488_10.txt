This is the movie to see if you want to marry or you're a married couple. The film portrays a couple in Italy and deals with such difficult issues as abortion, infidelity, juggling and family. The so-called "culture of death" that we are living nowadays in the world is terrible and this movie will make you think. <br /> <br /> You have to see. I hope it is distributed as it should. Congratulations on the distribution and director. Two fingers and a 10-star rating from me!
