Director Samuel Fuller creates a brilliant visual configuration: the lively pocket listens involuntarily to a microfilm from a woman's bag; proves to be a Communist courier, and now she and her police are being watched. Formula Noir Formula is all its glory - before the ingredients become clich√©s - including seafront location, fluorescent, saxophones on the soundtrack and a climate icon. The performances of Richard Widmark and Jean Peters are headed straight to the target, and the clever and sharp scenario is quite colorful. Fabulous Thelma Ritter received an Oscar nomination for the role of "knockout" as a "professional stall". Interesting, atmospheric, hard as nails. *** from ****
