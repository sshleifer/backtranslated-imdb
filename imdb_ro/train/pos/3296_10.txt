Mum Kumari presents more style and grace, moving from legs, standing on the floor than you can find in most other movies. The director has produced many memorable scenes of touching beauty than seems possible. Music and dance are of the highest quality possible. You can see in the first dance scene that the director has all sorts of things happening in the background: other dance dances, a beating that falls on the stairs, a lot of activity, but he knew we were looking at the Mina dance and bet if not seen many times, you have not noticed. Always, perfection. JQ
