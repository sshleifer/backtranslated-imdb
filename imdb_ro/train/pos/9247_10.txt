I was expecting this movie to be a love story from the 1930s. The boy meets with a girl, falls in love, the boy loses his girl, and the boy finally wins. It was not like that. Clark Gable interprets con artist Eddie with all his usual charisma and the growth of malicious eyebrows. He's hiding from the cops when he breaks out in Ruby's apartment (Jean Harlow) to find her bubble-covered bubble, no less. Instant chemistry. Playing hard to get for a while, but a girl can only resist that grit for so long. The heat between them is obvious and there are some scenes that are certainly pre-production code! When a blackmail goes wrong, and Ruby ends up in a boardroom for "troubled girls," she's miserable, and because of the pests that her roommate gives them, she starts to think that Eddie will never come for her. Harlow perfectly interprets Ruby desperately, speaking fast. Never leave Gable all the good lines! There is a particularly moving scene, playing their "play" on the piano, which behaves perfectly. The last fifteen minutes has been crying me every time. A truly sweet love.
