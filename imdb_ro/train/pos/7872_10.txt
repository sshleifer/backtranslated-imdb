The first review I saw about "said what the madhur bhandarkar wants to say?" It should say something so decisive. The most beautiful thing about this is that he has no part. No propaganda. This is the movie that captures so many angles of a problem (I do not know what I call a "problem" here) and yet, like any mediocre film, there is no solution. I was so intrigued when I realized that the movie ended almost in the same scenario, just as it did. The film defines so many characters that are full of completely different priorities and different ideologies, yet they are all part of the system that is even more apathetic. I wish I could say more, but there will be more spoilers ahead. So watch if you want to see one of the most mature films of recent times.
