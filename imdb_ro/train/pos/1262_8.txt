A graduate student of the young and seemingly promising faculty (played by Blair Underwood) is sent to prison for killing an innocent girl and is put to death. Sean Connery interprets the lawyer "happily going lucky" that the young man's grandfather descends from his pension and prays to take the case in hopes of releasing his nephew. Laurence Fishburne plays a police officer who was well involved in this case and is eager to reveal a theory that Connery might be amazed to try to free the boy whom he and the entire police department swear to be guilty of murder. Ed Harris, Kate Capshaw, Ruby Dee and Late Lynne Thigpen co-star in this very intense thriller.
