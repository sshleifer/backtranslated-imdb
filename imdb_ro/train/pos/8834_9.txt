A very well-made film in the 1960s of communist Yugoslavia. The five young actors who are adolescents at the heart of the story offer powerful, sincere and emotional deep performances. A clear picture of how natural trust and naivety inherited by adolescents can be easily manipulated and how they have affected the rest of their lives. Highly recommended.
