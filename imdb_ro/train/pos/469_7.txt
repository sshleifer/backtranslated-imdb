The story line was quite interesting, but the characters were fairly flat and sometimes too extreme in their thoughts / behavior. More than necessary. I also think something went wrong in casting. John Turtorro does not really like to play a semi-autism chess player, not to talk about the Italian player. The reasons were not much underlined. <br /> <br />
