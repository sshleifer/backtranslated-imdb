When will people learn that some movies are made for fun and are not necessarily out to change the world? If you understand this, then you expect to have fun while watching Bill's and Ted's fake journey. This is a movie that is a bunch of fun to watch, Keanu and Alex are making a big screen team repeating their characters in Bill's and Ted's "Great Adventure" with much more "style" they had in the first movie. It's not rocket science, but it's great for a laugh, the characters are extremely capable and the story line is so radical that you have to laugh. Do not expect "deep and meaningful" just wait for fun!
