Kazan's first film won an Oscar. Some reviews here come in great detail and length about the film and its symbolism, and it evaluates it a lot. I can almost see where they come from. But I prefer to take a more leaning approach to a long-forgotten movie that seems to have been shot without a budget and quasi-documentary. The plague of pneumonia is lost on the streets of New Orleans, and the (Widmark) and the Douglas detective must hold the principal (Palance). The film is moody, shot in black and white and uses locations very well. Widmark is great as usual. Forget the symbolism (the crime is equal to the disease and the disease is equal to the offense) and enjoy pursuit. It is not always easy to watch a movie like this, now that we are good in this new century, because it is a particular style that was very short (after World War II until the early 1950s) and is unlikely to be interest for the casual film observer. For those who will follow this for the first time, stay close to the great pursued at the end. It's different and sincere I do not know how they shot some of them. I can say that it probably took a long time to finish the film, as the first 90% of the film did.
