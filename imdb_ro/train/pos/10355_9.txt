The fascinating film, based on a true story, about an Australian woman, Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep), accused of killing her daughter. She insists that a dingo took her baby, but the story is very suspicious. The film actually refers to the circulatory media around the case, the way in which Australians interpreted what has been presented in the media and the mentality of flattery that eventually led to the belief of the woman, relying just on hard evidence. I love movies that cast doubt on the media and also movies that hardly look at how people are traveling by the justice system. I always believed that the jurors should be shown 12 frightened men before they were through their duties. It is not, as it has been said many times, a liberal film, but a clinical analysis of how we, as human beings, interpret events based on both our prejudices and the desire for vengeance. A murder in the dark is just as clinical. Schepisi is careful not to make the film melodramatic. Some might find the boring or dry film, but I seemed hired.
