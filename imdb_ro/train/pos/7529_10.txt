It's been two years and especially everyone looks different, some for good and some for worse. I enjoyed myself as much as the original. However, some of their defects, such as the Joker's change, now do not have red lips and looks like black hair and black pupils, is still expressed by Mark Hamill, which is a plus, I think. They have made Poison Ivy more white, suggesting that it becomes more like a plant and Catwomen looks very different and not as "attractive" as it was in the original. Although costumes like Batman, Batgirl, Killer Croc and Scarecrow seemed sorry, especially the scarecrow. The show is not as dark as the original, because Batman does not work as much as he does. Most times he works with Batgirl and the new Robin, Tim Drake. While NightWing (Dick Grayson) comes in many times in rescue. Batman renounced the yellow logo and the black wing on his suit and seems to have received a little bigger but still hitting tons of ass. The show is not as good as the original, especially because of some of the revamped characters, but the stories are just as exciting as ever and the dialogue is still elite. "Above the Edge" could be one of the biggest Batman episodes ever so make sure you check this out. <br /> <br /> Overall 8-9 / 10
