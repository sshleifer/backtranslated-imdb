I remember this movie since I was little, I loved it then and still do that. I managed to record it on DVD for my 18th birthday and I enjoyed the joy because it was so hard to find it in the past and it was only rented when I was younger. My favorite character is Charlie because he learns to be a good dog. The film is full of fun songs and music. The animation is brilliant, and the voices of character are perfect. This movie has always been a tearjerker for me but I think if I did not see the movie when I was young then I would not find it so bright and fascinating like me though I still think I still want because I'm In -play in animated movies.
