I was very impressed with this movie. The writing was fantastic, and the characters were all rich and simple. It is very easy to attach yourself emotionally to everything. The creators of this film have really hit their nails when it comes to creating real-life characters and to attract the aspirant in their own world. In addition, the music is extraordinary. They hired some independent to score, and part of the soundtrack, and they do a fantastic thing adding to the movie. If you have a chance to catch this movie in a small theater or movie festival (as I did), I recommend you to realize. Also on a personal note, Paget Brewster is beautiful in this movie. That's a good reason to check out.
