I saw the first film on a movie channel (HBO?) Some time ago. I was a fan of the Public Enemy, NWA and other rapid raptors, and I saw the CB4 in theaters. Anyway, the promotion for that caught my eye and I wanted to see what it was all about. Well, even on bats I knew it would be good (WARNING!) And I was right. Only the parody songs make this movie always and fast to watch (My Peanuts), but the flow and delivery of the movie were great. You have to love the satire of rap groups (obviously NWA), some kidnappers (Eazy E, Flava Flav, Ice Cube) and the humor of the three NWH members. Who can forget the deaf tune with his scratch? It is very bad that this movie did not get the credit it deserves because it was overshadowed by CB4 during the shows, but in my opinion it is a much better film. If you know and love the 90's gangster rap, you will watch and laugh with this movie for a long time. If you do not like or do not like "rap", you will enjoy jokes to the detriment of the genre.
