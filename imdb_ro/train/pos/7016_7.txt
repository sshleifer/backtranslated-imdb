Although I understand the bad things somebody has to say about this movie, it still seems absolutely amazing. It will touch you, and if you're not a critic, looking deep into the flaws and shortcomings of each movie, or simply not touching anything, it's worth seeing. Do not get into the movie waiting for anything, you only have a box of tissues and an open mind. It's beautiful and the acting is brilliant. I think Will Smith, despite having played yet another single person depressed alone, is amazing. I think a good actor is someone who can really present the feelings and emotions we all have on the best / best experiences so that it touches you and makes you feel something. And that's exactly what this movie does. Give it a shot.
