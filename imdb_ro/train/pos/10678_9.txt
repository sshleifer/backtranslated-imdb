One of the comedies of the '70s. It also has the best signature song of any comedy show. The story is about three people who have a flat over their owners George and Mildred. Comedy is based on the mixture of people who share. A man and two women. Richard O 'Sullivan is besotted with Paula Wilcox. She played in a gentle way and not a boring one, which is why this show was such a success. The scriptures and the stars have always been the best performances and Richard's love life has been demonstrated with a relaxed charm. The final titles contained visual jokes that went unnoticed in the early 1970s, but related to the living arrangements of participants in apartments.
