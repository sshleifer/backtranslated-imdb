Peter Falk is a diverse and accomplished actor. The film is well written and acting seems to be a real life. For all Columbo lovers this is a superior work. Because it shows what a talent Peter Falk is. He does not play a detective, he plays a retired carpet seller. Until credits begin to play, you already want to watch it again. The interesting part of the film is that the message will apply to every person who follows it; the depth of its pertinence will be the only thing that varies. It's a shame that Hollywood Liberals only promote smut and skin, because this is the type of movie people in the business should be proud of. This would be a great movie to turn into a live stage play.
