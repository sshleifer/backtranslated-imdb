That's how I felt while watching this movie. I liked. He was hilarious. But I felt like I was getting a masked look in someone's psyche and then laughing because they turned around to make an interesting point. A friend said so: <br /> <br /> "I feel like I got into someone's house and now I watch their terrible videos from home without knowing." is brighter than fiction film pieces. "Groovin" Gary, the original "Beaver Kid," is a small town guy who returns to a nearby television station in the hope that he will be filmed - and certainly can not, as he had originally expected. hopes of fame and significance, he invites Harris to come and film a real talent tale he has organized in his hometown - with his title "Olivia Newton-Don". <br /> <br / > The director, Trent Harris, is doing a brilliant job with this slowly growing story. Some pictures of a strange child who wants to be someone morphs, over two subsequent reinterpretations, in the story of the freedom of sexual identity suppressed in America. while Sean Penn and Grispin Glover shoot stunning shows, a young Sean Penn is the one more evocative - so closely follows the reality of "the Gary movie," but with strong shades given to push the sense of interaction as Harris wants to go. at the end of naivety with eyes closed, the original Gary is what moved me - in contrast to these possible interpretations of his situation. A movie that does not lose. I have not seen anything like that. Jacob.
