This movie is simple fun. It has nothing to do with America's original Pie, but it's fun to watch. Another try, but better than the Band Band and Mila empty, at least funny. </ br /> <br /> Immediately after the first five minutes I laughed out, so I decided to call my friend and follow him together. I had some beers and we had fun. <br /> <br /> You will not find any deep messages in this movie, but it's worth watching. <br /> <br /> So come back and enjoy yourself.
