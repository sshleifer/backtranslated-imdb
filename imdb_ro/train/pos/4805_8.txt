when I first heard about this movie I thought it would be Duchess (2008), but when I saw the first 30 minutes of The Young Victoria I knew this would not just be a solid movie. Almost everything in this movie is great, the costumes are really amazing and the settings are also beautifully shot. The only thing that really leaves me down is performance. Emily Blunt ("Devil Wears Prada") is the star of the movie, bringing Victoria to life and with this film she shows she is a great actress and she can choose a first Oscar nomination for her show. Rupert's friend is almost as gentle as Prince Albert, but he has great chemistry with Emily Blunt. Paul Bettany is also solid like Lord Melbourne, although I expected more of him. Jim Broadbent and Miranda Richardson both have supporting roles but are forgotten. For me the movie feels unfinished. Perhaps the screenwriter has changed too many things in the script, I do not know, but that's how I feel about the movie. But, overall, it's a great movie about Victoria's early years with an extraordinary performance from Emily Blunt.
