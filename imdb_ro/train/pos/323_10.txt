This is truly an excellent movie with a revolutionary message (both in form and in content) that should not be lost by any fan of French New Wave or Underground. There are no opening or closing skills - we are only placed in the world of consumer art, revolution, and youth. This film has little to do with the documentary and is more interesting to play with our advertising ideas and its relationship to reality. True and not real lines are traversed in ways familiar with documentary films, but this time we do it for consumer and marketing reasons, not to describe the real.
