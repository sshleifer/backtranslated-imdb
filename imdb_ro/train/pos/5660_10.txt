Maybe I saw an episode or 2 when the show was first released, but when I saw an episode on netflix I was also comprised. I watched the whole series in 2 days. :) I really liked Gary Cole's character. First, he is totally condemnable, then he begins to like the character ("These things have a thousand uses")! Andy Griffith, who meets Charles Manson, meets Satan. Beautiful, charismatic, breathtaking, and a kind of dangerous and "kind" I mean "really". I want to be like him when I grow up. Lucas Black is also great. And the accents are wonderful. Anyway, I thought this was one of the best TV shows ever and you realized you were seeing it.
