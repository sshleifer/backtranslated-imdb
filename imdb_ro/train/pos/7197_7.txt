There have been some films about Zorro, some made even in Europe, Alain Delon. This role has also been played by remarkable actors such as Tyrone Power and Anthony Hopkins, but for me the best of all time has always been Reed Hadley. This series gives you the opportunity to see an interesting Western attraction in which you will discover only the true negative character, Don del Oro, at the end of it. The series also has good performances by various actors such as Ed Cobb, ex-Tarzan Jim Pierce, C. Montague Shaw, eternal evildoers such as John Merton and Charles King, and Hadley's very good performance as Zorro. He was quick, intelligent, he used his whip and his sword and his voice was best for any Zorro.
