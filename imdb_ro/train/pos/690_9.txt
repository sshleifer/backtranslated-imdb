I had no idea what this movie was, or I even knew it existed about a month ago when I looked up when I was looking for other movies that looked at Dominic Monaghan. I thought this movie was a strange introspection in the mind of a bedroom and what his mind can go through the hours they spend awake when the rest of the world around them is asleep was an exciting movie and the good part was played by Dom ....... I think that even if this movie can not be bought anywhere (well I've never seen it anywhere now), you have to see if you ever have the chance for it will really make you think to those people around us who can not sleep and have to suffer the night after night that they have not managed to sleep or receive only an hour of sleep every night, so overall it was an interesting film of good substance.
