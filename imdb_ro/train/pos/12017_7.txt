The "Last Hard Men" is a typical Western for the '70s. Most of them seem to be inspired by Sam Peckinpah. Also this, but director Andrew McLaglan is a John Ford student and this can be evident in many scenes. IMO beginning is very good. In a way, McLaglan wanted to show the public the journey from civilization to the wilderness. In the third part there are some illogical flaws and I'm a little crying about Charlton Heston. He has to play an old ex-legist named Sam Burgade, but he's in a fantastic physical form. I never felt she really had trouble getting on a horse or a stone. For me he was not very motivated, as he does in most of his epic films. The same thing happens to beautiful Barbara Hershey playing the sheriff's daughter. Maybe they both had problems with their director or they were dissatisfied with their roles. Hershey and Coburn do not show their best, but they're still good. If the screenwriter had John Wayne in their minds like Sam Burgade? Also, Michael Parks, as a modern sheriff, is little used in his role. On the other hand, James Coburn is in the role of Zach Provo. Coburn is a real villain in this respect. He describes the evil guy between maniac hatred and intelligence. His role and role are the best in the movie. Landscapes and shots are great. The scenes are bloody and the violence seems realistic. Zach Provo and his gang had some violent and violent scenes. What I miss is the typical Western action in the middle of the movie. I would have liked a bank robbery or something. Generally, it's a fun entertainment movie. It's not a great movie, but above the media, because of a great Coburn, a very good start and violent and violent scenes.
