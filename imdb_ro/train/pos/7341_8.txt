I like Ralph Bakshi's films ("Wizards", "Cool World" and the animated "Lord of the Rings") and I'm a collector and fan of Frank Frazetta. I'm also a sword and a sorceress witch who loves Edgar Rice Burroughs and Robert E. Howard. I lost the theatrical release "Fire and Ice" in 1983 and I have been looking forward to seeing her video or a certain revival since then. Therefore, the 2005 release was a dream come true for me. However, I bought him with some fear, because I hoped he did not deserve to be seen once and then put on the shelf as a "collectable" dust gathered until the day I died. Fortunately my fears were groundless and I was pleasantly impressed by this film. As in the case of Frazetta, this is a stormy film that has hard physical and sexuality found in most fantasy / sword and magic movies without being greedy or dirty. Art is good and you see the phrase from Frazetta at the best. Even my young boys liked to go with me and watch them again and again. However, my wife has some objections due to the expensive princess dressed (very Frazetta-esquire). I do not mind because it is credible and there is no sexual scene. There is roto-scoping used, but I personally enjoy roto-scoping. Provides more fluid and more realistic moves for hard-to-find characters in animation. Despite some issues of continuity, I recommend this film to all Bakshi, Frazetta, Conan fans and sword and witchcraft. Enjoy!
