Okay, let's make it clear. I'm really not in science fiction, but for some reason I love Stargate SG-1. <br /> <br /> Jack O'Neil takes his SG-1 team through a star gate. A round device that creates a wormhole. It gives you the opportunity to travel in distant worlds. It might sound like the usual science fiction series, but it is not! Plot is established today, not in a distant millennium, like many other sci-fi series. I find it wonderful. It offers things, happenings and other things you can relate to and you can jump in the series at any time, without having to learn many new terms and names of all gadgets. They, of course, but thanks to O'Neil who likes to keep a simple terminology, there are not many. <br /> <br /> The series has a pleasant combination of action, humor and drama. If you enjoy many special effects, you will not find it here. They do not use much harm, but a limited amount of well-done special effects.
