Wow! I liked this movie and LOVE Judy Marte! This girl is not only a wonderful beautiful face, she is funny and very talented! It made me laugh many times only being very tough with Victor, who had desperately hit her! We will see it a lot in the next few years ... and perhaps also by director Peter Sollett and co-star Victor Rasuk! Victor Vargas's lifting is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time! Very refreshing! It's true, beautiful, funny, well-filmed, it got everything: good story, good actors, good film directions! If you like urban shots, Kevin Smith's Girl, you'll love Victor Vargas! Is better!
