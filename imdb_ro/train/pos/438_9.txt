From rainy England, bad winter late 1920s ... where there are still sadness and many young widows and veterinarians with disabilities from the big men's massacre and the murderer of their women's dreams - - now known as World War I ... <br / > <br /> Four women share this wonderful little Italian Italian castle on a hill; a young widow who drowns her pain in frenetic parties, two women who will rediscover their husbands and a fourth woman who is tired of her famous friends ... ... These four women will come along with two spouses and a former soldier - blind - to get a spiritual "makeover" for a great holiday in April in the early 1920s, Italy. Study this movie for how mood and beauty can tell a story. (Probably not a movie that would please many men ...) NOTE: Store on coffee and hot chocolate and invite the girls over a few days of late winter ... Spring comes ... Enchanted April promises you!
