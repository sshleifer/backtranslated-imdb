I grew up in South West Virginia; I'm at the same age as Homer Hickam, the author of "The Rocket Boys" (or maybe an older year), the book that made up the true story of this heart-warming film. So I am closely related to the coal mining of West Virginia and the amazing effect that Sputnik had at that time (October 4, 1957) on everyone. Rocket Boys continued to make a living for themselves. I continued to earn my degrees in Physics and Computer Engineering. All because Sputnik awakened many young people to the "Science Gap" that the US had in the US. in those days of the Cold War ... This is a wonderful movie for everyone, of all ages. But if you grew up in West Virginia in the late 1950s, it will reach the core of your being. Everybody: Take it; look; recommend it to your friends ... who thank you many times.
