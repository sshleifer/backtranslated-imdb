This movie changed everything for me ... I heard of breakdancing and hiphop, but I never saw it professionally (hey, I was an 11 year old kid in the Netherlands!) When I saw this movie everything changed . I was actively involved in the hippopotamus movement in our city, I started to say and write lyrics. Up to now, I think this movie is a personal favorite. Sure, the importance of filming and "cinema" may not be so significant. But who cares if the movie was filmed badly or if you could see a little that hangs over someone? It's what you do personally for you that matters ...
