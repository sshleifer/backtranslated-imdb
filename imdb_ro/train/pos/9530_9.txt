Conrad Hall came out with a bang. The great photographer finished his illustrious career with this film before passing. He has become proud because this is one of the best crime movies you will ever see. Of course, the act is not bad when you have Tom Hanks and Paul Newman playing the lead! The value of the action here is quite correct: not much; not too little. None of the characters here, honestly, are "good boys," because Hanks is a professional man who hit the city for Newman's boss. Hanks's only way of redemption does not want his son to finish a killer like him, even though he teaches him how to run into robbery! How good the actor is and is just as exciting as the story, the true star of this movie is the Hall cinema, who is painting the scene after a beautiful scene with his lenses. His work is just great.
