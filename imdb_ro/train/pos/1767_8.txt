Steve Carell made a career of portraying the little guy just first at The Daily Show and then in supporting roles. In Virgin, Carell has found a clever and hilarious script that makes perfect use of his strengths. Carell plays Andy Stitzer, a middle-aged man who lives a quiet, lonely life. Andy is a little weird, but in a strange way. One night, while socializing with his colleagues for the first time, Andy reveals accidentally that he is a virgin. His collaborators, David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco) and Cal (Seth Rogen) tease Andy initially about his situation. But it is clear that all three have some respect for Andy's decent human being and they decide to help him, helping him to finish his virginity. And so begins Andy's search for maturity. Andy is the innocent quintessence, and most of the humor derives from his naivety in situations where he is throughout the film. Some of humor is raw stuff, but most of it is just a smart comedy. In addition, we found some parts of the film quite exciting because Andy is developing both romantic and friendship, perhaps for the first time in his life. I'm not trying to describe the movie as a love story or a drama; is a run in the comedy of places. However, every good comedy I've seen has a heart to take care of the characters. A good comparison would be "The Nesting Crashers" earlier this summer. Virgin has a similar humor, but it's maybe a bit more vulgar in some jokes. I especially liked the end of the movie, which I thought was a perfect way to end the blow. Without giving anything, she reminded me of "Something about Mary." Very light and fun; let you laugh and smile, just how you should feel when you finish a comedy. I would recommend a lot.
