I never heard of Robert Roy MacGregor before "Rob Roy," but the movie is worth seeing. By playing the title character, Liam Neeson brings the same spirit to the role he has brought to Oskar Schindler, and Jessica Lange does a great job as Mary's wife. Archibald Cunningham (Tim Roth) is a person most likely to bother your skin. Generally, this is as good as "Braveheart" (maybe even better). I laugh when I think about how Hollywood released two films almost backwards, taking a shot at England. Very good. Also starring John Hurt, Eric Stoltz, Brian Cox and Jason Flemyng.
