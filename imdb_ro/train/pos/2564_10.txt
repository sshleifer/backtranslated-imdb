Personally, I think Sayonara was the biggest movie he ever did. He touched every emotion from anger to romance, to tragedy. Brando should have won for the best actor. Anyway, the movie is great, the man is appealing to MALE and MALE and now you have no reason not to see it! Do it, and fall in love.
