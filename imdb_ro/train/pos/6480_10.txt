This was the best war document ever made. Since the beginning of the first episode, Sir Laurence Olivier described the terrible events in Oradour-Sur-Glane "The Day Soldiers came". In the last days of the war, when mushroom nights appeared over Japan, we did not miss a second of this classic series and I remember well even though it was seen in 1974. Every aspect of this tragedy was covered in detail. This whole series should be a compulsory vision for as many of the world's children as possible so that the tragedy of the Second World War is not repeated and that bigotry, hatred, greed and intolerance are not confused with patriotism or religious zeal.
