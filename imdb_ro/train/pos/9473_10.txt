I was lucky enough to see this at a pre-screening last night (Oct. 20) and I was incredibly surprised by the wonderful plot and truly heart-felt acting. While the plot is not particularly complicated or exceptionally, the story unfolds in a way that feels fresh, unique and distinct "indy" in style. It is not something that can easily be compared to the films of the past, it is a unique approach to a kind of classic middle-aged love story. <br /> <br /> I was particularly hit by the pouring of the film. Up to every last extra in the family, it was a beautiful and talented cast. The three daughters did a wonderful job, the talent was evenly divided, and none of them "brightened" the other two. It was truly a delightful movie, suitable for all ages, and laughs amusingly funny, yet appealing and exciting. It was a wonderful break from sexual jokes and the nudity of recent movies.
