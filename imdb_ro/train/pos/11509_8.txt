It is a real shame that this television series, inspired by the superior images made for television "The Night Stalker" and "The Night Strangler", lasted only one season and twenty episodes, because in the best way (combinations Carl Kolchak's verbal spirituality with Tony Vincenzo's editor, perpetually irritable and long-suffering, have always been a livelihood to watch and hear), intelligent writing, supernatural threats (I must love the original and original creators of "Murders of Spanish Moss "," The Sentry "and" Horror in Heights, "plus you can not be deceived by your favorite fans, such as zombies, vampires, werewolves and witches), colorful characters that act lively from a bunch of celebrities cool (the legendary biker icon William Smith had a rare chance to tackle a heroic lead in "The Eater Eater", while other episodes featured great actors veteran rappers such as Keenan Wynn, John Fiedler, John Dehner, Severn Darden and William Daniels in succinct roles), effective moments of genuine suspense (the culmination of the "The Murders of Spanish Moss" channel, in particular, was really disturbing) one and the only Darren McGavin is in a dazzling form, as loud, aggressive and exciting, but truly decent, brave and honest little, Chicago, Illinois reporter Carl Kolchak. Kolchak was the protagonist of everybody with a strong nose for a tasty piece and a miserable miserable to get into all sorts of trouble. Moreover, Kolchak, occasionally, was anything but superhuman; usually either hindered or fallen while escaping from a deadly threat, but possessed a certain inner strength and courage that allowed them to save the world from time and time from all sorts of lethal enemies in other worlds . Kolchak was surrounded by plenty of pleasant side characters: Simon Oakland was perfect as Carl's chronicler, Tony Vincenzo, Jack Grinnage, in the role of Ron Updyke, made for an ideal comic strip, Ruth McDevitt was pure and simply delightful as Miss Emily Cowles, and Carol Ann Susi was also very fun as Monique Marmelstein, who started to return after appearing in just three episodes. Granted, the show suffered due to makeup without makeup and special effects (lycantrope titular in "The Woolwolf", unfortunately resembles a Yorkshire terrier!), And the last two episodes praised some stupid monsters (the headless biker in "Chopper" Lee Crosby as Helen of Troy in "The Killer of Youth"), but even second-rate shows are redeemed by McGavin's program mark and McGavin's sophisticated virtuosity and McGavin's impressive presence.
