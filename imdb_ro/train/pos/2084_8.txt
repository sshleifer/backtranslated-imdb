My main problem with the movie is that it takes too long. Something else is pretty good. Paul Muni plays a Chinese Chinese farmer who is about to marry a married couple. Luise Rainer is a maid who marries Muni. I live with Muni's father on a farm and they do badly. When, finally, he gets some money to buy more land, a drought hits and nothing grows. All those who head north to Muni remain behind at the beginning. When they leave and get to town, they realize there are no jobs and worse than before. She even thinks to sell her youngest daughter as a slave for some money, but to decide against her. When a bunch of people start robbing the city, the soldiers show up and start executing people. Paul Muni is doing a good job, and Luise Rainer has won a second Oscar for this film.
