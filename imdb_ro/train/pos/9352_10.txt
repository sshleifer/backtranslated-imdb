Most people, especially young people, may not understand this movie. It looks like a story of loss, when it's actually a story about being alone. Some people may never feel loneliness at this level. Cheadles Johnson's character mirrored the total opposite of Sanders, Fineman. If Johnson felt blessed, Fineman was trying to forget his life in the same perspective. Jada is a great addition to the distribution, and Sandler draws tears. Cheadle had the role of comic and was a great supporter for Sandler. I see Oscar somewhere here. A very beautiful movie. If you've ever lost and felt alone, this movie will make sure you're not alone. Jerry
