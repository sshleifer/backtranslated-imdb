After seeing only two of his previous photos, I got along with Altman. Before, however, I always called his "boring" shooting style. You just have to be in the right mind to appreciate your crazy genius. "HealtH" is quite underestimated and obviously printing. Actually, I do not think it was ever issued to the VHS. Why is this? When all these movies become daily, the DVD is left behind without good reason? Frankly, I had no real problems with this movie. It was, for the most part, constantly amusing and funny. Almost all scenes are mysteriously interesting for a specific reason, regardless of the wonderful dialogue or subtle performances. There is a real ability here. And Paul Dooley's downstairs half is fascinating. If you can, try to find a copy of this small forgotten gem. It's not perfect, but it's much better than most of the sludge there getting DVDs. Hell, I'd be happy with a beautiful VHS copy of this. Most of the time it's in the Fox Movie Channel, so look at it.
