This film is an amazing piece that will convince even the most skeptical spectator that Gerard Depardieu is one of the best film actors of the last 50 years. Its performance shocks, amusements, disgust and glamor leave you breathless. This film was shot in the early days of his film career and is gross, but he is still able to convey the skill of Depardieu. You have to see any of Depardieu's fans and by far the best early work.
