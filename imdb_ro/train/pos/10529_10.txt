In any case, my favorite novel, Austen, and Paltrow is by no means my favorite actress, but I found the film almost uncomfortable. Paltrow does a good job, and Cummings, Stevenson and the one who plays "Miss Bates" are absolutely wonderful. Details of the period are not alienated; the sense of the film is, in fact, right. But the real "discovery" is Jeremy Northam as Mr. Knightley. It could not be more perfect casting, IMO. I hated K in the novel, but I found him wonderful human and human in the movie. Northam's good looks and smiling eyes are no obstacle to pleasure! Highly recommended. Anar
