I know I like this movie and do it for the most part, but, as others have said, it is a bit long in the tooth. We also found that aggressive male crewmembers are a little annoying. It's a wonder they did not start stuttering and screaming at the moon. I also have to say that the movie generally leaves me cold. It is a very sterile atmosphere that penetrates the film. In addition, the effects are extraordinary (besides the cartoon monster), just like the effects, props, costumes and, of course, Robbie. If the robot was not in this movie, I do not think it would have been as popular as it would be. The second half of the movie begins investigating the forgotten gadgets of "Krell". Every time I see this movie, Krell lets me scratch my head about exactly who or what they were. Based on what was being done at that time, besides "This Island of the Earth," the Forbidden Planet is less than one kilometer above Sci-Fi medieval films of the time. Being filmed in color also adds to his joy. Of course, a classic in itself, defective and all, and deserving.
