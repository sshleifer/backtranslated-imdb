This beautiful story of a bigger son returning home, learning to love and being part of all the things he has left home to move away, is disturbing and moving. This shows a society that is perhaps strange to us in the Western world with a family feeling we've lost. The story is beautiful, sad and sometimes funny and funny. He has a sense of realism that we no longer see in our western films. The actor is unusual, while the film progresses, almost giving the impression that it is not a documentary of ordinary people. This is brilliant direction and film making. <br /> <br /> I like to watch more of this director's films.
