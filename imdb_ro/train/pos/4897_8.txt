Does this film attract you from the beginning, because it attracts our attention, recognizing that this story opens with a cliché? a funeral. In other hands than Judy, I would not have given it in 8 because this material was done again and again: Great reunion reunion, army platoon, theater group, singers, band. But this film never stops at a cheap sentiment, and when you think it will change in another direction. A case in this regard is the flowers sent by an admirer to Judi. The members of the band are an interesting group and walk over the clichés. One is in prison, one found the religion, one is an alchemist and one immersed in dementia. But the joy of rediscovery by Judi, ignited by her grandmother's interest, leads us and makes us overlook the sometimes simplistic nature of the plot. The cast is a talented Leslie Caron, the incomparable jazzist Cleo Laine with his remarkable notes, a last performance by Joan Sims, brava Joan, a cute like a Ian Holm flyer with a ball, and Olympia Dukakis as a divorce of money living in the areas Scottish highs with her ghillie and her whiskey, Closing scene is the standard Hollywoodland fare, the judges of the star converted to supporters lovers of fun, the old lovers have gathered, the youngsters have swept the music of the old timers. Life should be so simple. But I would look again, and I intend to, with my niece. Because in the right hands, sometimes somebody loves these old clichés. 8 out of 10.
