A meteorite falls in the land of a small town, bringing a jellyfish creature. An old farmer is attacked by a stranger in his hand, and young Steve Andrews (Steve McQueen) and Jane Martin's girlfriend (Aneta Corsaut) take him to Dr. T. Hallen (Steven Chase). The local doctor carefully treats the blister and asks Steve to investigate the location where the old man was found. When Steve returns, he sees the blob kill the doctor. Steve and Jane are trying to alert police and residents, but nobody believes in them, while the grain swallows many bigger and bigger people. "The Blob" is a cult and a classic SF. It's a low-budget movie with many actors and actresses of bacon (except Steve McQueen), terrible but also delightful and very, but very funny effects. This is the first time I see this classic (I saw the remake of 1988 with Kevin Dillon), and I really recommend it to Steve McQueen's fans and B-sci-fi movies of the 1950s. The movie that is part of my review number 1400 could not be better. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Bolha" ("The Blob")
