Very few so-called "remakes" can be as good as the originals. It crosses the boundary with flying colors. Just a remake, I do not think so! I saw her theatrical at the age of nine and I was excited and excited about the film. <br /> <br /> The film certainly invites to a comparison with his counterpart in 1963. The previous film is also a pleasant and funny film, but of course tends to feel more like a documentary of nature than a movie. This update is more epic and cinematic. However, I strongly recommend both films. This movie is certainly a must-see for an animal lover. We have the wise Golden Retriever, Shadow; the sharp, sarcastic Himalayan cat, Sassy; and the young, funny lover, American bulldog, Chance. The animals are brilliantly expressed by Don Ameche, Sally Field and Michael J. Fox, respectively. There is practically nothing offensive in the movie. There is a little scathic humor, but nothing extreme. No violent violence, except for some tense scenes involving a hitting waterfall, an angry porcupine and a dark rail. Scary, frightening, moving and, above all, true, I was surprised to see that the movie did not win any prizes. However, I will have to say that it is as good as the nominees of the best film.
