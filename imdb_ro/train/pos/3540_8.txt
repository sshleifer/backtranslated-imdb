I bought this game from a pulse bought from Walmart. I'm glad we did. It was really fun to listen to Sean Connery and play the game. I thought the graphics were the best I've ever seen in a movie / game remake. Bonus levels were very tough! The sniper I considered too hard, made me so frustrated I did not play for one and a half weeks. There were too many people shot at you without hiding behind them or dragging your life. <br /> <br /> The only thing I could change was the upgrade system. We have not noticed any difference from non-upgraded equipment to upgrading, such as buying an armor upgrade did not seem to make the armor stronger or more filling on my life counter. I really liked the Q copter. I think the developers did a good job.
