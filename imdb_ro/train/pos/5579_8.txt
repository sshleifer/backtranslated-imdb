I've never heard of this movie until I accidentally encountered it when I sailed IMDB. I have seen that they have received many awesome reviews containing very colorful excursions on how much they have been disturbed. Of course, that meant I had to see it. I was pleasantly surprised that Whipped is actually a good movie. I followed her with a group of friends and I laughed more than I had with many recent recued Hollywood dick comedies. This is an independent film and as such describes her subject (sex and encounters) without the Hollywood fiction. I clearly suspect that people's views on this film will very much depend on their experience in life. If you have never played or played a lot, you will not get this movie because you have not met people like those characters. If you have, you will recognize many of the situations presented here in comedy. The end was also good because it did not represent women as unreal, helpless, virginal romance, as opposed to many Hollywood movies.
