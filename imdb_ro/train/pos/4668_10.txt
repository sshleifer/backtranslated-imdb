This movie is now on digital television at least once a month, I have seen it a dozen or more times and never cease to delight me. If it were tomorrow, I would have followed them again. This is the art that Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, two magicians of the actors profession can create, greatly helped by the superb support trio of Karl Malden, Bob Newhart and Robert Morley. Let's not forget others in minor roles. It is a simple story, simply said, about an ex-con, a murderer, fighting and succeeding with "new age technology", that is, computers, and finding affection in this process. Even if it is a tad (tongue in the cheek) unlikely, even unbelievable, the characters are not. There is no violence, no sex, no bad language, and especially no gross method that is so widespread today. A real lesson for modern movie makers about how to make a great show in and with almost nothing ... except remarkable talent.
