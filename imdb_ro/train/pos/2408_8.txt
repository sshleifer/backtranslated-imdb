Anyone who saw Mel Gibson's Pascal of Christ and was disturbed by gorilla violence would like to see this movie. Although it was not a success in the box office or TV rankings, The Fox Movie Channel finds another good reason to show it annually. I liked the way they coached Chris Sarandon and the men who portrayed his disciples to sing in Hebrew. Although Sarandon does not have long hair like any other that Jesus would have done in other films, its appearance is close to what a Jewish man would appear. What surprised me or scared me was the scene where Caiaphas told Jesus about Pilate "And never forget that you are a Jew!" Though this was not a racist remark, Colin Blakely was trying to make Chris Sarandon look like garbage in the eyes of the prominent people of those days. Keith Michell's Pilate's expression was terrifying, compared to his previous performance in "The Story of Jacob and Joseph" and "The Story of David." But if you compare the portrait of Pilate with Telly Savala or Hurd Hatfield, you can say he really painted the impression of a Roman prosecutor.
