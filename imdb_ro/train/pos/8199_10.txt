After the official Dirty Harry trilogy with The Enforcer (1976) was considered the final chapter of the series. Dirty Harry returns, older, more dirty and dirty than ever since the original 1971 classic. Dirty Harry has murdered a psychopath killer, veteran cops and veteran terrorists in Vietnam in the past. But now he is, after a new murderer, a killer who wants revenge by shooting his attackers. <br /> <br /> Sudden Impact brings a new sense and darker tone to Dirty Harry. Callahan is on a new crime scene that is circling back to a woman (played by Sondra Locke) who was brutally raped along with her sister who is left traumitized. Ten years later, she left to get revenge, throwing her attackers. At the same time, Callahan is in a heat of trouble by his superiors after provoking a mob mob in the face of a heart attack, which the monkey hunts. So, to let the heat fall into the city, Harry is ready to take a vacation in a seaside town, but at the same time the raped victim is also in town while hunting down his attackers one by one. Harry is in the investigation and finds very similar murders as he lives in the murderer's footsteps. The sudden impact, in my opinion, must be one of my first 10th revenge films, and the second Dirty Harry's best movie, much better than The Enforcer and The Pool together. Sudden Impact of what Harry had originally dirty, a dark tone with a value of entertainment. <br /> <br /> So, do you feel lucky, punk?
