This show has been my escape from reality over the last ten years. Unfortunately, I miss her. Although Atlantis has filled the hole a little. The last episode of SG1 (on TV, anyway) was beautifully done. Robert wrote something that was close to reality. Like he wanted to explain how he was on stage. (All those who have been working closely together for so long are forced to stand up and down, but over the years they have turned into a family). I thought it was a great way to end despite the criticisms of others. The SG1 was something special, and from time to time it passed me over the thresholds of mistrust and astonishment. Wonderful characters, stories, directors, writers. From episode one, I was engaged. The mix of action, science, drama and especially comedy went so well that it made me want more. There are no real words in which to express completely what this show meant to me. I can only thank those who have kept the show so fresh and fun for so many years. I inspired myself to do many things that I thought would be impossible. I look forward to the movies next year and I really hope there will be a number of them. I do not want the show to die. Stargate SG1 - 1997 - 2007?
