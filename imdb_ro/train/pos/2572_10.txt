I thought it was a very funny movie. I love dog movies and comedy movies so combined that they were twice as good. K-9, k-911 and k-9 PI are my favorite movies. Jim Belushi is hysterical and Jerry Lee is hilarious and adorable making a wonderful team. The only downside is that I did not really understand how Dooley's wife died. He died before this movie, but how? If they said they must have missed it. Besides, I give him two fingers / sews up! Those dogs (Jerry Lee and Zeus) must have had a lot of training. They were so funny, and all the noise Jerry would have done when Dooley was talking to him were so funny. my favorite was when Jerry Lee sang and biting peoples' peoples to get very funny information
