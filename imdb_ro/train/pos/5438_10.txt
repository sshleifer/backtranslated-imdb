An adventure director directed by George Stevens (before returning to a more serious fare, such as REMEMBER MAMA in 1948 and GIANT in 1956), who set the standard for all future action lines to follow. Relying freely on Rudyard Kipling's poem, GUNGA DIN follows the journey of three military officers to India in the nineteenth century. The noble trio must dare a series of battles and other various dangers, including a robbery cult and a temple full of gold. Their screen adventures remain thrilling even after more than six decades and have inspired almost all of the work from the cliffanger inspired STAR WARS (1977) and RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARC (1981). The biggest reason for the success of the image is the perfect performance of the trio of highly charismatic actors. Victor McLaglen seldom was better than the rough guy, Cary Grant is the last comic strip, and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr, is just as suicidal as a hell, imaginable hero - maybe even more than rival Errol Flynn. The chemistry of the three actors simply could not be improved and such warmth and credibility is precisely what is lacking in the most modern pictures of action - and they receive extraordinary support from the wonderful Sam Jaffe, who overcomes the obvious physical mischief makes the title the character of a lighthouse of human sweetness and tranquil power. A big hit in his day (the film was the second largest producer of money since 1939 behind the successful GONE WITH THE WIND scandal), and is probably the best film of its kind.
