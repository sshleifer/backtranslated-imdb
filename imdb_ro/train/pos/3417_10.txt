Before seeing this, I was stripped of the subject, but this is not your average triumph over the story of adversity. Though this is technical about the blind Tibetan blind climbing Mt. Everest, there's a lot more to it. This film portrays the very strong, often contradictory personalities of two spirited blind adults who led the children, Erik and Sabriye. Erik is a blind American mountain climber / athlete and Sabriye is a German blind academician who started a school in Lhasa Tibet. They are so exceptional in their own ways, but they disagree on what will really build trust in children. Erik wants them to reach the summit, while Sabriye wants them to enjoy Erik as a model model and to enjoy at the time. The tints are complicated and somebody moves away without being sure who was right or if all the climb was a great mistake or a great idea. The deepest scenes are with the Tibetan children themselves and the difficulties they faced before finding their way to school. The most exciting for me was the story of Tashi, a frail teenager who grew up on the streets after his parents abandoned him. I was able to watch a whole movie about his life and I was happy to learn that because of his school he now leads a small successful business with some of his colleagues. If you liked Spellbound or Murderball, you'd love that.
