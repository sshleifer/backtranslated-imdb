Full disclosure: I'm a cynic. I like my finishing touches and my hands are drying up. I did not cry when Bambi's mother was shot. Will Smith, the new film Happiness, seems to be a desperate motive for an Oscar. Basically, I was born without an artistic soul. <br /> <br /> Why on earth did I enjoy "10 items or less?" Maybe it was the double espresso we had descended before the show. Or (more likely) maybe even the hottest of the film fans could use an occasional jam shot. <br /> <br /> And sweet is it. From the moment that "He" meets Scarlet (an event far from a Nora Ephron "meets cute"), the vision is taken in an intimate journey with two strangers who learn to care for where their lives are going. (He was beautifully helped by Phedon Papamichael's work in cinema cinema.) The main argument for the film is that it's too far away. Is the movie much longer? I do not know. You tell me. I've met Adrian Brody on the market. (However, not for lack of test). Do I like to think about the adventures that may occur if this important event takes place? Darn right. . .This is where most reviews of "10 items or less" fall short. . . I do not take into consideration the fact that we, cynics, have fantasies. And sometimes it's worth the admission fee to live them vicar, 82 minutes at a time.
