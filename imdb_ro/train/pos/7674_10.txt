I had the privilege of watching Holly at the Edinburgh Film Festival last week. What a strong and moving story! Holly is a 12-year-old Vietnamese girl who is sold in prostitution by her own family and lives in a brothel in Cambodia. Patrick (American) enters Holly's life and decides he wants to help her. When Holly is sold again, Patrick is desperately looking for her. We're going through a difficult journey through Cambodia, and we hope they will reunite. Holly is one of the millions of children who are sold and trafficked every day. The film presents this difficult problem without crossing the line. I left, I wanted to find out more about child trafficking and wondering how I can help? This movie should be seen by everyone because it is a beautiful story and poses a problem that we no longer have to ignore.
