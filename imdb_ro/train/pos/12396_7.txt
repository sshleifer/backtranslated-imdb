This is the second part of The Animatrix, a collection of animated short films that tell us more about the Matrix world. In this case, we learn how people and cars can not work and live together. It is a small lesson of history in the world of the "Matrix". It's not as good as the first part ("Osiris final flight"), but still quite fun.
