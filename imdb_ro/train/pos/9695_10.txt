Some people might call "Paulie" a movie for children, but I want to say that is more than that. Perhaps more than anything else, this film is going successfully long distances to show the situation of immigrants in the United States - current in the light of recent debates. Presenting a parrot telling a Russian immigrant portrayer (Tony Shalhoub) about how America searched for its owners, the film tells a few stories. There is an elderly woman (Gena Rowlands) with whom she is friends, then a Mexican immigrant (Cheech Marin) and others. Everything is a very well done movie. Usually I do not expect many of these movies, but this is a treatment. I certainly recommend it. He also plays with Jay Mohr, Buddy Hackett, Bruce Davison, Hallie Eisenberg and Trini Alvarado.
