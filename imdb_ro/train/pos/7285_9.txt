This movie was scared by me when I was just a kid. He is not "Citizen Kane," but he has his moments. The fracture of the arms is good. The plot is good, even if the characters are not - it could have something to do with acting. Put some top names in roles and then see what you get. He was one of those who shoot, edit (as little as it did) and distribute movie types in a few months. This is a classic, low budget movie that deserves to be paid. I rated 9 other films of that kind and age.
