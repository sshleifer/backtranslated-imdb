"Be careful what you say to your servants" is a revealing comment. The head of the largest oil company in the country is called the new president, backed by the US, and these young Irish film makers have everything in their hands. A wonderful film of educating young people about democracy. We see transparent documentation on how to handle the mass media and the force used, in the interest of big business, against the interests of the democratic desires of the people. Ribbons.
