The first two sequences of this film set up the two conflicts: the thematic conflict between soldier Todd and his suppressed humanity, and the physical conflict between Todd and his biological substitute. Both sequences collapse in different ways. People's scenario fades somewhat by solving the first of these midway arches through the film, which means the second half is a bit more than a direct action action. <br /> <br /> However, kudos for decision-makers to create a genre piece with heart and even a bit of soul and especially to Kurt Russell who transmits many with very little. <br /> <br /> Not great movie, but worth seeing.
