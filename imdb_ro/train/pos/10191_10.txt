What is contained on this disc is a first-rate show by a first rate band. This disc is NOT for the weak of the heart ... the music is incredibly intense and very enjoyable. What you will learn when watching this movie is why Who has been so great for so long. It is true that their recordings were wonderful, but their performances were the top of the pile. In 1969, when the concert was shot, the teenage bobs who were screaming with beads at the Beatles disappeared, and bands (and audiences) settled down to lengths and often amazing performances of musical virtuosity - something that few audiences had intellectual curiosity watched in the era of music preserved by Britney and Christina. What you learn especially here is the amazing things that can happen when talented musicians are encouraged to improvise. Try the concert, it's really amazing.
