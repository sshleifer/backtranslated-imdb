Progressive, hilarious, tragic, sad, inevitable. A group of descendants joins a "spiced" crook to get out of their poverty. Great idea ... if you ignore the screwing factor. Beautiful to see George Clooney does something really funny for a change. Casting is perfect, and action standards are very high. Although it can be said that the subject of the crew is not new, I think this film occupies it in an interesting and unique way. Enough to distinguish from what happened before. Very good boys.
