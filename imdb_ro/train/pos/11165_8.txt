Four words explain why this movie was made - "She made her wrong." The huge commercial success of that vehicle, Mae West, convinced the brass studio that the gay melodies of the 1990s were a viable proposition. Here we are rewarded with a quick, well-written story that fully targets the stars of his stars. Wallace Beery and George Raft are excellent as friendly rivals; Jackie Cooper is a bit harder to take, but Fay Wray is the one who steals the film with his ladies in commerce. With a powerful director - as Walsh turns out - Wray could carry a lot of punch and is completely credible as the object of the Raft and Beery affection. A lot of atmosphere, beautifully designed, this is a forgotten film of revival.
