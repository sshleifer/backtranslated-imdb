I've seen this on TV a long time ago that I do not remember when it was, but it's still one of the most scariest and most unpleasant movies I've ever seen. There is a subtle but intense horror, induced by the black woman hiding on the edge of the frame, not very visible, so you feel (like the applicant's hero) sure it's not just the imagination or not. It's also one of the few movies that made me afraid to watch. "Production Values" must be hung, good films are about a director's ability to create atmosphere using film, actors, locations / sets, music, attention to detail and imagination. A real jewel.
