The unborn is a Roger Corman production and as such is ugly and tasteless. If you hate pregnant women, check this movie because it is full of preggies and miscarriages. Brooke Adams is Virginia. She and her husband square go to a fancy fertility clinic because they can not have children alone. There they meet with Dr. Meyerling (James Karen from ROTLD 1 & 2). Dr. Meyerling had a very high success rate in getting pregnant couples. (Enter joke here.) Is it because he's creating some genetic survivors? This is what Virginia begins to think when it begins to have strange side effects and extreme mood from the treatment. Then she starts to take things in her own hands. On this, you'll have to get the rest of the details elsewhere, because if I told you all the good you could hurt, you put it on the Netflix rental queue too fast. It's a bit slow, but once it's in the last third, all the systems go! Highly recommended by me on the strengths of non-PC fetal violence. 33 1/2 of the seventeen stars.
