Being a true product of the hip-hop generation and electronic dance music, this is undoubtedly one of my favorite movies of all time. Beat Street, though not "authentic" in some respects like "Wild Style," is a movie that is guaranteed to draw the hearts of anyone who boasts the culture of urban music / DJ and electro-club culture. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> . The b-boy battle scene at Roxy nightclub (a real-time competition between legendary Rock Steady Crew and NYC Breakers) is just as essential to the archives of a hip-hop fan as any classic album. Look at some of the movements of breakers in slow-motion if it is possible to really appreciate the athletic and stylistic expertise of a B-boy / B-spicy girl. All the praises of the Zulu nation!
