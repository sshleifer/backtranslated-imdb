Zentropa has much in common with The Third Man, another film similar to the noir, which was seated in the post-war Europe. Like the TTM, there is much work invented by the camera. There is an innocent American who engages emotionally with a woman she does not really understand, and whose naivety is even more striking in contrast to the natives. But I should say that the Third Man has a better story. Zentropa is a little disintegrated in this regard. Perhaps this is intentional: it is presented as a dream / nightmare and making it too coherent would hurt the effect. <br /> <br /> This film is incessantly thin - noir in more than one sense; never seen the sun shining. Grim, but intriguing and frightening.
