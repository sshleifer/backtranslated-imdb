I have seen this wonderful production and I wonder if anyone can tell me anything about the actress who played the blacksmith's wife - I'm not sure of her character's name. I went to BYU with her and lost contact with her - her girlfriend was Kim Luke - and I wonder if anyone has any information about her. Not included in credits. This production was remarkable, a tear in all accounts, superb action by all. I do not even want to put it in the general category of "acting", rather "portraying with the sensation of the amazing events that led to the opening of the heavens for this final dispensation" ..... something like that. If someone has worked with Kim or has a website or something, please let me know! She was fantastic in her role, by the way ... Thank you, Melissa Thorne
