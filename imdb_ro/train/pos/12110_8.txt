For those who think the anime is just about the huge reptiles that kill the pupils, think again. There is a totally different side to the Japanese animation. Yakitori! Japan is one of these shows. It's a cute little story of a little boy with the gift of making delicious bread. His universe is based on the creation of a Japanese bread that matches the famous European bread. The show is as strange as they are and I'm sure non-Japanese spectators will miss many jokes. But it is still very nice to look at the full vibration of the show. <br /> <br /> In Yakita world! it is not unusual for people to resemble an orgasm after they have eaten bread. Bread is hallucinating and can give the consumer a wide range of super powers, from time travel to swimming as a fish. This strange look turns him into one of the less predictable and fun shows we've watched in a while.
