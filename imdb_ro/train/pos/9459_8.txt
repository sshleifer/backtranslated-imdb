I look at romantic comedies with some hesitation, for the romantic comedies that contain the old cliques that make an uninteresting film. Typically, in a romantic comedy, there is a girl and there is a guy, both in love, then you have trouble and then you get married or anything else. But this movie is a different story, it's really very different from the romantic comedies we've seen lately. <br /> <br /> There is a widow (Dan), a girl (Marie). Dan meets Marie in a bookstore and talks for some time after Marie has to leave. Dan develops something for her, and when this starts to turn into a sense, we get a turn. Marie is his brother's girlfriend. Undoubtedly, Dan flirts with Marie and realizes he loves her, and even Mary loves him, but their love would not be possible. The way they make it possible forms the rest of the story. <br /> <br /> Steve Carell is doing well, Juliette Binoche is good as Marie. And all the other things are doing well. It's a good movie, watch it.
