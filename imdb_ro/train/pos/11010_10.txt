When Matrix appeared in 1999 and questioned its existence and identity, it was expected that many films would use it as a source of inspiration. This has not really happened, surprisingly, and it lasted until 2002 for a movie with a similar theme to appear. But to say that Cypher is a clone would be his discredit. The story is about a Morgan Sullivan, who is engaged in a job with a high tech techno company called Digicorp. His mission is to be a spy and to get information about a rival company while under a presumed and false identity. Life at home is perfectly normal, but she must lie to her wife for what she actually does. However, things start to turn into conspiracy, and before you know what's going on, he begins to wonder who he really is. This is not helped by a strange woman who returns ... Twists and turns in all directions keeps you absolutely fascinated and at any moment does not seem to be anything contradictory or incredible. <br /> <br /> It's a fascinating journey in a not too distant future and with good action around it will keep you on the edge of the seat. Highly recommended.
