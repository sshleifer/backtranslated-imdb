True, it does not follow the book very carefully, but it is still a very interesting story. Swayze was much better in the role than I expected. And Doody avoided portraying the "foolish woman from deep into the wild," which most of us probably expected (Kate Capshaw of Indiana Jones & Temple of Doom). In any case, it's amazingly good than Richard Chamberlain's awful pair of Quatermain movies. It's very reminiscent of a western in many ways. The only thing I did not care about was mystic, but I think it's an integral part of the genre. How would you say "how can you have an African adventure story without witty doctrines and pretentious wandering tribes?" Heh.
