Here's a really strange thing for you. It starts with another take-off on the PSYCHO shower scene on the campus, then becomes more crazy when more of their coats and their daring friends head south towards Spring Break. The problem begins when they lead in the red county, led by a murderer Sheriff Dean. One of his courageous colleagues wanders in the woods, confesses to a sheriff's murder and opens his head. Then he lets him disconnect the MACON COUNTY LINE as a Dean strain, traps and slaughters the mindless witnesses one by one. Tony March is in the target as the evil dean, the fun. The overall tone of the movie is really disturbing. The end is so steep that almost you think the director has fled from the film; is also a desperate study. SHALLOW GRAVE is a necessity for misanthropy, misogynists and nihilists around the world.
