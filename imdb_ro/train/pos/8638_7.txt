David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes play a couple of young journalists who want to go to California but can not really afford to share with another couple (Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis) to save at the expense. so they can stop at various crime spots along the way, sites where serial killers have done their jobs because Brian (Duchovny) is a writer and Carrie (Forbes) is his photographer. Lewis is a serial killer and a girlfriend who only goes along with what he says. I do not care about Pitt as a rule, but he does justice to psychological roles. The effect is that he does them so well, I actually have known people just as before, no, not murderers, but with the same mentality. Anyway, as the road goes on, Carrie suspects that the others are out of money, but Earley seems to always come with the money. ..whatever times she leaves someone dead here and there to do it, yet Lewis does her new role she excels, a woman not too luminous, who has a good heart, but does not understand that she does not have to She's getting used to being beaten by Earley when she does something she does not like. As things begin to become more unacceptable, Carrie insists that the other couple is left at a gas station and, unfortunately, at the moment she is in, she sees a news bulletin telling her exactly who they were shared with, after which things go down for them to a quick clip. This is not the biggest movie in the world, but it's not bad ... I looked at what the "unrated" version ought to be, but I wonder how much it was cut from the rated version, because it was me seemed quite bland, indeed ... not that it means a family tariff or something else, if not the Manson family. 7 out of 10.
