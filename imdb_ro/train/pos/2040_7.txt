CREEP is a terrible, real-time horror movie that just wants to show people that they are being attacked in a mutant subway platform of a mutant for 85 minutes. And do that. Nothing more, nothing less. Director Christopher Smith takes the drama as plausibly as he can by introducing a series of characters that would actually have reason to be in the subway after being stuck. It also deliberately leaves the origins of Creep titular (the illegal experiments that happen in the 60's underground are suggested) and that the mystery works for the most part. Unfortunately, it is undermining towards the end, in fact, retreating from a twisting end in the event that more genetic malformations arise (these are also suggested). Yeah, you heard me well - I wanted to end a reversal of the clich√©s! Franka (RUN LOLA RUN) Potente is good as the feminine lead terrorist, and the rest of the camp is fine.
