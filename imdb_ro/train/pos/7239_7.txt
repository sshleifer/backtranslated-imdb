What kind of gem of a movie, so good that they did a sequel. The film begins very well with a nasty monster who eats a few people and a party where the two main characters have begun watching Bendan Hughes performs the eccentric Vlad, a little bit of a chance for who he is, who moved to the city and used the services a real estate agent to find a home. <br /> <br /> Hell, we've seen all the vampire movies, we know the format. The film is being watched but the performance of the actors is very wooden and they seem like they do not want to be in this movie, but maybe that's just a part of the decadent atmosphere. I did not like the end, but there is a sequel, I have to watch it. /> <br /> When I looked at the movie, I thought Brendan Hughes did not really fit. Later, I could not think of him anymore, it generates a dizzying sensuality, so maybe he was right for the party. BRENDAN HUGHES Last seen in "Hitler - Raising Evil" as Lt. Guffman. Where is he now?
