Those who are not familiar with Elvira alter-ego Cassandra Peterson, then this is a good place to start. "Elvira, the Master of Darkness" begins with our heroine, message. It seems that her great aunt has died and that she must be present for reading the will. Eager to raise money for a show she wants to open in Las Vegas, she decides to leave in hopes of getting a lot of money. Unfortunately, the place to go is Fallwell, Massachusetts. If you have to remain a spell because of the car break, she discovers that her aunt left three things: a house, a dog and a cookbook. City residences have mixed reactions: teens like her, women hate her and men ask for her (though she's trying to stay the moral pillars of the community). The worst problem turns out to be her great uncle Vincent (W. Morgan Sheppard) because she wants the cookbook. Looks like the cookbook is a book of spells that will make it a stronger warlock. The movie is actually quite amusing, with Peterson aka Elvira using her "equipment" and sexiness as a joke do not forget, tomorrow we will show our head with two things ... I mean two-headed work.) Especially funny like Edie McClurg as Chastity Pariah, the woman who works the most to keep the city in line but ends up looking ridiculous (The picnic scene is the perfect example). It's worth a look (the movie, not her tits, of course).
