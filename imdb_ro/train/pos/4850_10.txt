So, are your boys going to sleep? Does the wife visit my mother in law? Although you are home. Is it a dark and stormy night and there is no football on the TV and the dishwasher needs stacking? So now what are you gonna do? <br /> <br /> I will tell you! <br /> <br /> Go make an old-fashioned cocoa (Frys is the best!) Keep some ginger nuts and sit in front of the DVD. Now go select and play Arthur Askeys world war two thriller / horror The Train Ghost, come back to that cozy couch and enjoy the night in! Ghost Train is a true classic British time of war! Arthur Askey, with the side shot, Stinker Murdoch, amuses and suspects the cast, a high octopus, emotions and spills, a thriller of espionage. It is in old rural England during the Second World War. It centers around a group full of people who have to stay overnight in circumstances beyond their control in an old railroad waiting room that they discover is haunted by an old train. and it's just a credit for all the cast is humorous in parts and sometimes even scary! <br /> <br /> (The story was written by that old boy Godfrey of Dame Army fame and is smart) Arthur Askey is fun and is very home preforming his routines for you and cast, he also shows him can act a bit! The cast is never staged, however, even the railroad keeper and the parrot give the film the necessary gravity. Oh, and when it's over, please remember to stack the dishwasher!
