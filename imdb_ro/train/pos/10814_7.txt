Given the opposite of 2009, where the reality is that we have a black president, this film has a rather strong historical significance. For the value of entertainment we found that this film is both committed and repulsive. I was quite taken back, of course, by the flagrant racism of the time, but I found the incredible music and dance. It's also cool to see Sammy Davis Jr as a very young actor. He plays Rufus Jones, a young boy who is consoled by his Mamma. He is told, "Why could you one day be a president?" This was so ridiculous in 1933 that he was mocked and thought to be proud, charming and funny. Most of the film is a fancy sequence of what the government would be if it was led by a black man. They describe the chairs of government as a rebellious Baptist church. The fact was when I came across this movie the day I drew it. It is very well made and very fun. I think that if we look beyond racism, we can see this film for everything that brings us. In fact, let's note that it is not just ridiculous to have a black president, but that it is normal, just makes this film more relevant. It clearly marks a moment in time for our collective consciousness.
