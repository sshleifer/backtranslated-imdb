I saw this on a US flight and was a little skeptical at first, because a few people said there were so many characters in it that you did not get to know each of them. However, I have not found this at all. The movie is fast but this is due to the nature of the director and the star. The tracking scenarios are excellent and yes, it can be predictable, but it's not true for most movies. The main character is a bit slippery, Christopher Eccelston is not as convincing as he could have been, but that said he's still a good movie.
