I liked this movie. It was a joy to see a version so close to Peter O'Donnell's vision. A number of people disliked the film, but it must be seen in the context of the history of origin that it is. The film uses the flashback to show the young Modest and the events that turned it into the woman she became. Before the network. Before Willie Garvin. The rhythm is slow and, for my taste, there is not enough tension in the current scenes. However, this is acceptable only to get a version so faithful. If you like Modesty Blaise, you'll even enjoy his mistakes if you just want a action action with your car tracking - forget it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She has the feeling of being the first in a franchise, but, as I have never seen it promoted anywhere, I guess it will no longer be the case. Unfortunately.
