This movie should be put on DVD. It was so funny and I liked it. Indeed, very cute and funny. It's not realistic, but we do not suppose it would be. The only thing I did not like was the girl had relied too much on this guy. It is, however, the way of thinking of the time. I've been trying to get this movie for so long and it's not available for American format only in the UK and it will not play on American DVDs. Unfortunately, a classic movie was forgotten! Believe it or not, but this movie could easily become a cult favorite for all ages. It's a shame we do not legalize certain things that could really save our little ones or ours. Lindy is unthinkable, a positive character that makes lemonade of lemons. She is amusing and charming. He stole the show!
