Watching the movie, I had a very light mood, and this movie is also light, but the end of the movie is just unexpected, leaving a long memory in his mind. The film begins with Abhay and his profession as a witness during the registrar's marriage. Soha comes for marriage and his friend does not leave Soha alone on the street she can not return home and has nothing to live here in this situation Abahy turns out to be a help for her, that's the story base. The rest is just to be watched, and the end of the story is sweet bitter that Abhay has to deal with, which keeps you on the edge of the chair. <br /> <br /> Dialogues and music are good songs are good direction is good and as the script that you feel the film is slow but looking for the story request is fine. A real thing to watch especially with the mood I liked this at home with coke and peanuts. My rating for this is 8/10
