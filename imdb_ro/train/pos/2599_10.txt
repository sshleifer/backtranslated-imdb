Being pleased with Joyce's complex novel, I was ready to be disappointed with the scenario of Joseph Strick and Fred Haines, given the fabulous complexity of the original text. However, the film proved to be very well done and a fine translation of the tone, naturalism and levitation of the book. She's surely read the original text before watching the movie. I imagine that the latter would seem to be split, with very strange episodes, seemingly randomly stitched together, without pre-reading the text to help understand the plot. It is amazing to see how dirty the film is because he was shot in Dublin in 1967. The Irish film eventually censured it to the public in Ireland only until 2000 (it was hid the audience in a private cinema club, the Irish Film Theater, in the late 1970s). Joyce's eroticism is not simply naturalistic and twisted, it offers numerous "perverse" episodes. It does not matter that so many of these fetishes were unacceptable when the book was published in 1922 - they were totally taboo when the film was made in 1967. It's amazing and daring to look at the Irish acting profession of the years 1960, respected by all, dare to speak and adopt Joyce's highly transgressive text with such a taste. Bravo!
