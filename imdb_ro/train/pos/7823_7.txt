An excessive but convincing account of the friendship between Civil Rights Leader Steve Biko and Donald Woods. The first half of the movie is the strongest in which we see the connection between the two men and how they help each other, but the second half is not as strong due to the elimination of the Biko character. Still, it's an impressive film with extraordinary performances made by Kline and Washington in the movie that puts them on the map. Washington has also been nominated for the best supporting actor for the first time. On the whole, a well-done film that could have been cut short. 7/10 .____________________________________
