I chose a whim of the library and I was very pleasantly surprised. A lot of extremely tight, expressive, room-like work, a scenario as tight and two good actors mix together to make a very fine piece of film. Not for the reptilian multiplex brain, but rather for the true aficionado of cinema. If Hollywood gets his hands dirty, I'm sure he'll destroy it. A choice treats all the way. The other posters here have sung more than his praise, so I must not bother to duplicate them; Take their advice and mine, and do not miss this gem. Call yourself what you like; I call two hours of well-spent entertainment. Read my lips: do not miss.
