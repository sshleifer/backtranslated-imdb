I do not know ... Maybe it's just because it's an impressive tribute to a Muslim religious action (hajj), but I feel the movie is so undervalued. I can not believe that the film has just been voted by only 223 people, given that the film was produced in 2004 and has won many awards since then. About the movie ... is one of those sweet-action movies.Reda, a French teenager who is going to sit for Baccalaur√©at, is asked by his devoted old father to take him to Mecca.Strange what it would look like (if someone knows too much about Islam), the father wants his son to lead them from their home in France to Saudi Arabia on a once-in-a-life religious pilgrimage. The difference in generation between father and son is based on quite simple terms ("you can know how to read and write, but you know nothing" about life, "the father without the name of his son), but some kind of literature is avoided The father never speaks in French, although Reda understands Arabic, but can only answer in French Although they meet with many people on the road: "There is the old scary woman which he raises on the Bosnian border on the road to Belgrade and the speaker Mustafa (Jacky Nercessian), who helps them on the border with Turkey, reluctance and timid women wearing burqas on their way to Damascus, "the emphasis is always upon the father and the inappropriate son. there is too much conversation in the movie that will make her look good. You will see magnificent views in every city I lead. rate even the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia, even if the film is not relatively long. Generally, I do not like movies that do not have enough dialogue and who take their power from the subtleties of the room, but that was really wonderful. Despite some unsuccessful details (such as Reda's unseen French girlfriend), the film appeals to the senses. A great artwork and remember this film is the debut of Ismael Ferroukhi.
