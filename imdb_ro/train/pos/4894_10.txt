I grew up as the music in this movie was popular. What a wonderful time for music and dance! My only complaint was that I was a little too young to go to the employment office and nightclubs. I think it sounds like I live in the past (I have wonderful memories), so what's wrong with that ?! World War II was a terrible moment, except for music. Glenn Miller's death was a terrible misfortune for us. This movie will be my favorite. Clio Laine was great; What voice! I do not know how I ever lost this movie. The main reason for this commentary is to alert the modern generation to an alternative to Rap and New Age, which is offensive to me. Watch this movie and give it a chance!
