Youth, sexuality and the French rural environment - one of the most unique movies you will ever see. If you can see it, there is no feat, considering how hard it is to find copies of it (a combination of deficiency and censorship.) It's sometimes erotic, sometimes disgusting and sometimes funny. A bit boring, also in the middle, but in everything you can not call yourself an angry bizarre movie until you've seen it at least once.
