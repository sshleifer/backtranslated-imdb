The film focuses largely on an assault on Robert Taylor as a hunter of ruthless buffaloes and those who have to endure it. In a hunt for decreasing the number of buffaloes, the end of a tragic era of meaningless slaughter is full of drama and remorse for both buffaloes and native Americans. Taylor is blinded by the hatred of the Indians and his naivety, that the buffalo herds will never disappear. In a scene, he shoots the animal after the animal, while in another he kills the Indians and then eats the food they find at their fire. Under this ruthless exterior there is an uncertain person who is low to ask his comrades (Stewart Granger, Lloyd Nolan and Russ Tamblyn) not to let him. It is not the most enjoyable of the movies and is weighted by the drama it creates, leading to a tough and fitting conclusion in a blizzard.
