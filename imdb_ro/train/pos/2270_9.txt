The film is a little "thin" after reading the book, but it's still one of the greatest movies ever made. Sheryl Lee is beautiful and Nick Nolte is really "vonneguty". He does an excellent job expressing feelings from book to film. Not many movies involve both the feeling of the book and the mother's night.
