Two sailors are on vacation - Mrs. Joseph Brady (Gene Kelly) and shy innocent Clarence Doolittle (Frank Sinatra). I meet beautiful Susan Abbott (Kathryn Grayson) and both fall in love with her. There are more, but you probably guessed it. The story (even for a musical of the 1940s) is ridiculous and everything is so beautiful and healthy - it gets annoying pretty quickly. Also this movie is too long. It's 140 minutes and that's too much for such a bad story. There are also boring numbers by Jose Iturbi and his orchestra. However, it is worth catching. When Kelly dances or Sinatra or Grayson sings, this becomes magical. None of the songs is particularly memorable, but Sinatra had such a beautiful voice that you will not care. He is shot in rich Technicolor, with all the shine that MGM has had. The action is OK - Kelly is fine (though you see him as a lady pushing him) and Sinatra is great (though you see him as a shy guy, he pushes him too!). Grayson has nothing to do, but it's incredibly beautiful to look at. Some of her pictures took my breath with me! There are many important pieces: Sinatra and Kelly's great dance and song; Sinatra singing anything; Grayson the two songs and the famous cinematic sequence where Kelly dances with Jerry - an animated mouse! Tom's doing a fun camouflage. There's also little Dean Stockwell stealing every scene he's in. So it's too long and the plot is not in the hand, but still worth catching. This was a great success in his days.
