I like Eddie Izzard. I think this is great, and the other television specialties must be looked at the same. He has a good book "Dress To Kill" besides also buying that I think people should read. I liked that this program won an Emmy, and anyone who likes history will probably get a laugh at Eddie. Enjoy :)
