I write this 9 years after the final episode was broadcast, and I'm still wandering about Wildside's impact on me. It has effectively disappeared where many other police dramas have left and succeeded. But he went on and did not turn away from the realism of the streets, often portraying life events and characters up to T. <br /> <br /> I am extremely deprived of this series, instead of stupid "Underbelly," which was dramatized and acted creating a whole American-esquire trash. Wildside has remained true to the uniqueness of Sydney, and that's why they are truly indebted to this wonderful series. The actor was type A and it is a shame to see that only a few actors have continued their career, while others have faded into obscurity. I do not want Australia to forget this wonderful piece in their television history, so I ask ABC to release the full DVD series, not the first three. Give this series the end he deserves.
