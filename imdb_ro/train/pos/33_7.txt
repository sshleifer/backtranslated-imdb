This exciting Giallo impulses a typical but still thrilling plot and a truly sadistic killer who obviously likes to hunt down their victims before killing them in painful ways. Directed by Emilio P. Miraglia who, a year earlier, also made a very interesting "La Notte che Evelyn Usci della Tomba" (see also my commentary on this), the film starts a bit slow, but, as a whole, neither a time is not wasted with sub-parcels or unnecessary sequences. /> <br /> This film is a German-Italian co-production, but it was released in Germany on video only in a 15-minute cut-off version under the stupid title "The House of Horror". At least the murder scenes, which will satisfy all the gorehounds, are completely intact, and the viewer receives the killer's motivation at the end. But the Italian version containing all the materials is still the one to look for, of course. A convincing Giallo with forced twists and red herring, "La Dama Rossa Kills Sette Volte" is highly recommended to fans of Giallo and slightly superior to Miraglia's other thrillers.
