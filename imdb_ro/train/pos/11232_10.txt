Okay, so the first few seasons took some time to go on the way of special effects, but from the beginning, Hidden Frontier consistently gave good story lines and performances and were always willing to mistakes they made . They advise people to see the newer episodes first so they can see how good the show looks and understand how much has changed since the first episodes. Distribution has a fantastic camaraderie and looks on the screen. <br /> <br /> The influx of invited actors who make their mark on the show and with the fans also witness the show as the story lines go from power to strength. The show has pushed barriers with its various stories - depression, drug addiction and mass homosexuality - and they have rubbed a few people wrongly, but that's what Star Trek is. She describes these story lines in a smart and emotional way, treating them subtly and without problems. <br /> <br /> Yes, they used some characters in the history of Trek, but they were right - characters such as Shelby, Lefler and Necheyev, very little used in the show, had a rebirth in New Frontier books, but they they lost sizzle after a while when Peter David, when more than wild fantasy versus science-fi serious, and HF shows those characters in a completely different light that serves them better. <br /> <br /> The site also allows fans to interact with chat rooms and forums and get to know the people involved. They release the episode for each episode so fans can see what they laugh, because they do it in their spare time with a dedication that would make many professional actors with big eyes in shock! <br /> <br /> What this series, which is approaching for almost seven years now, has made such a limited amount of resources, not surprising - bringing people in, inspiring others to do the same. HF will live long after it's over, as long as people still enjoy the reason they first started.
