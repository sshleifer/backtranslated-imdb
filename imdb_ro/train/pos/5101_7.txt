John Travolta, the world's greatest honkeytonk, and a mechanical bull ... what you can ask for! Yes, you probably will not get many profound surprises or meanings in this. Still, it has always been nice to see this love story. Bud (Travolta) and Sissy (Debra Winger) meet at Gilley and fall in love. They have all the difficulties you could expect from a hardcore redneck couple. The honkeytonk scenes are fun with dancing, bull's mechanical riding and, of course, the required quarrels. He has a good soundtrack since 1980 with the song "Looking for love in all the wrong places," "Devil went to Georgia" and "Hello Texas" by my favorite Jimmy Buffett. Break your cowboy boots and boogie! <br /> <br /> *** (Din 4)
