Jim Belushi is awesome as "Medie Joe," which receives 15 minutes in "The Twilight Zone". Michael Cane is a mysterious auction that not only listens to Belushi's story but also has a "remedy" for Belushi's middle class problems: A magical potion to bring an avalanche of changes to Belushi's life. <br /> Flashbacks show that a 15-year-old man is ashamed to have defeated the baseball team championship in this team. Belushi continues with his "pitiful life", apparently happy, but always wonders "what if ..." For what seems to be a few days, Belushi is living a "different" life, an enormous success, admired and ugly by others an equal measure. This is not really a "wonderful life," but some elements are similar and very appealing. "Conclusion" is predictable but still satisfactory. Look for a very young Cortney Cox in one hand as a "fatal attraction" - like another woman. A very enjoyable movie!
