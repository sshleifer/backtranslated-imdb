I was impressed by Chavez's position against globalization for some time, but until I saw the film at the international documentary film festival in Amsterdam, I realized what she really did. This film tells the story of the coup d'etat / conspiracy of the Venezuelan elite, oil companies and corrupt Western oil governments to overthrow Chavez's democratically elected president and return Venezuela back to a brutal dictatorship. This film is a must for anyone who believes in freedom and justice and is a lesson for the rest of the world! I congratulate the people of Venezuela to take the matter in their hands and to save their country from Halliburton and the Bush regime.
