This film describes the life of someone who grew up in the most serious circumstances, but unlike many people in fact, he grew up to be a respectable person. More is the fact that this is a true story. Antwone Fisher is so innocent and yet he was abused for it just because he was not white. Antwone Fisher has been married to the same women for ten years and has never cheated on women, coke, cigars, weeds, alcohol or any of the things that are very popular in places where he grew up. <br /> <br /> There is not much to say about this movie being excellent. The only rating I can give is 10/10.
