In my sincere opinion, everyone should see this movie at least once. He really put things in perspective as we watched him. Although it was fictional, this film is about something that could happen to your children. It shows how easily two children can hide both their hatred of school and their plans to kill innocent students. This movie would not work in any other format. They pulled the camera perfectly, perfectly. Remind us of April 20, 1999, when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold murdered 12 students and then they themselves. It also reminds us of the press storm that followed. Everyone wanted to see the Rampart video and everyone wanted to see the Basement boxes. This film is a fictional version of our dreams that comes true. We came to see the baby behind the monster. The only bad thing about this movie is that it did not work well on the market and few people know it existed. If they only had one preview in a single film, they would all have gone to see what Zero Day was about. I think this is the best film adaptation of a film school among the few who have really tried. Filming itself takes only about ten minutes of film and half a film because it focuses more on Cal and Andre and what they have done before. If you have not seen this movie yet, go and rent it and watch it. I guarantee you that when done, you will be speechless.
