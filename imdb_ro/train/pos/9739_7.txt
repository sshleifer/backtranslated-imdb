We had fun looking at this movie, mainly thanks to Simon Pegg, who quickly became a solid box-office remake for comedy movies. He is hired from his dead work place, published in London, by large shootings from NYC media mogul Jeff Bridges, as a writer, for one of his celebrity folk. After he paid his contributions, he reached the top of the hacker's script ("the seventh room"), where he became a minor celebrity himself. The story is very funny, and Gillian Anderson plays an impressive role as an advertiser. On the road to success, he finds the true meaning of love, etc. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> <p> <p> <p> Kirsten Dunst was good as the interest of love. The rest of the support worked well. This was a good comedy and it is worth to stop at theaters.
