After watching the trailer, I was surprised that this movie never reached the theater, so I ordered BluRay. I looked a lot and I have to say that this movie is better than some of the important animation movies there. Of course, it has its flaws, but I can still recommend it. The animation is well made, very funny and unique, and the story made me look all the way to the end. Some backgrounds are just great and you can see the French talent behind it. I thought that the performance of Forest Whitaker feels a bit lonely, but that's how the Lian-Chu character described in this movie. So, overall, my big fingers, I really enjoyed it and I hope it is a good enough success for all the studios involved to continue making such great movies. I would recommend giving it a chance and being surprised how great a movie can be with such a small budget. Hektor alone deserves to watch the movie because some of his moments are Stitch-like hilarious.
