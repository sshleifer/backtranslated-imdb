OK, this movie is bad. I mean, in a good way, though. It was silly and it was one of the best "stupid" movies I've ever seen. Banknotes and gags are intentionally bad, but they are delivered in a way that has hit all my right notes. The supporting characters were rather superficial and mediocre. There is a rather weak plot, but it works very well. <br /> <br /> Elvira's character focuses here. It's attractive and adorable. Cassandra Petersen has a world of acting talent that just shines in this movie. above that talent acting, had physical attributes that were sincere, amazing. Few men may not agree with that. The parts that showed the figure were also some of the funniest scenes in the film. I had a nice ear to my ear from the first scene to the last. <br /> <br /> Recommended for fans of comedy and beautiful women's fans. I wish I had made a dozen Elvia movies.
