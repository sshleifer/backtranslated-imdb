I saw this series when she was awarded at the Toronto Film Festival. I liked the idea behind the movie, where two people gathered and told a director in each country to direct a 911 movie. These directors never met before the project was complete and they they saw how they looked together. WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All the pieces were very strong, and some were controversial. If you are an American, then maybe you do not like this because some of the pieces can be found anti-American. However, I know a few Americans who enjoyed these series. The song I found the best was India. It was about how a Muslim family living in states had two sons and one of them was missing. The Americans gave him his cold shoulder and automatically assumed he was linked to the terrorist bombing. It captures the mother's despair and humiliation of these allegations so well that it has brought tears to my eyes. Finally, we see that her son died while trying to save more victims from the collapse of the towers. This was a true story, and that made it so real. There were a lot of emotional and powerful pieces, and the song in Africa was one of the best. It was humorous, but as strong as the others. They have to see for everyone and we hope that America will debate this and let them play in their country.
