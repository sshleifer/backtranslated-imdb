I liked very much. I thought it would be a documentary, but it's revealed as a good piece of language in cheek fun. I think this was well done, quite a big TV show in a movie, but because of the characters or rather the original actors, the desire to have fun and to be fun, helps this work in an old-style style innocent. If you are a fan of the original TV series then I'm sure you will enjoy this. <br /> <br />
