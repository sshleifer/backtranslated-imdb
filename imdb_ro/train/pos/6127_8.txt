Jack Frost is about a serial killer who is sentenced to death. On the road to death, the prison truck he walks on collides with a chemical tank filled with a chemical that turns his molecules into snow on the ground, turning him into a snowman. Being a murderer himself, he turned it into a murderous snowman. Jack wants to revenge the sheriff who caught him. Jack now starts killing people in a small town. I do not think Jack Frost has the chance to become a classic horror, but it's a fun movie. Put your brain on hold and have fun with it, but do not take it too seriously.
