"Spin it!" The 90's were opened with a favorite Disney favorite, "TaleSpin," the TV series of cartoons containing characters from the "Jungle Book". Join Baloo and Kit Cloudkicker while flying in the Great Duck, as you have never seen before: from Cape Suzette to the Louie Mountains, up through the jungle, the water, the volcanoes, the adventure search, fun, all in one cartoon adventure in action! <br /> <br /> This was my favorite as well as my family. That ran after Disney the afternoon throughout the first half of the '90s until the original cartoons moved to the Old Disney Channel in 1995, which I saw on vacation with 1996 before receiving the cable in March 1997. < br /> <br /> And the good news: today's DVDs are here !!!!! Restore the fun and enthusiasm "Dun, Dun, Dun, TaleSpin !!!!!" <br /> <br />
