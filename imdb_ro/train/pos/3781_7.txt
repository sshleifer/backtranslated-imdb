I would not dare say that this movie is better than the original, but it is very good in its own right. Comedy in this movie is as good as the original, but there are so many scenes that make me laugh just thinking about them. The story in this movie is even more bizarre than the original, but that's what makes it so great. Peter Hewitt is doing a great job heading for this film with excellent distribution. The core of the original film returns to their characters in this film and they all do a great job with their roles. I do not care what anyone says, I think Keanu Reeves is a great actor! I loved Ted's portrait very much in both films, as Bill Winter's Bill did. I was very happy to see George Carlin return to Rufus's role, very cool! Hal London Jr, who plays Ted Logan's father, is doing a very good job. The scene in which Ted possesses his father's body and Hal London Jr begins to behave as Ted is a wonderful scene and shoots it impressively well. I can not forget to mention William Sadler as Death, he made the film for me. The rest of the distribution is pretty good as well. If you liked the first installment of the Bill and Ted series, then I hope you would like this movie too. But, do not expect to be as good as the original. I hope you enjoy the movie, thank you for reading, Chris
