Fawcett's Kudos take up roles that were considered controversial at the time. To remind me, rape was still a taboo issue in the 1980s, and women's rights and emotions were rarely examined so deeply at that time. Fawcett is simply a woman who is followed, followed by actor James Russo. He is appropriate as an obsessed psychopath, but sometimes a bit transparent. Diana Scarwid has a small role, like Alfre Woodard as a house mate. Woodard worries about legal consequences when Fawcett, the victim of rape, takes revenge. The scene where he throws a hot oil pan on Russo is classical and, as a rapist, he deserves. She then holds him in captivity and the consequences have to be confronted. A very real story that reflects the emotions and anger of the victims of rape who have been physically and mentally broken. Highly recommended. 8/10.
