RKO Studios have decided to borrow both William Powell from MGM and Columbia's Jean Arthur for one of their bigger budget efforts to win the popularity of The Thin Man. They have succeeded to some extent. A lot of people forget that in addition and sooner than Nick Charles, Bill Powell also starred in several Philo Vance films in the lead role. So this time it was very well put into play. Doctor Bradford does not make as many liquid lunches as Nick Charles, but Nick's blasphemy is still there. One difference is that while Nick Charles married an heir, Doctor Bradford works as a doctor. This helps in his detective advocacy and actually makes this movie. He has two crimes to solve. A jockey falls from a horse that enters the homestretch of a big race and dies without any apparent reason. The coach suspects something, but he is hit by the more conventional method of a bullet. This is after coming to Bill Powell for help. Myrna Loy had a more determined influence on Bill Powell than was Jean Arthur. Arthur interprets her as a dazed mother more than Loy did. But she works here and she and Powell have a good chemistry. James Gleason, who proves to be delighted, is the police inspector as Sam Levene / Nat Pendleton. All they needed here was That and possibly Eric Blore, as Powell's driver, was the essay on that side. If Powell and Arthur were signed to this studio, we'd seen a lot of Bradford movies.
