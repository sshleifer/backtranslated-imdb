Several summer caravans were accidentally sent into space by a robot. And the oxygen in the ship was leaking. They had to send someone to a space station to get the gas tanks, etc. etc. First of all, the plot of this film is not possible in real life. But it gives you warm feelings of anything possible if you establish your heart. It's amazing to see those young actors who still look the same after so many years. (I saw this movie for the first time in 2000, it was filmed in 1986) There are quite a few people in that movie still working in Hollywood. The view was wonderful from outer space. Does not seem unreal. It's about 2 hours long, runs so fast that you will not even notice it. You know it's not real, but you've just suffocated it to the end. Generally, it's a good family movie. <br /> <br />
