Well, Tenko is undoubtedly the best British television show ever, shows, direction, casting, suspense, drama ..... everything is fantastic about it. a little later in the last season, the final movie took the beautiful threads and carried a superb story for the fans of the show and the beginners. I can not recommend this movie anymore, find it and watch it. But I advise you to watch the first series because the first 2 seasons are even better than this fantastic movie. An obvious (10/10)
