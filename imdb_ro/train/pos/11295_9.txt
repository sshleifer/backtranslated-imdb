This movie has always been a favorite of me since I first saw her as a 12 year old child in 1962 when she was featured on the Los Angeles TV show's "late show". The characters are very interesting from the beginning of the movie and it is too bad that the movie was never released on the video tape nor ever shown on television (apparently due to a ban on the Estate of Moss Hart, the playwright / producer / writing the story and introducing it for the first time in the New York stage during the Second World War - the reason for the rejection of the show is hard to find more than 50 years after it was done. I have not seen the movie again for over 30 years, when someone who was actually a major member of the movie managed to get a bootlegged copy of VHS (poor video quality but good audio). My memory was correct: it was still an exciting and fascinating film to watch. An astonishing aspect of this film is just how many of its stars, who began their career in 1944), have continued to become either major film stars or at least well-known and fully engaged actors (for example, Judy Hollywood, Edmond O'Brien, Jeanne Crain, Barry Nelson, Don Taylor, Karl Malden, Peter Lind Hayes, George "Superman"), Reeves, Red Buttons, Lee J. Cobb, Kevin McCarthy and Gary Merrill. The scenes of the B-24 Liberators are extraordinary, especially close-ups, where the details of the giant bomber (for those times) with 4 engines (then 18,000+ products, now almost gone) can be seen. A good perspective on the various levels of training that a pilot cadet made to be assigned to a bomb crew (of course, very inclined in relation to gender, as was the tendency of the day: only men became pilots, has supported them in their roles - hard to accept in today's world). I hope one day it will be released on video for a new generation to enjoy.
