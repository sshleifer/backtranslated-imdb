Wilhelm Grimm (Alexander Knox) ​​is being tried for Nazi crimes. Three witnesses - Father Warecki (Henry Travers), Wilhelm Karl's brother (Erik Rolf) and former boyfriend of Marsha Hunt - before Wilhelm spoke in his own defense. The film ends in court summons .... The film is told in three retrospective segments that each of the witnesses takes their stand. The story is mostly in a small Polish village, and memorable scenes include the village's reaction to the death of Anna (Shirley Mills), whom Wilhelm is accused of rape; treating Jewish villagers as they prepare to be moved to concentration camps; and the church service where Willie Grimm (Richard Crane) denounces Nazi education as he drove back for his girlfriend, Marina's daughter, Dorina Morris, after being shot in a brothel. Knox is indecisive and is very convincing as a man, sick and evil. Martha Hunt has some strong moments and matches her strength, and Henry Travers is also very good in the role of priest. This movie provides an effective story that stays with you after it's over.
