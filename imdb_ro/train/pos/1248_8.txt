"The Golden Child" was Eddie Murphy's first film from his Beverly Hills Cop megahite. And even if it's not as good as "Cop", it's a comic adventure of fun. Murphy plays the role of discoverer of lost children who are attributed to an unusual case. His mission: to find the title character, a child with mystical powers. This movie could have been titled "The Beverly Hills Child and Doom Temple," as parts of this film play as a Spielberg adventure, much like a comedy by Indiana Jones. He has comedy with laughs and adventure with special effects. A lot of fun. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
