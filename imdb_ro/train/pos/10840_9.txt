In the voice on which the film begins, Hughie (Billy Connolly), a 70-year-old Strange Fruit band, said the lightning struck by a rock festival to stop the Strange Fruit set was that God was sick of excess 70 years. Indeed, it was popular to put down this era of music, and see punk as a welcome antidote to it. While agreeing, the excess was tedious (as did the misogynist excuse that came out of him) and, like punk, I still am a fan of what is considered classic rock or glam rock, and this movie about long reunion and strange of Strange Fruit is a tribute to those days. One of the reasons why the movie works is caring for the people behind the scenes. Brian Gibson has directed what she has to do with love, about Tina Turner (while I had problems with the dramatic pieces of the film, the music was very good), writers Dick Clement and Ian Le Frenais co-wrote British Television Television "EMPLOYEES" OVER THE RAINBOW directed to music and Strange Fruit songs were co-written by Mick Jones from abroad (not to be confused with Mick Jones by The Clash), so it was a meeting of people who knew what they were talking about. Also, two casting members are self-supporting musicians (Bill Nye, of which I do not know, although the film gives him his own sung, and certainly looks like a singer of that era, while Jimmy Nail was in a another British Music Broadcasting TV, although I forgot the name, and he was in EVITA), and the others are convincing. And while, as I said, a bunch of 70 bands like Strange Fruit behave badly against women, the film does not make the same mistake (except for the woman who follows Timothy Spall); as the meeting manager, Juliet Aubrey is pretty good and has a completely rounded character. The other actors are so good, with a special praise to Stephen Rea, who plays a more dramatic role without sentimentality. There are some plot points that do not work, but in general this is pretty nice. Yes, and the music is good.
