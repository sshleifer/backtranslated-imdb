It was an adorable movie. A real good-looking movie when you need one. The story is light (there is no extinction with the wind), but sometimes such a plot is needed. Funny and hot characters, fantastic actors and beautiful costumes / wardrobe. Parminder K. Nagra (also from TV ER show) is WONDERFUL in this role. She is certainly a new brilliant star for Hollywood. Everyone should keep an eye on it, it will be BIG in the future. Also impressive was the soundtrack for this film. A beautiful blend of modern and Indian melodies. I was dancing throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended if it's a fun movie you need.
