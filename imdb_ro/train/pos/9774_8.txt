This movie has ups and downs, but to me the good things in this movie far outweigh the troops ... What is not so good about the movie are sometimes dialogue, sounds, lighting (I'm the only one who noticed how the sets were enlightened was amateur, and to act .... What is very good are the very original story, the very intense atmosphere, the gore factor that is very great, and the effects that are made in the highest. is worth watching, or maybe even a must-see for everything horror you and gore fans ....
