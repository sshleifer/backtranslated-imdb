I have never heard of this move, despite the connection with George Clooney (whose company produced and appeared in a very funny way) and his director Steven Soderbergh. Worse, I got this in a box of discounts for $ 4.99 (Canadian dollars to that!) What a great and pleasant surprise. But I think if William H. Macy is in it you can not be disappointed. This was very reminiscent of the comedies in Ealing in England in the 1950s. Okay, with more profanity. This is an unusual and sometimes fun movie. The current blow made me laugh so much I cried. Perhaps the funniest use of panties in the history of the film. Maybe my expectations were poor, but I looked with a group of people and I had an explosion. The best 5 $ we spent in ages.
