So Mary and Rhoda have grown old - who is not? I was a teenager when Maria had a premiere and a "young adult" when she left the air. Yes, it was great to see Mary and Rho together and yes, maybe the movie did not support the comedy of the original series, but there were enough moments that reminded the spirit of the show to make it a good tribute. Example: the producer who employs Mary and then dictates the idea of ​​a new series of "elders". Is not this typical of today's Hollywood television mentality and the "bean meter" movie? This is not the best scenario of MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW - but it's a pretty good look at a show I grew up in the '70s.
