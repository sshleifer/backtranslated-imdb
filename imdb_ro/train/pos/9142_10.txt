Purple Rain ... what else can I say, the title speaks for itself. But I think all the actors were well-chosen. The movie had a wonderful story. I liked! Since I watched the movie, I was locked in the '80s and there are only 13! My favorite part of the movie was when his father died, and he took all his musical compositions, and Apollonia was sitting on the ladder with his ear in his hand. Critics say it's a drama, but I think it's more of a love story. Murphy Brown also did a great job in the film, actually acted like himself. I'm glad to see this movie. The Purple Rain song, beautifully sung, was so unimaginable. I've been crying several times.
