For all the killers there: condemning a television evening with an episode is like judging a whole book after reading the first few pages. Having said that, I was a big fan of BSG, thought to be one of the best TV drama (not just sci-fi) in the air. But it was time for it to end and the story went on. I liked the BSG epilogue "The Plan", but he raised so many new questions he answered, so I anticipated the "Caprica" ​​and I was not disappointed. We hoped he would not try to be another BSG and I was glad that Caprica was something different and I personally found the interesting story in a different way from space fights, explosions, and special sci-fi effects do not misunderstand me, I like those things too). Eric Stolz and Esai Morales offer solid performance, and Alessandra was great. I can not wait until next week.
