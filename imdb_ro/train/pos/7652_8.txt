The actor - fantastic. Story - Stunning. Scenario - Wonderful. Just a few ways to describe this movie. Yes, it's slow and it's the most talk, but the whole story of their lives, and as they say with flashbacks thrown in and out, makes you want to listen to any little thing to learn more about this haunting story and tragic. I, myself, read the book on which the film is based, and showed me more light in this story and answered a few questions that remained unanswered in the film. I will also read The Executor's Song, which is the half of "the other" of Gilmore's story. This movie made me believe so much about the phrase "piercing across the bottle". You have heard a song in Gary Gilmore's Eyes, a punk band that wrote a song about Gary Gilmore's eyes (which is one of the things Gary gave as a transplant when he died) and as you listen to him, the last time Mikal sees Gary, you look at the whole situation slightly differently if you only have the piece itself. This movie opened my eyes on so many others. I recommend this movie (and the book) very much.
