I am very sorry that this charming and capricious movie (which I first saw after it was first released in the early fifties) had such a bad reception so recently. In my opinion, it has been greatly underestimated - but perhaps it is more about the European sense of humor than the Americans: maybe we can understand and appreciate more subtleties and situations in Europe because we are closer to some in real life! In particular, the limited but good music - especially the song "It's a beautiful and beautiful night," which was published separately on a 78-rpm HMV record (the 10-inch prick label, I think!) In the fifties. I would urge anyone interested to try if you had a chance: you may have a pleasant surprise.
