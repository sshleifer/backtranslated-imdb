Being a fan of "Columbo", I was very disappointed with "Corky Romano". While, certainly, a funny film, the character of Falk's head of telephone was a cry out of the lover's lieutenant he had been playing for so many years, especially with the offensive language he was using. After "Corky Romano", I was really surprised and amused Mr. Peter Falk. However, after seeing for the first time "Finding John Christmas" and his predecessor, "A City without Christmas," for the first time every week, I have to say that "Max," Peter Falk's delightful character in both movies, is definitely as memorable and loved as "Columbo". While parts of the film are quite predictable, such scenes do not in any way remove the joy of seeing the story played. I would also like to record both these unimaginable Christmas movies and I highly recommend them if you are a Falk fan, a Christmas nut or just someone who enjoys the occasional movie films of the week. This movie can be lost among the sets of movies made for television, so do not forget to find "Finding John Christmas" before it's too late.
