Like a native of Bolton, this movie has an obvious appeal to me. The localization images are fascinating and show a very transient Bolton - there are a number of seemingly escape scenes, but this serves to show the city being rebuilt - and the idea that the old has to make room for the new one is right in the heart of this movie . A tiny little bastard, James Mason, leads a pleasant ensemble in a story about an agitation over a herring that is sprawled in a soulful generation generation, then a pleasant resolution. Although I'm a little too young to remember it, the finest of Lancashire's life in the 1960s is still here: spinning on Friday, songs around the piano, constitutional Sunday, good neighborliness, courtesy of the yard, massive importance of self-esteem and I was delighted to see Naughton's funniest lines in the game left intact. There is no doubt that this movie should be available on DVD - it is well done and most performances are well done.
