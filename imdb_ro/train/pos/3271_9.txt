I've always been a great fan of this movie, first of all you've seen the track, the actor is great and it helps this movie go really well. Cybill Shepherd received great reviews for her role and was well worth it. The beginning of this film begins in the past when Corinne Jeffries (Cybill), whose perfect marriage of image comes to a crushing stop when her husband Louie dies unexpectedly. Fortunately, Louse gets a second shot at life when he agrees to be "recycled" back to earth as the new-born Alex Finch (Robert Downey, JR). Alex continues to live his new life by looking at her past life, while Corinne tries to continue with her. But fate crosses Alexs' path 23 years later when he meets Corinne Miranda's daughter (Mary Stuart Masterson) and is suddenly flooded with a lot of unwanted memories (fun starts here and embarrassing.) Music is great, and scenes I feel very hearty and very nice. You will be disappointed if you give him a chance, Chances you will. Very funny and sweet!
