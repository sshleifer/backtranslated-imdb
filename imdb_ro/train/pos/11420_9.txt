This film refers to subtlety and the difficulty of navigating the limits of death, race and desire. Granted, it's not a movie for everyone. There are no cars, no buildings, no crimes. Drama is in the tension suggested by looks, minimal gestures, space boundaries, light, and remaining things - sometimes very apparent - reckless. It's about identity, memory, community, affiliation. The different parts of the film work together to reinforce the leitmotifs of themselves and of other nature, identity, desire, limits and loss. It will reward the attentive and sensitive viewer. It will not affect those whose tastes require explosive, massive, spicy action. It's a beautiful human film story. That's all.
