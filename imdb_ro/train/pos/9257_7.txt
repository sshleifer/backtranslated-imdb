Are your typical women in a love story for the shipping of the ship? Maybe, damn, you know how the formula works so far, a beautiful woman is put in a picture, someone has to fall in love with her. I think this movie follows some typical story lines, but that does not say anything about the content. There are extraordinary scenes with Crispen Glover, Dennis Hopper and Gary Busey, though short. Some things did not make sense, like the need to go into random battles, but it's fun to watch, the battles were actually well done. This is certainly a comedy in the first place, but it has a good feeling. Humor is well balanced, you will not hurt your stomach, but you will keep a smile. There is a bit of action steaming, so not one for kids.
