Neil Simon had a talent for dialogue and nowhere is more obvious than the lines that WALTER MATTHAU and JACK LEMMON offer as opposed to ODD CUP - a mixture of comedy and sadness that depends entirely on the credibility of two friends, an apartment . Lemmon is neatnik Felix Ungar, bent on the suicide after divorcing his wife and agreed to share an Oscar Madison (Matthau) apartment with somewhat disastrous results. It seems that everything Felix says and leads Oscar on the wall and none can handle the other, Oscar being the strangest man imaginable, and Felix the opposite. The funniest scene for me was when the chick Pigeon Sisters in the above apartment visited a dinner. The invaluable interaction between Lemmon, Matthau and Carole Shelley and Monica Evans is enough to put you in seams. The talented pigeons are the enemies who made the voices for the Gabble Sisters (a pair of gestures) in Disney's ARISTOCATS, and here - their comic time over Lemmon's sad sad desperation story is enough to turn the movie into hilarious - - if much of the time remains. If you are a fan of Neil Simon and have enjoyed other screen treatments of his work, it should not be missed. Matthau and Lemmon are perfectly distributed (even if they have considered role-sharing before filming starts) and, of course, it's easy to see why it subsequently became a top-rated show. <br /> <br /> Summary: Up Comedy Simon, do not miss.
