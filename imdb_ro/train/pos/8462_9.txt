I have just bought a collection of this wonderful series and even after watching only three episodes, I still fascinate myself with the elegant style of animation and the slow but thoughtful action of the story. I'm still a fan ..... with some minor pain. Although this tranche in the Gundam saga is very cool and has what the previous series had - a satirical style of style to say about war mistakes and not to give up the need to have control or power everywhere (sounds familiar?), I have to say that it becomes a bit too soft-dramatic on continuing to explain the lives of the main characters and their incessant need to spoil the chest of anything and what they have to do to stop the OZ group from success in their plans (especially the character called Wufei ... I mean, he calls out more than an American character on a soap opera. I counted you?) Besides the exaggerated drama (I think most of it comes from the doubling of the English voice actors), this series is still very exciting it will capture me again. I mean, it may be worse. It could be like the recent installment, SEED ...... eeeewwww, talks about soft-dramatic ... I'll talk about it later.
