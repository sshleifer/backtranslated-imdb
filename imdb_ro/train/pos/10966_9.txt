Gray Gardens is a world in itself. Edith and Little Edie live in almost total isolation, eating ice cream and pasta in an improvised kitchen in their seemingly common bedroom. Cats are dying while Mother Edith is insulting her daughter's eloquence. This is a Tennessee Williams game that comes to life and should inspire scriptwriters and playwrights because bizarre and overlapping dialogue is 100% real. The situation in the house reminds me exactly of how my grandmother and her 50 - the daughter lived for a decade (other than being poor and clean). They would whip all day, Grandma talking about her gloriously perfect past, while her daughter continually blamed her for opportunities missed with men, work and self-expression. This movie is a must-see for anyone writing a parent / daughter relationship of this kind. He is sad and voyeurist, but the directors have done a stunning job, getting the Edians comfortable enough to expose themselves so foolishly. It is rare to see real life in this way, and especially in the context in which we live - remnants of a powerful family that fades into nothing in the skeleton of their mansion.
