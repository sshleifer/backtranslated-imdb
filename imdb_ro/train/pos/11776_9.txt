Chuck Jones's "Hare Conditioned" is a fast, often hilarious cartoon. Pitting Bugs Bunny against a strange, yellow-skinned store manager who wants to fill it, "Hare Conditioned" takes full advantage of its multifunctional settings. The Chase takes Bugs and his follower through a variety of departments, leading to an inspired hole, where they quickly emerge from different departments wearing what clothes are associated with that part of the store. This big gig is forced, however, through a truly inspired sequence involving lifts where the Bugs, disguised as an elevator boy, misleads the store manager to go tirelessly on or off the lifts at the wrong time. It's a glittering, culminating piece that unfortunately leaves a very funny final gang. At that time, however, "Hare Conditioned" made its mark as one of the great chase films, bursting with wild energy. As Bugs was more and more refined in some of the other cartoons of that period, "Hare Conditioned" showed that it could be as appealing as a more anarchic character.
