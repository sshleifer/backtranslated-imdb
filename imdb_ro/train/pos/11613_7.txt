Distortion is a movie that caught me by surprise. A kind of multi-layer drama that focuses on a man writing a play about his life experiences that is happening right now. To be more concise, he feels that his wife is deceiving him, so he hires a private eye to sneeze him. His wife has no idea that this is happening. Meanwhile, the actors in this play also have some people who did it with their sleeves, making themselves stand up against each other and tell unscrupulous people from the world of Israel. Everything culminates in a theater with all the actors present and predictable (but not really) happening. The director of the song keeps things moving along with the ensemble of characters and edits a way that makes you pay attention, this is actually a fun movie, one that I was not disturbed to look at and I recommend people to look.
