This is a so-called "common sense" movie, but it made me sad in a way. Why? Because I had the talent, but my parents did not let me study at the sports academy, and that at the age of 12 I decided to give up football. And football is the red line in this movie. Together with the struggle young people have with their parents' expectations. An Anglo-Indian girl and her parents, with their strong family traditions and ties, and on the other hand the English family with a woman who dresses like a boy and plays football ... a combination that worries her mother! This film also traces the lives of ordinary people, as well as the Indian community in England. It's about believing in your dreams and living a single life (where I heard this before). Paraminda Nagra (a beautiful woman!) Play Yasminda, a girl who is not interested in boys, new clothes, makeup and typical 17-year-olds. In contradiction with her sister Pinky, fill in Yasminda's opposite. It must be true, to see how a beautiful little girl struggles with the traditions of her parents and finds her luck at last. With cool music from Blondie, Curtis Mayfield, Texas, Melanie C, as well as Indian hits. Pleasant to look at, but if you, like me, have ever played football and have never done it, then this movie will make you melachonic.
