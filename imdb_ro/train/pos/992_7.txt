We had no expectations; I've never heard of Jamie Foxx; All I knew was that the movie had strong characters. I thought it was very fun; it was fun. The plot was different and unpredictable to keep my interest. For me, Foxx is an original. David Morse is great (indeed, this is not the best part of it). I thought shooting and pyrotechnics contributed to the film and were well done. I did not expect much and I was happy to be surprised.
