I have heard that this film was a study of the art of the landscape photographer, presenting the beauty in deconstructing the natural landscape of man. It has certainly been shown laborious activities to find locations, create photos and capture stark images whose final destinations were art studios around the world. Put yourself together in moving pictures is really a horror show. This film takes you through the suppression of the shock of broken images, with gentle waves of wonderful industrial music that guides you through a river that is moving slowly. Each sequence is on its own, but in combination you become deeper and deeper in the sense of overwhelming inevitability. There are few words, which allows grandeur in what is shown to preach in its own way. A terrible, massive factory stuffed with human vending machines living in sleepless living without hope. People who died early, while they were rumped for recyclable scrap in our wastelands E. The birth of giant ships and their destruction by hand in huge cemeteries. The construction of the Three Gorges dam, the largest industrial project in human history and probably forever. The time that a city dies and is at the same time reborn in a replica of modernity that deliberately destroys all the relics of culture that has been. The most terrifying image for me was a dam engineer, explaining that the most important function of the dam was flood control. The suture goes to the orchard behind the spokesman, where the last flood level is due to the toxic water that ate the tree bark, demonstrating that only the most hideous worms could live in the water. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Artist Edward Burtynsky explains the method. "Do not say what you should see?" many people today are in an uncomfortable place where you do not necessarily want to give up what we have, but we realize what we do is create problems that go deep. It's not just a right or a bad thing. It takes a completely new way of thinking. "The subtlety of this goes down in a sentence / sentence, but the pictures of the film scream that the decision was made in favor of the dark side. who is witnessing the washing out of your awareness and contemplation, there is only one possible conclusion - we are destined - the progress of humanity that is inexorable from our nature leaves behind the massacre that this artist finds in the terrifying beauty. are the pieces that our woods are hurrying unconsciously towards our own death. Unlike most environmental films, it does not end with any call to arms. It basically argues what the reason is, but it assures you that you place the blame properly on everyone equally.
