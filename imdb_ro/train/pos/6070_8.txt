Yes, Shakespeare would have been really proud. Laurence Fishburne was not in the best, but certainly not bad. Kenneth Brannagh, on the other hand, was brilliant. His instinct was great, as if he was playing with the audience. Very nice work. There was sometimes too little drama if more would have been expected. For example, Cassio's murder was a little blurred by too much distancing, causing the spectator to twist his head to understand everything. Did I tell Michael Maloney? Roderigo was unusual; even annoying. If you have not seen Othello before, look at this. If you did not read Othello, you see that. If you did not hear Othello, you see that. On the other hand, do a favor to read it, seeing it acted on the stage and hearing it and singing.
