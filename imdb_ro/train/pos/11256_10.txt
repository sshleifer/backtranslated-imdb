Undoubtedly, the best of John Le Carre's novels, transformed into a classic movie. Performances by Peter Egan (Magnus Pym, The Perfect Spy), Rudiger Weigang (Axel, real name of Alexander Hampel, Magnus Intelligence Czech controller), Ray McAnally (Magnus's father) and Alan Howard, the faithful and the British controller), along with the rest of the characters, are so perfect and natural that the person responsible for casting should have received a prize. Even small parts, such as Major Membury, are made to perfection. There is much to say about the power of performance and the power of the characters in the novel, which, despite Magnus's duplicity, can only help us feel closer to Magnus and Axel than to Jack Brotherhood and Grant Lederer in American intelligence. I have read the book at least a dozen times and watched the movie almost every time, and I continued to be fascinated by both. If I had a book to take a desert island, A Spy Perfect would be choosing above all else.
