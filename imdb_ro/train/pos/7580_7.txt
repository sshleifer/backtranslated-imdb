As much as I enjoyed with Hanzo the Razor, three are definitely enough: "Who Has Gold?", The Final Adventure for the Japanese Lawyer along with the impressive package is a pretty piece of Pinku cinema, but it offers a little new in terms of ideas making a big step back in the scandal. The film opens with the appearance of a female ghost and looks as if exploring the supernatural territory, something that could have taken the series into a new exciting direction; unfortunately, after the spook turns out to be just a shame in the style of Scooby Doo (cooked by a corrupt treasury official eager to keep people away from the lake where it hides the stolen gold), director Yoshio Inoue is pleased to recycle familiar elements from the first two films, the result being a rather old business. Once again, Hanzo leads an investigation that asks him to interrogate women by using his powerful penis, to catch his enemies and abuse his superiors. On the way, we come to wild orgies, rape of good nature (Hanzo is forced on women who want to appreciate their will) and bloody fighting. If you have already seen and appreciated the first two movies, you could also watch this installment to complete the set, but be warned that this is probably the least satisfactory one. 6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.
