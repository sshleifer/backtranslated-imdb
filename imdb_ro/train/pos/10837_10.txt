As an elderly rocker, this film mentions Heep and Quo - my two favorite bands ever - but with incredible distribution (everyone) - and the fantastic story - I really like this kind of creation. I can not recommend him anymore - and Mick Jones has added so much (lead leader and lead writer along with the biggest rock singer Lou Gramm) - I've seen this great work more than 10 times - Bill Nighy - and Jimmy Nail - talent scatters from every poison - then Astrid .... and Karen ..... what could an age rocker ask for! 10/10 - Bright blood.
