William Shakespeare would be very proud of this special version of his play. Not only is the best version of the film, but Hamlet's only complete version. Kenneth Branagh's hamlet is simply genius. Not only because it was written by Shakespeare but also because it had the courage to do everything, even if it was over four hours. We all know the story of the Prince of Denmark and his plot to avenge his father's death, so I will not go into the details of the story. However, I tell you that the best part of this Hamlet version is not the amazing sets or stunning shooting, but the interpretations of the characters of each character. I doubt you'll find a Polonius better than Richard Briers's delicious portrait. Plus, you can not go wrong with Julie Christie and Jack Lemmon. Also, Derek Jacobi, a regulator among Shakespeare's adaptations, is magnificent as Hamlet's antagonist. Of course, we need to talk about Kenneth Branagh. He stunned the audience when he entered the stage with his first trip with Shakespeare, Henry V. He was dealing with Hamlet. Sure, Olivier's presence was exciting, but I think Branagh's performance is great. When you follow him on the screen, he's almost as though he knew exactly how Shakespeare wanted the role to be played. How he was not nominated for an Oscar is a total mystery. At least the film received several nominations and even a strange choice for the script. I think I know I'm writing good when I see it. <br /> <br /> In total, you will never find a richer and richer production of Bard's best piece. To say that the technical aspects are wonderful would be an understatement. If you like this game and you are a fan of Shakespeare, surely you have to check this movie. Even if you do not care about Shakespeare, the pictures will keep you busy during the movie. You may not think you can stay all at the same time, but you will soon find that stopping this movie will make you want to see it more.
