This low-budget digital video has strong points in the right places - writing and acting. In addition, digital photography is the best of the batch so far. In low light conditions, the characteristic tone of the video image prevails but surprisingly rivals the film stock for brightness, clarity and saturation in lightened situations. This is the grass root movie making the best with a quick dialogue that bears a kind of "Cowboy Midnight" story about the grifters doing all they need to survive in the city of San Francisco urban.
