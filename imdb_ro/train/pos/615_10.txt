This is the symbol of fairy tale! The villains are completely evil and the heroes are refreshing. Danes, Deniro and Pfieffer are wonderful as well as the new actor who plays Tristan. Outstanding performances, enchanting, fun and dramatic magic and a perfect end of fairy tale make this movie absolutely fabulous! I'm not sure all the content is suitable for younger children, but for an older audience, there's a lot of hilarious subtleties! Previews do not make this cinematic right! My fianc√© and I were pretty skeptical, but I was so excited that I had a chance in this film that I can only hope to assure someone on the fence of this movie to try!
