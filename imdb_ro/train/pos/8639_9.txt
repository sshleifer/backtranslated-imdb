I have to start with excuses because I thought the first 75-80% of this movie was hilarious. It's largely because of Brad Pitt's performance. Spot on. <br /> <br /> Action by all involved was pretty good, but Brad stole the movie. The atmosphere was perfect in all respects. I'm not a giant Pitt fan, but this has to be one of his best roles ever. Brutal, honest, Gritty. All the good words to describe this movie. I read a previous review and the person said that the rationale behind Early's violence is not explained. It is explained, but they fortunately do not have to go into graphic details to get their point of view. Generally, I gave this 9 because each scene 1 or 2 was effective. I think the humor of the first half is perfect for this film. Underestimated.
