Here's another movie that does not really need a recommendation. It is a classic, fun and fun comedy, and of course inspired a series of successful television, which many would say even better (I like both of them personally). For some, it's hard to warm up to Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau as Felix Unger and Oscar Madison when they were weaned on TV with Tony Randall and Jack Klugman (or maybe the other way around). But what we have in both cases are four good actors who, in real life, seemed so much like their film counterparts that they managed to make their own characterizations. It's the humorous material of Neil Simon, which is essential, and where the laugh comes from reality. For those who have never heard of CUP CEAI, it's the story of a weird and strange freak (Lemmon) who is thrown out of a 12-year marriage by his long wife and suffers and lives in Manhattan's flat of his amic and totally irresponsible friend (Matthau). Penetrating these two roommates together inside the same four walls makes some extremely funny difficulties.
