Let's start with Christopher Cross's theatrical play. The song is "If you're caught between the moon and New York City." It's a great theme and song, even after all these years, they never get tired. It's really a wonderful song about New York City. Anyway, great Dudley Moore CBE plays the role of a spoiled, millionaire who is involved in Jill Eikenberry's character in the movie. Jill will later play LA Law. However, he is served by his wonderful British butler, Sir John Gielgud OM, who won the Oscar for his role in "Best Supporting Actor". Arthur falls in love with the character of Liza Minnelli, who is perfect in this film, apart from her performance in her Oscar winning role in Cabaret. No, Liza does not sing. She plays a waitress. Anyway, I love Geraldine Fitzgerald as the Bach family matriarch who decides the family's fortune. Anyway, she is fabulous and she should have won an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Barney Martin best known as Jerry's father Seinfeld interprets Liza's father. And it's great. The movie was well written, acted, and was broadcast to the audience that wanted more of it.
