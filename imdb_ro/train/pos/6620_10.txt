If the answer to this question is yes, then you should enjoy this excellent movie. I just saw it a few hours ago here in Paris (where the action takes place) and still feel the huge trauma I received behind my eyes ... What a visual shock! I've never seen such a beautiful white and black photo and such a drastic change in how to make animated movies. I firmly believe it will exist before and after "Renaissance", just as we have seen with Pixar movies or the experiences of Akira and GhostInTheShell. This is a real breakthrough in the small world of animated films and I hope that this French initiative (a small French studio unknown, with a few young people who have had a dream called "Renaissance" ...) will receive the success and recognition it deserves. Vive to France!
