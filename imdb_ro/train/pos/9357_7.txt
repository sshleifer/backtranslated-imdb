In New York, family dentist Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle) occasionally meets his former roommate and friend Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler). Charlie became a lonely man and bothered by the loss of his wife and three daughters in the tragic September 11, while Alan has trouble discussing his most intimate feelings with his wife. Alan holds his friendship with Charlie and approaches each other. Alan tries to fix Charlie's life by sending psychologist Angela Oakhurst (Liv Tyler), but Charlie has an aggressive response to treatment and is sent to the court. "Reign Over Me" is a good drama about loss, friendship, family and loneliness. September 11 is irrelevant to the plot; it could be a car accident, a fire or any other tragedy, as well as the sexual harassment of Donna Remar played by gorgeous Saffron Burrows, Alan. But the family drama works, supported by the great performances of Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle. Liv Tyler is impossible to recognize, I do not know if she uses excessive makeup to look older, but her face is weird. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Reine Sobre Mim" ("Reign Over Me")
