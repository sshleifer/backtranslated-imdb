This film is more Lupine then most, especially from Funimation. Other than evil dubious, it's not bad. The first hour is very similar to Comic (which is all based on Lupine). Wolves try to get a great treasure. Fujiko uses Lupine's weakness toward women to try to get something out of her. The last bit is not so bad, he is with other women, but of course, Fujiko is still the number one. Many of Lupine's other films are several families with cuss, then Lupine. Any good fan Lupine think he will be pleasantly surprised (I know I was after I heard so many bad things about this movie). It might be a bit better without the small animations rolling over the credits (making it a bit muscular) but it's generally not a bad movie. Good enough to be one of the few that I will follow again from Lupine III.
