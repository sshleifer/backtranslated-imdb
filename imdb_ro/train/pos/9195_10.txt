I do not often play a movie or show for ten years, but this show has touched a nerve in a way that has no other show. I found the whole series on mysoju.com and thought the premise looked interesting, so I glanced. I was not disappointed with what I saw; I was moved. This story remains on the most delicate side, as the main characters move us through scenes. Sumire Iwaya, played carefully by Koyuki, shows us human nature as she wants to keep the trouble of being shown. No one wants to give their soul to a prospective partner. So, he replaces a man, played by an adorable Matsumoto Jun, as a pet. This pet is like any other creature that we consider a pet. The difference; he can revolt in the same way, after all Momo is a man, not a dog. Being treated as a pet, he reacts to situations where a dog might react. She spends time with her new friend, Momo gets jealous. When she realizes that her pet is not just a pet, the sexual tension between the two starts to grow thick - Momo is a wonderful dance. Her thoughts change slowly when we begin to look at his own thoughts. Matsumoto makes us see a character that is very dimensional at first, in two dimensions when we see it as a dancer, a three-dimensional character when we see it begin to fall for its master as a man, not as a dog. In my opinion, it is worth watching this story just to see that this character is developing. Plus Matsumoto plays Momo with such sensitivity that you almost start to want it too. He does not even want to think about the future and how their relationship will change, but as Momo (the name he gives as someone to call his new puppy)? we both knew he would not be able to resist. Watch this show with an open mind is worth it.
