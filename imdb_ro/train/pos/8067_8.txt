Today, if someone mentions the name Victor McLaglen, the answer will most likely be "Who?" or maybe "Why?" Believe it or not, Victor McLaglen won the Academy Award for Best Actor in this film about a desperate poor man who is willing to sell his best friend for "carfare" in the United States. It's an exciting movie that shows how low even the best-understood shnooks will go for just a few dollars. The film takes place in Britain dominated by the British, and while all other characters are fighting directly or indirectly for Ireland's political independence, Mr McLaglen's character is concerned about getting money and getting drunk. The film wonders if political activism deserves all the trouble, because while the activist strives to make a point, many others not only do not care, they do not even know what it is. The morale of this movie is: seek the boyfriend, he can sell you a penny.
