Buddy is a fun family film set at a time when "humanizing" the animals and making them cute was an accepted way to attract people to be interested in them. Building on a true story, Buddy shows great love that the main characters have for the animals and for each other and they will do everything for each other. While it is not a perfect movie, the animated gorilla is quite real in most of the time and the chaos that takes place inside the house is usually fun for the kids. This film misses an opportunity to tackle the mistake of bringing wild animals to the house as pets, but it presents the difficulties. <br /> <br /> A recommended movie that was the first for Jim Henson Productions.
