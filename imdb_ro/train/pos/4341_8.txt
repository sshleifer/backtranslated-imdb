Who has no unresolved problems with their parents? And which parents do not have unresolved issues with each other? I know, it sounds hard. But this is played for laughing in the movie, making both the better comedy and the better drama. I've always liked Paul Reiser and Peter Falk, and though I'm really worried that their star qualities might be too big for a small movie, I was delighted at the first scene. were the discoveries the son makes about his father as a person. Peter Falk's monologue about being a father and a sacrificial husband working was the perfect point of balance. Without acting so well, the film would look much less nuanced, and the character is far less exciting. Very well done, Paul and Peter!
