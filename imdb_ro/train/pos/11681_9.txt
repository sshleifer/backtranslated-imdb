Many of the comments and comments I've read about this movie say that this is a rather old film and performance by Clara Bow. Though the story was quite typical of Clara's subsequent silence, it still seems to me somewhat mixed with heart and incredibly fun. Clara plays a happy Hawaiian girl who will stop at nothing to win the man she loves ... it does not matter that this man is married! Clara's lack of modesty was shocking during the day, but I think it damages the sweetness and general fun of the movie. Although it's certainly not a brilliant story (quite typical in fact), this movie is a beautiful presentation of Clara's ability to make the audience laugh.
