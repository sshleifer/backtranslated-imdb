I love this movie. My friend, Marcus and I, was going to Hastings, because we needed to rent something we never saw, and I came across this wonderful movie. I had no idea what it was about, but it turned out spectacular. 2 fingers up. I liked how the movie was shot, and the actors were very funny. If you are looking for a funny movie that also makes you think I suggest you go to your local video store very quickly and find this movie. I'd tell you some of my favorite songs, but that could ruin the movie for you, so I will not. This movie is definitely on my top 10 top movies. Do you really think Nothing is bouncy?
