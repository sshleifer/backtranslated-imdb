The dramatic love of four men in a canoing weekend on a remote river. They are the pacifist Ed (Jon Voight), adventurous, violent Lewis (Burt Reynolds), crazy Bobby (Ned Beatty), and beautiful guy Drew (Ronny Cox). The first 40 minutes are wonderful - there is the incredible succession of the banjo duel, an interesting interaction between the characters and just a stunning widespread cinema by Vilmos Zsigmond. Then two hills attack Ed and Bobby. One of them is violating Bobby ... and the journey becomes a nightmare. Just incredible. The scenery is incredibly beautiful, but this terrible violence takes place. To be honest, Beatty's rape has never bothered me - I am very aware of the fact that she is false despite the fact she is doing well. This film also shows how characters change - Ed has his pacifism tested, Lewis gets weak, Bobby is raped by one of the men he scorned earlier, and Drew is trying to keep angry. John Boorman's direction is also very assured, and the sounds of the woods and the river help the mood more. The act is largely good. Voight is just fine - he was better. Beatty is also ok - but it's his debut film and he has the courage to assume such a risky role. Cox is very good, especially when things start to fall apart. And Reynolds is just gorgeous - one of the best EVER works! How was it not even an Academy Award nomination that escapes me. Bill McKinney and Herbert Coward are also too credible like the hills. <br /> <br /> A powerful movie - NOT for children. Try viewing an unreleased version - the TV version is deleted. Also, viewing in a letter box is essential to capturing stunning images.
