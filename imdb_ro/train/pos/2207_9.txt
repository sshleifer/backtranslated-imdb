It's not a bad word to say about this movie really. I was not initially impressed with it, but it grew fast. I like it very much and I think it's a shame that many people can not see the past that it was banned in some territories, mine being one of them. The film is delivered to the department of shock, gore and atmosphere. Score is a beautiful piece of suspension delivery device. It seems that only Chris Young was one of the best composers in the field. Action in this film is of a somewhat high standard, if it is a little wood in some places, and the effects are very real and stones. All these are praise for a good movie in my book. I have noted, in some reviews, that the movie became serious, having the famous killer movie P.O.V. And I wonder: What's wrong with this? It's a classic blow that evokes horror in any fan of the genre and it's a great thing to keep the killer's identity a secret. The only thing that prevents this movie from getting important notes in my book is that surprise overthrow (the killer revealed) is not treated with more care, that is, it happens quite quickly, although great performances only make it credible. Besides that, PRANKS is a great movie (though I prefer an original title) and a shame that so many people beat it like a cheap piece of nonsense. Moreover, but only a few know that it seems to have been lost in the fog since the early 1980s. What a pity ... He is a very good people! Believe me!
