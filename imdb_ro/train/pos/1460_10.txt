Excellent film that reveals how people are connected to the usual beads exchanged during Mardi Gras. The film is much more than a commentary on globalization. In fact, he personifies Chinese workers, factory owner, New Orleans bearer, and even those who have spent in New Orleans. What is most remarkable is the director's ability to tell a complicated story with complicated details in such a simple and seductive way. His amazing access to the factory is another aspect that is exciting and I just want to know how he came in. It is a beautiful story, without sentimentality or guilt associated with it, and the conclusion offers hope without letting people feel alienated.
