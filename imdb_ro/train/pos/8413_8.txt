A stupid young man becomes obsessed with a woman - so obsessed that he loses perspective and common sense. A bad magician approaches him and informs him that he can give him a great wealth he can use to win the heart of the lady if he agrees to give him whatever he wants in their room. The stupid guy agrees and the magician steals man's reflection from the mirror - and evil things naturally result as a result. If this movie had been made only a decade later, I'm sure I would not want them not been so charitable in reviewing and writing this movie. After all, the plot of the film is a bit vague in spots, and acting is sometimes a little stomach. However, when you think that in 1913 "full-length" movies were rare - and often only 20-30 minutes! In addition, the whole idea of ​​a complex story like you in this movie is very unusual - as the stories were very short and they acted broadly. So, taking into account the limits of time, this movie is pretty good and is one of the previously known horror movies.
