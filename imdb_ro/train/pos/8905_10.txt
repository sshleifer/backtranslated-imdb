Old horror films are exciting, screaming, cries and much humor to go with her. "The Blob" is a classic in his work. Steve McQueen (1930-1980) plays a teenager trying to be a hero in his town. Exiting a meeting with the little girl is quite typical for all adolescents. But when the old man discovers the same object falling from the sky, he gets to be the victim, and Steve helps him do his best. When it's up to teenage power, this movie really gives it. I know that most teenagers have had their hardships when acting, when they receive the danger, they must learn to forget the past and do something good to save mankind. When the adults in the city got to learn the hard way about "The Blob" running amok, they must learn to trust teenagers and not let their behavior enjoy them. The Juggernaut was pretty cute in the day, and in my opinion I think it was JELLY! When everyone steps in to stop the threat, the city is safe again, thanks to an old, old collaboration. I still eat Jello and I watch this movie all the time if you do not like Jello, TOUGH! RATING 5 STARS
