I like Burt Reynolds's old movies. They are more fun and better than any other combined movie. They might have stopped making movies after "Cannonball Run 2", but I think how could they know they would not be better anymore? Man this movie is good. Burt Reynolds must dress like a chicken and drive a lot in a racing car, and the luxurious Loni Anderson is at hand, looking extremely hot in the eighties. Burt and Loni were days! I had a magazine publishing Loni Anderson for a vacuum cleaner. I really enjoyed the ad! In addition, there is a part of the movie in which the audience at the racetrack is disturbed by what Stroker Ace (Burty R.) is doing and shows that a guy in the audience bends and sticks his finger up to the bottom to reveal disappointment! I laughed so hard that I almost passed the night! If you can find this movie, rent it! And then you never watch another movie, because I'm telling you now: it's useless.
