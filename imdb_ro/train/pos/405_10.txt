I have been a fan of Xu Ke (Hark Tsui) for many years since school. This movie is the best fantastic movie for years. I do not think "action" is the right kind, although there are many KongFu actions and scenographs. Wait, did I mention that this is an ORIENTAL fantasy? please note that you DO NOT use the Hollywood formula to rate this movie. And for the guy who's around, I'm not blaming you, because you're still young and you need to find out more about "culture."
