After the initial shock of realizing Branagh's courage to film this, I was literally trembling with the enthusiasm of having this epic right in front of me. I was not disappointed. That's true for Shakespeare and yet so accessible. My mind exploded. I always like to see or rather listen to Branagh and made me wonder ... is this movie named in other countries? It would be like painting a mustache on Mona Lisa.
