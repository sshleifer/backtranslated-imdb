Touching and sad movie. Presents the attempts and attempts of a writer who tries to understand the paralysis caused by a cycling accident. The film focuses on his relationship with his married boyfriend, about which he is often very hostile and about his interactions with other casualties, especially an ungrateful motorcyclist and a white-supremacist biker. The film is often humorous, often sad and always credible. Remove the kleenex box and watch it on a comfortable Sunday afternoon with your partner.
