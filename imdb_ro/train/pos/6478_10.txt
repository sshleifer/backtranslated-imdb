Despite being told from the British perspective, this is the best documentary of the Second World War ever produced. Presented in digestible episodes (how can they be digested as war), like Laurence Olivier's serious voice connects the crowd of eyewitnesses who have been forced to live the events of that horrible time. Looking forward to its DVD appearance in the U.S. Europeans had the opportunity to launch on DVD earlier this year.
