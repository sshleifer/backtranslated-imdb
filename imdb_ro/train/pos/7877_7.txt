Write the word <br /> <br /> What you see is what you get. Not realy! What makes Madhur Bhandarkar's courageous and shining is the destruction of the myth attached to the glamor and the glitters that color the pages of our newspapers and whose lives (party reading habits) are pursuing with such manic fervor that only our intrinsic voyeuristic will can explain . <br /> <br /> The phenomenon of page 3 is equally deplorable because it is enigmatic. How he gained such control over the printed word and when he started to intervene on the front page is subject to another debate. Bhandarkar smartly avoids this. He is concerned only with the mechanisms of this grotesque existence. And by doing so, he divides the different elements of this way of life. Like Robert Altman (although we do not compare Bhandarkar with Altman's genius), Bhandarkar uses countless characters to pursue his motivation. Whether it's a NRI page 3, a gateway, a new-rich, a future model, a socialist politician or an erotic novelist; all characters are inserted with a lens and each one has a distinct character sketch, even if their parts can be tiny. And there is the appeal of the film. <br /> <br /> Konkona Sen Sharma plays Madhavi Sharma, a young and talented journalist covering page 3 for the Today Nation. Initially, to content herself with her job, she soon begins to see the ugliness of this beating that is covered by fake and cosmetic fools. But Bhandarkar opposes the temptation to make this subject a moral-police film and avoids focusing on a single character. For this reason, the film is not only about Madhavi, but also about Deepak Suri (Boman Irani), editor of Madhavi, who passively accepts her role as a bigger car, Anjali Thapar (Soni Razdan) - a societal suffocated by social pollution , Abhijeet (Rehan Engineer) - a homosexual makeup artist and roommates Madhavi, Sandra Mridul, Sister and Gayatri (Tara Sharma) - an aspiring actress. It seems like an impossible task to assimilate so many characters (and more) into a single story, but also a complete credit for Nina Arora and Manoj Tyagi for writing a strange screenplay. The dialogues of Sanjeev Datta and Bhandarkar were written with great attention to detail. <br /> <br /> Any narrative, no matter how good, can fall smoothly, with the lack of authentic performance. Fortunately, the "elders" with actors and not stars. Konkona goes through her authorized role with ease. Ditto Boman. Sandhya Mridus receives the best written, but almost exaggerated part. Kulkarni Atoll is scattered though it has an undersigned character. Sometimes the director seems too eager to incorporate as much as possible (pedophilia, homosexuality, etc.). But the contexts in which they are used do not make them look ugly. <br /> <br /> Finally, Bhandarkar's attempt is to saturate voyeurism, but one step further. It takes us inside the photographs and expose us to the frightening realities of this human sect, which seems to live strangely in a different and distant world. These are the same people who were piling up in the joy of the new year, while a few hundred kilometers their fellow citizens were hurt by the ferocity of nature! Intelligent writing, embedded skill songs, capable performances and a genuine sense of sincerity are what makes this film worthwhile, despite the lack of finesse and poor production. "Page 3" is an optimal way to enter a new cinema year.
