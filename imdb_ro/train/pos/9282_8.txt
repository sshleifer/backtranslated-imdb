In Iran, women are not admitted to football games. Officially, this is due to the fact that they must be exempt from the vulgar language and the behavior of the male audience. But, of course, it's sexism. Women are smaller forms of human beings. Some courageous girls oppose this and try to enter the stadium using different tricks. They are trapped by soldiers and keep in a cage until the police come and pick them up. Despite the crazy situation, this is a humorous movie. It is also encouraging to see how people always find ways to combat oppression. You will be touched at the same time as you have many laughs. Good job of director Jafar Panahi. This is in many ways a heroic comedy.
