In my opinion, this is a good show for celebrities. I liked seeing Greg Kinnear as a host. There are many reasons why I said that. Even if Hal Sparks was a good host, I sometimes want Greg Kinnear not to leave. If you ask me, it seems that no one is left with a TV show throughout the round. However, I liked to see the different hosts and other people who falsified celebrities. If you ask me, it was funny. Before I finish this, I have to say that I miss this show. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this show to all the fans who have died - the sketch. You will really enjoy it.
