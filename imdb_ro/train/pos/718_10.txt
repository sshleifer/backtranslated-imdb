Rock 'n' Roll High School was one of the best movies ever made! I think the only reason it was so great was because of The Ramones! You could not have done the same movie and put something like Sex Pistols or The Clash instead of Ramones, it would not have been the same. dey young, Clint Howard, Vincent Van Patten, Mary Woronov, Paul Bartel and the Monters Hall, just added to the film. The whole movie is about Ramones ... especially Joey! So everyone has shown a visit to Rock 'n' Roll High School if you're a big fan of the real PUNK. She is not the new crazy ... but loud and fast. Only Ramones could do. R.I.P (Rest in Peace) Joey Ramone 1951-2001. Dee Dee Ramone 1952-2002!
