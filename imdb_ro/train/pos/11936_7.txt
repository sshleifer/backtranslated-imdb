I really liked this movie as a little kid. At that age I thought the silly baseball antics were fun and the movie was "cool" because of the sport. Now, a few years later, I can look back and see what was a well-designed film. This movie opened my eyes as a small child in the battles faced by other children and the problems of the real world. This type of exposure is largely devoid of children's films these days, which I do not think is for the benefit of our society. Of course, the baseball antique seems to be very bad now, but they have attracted the kids. Not seven years will ask to see a movie about foster children, but they will ask to see a movie about baseball. Disney realized this and took advantage of this to teach these children an important lesson about the world. As a young adult, the performance of Al and the other angels seems far less impressive, yet I will give credit to the actors who played both children and Danny Glover, who have all made a fantastic job.
