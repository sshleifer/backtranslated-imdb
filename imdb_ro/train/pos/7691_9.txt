This show was a landmark in the American comedy, as it was the first sitcom to have played an African-American cast. Unfortunately, it has never been extended to British television. The Evans family is a poor African-American family living in a tower block. Dad is called James, trying to run the house, but Florida's wife always gets the best. The three children are artistic JJ, Thelma moody and young intellectual Michael. Coming always in the house is the gossiping friend of Florida Willona. I watched two episodes of this show on youtube (Black Jesus and Sex and the Evans Family - the only two on the site). You may wonder why an English spectator has been watching a series that has never been demonstrated or hardly heard in his country. The answer is this. In 1976, the British first discovered the black sitcom called "The Fosters". Only two series were made and now seems forgotten. But I watched an episode and I was impressed. Then I learned that the scenarios were the same as the "Good Times". They were the same characters, but with different names - Sam Foster was the father, his wife was Pearl Foster, and the three children were Sonny (a young Lenny Henry), Shirley and Benjamin. Pearl's gossiping friend was Vilma. (To read about The Fosters, I wrote a review about it). While watching the Good Times, only two things have made me angry. First was the theme of opening (awful) and secondly it was the laugh of the audience. I like the audience's laughter, but in this case, someone would say a slightly funny line, and the audience will become crazy and start beating. Besides, it was a very fun show. Let's hope that more episodes appear on youtube and hope someone will launch "The Fosters" on DVD in England. Best Episode: Sex and the Evans - Episode 1 of the series 1. Foster's episode was called Sex in the Black Community. The other episode I've seen, Black Jesus was the title of an episode of "The Fosters"
