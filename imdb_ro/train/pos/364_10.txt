Steve Speilberg's adaptation of the popular novel by Alice Walkers is not without controversy. When the first members of the black community criticized the treatment of black men, while others asked why a white man was guided by this film about black women. This is the story of a young black woman named Celie, growing in rural America after the beginning of the century. She has two children by her abusive father who is snatched from her arms at birth. Her only consolation in her miserable life comes from her sister. Celie (played in recent years by newcomer Whoopie Goldberg) is married to an abusive husband (Danny Glover). The husband is humiliated by her sister and so is quickly removed from Celie's life. The story is often upsetting, because Celie hopes that one day she will be reunited with her sister and her children. Throughout her life she meets an assortment of characters, including Sophia, a tough wife as the nail for her top son, and Shug, a powerful and joyful singer who teaches a thing or two about love. > Speilberg's direction is all around this image, which features brilliant cinematography and some stellar performances. I dare you to watch this movie and not to move! Color Purple film captures the essence of what is a complicated story. While it tends to minimize the lesbian aspects as well as the African story, both of which are so vivid in the book, the film remains true to its themes, allowing Alice Walker's voice to shine. <br /> <br /> I could not begin to answer the controversy surrounding this movie. Suffice it to say, however, this is one of the few movies I can watch again and again and that has left me an indelible sign.
