At least something good came out of Damon Runyon's wrong attempt to feel the mafia. "Guys and Dolls", seemingly indestructible music, was shot in 1955 by Joseph L. Mankiewicz ("All About Eve") in a colorful and enjoyable film that included a distribution of all ages, including Vivian Blaine Broadway show ), Jean Simmons (whose character looks similar to Audrey Hepburn in "Holiday Roman") and two of the best-known people, Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brando, both recently winning Oscar for Best Supporting Actor here to eternity ") and the best actor (" On the waterfront ") and were in the top of the game. Listen to Brando singing "Luck Be a Lady Tonight" talks about the volumes where Dylan received his voice early. Stubby Kaye steals the show as Nicely Nicely Johnson, who descends the house with "Sit Down You Rocking The Boat". Omnipresent Sheldon Leonard adds another page to his gangster screen of the screen. The film has a bright, cartoon look, anticipating Pop Art since the early 1960s. Characters speak in a stylized pathology, apparently based on Yiddish idioms. Although the social attitudes and gender roles of the film are dated, it is very fun and even the delicate joke of the Salvation Army is harmless and does not reflect any real animosity over organized religion. Watching Sinatra and Brando in the same movie is a good reason to watch this movie, but it has many other attractions to offer during its 149 minutes.
