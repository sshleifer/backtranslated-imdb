I just watched the first DVD series, but I summed up the Sopranos as a Shakespearean plot with a Tarantino script. The series is as good as Goodfellas and Casino and is as good as the Godfather (so it's not "10") and much better than any of Guy Ritchie's efforts. Although there is a lot of action, some of them quite bloody, the story is the character driven. Even some of the minor characters contribute to extraordinary lines; e.g. the relationship of the priest (or lack thereof) with Carmilla and the restorer's wife, and Christopher and his girlfriend (who did not last a long time (a Darwin nominee?)) In addition to the scenario, script and act, liked; <br /> <br /> 1. It made me want to visit New Jersey and eat pasta with a tomato sauce. 2. Music. 3. This shows that, literally, anyone can suffer from mental health problems.
