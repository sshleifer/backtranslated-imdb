This movie is pretty cheesy but I give credit for at least trying to provide some characterization for its principles. There are some wonderful moments in the movie and the dialogue has some wonderful moments as well. The air strike sequence is probably the best part of the movie. I think I really like the idea of ​​what a veteran will take for a veteran colleague. Of course not everything is well done, but the premise is not bad at all. tome
