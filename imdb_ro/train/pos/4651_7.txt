We have not set very high expectations for this film, which left me pleasantly surprised. The story is a bit strange, but in general I think it has acceptable credibility. The action scenes are pretty pretty and accompanying music is used to induce some patriotic feelings common to American films. Perhaps this is not the best movie ever, but it is unusual for Sweden and I hope to see more similar in the future.
