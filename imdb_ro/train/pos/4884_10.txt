For people of a certain age, W.W. II was the defining moment of their life, and what followed could never be compared. While the movie opens, a recently widowed, yet still lively woman (Judi Dench) hears a street musician trying to sing the classic song, "Stardust." This remembers her memories of when she played almost all the girls who made fun between the bomb raids during the war. The drummer, Patrick (Ian Holm), avoided happiness and liked ladies. The character of Patrick and Dench meet and decides to reunite the band, which takes on a series of mini-adventures. In spite of climbs and downs, the band reunites and has a successful reappearance. The film is very written and undervalued, with superb performances of all those involved. The characters are well-developed and all the people who have not given up life despite their years. And that's all that glorious swing music! This is not Steven Spielberg's pontificate, but a serious film with all this. The war has affected everyone and this lesson is not forgotten in a movie that is not afraid to have fun while learning.
