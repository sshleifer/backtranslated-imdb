I swear when I first saw the movie, I cried my eyes! A STAR IS NORN is the movie that lets you know what love means despite the obstacles encountered by John Norman (Kris Kristofferson) and Esther (Streisand). You also experience how to lose such love until the end of the movie. Streisand and Kristofferson have so much chemistry together and the music is fantastic! When Streisand sings With another glance at you / Watch now, it's just a pure magic! This movie made Evergreen one of my favorites, and Queen Bee is such a fun song. I also like the 1970s model (except for Streisand's Afro, in addition to being a beauty). Star is Born is my favorite number one film. This movie is a pleasure to watch and is a heart at the end.
