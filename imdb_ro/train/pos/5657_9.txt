I remember seeing the Gothic American when it was first released, my mind came recently, all I remembered was that the same guy appeared at Midnight Caller, which is Gary Cole, I'm not watching TV, but I watched the American Gothic bought the full DVD series this week, and is still as good as ever. This is one of the best TV series ever, the reason why I do not see much television is because they are just the trash that is on, except for Derren Brown. all Realitatea TV or Soaps, like Grease, Big Brother etc, I'm tired of it, I got the full American Gothic series for Â£ 16.97 from the Asda website, the cheapest one I can find.
