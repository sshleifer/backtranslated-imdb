"Footlight Parade" is fascinating on so many levels. There is no way that the alleged "theater prologues" could have been produced in any theater on earth, of course. Think about, for example, the huge swimming pools and the three-storey high wells for "A waterfall". (Berkeley directed John Garfield in "They Made Me a Criminal" after six years and had Dead End Kids singing "By a Waterfall" while they took their showers. Shanghai Lil is the best production in the picture. It's a catalog of Warner Bros.'s sensibilities. Keep in mind that African guys mingle in the scene with white and Asian prostitutes. You have never seen that blacks have been integrated into a social scene in other films of that period, except when they were portraits in a train or maid in a big house. Here the black boys sit at the bar and sing with the others. I'm also glad when the military dancers make a presentation of the book section of Roosevelt's image. There is also the ANR eagle - the logo of the controversial New Deal Recovery National Administration. The FDR was the new president and the hopes were so great that he would withdraw the nation from the Depression. You would never see this sort of thing oriented toward the working class that comes out of MGM, of course. Warner Bros. wholeheartedly supports the rise dictated by F.D.R. administration. <br /> <br /> Dear Little Miss Ruby Keeler has never been better than she playing Chinese prostitutes, Lil. She does not follow her legs while dancing, which was one of her defects. <br /> <br /> Pre-Code is fun. The "Cascade" number is great in this regard. The girls turn into swimsuits on the crowded bus, climbing through Times Square with all the lights they light up. Eagle witches swiming alongside the room offer some kind of photos that could not be seen for 35 years. In a few months, the Production Code would eliminate such naughty pleasures.
