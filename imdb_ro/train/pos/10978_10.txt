A few years ago, when I first looked at the "Gray Gardens" I remember laughing and finding the hilarious camp. A few years later I laugh aloud when I look at her, but after many views I have come to see the beauty of the strange relationship twisted between Edith Bouvier Beale and Edith Bouvier Beale. The mother and daughter living together in their 28-room restroom in East Hampton add a completely new meaning to the term "Shabby Chic." With countless cats, raccoons and opossums as roommates, this aunt and niece from Jackie O. allowed the filmmakers Albert and David Maysles to come to their mansion to film their lives day by day. The result is a hilarious, beautiful, sad and moving story of the true rule of love and anarchy. The relationship between Big and Little Edie is proof of indestructible love ties. And their life an example of leadership, determination and free will. This movie has more to recommend than to put words in. It's a rare experience you have to see. <br /> <br />
