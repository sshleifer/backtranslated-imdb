For a comedy, it has a decent and inventive plot, and Trey Parker and Matt Stone's comic timing are perfect. There are dozens of fun moments in this fantastic movie. I especially like the multitude of colors and the way in which scenes from the sports arena contradict. Robert Stacks Undetected Mysteries is also very funny.
