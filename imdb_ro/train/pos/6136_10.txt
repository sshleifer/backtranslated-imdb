I love so many buttons and bedclothes that it makes me cry a thousand tears of joy every time I have the wonderful pleasure of seeing them. I would also like to reiterate the simple fact that I love him so much. I have 27 copies on the video and I love them all equally. I also love anyone else who loves her. I love you. my favorite scene is a dance scene on the portobello road. I learned the dance movements and practiced it every day. I have some audio recordings that I sang the song. if someone can play drums or guitars, I'm thinking of forming a button and broomstick. Bandi I hope to call it "buttons". love me (liz)
