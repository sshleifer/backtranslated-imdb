it was one of those $ 50 cent of the years --- and much more complex than most --- and it was in color! not only the effects are extraordinary, instead of nonsense like "land vs. flying saucers" - the real "killer" is the "universality of the plot" - everything is based on two principles - the ancient concept of one hears the incestuous father's desire for his daughter and the idea what would happen if a world technician reaches the point where all the wishes of the citizen become manifest. It is useless to say if all those we want dead become dead, not many, if they are left - and who have become the fate of the "forbidden" planet - rather modern. Unfortunately, the "tools" of "The Krell" - lost in ignorance, remain, and "Morpheus," the incestuous father knows how to access such techniques - and makes it so that he does not lose his daughter to another. old parcel, beautifully rendered. Given his age, there remains amazing suspense, action, classical human-emotional --- and visually very modern --- it does not pass through it - we present all modern sciences and psychological content it raises beyond any kind --- a timeless work --- and soundtract! you will see / will not listen to any pure synth sound and no Moog perfect thighs --- do not miss ---
