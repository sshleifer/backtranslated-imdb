"Sky Sky" is a movie that will steal your heart, fill your mind with vivid images and lift your spirit. Homer Hickham's story and his dream of creating a rocket seem equally simple at first, especially when the film is in a mining town, where the future is as clear as the pieces of coal in the mine. But Homer can not follow his father's steps. With the encouragement of Miss Riley (friendly teacher), the staff of her father and his friends, Homer tries to make her dream come true. However, as in any true story about life, there are many stops along the way. Director Joe Johnston descends to the coal mines, where we are witnessing a cold situation of the miners who lean under a rock ceiling. With lighted helmets and bent posture, it looks more like alien insects than people in the dark. The miners' hackers and black faces have been a constant reminder of the dangers that miners have experienced in their work. In contrast to the bulk of the mining weapon, there are Homer's pictures and launch of his friend's rocket. Under the blue circle of the sky, rockets are placed on a buffer and launched into the stratosphere ... And nothing matches the scene when Homer sees Sputnik for the first time. However, what makes the movie as love is the relationship between the characters. Homer's father is a hardcore classic man ... but he also has a soft side. We see that he loves his son, despite many arguments. Miss Riley's love and support are obvious. Best of all, the movie is awkward. It does not bind everything in a beautiful arch. He tears you, he raises you. It keeps an air of reality, which is important in a movie like this one. This film can be considered a complete work. At first, I was disappointed that the film did not go on with Homer's life. I did not want it to end. Then I realized ... that's what makes a good movie to a person. If he did his job, you will not want it to end. And Sky October is doing that.
