the fact that the movie is predictable is not a problem. this movie is like a beautiful painting to enjoy. the scene of the museum is like a beautiful musical video. the apres sex scene is a very familiar scene in all our adult lives. but the movie would have no interest in me without keith gordon. keith gordon is perhaps one of the most underestimated actors of our time. almost everything I know about acting came from studying especially the eyes. had the most convincing face. his character possesses the qualities that I regard in a type, sensitivity and dedication. keith gordon is superb. BTW, I'd like to shave my beard right now, while Adam's lips, jawlines and apple were the most beautiful sets next to the eye.
