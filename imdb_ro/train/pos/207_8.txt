At first, it looked like a boring comedy, like The Odd Couple, but when I entered it turned out to be a very funny movie. Willy Clark (Oscar winner and BAFTA Walter Matthau) and Al Lewis (Oscar winner and Golden Glove nominated George Burns) were a great comedy duo and brought together to revive the hospital sketch for a TV show. Willy, Benly's nephew Ben Clark (Golden Globe winning Richard Benjamin), is confident that they can reunite without hard feelings for each other, how wrong it is. They can not always meet, both are forgotten, especially during the conversation, but they do it in the end. She also plays Lee Meredith as sketch assistant (Miss McIntosh), Carol DeLuise as Miss Doris Green, Al's daughter, Rosetta LeNoire as Odessa, Willy's assistant and Space muppets to Murray Abraham as a mechanic. I think the best line of the film is mentioning that Matthau Burns called it "a miserable boy." He was nominated for the Best Art Scene, Decoration Set and Best Screenplay, adapted from other materials, was nominated for BAFTA Best Screenplay, and won the Golden Globe Best cinematic film - musical / comedy Best script. Very good!
