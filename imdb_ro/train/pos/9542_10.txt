Do not be fooled by your loved ones, it's a sweet walk! A true successor to Tetsuo Iron Man and Ichi the Killer, this jewel starts with a bang and puts gore on the thick until the credits roll. It seems that the aliens took over the human corpses and changed them into war machines, which are then used to fight each other in a twisted game for the fun of their species. The winner of the battle eats the defeated. That's more for the plot, but who cares when the gore is good? I do not know how many buckets were used, but it's disgusting to look at it. There is an interesting and effective use of stopping the movement when taking over is in progress, and loving care is put on all creatures and makeup effects. CGI is a bit limited, but actually does not destroy the overall quality a bit, at least for me. It was really a fun and stomach movie that deserves a lot of praise and really won the place in the Cult Classics stack. Find it and watch, you will not be disappointed!
