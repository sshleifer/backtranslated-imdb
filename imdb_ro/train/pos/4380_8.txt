This is a very good movie, under-rated action / drama / and slightly historical film. The basic story relates to Rob Roy's Â£ 1000 loan, the theft and the problems he causes to his family and indirectly to his clan. Cunningham (Tim Roth) is an amazing character and character in this story. The beautiful cold and if you look at his face, he seems to have the opportunity to close his eyes and to look completely bad. Rob Roy (Liam Neeson) is also excellent, but I think writers have used the word "honor" too many times. The rest of the cast is strong, and the whole movie is very well shot and filmed. The action is exciting and sword game very realistic, but not too bad. The story is good and you really want Rob to win. All in all just shy of a classic.
