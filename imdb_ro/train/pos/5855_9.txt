If you played "Spider-Man" on PS, then you've seen everything. To really experience, you should get the DC version. Simply put on a graphically more graphic game; the textures are sharp, the levels are easy to navigate and have a much better sound, then it's the PS cousin. I bought this game back at the end of '00 and still remains until today. Well, Marvel: Ultimate Alliance is a much better and more strategic game, but if you're a fan of "Ol Web Head," then you owe it to that for the gaming library. Swinging around the city, as Spidey has never shown this good and dead-in a video game. If you have a Dreamcast, do this inexpensive. The DC version is simply incredible.
