An extraordinary, unusual Audiard movie, Read My Lips, is a heartfelt thriller. It is perfect for the beautiful grizzled charisma of Vincent Cassel and has a wonderful performance contained by Emanuelle Devos. Devos is a recurring feature of Audiard in the same way that KArin Viard appears for Jean-Pierre Jeunet: unconventionally beautiful (she is referred to by everyone as unattractive in this film), versatile and capable of a subordinate profile. <br /> <br /> This is almost the definition of her role as Carla, an office house tortured by colleagues exploiting her deafness. However, she finds an ami exploitation, if you like in the former con. Paul of Cassel. Each exploits the unconventional talents of the other (reading the theft and lips) to fight through their respective situations and to form a romantic unconventional approach. Devos / Audiard manages the deafness of Carla and his companion, worsening the interior world in a discreet and elegant sense. In this film (2001), Audiard is already clearly in control of his handling of tension, action and investment with a truly visceral experience that will become a great success - A Prophet - nine years later. 7/10
