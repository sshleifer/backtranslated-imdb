I really liked this movie. Britney is an excellent model for teenagers and should be much appreciated. This movie aims to track your dreams and never give up, no matter what people can do or tell you to discourage and criticize. Holly fulfills her dreams just like Britney. <br /> <br /> There are moments in the life of all people when people judge them for what they are not who they are. Watching this movie will make you realize that you are special in your own way and that you have to follow your dreams no matter what happens. <br /> <br /> I would like to thank Britney for encouraging me and my friends to follow our dreams. He'll never know how much this means to me. Bravo Britney. You are the best!!!
