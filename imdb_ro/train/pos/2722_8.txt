This recreation of Kansas infamous crime in 1959, based on the Capote book, is shot suddenly by Brooks and the cinema Hall in black and white, giving him a documentary sentiment. There are good performances from Blake and Wilson as killers and Forsythe as a policeman following them. The scenes that led to the murders, filmed in the real house where murder occurred, with a fluorescent wind noise, are quite intense and cold. Brooks leads with a lot of verve and uses several interesting transitions between scenes. The only complaint is that it's a little too long, dragged down and somewhat preaching.
