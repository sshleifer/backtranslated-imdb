To love you most, you have to be a) strongly in love (no marriage) b) recognize English humor that admires gallant and sorcerer's life situations and not just to be a bitch c) be smart enough, because the authors gave the opportunity to laugh and weep over every minute of this film and only if you meet the requirements "b" and "c" you can recognize and enjoy the author's contribution. d) Enjoy the film that you have to love women like Kirsted Dunst, which is so natural, sweet and irresistible. e) You have to admire creatively, a little melancholic people, with remarkable and remarkable personalities <br /> <br /> if you meet all these requirements, you probably miss this movie by almost 10 points. I never laughed half (!) As much as watching this masterpiece. And I even managed to cry while laughing at certain times (I always became sensitive whenever good things happen to Kirsten Dunst)
