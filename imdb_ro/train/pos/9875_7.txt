The presentation of Lily Mars (MGM, 1943) is a nice movie, but in my opinion it could have been better. Judy Garland is great as usual, but some scenes in the movie seem to be out of the question and the romance between her and Van Heflin is growing too fast. I mean, one minute is ready to beat his butt, but the next moment he falls in love with her. I think that this production, the editing of the film and the script (even if the photo was great, the landscape was beautiful and the costumes were beautiful as well) could have been a little better. It feels like production has been too hasty. <br /> <br /> The support distribution was also good, especially the little Janet Chapman as the second daughter's youngest daughter. At age 11, she looks really cute and it's a shame she did not develop into a teenage comic actress. She is much better in this movie than in her previous films like Warner Brothers in the late 1930s (except for Broadway Musketeers 1938, she is very good at it) when they tried to turn it into a Shirley Temple / Sybil hybrid Jason. Overall, this movie could be better, but eventually Judy gave it all.
