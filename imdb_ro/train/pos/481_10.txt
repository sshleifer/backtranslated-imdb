This is one of the unusual cases in which a movie and the novel on which they rely are both great. Perhaps because Gorris takes Nabokov's initial ideas and gives them a different interpretation, the final result is a point of view on Luzhin, who dignifies him more than Nabokov's. The only thing in the film I do not like is the influence of Valentinov on Luzhin's destiny. I can not imagine Nabokov creating a person like Valentinov and giving him such a great influence on the novel's argument.
