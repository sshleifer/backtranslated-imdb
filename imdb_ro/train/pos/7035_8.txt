Cusack does the best David Niven in this case, though I do not know if anyone outside of me noticed it. When it's seen in the mind, a delicious over-saturated "wants to be taken seriously than Austin's powers, but still be funny to reprocess an undervalued classics comedy." Hillary Duff makes a Britney Spears with the version of Mata Bond's hand dance.The writers built a reversal of Oedipus in the plot-an interesting choice.I never knew how calm Montel's voice was in this movie ... I think he found a new one Calling a Voice System!
