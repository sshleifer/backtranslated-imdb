The geniuses of William Cameron Menzies and Herbert George Wells make this extraordinary anticipation movie with ambition and hard to find action today. They predict World War II and how the UK was attacked, and the fact that the war will be followed by a space flight. Change calendar; In the film, war and space exploration are much longer, but there are so many things right from a qualitative point of view that it is amazing. We even see a helicopter (the movie is older than them). Unbelievable giant airplanes and a futuristic meritocracy for scientists who seem to be Romans with bubble helmets: if you see in these funny costumes, you can appreciate the state of artistic architecture by the masters of the 1930s, Well's vision of a rationalist society, interesting reflections on the nature of power, and John Cabal as an archetype of the adventurous and inventive human being, who chooses to shape reality and not to form it. <br /> <br /> 9 1/2 of 10. Inspiring as the ultimate monologue by John Cabal.
