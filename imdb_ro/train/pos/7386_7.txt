OK, so Oscars seem to improve a little more every year. And I got rooted for "Gosford Park" to win (come on, Robert Altman deserved an Oscar for years!). That being said, I think the time has come for an African-American to win the best actress. Unlike the previous reviewer, Halle Berry's role in Monster's Ball was much more original than that of Nicole Kidman in Moulin Rouge; I would not have thought of nominating her for anything, especially in a year that saw "Mulholland Dr.". Among the things I predicted were the stuff of September 11 attacks; I knew they would say something about freedom. Yes Yes. Robert Redford should know better. But, contrary to the previous review, Whoopi Goldberg is not the worst host (among the hosts of the past was Bob Hope, for which I have no respect); I really liked John Ashcroft's jab. So, although I did not offer the best picture "A Beautiful Mind," "The Annual Academy Awards 74" I still enjoyed (I have to admit, I like Oscars more than my birthday). And the next day, after my parents and I were walking around the houses in Bandalier, New Mexico - it was a spring break - I thought that when Jim Broadbent won his Oscar, most of the people who wanted to ask him : "Jim who?" I wonder if Woody Allen will ever come to the Oscar.
