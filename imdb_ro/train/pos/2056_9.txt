I do not think most people give this film as much credit as it deserves. I like low-budget horror movies and that's what the cake takes, especially for originality. Yes, Scarecrow is a Kung-Fu fighter, but why not? No one else is willing to go that far. We really did not have much fun watching a Candyman movie. So the city realizes that a child calls him a scarecrow, even his mother does not care about him. Then he is killed and the spirit is infused into Scarecrow, which then goes on a killing snore. His death is relatively easy to assume once the movie starts to work. Dedications from the end go directly to a lot of dire directors of horror, but with the greatest dedication to Dario Argento really impressed me that there are those people who want to make films of a newer genre. Throughout the movie they have a lot of Arnold blows with a lining, you'll surely laugh like a stick and kill the sheriff with a stick. I'd say, take a pizza on some friends and laugh at A $ off with this movie. I like it for originality, very fun.
