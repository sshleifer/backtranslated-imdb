The fact that this movie was put on a DVD formatted from TV and a fuzzy picture really bothered a lot of movie purists ... and rightly so. This deserves much better treatment. The story is about a street interpreter who needs a son to promote his job (the rules of the day) and ends up with a little girl instead (not a conventional way) .... and issues that arise later. The old man bought the child at a slave auction and soon finds out that the kid is not a boy, which he obviously thought was the case. The old "Bianlian Wang (Xu Zhu) is kind of funny, with a missing front tooth and an infectious smile, the little girl" Doggie "(Zhou Renying) is a box. The rest of the story is the way the two succeed. a bit in the last 15 minutes, it's about the complete story with drama, suspense, humor and sadness. Do not expect a good quality picture for the money you spend on DVD until it comes out on the wide screen, rent it .
