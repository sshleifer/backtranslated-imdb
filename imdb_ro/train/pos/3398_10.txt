I saw Soylent Green in 1973 when it was launched for the first time and maybe eight times over the years on TV or video. It has always been one of my favorite SF movies and / or Charlton Heston. Recently, the Egyptian theater in L.A. had a retrospective 12 film Charlton Heston. We flew from the state to see six movies for two days. Soylent Green looked great on the big Egyptian screen with a perfect new print. From its opening opening to the home scene to the big end the movie was fantastic. Charlton Heston as a policeman living in a dog eats the world of dogs with few remaining natural resources and no understanding of how the world was to be and Eddie Robinson as a man who remembers his past are both wonderful. Their chemistry together is wonderful. The film also looks much better in a great 35 mm print. Fleisher really knows how to fill the screen, the cinema, the writing, the music used and everything about it works. The film is also very strong in its bleak and very possible vision of the future. Just think about how the world's population grew, the tropical forest that has disappeared, the resources have been exhausted, the greenhouse effect has been getting worse since 1973. I wonder just why this film has not played in theaters all these years. His reputation should be better. Speaking of reputation, people often talk as though Charlton Heston is not a big actor. Seeing him in El-Cid, Soylent Green, The Warlord, Omega Man, Will Penny and Major Dundee in the back, I'm convinced he's one of our best actors. Of course he did about a dozen other great movies, and for those who care you know what they are
