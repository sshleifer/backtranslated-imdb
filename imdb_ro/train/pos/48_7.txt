I am from Belgium and therefore my writing in English is quite poor, I'm sorry for this ... This is one of those little-known movies that only play once on television and seems to disappear into thin air. I walked through my old collection of VHS Videos and I came across this title, I looked and I had an IMDb score over 7/10, pretty decent. I have to admit it's a very good thing to put together the film and that's why I'm puzzled. This is the only film made by this director ...? Why did not do a lot of movies after this good ...? Someone with so much potential should be forced to make another film, ha ha ;-) <br /> <br /> Anyway, I would really like to see that she is shooting together and making another good movie like this, please .....?
