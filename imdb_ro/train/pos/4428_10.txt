I have to totally disagree with the other comment on this movie. The visual effects complement the supernatural themes of the film and do not distract, and I liked how this movement was not like Crouching Tiger, because this time the action of the sword was not attached and most of the time you could see the action almost. <br /> <br /> I think the Western audience will be very confused with two scenes, one involving a monk trying to burn in life, and the other about the villagers who sing it is the end of the world. These scenes are derived from certain interpretations of Buddhist Buddhism in Mahayana (Mahayana Buddhism is found in China, Korea, and Japan), and the other scene deals with a clue in the Japanese calendar ... people thought the world would come to an end. Gojoe has action, story and visual to fascinate any spectator. I firmly believe that with some skillful edits, they can be sold in the U.S. One complaint is in the last battle scene (I can not give anything - sorry).
