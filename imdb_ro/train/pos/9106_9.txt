Since I first looked at it, "Piedras" is a personal favorite and one of the few pictures we could see many times. The grand scenario describes the lives of a bunch of women (all intertwined in some way) with deep understanding and sensitivity. Ramón Salazar made a compelling film in his directorial debut and proved to be an effective director of the actors. <br /> <br /> Not that all the performances are excellent. Of all the top ladies, they differ from the average (Najwa Nimri) to the very good (Vicky Peña), but the standing ovation should be directed to the new Mónica Cervera, which convincingly plays Antonia San Juan's retarded daughter. Enrique Alcides is irresistibly charming as the little girl's nurse, and there are small draws from Andrés Gertrúdix, Geli Albaladejo and the director himself, Ramón Salazar. "Piedras" is beautifully written and filmed when I saw that I moved so much that I could not think of it for days. I strongly recommend it.
