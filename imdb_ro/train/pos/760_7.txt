I have not seen this movie since the late '80s and decided to take its VHS version. The plot is very slow, and the actors seem almost robotic in this breakdance blow. Music, hip hop / freestyle artists and breakdancing scenes are what makes this movie special. Breakdancing is actually better in this movie than in "Breakin", but I have to say that "Breakin '1 & 2" carries the energy and the enthusiasm on the screen much better. It's a movie I'll keep in my library, but it's not a movie I can watch again and again, just once in a blue moon.
