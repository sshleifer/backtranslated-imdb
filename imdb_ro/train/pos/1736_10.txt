Look, it's very likely one of the best films America has to offer the rest of the world. To hate this movie is to hate freedom in itself. I remember that the early 80's was a moment of uncertainty. The economy was weak, communism threatened us all, and nuclear destruction was almost certain. From that confusion came a hero, Stroker Ace. Ned Beatty's performance in this film has shown that he will never again be portrayed as a one-dimensional victim in the wild. His triumph is a source of inspiration for all. The screening chemistry between Burt and Loni draws clear comparisons with Brad and Jennifer. Jim Nabors is a poet. Go see this movie tonight!
