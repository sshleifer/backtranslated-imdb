E! TV is a great channel and Talk Soup is so funny, in a flash you can see the change of episodes. We want funnier writing by the best writer ever Stan Evans .. The patron saint of mindless masses ... He is a truly talented writer, actor, comic, producer and director and creative consultant. Anna Nicole loves him, but he was not billionaire billionaire, so he left him for a billionaire. Many super stars wanted to make movies with actor Stan Evans, who has a "Humphrey Bogart" action style (Clark Gable). He should make more movies. Maybe with Stephen Spielberg, or perhaps many other talented producers. We want a moment of FAME with great fortune to win. Has he produced any dramaturgy? or maybe any docudrama ??? A project about Bernie Madhoff would be a great TV movie by STAN EVANS. How many scenarios did she write? Is it under his contract $$$$$$$$$$$$ billion with with with with with Disney? He should earn more than 50 million dollars ... He could also write a movie about the regret of King POP .. Michael Jackson. We want to see more of Stan Evans in movies and TV too. Thank you very much. Elvis left the building !!!!!
