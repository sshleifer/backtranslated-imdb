Actor Paxton made his directorial debut with this frozen, dark and competent thriller about a widow mechanic (Paxton himself) who threw his two sons into wilderness crimes, saying that the victims were human beings rather than "demons "and that they were selected by God to destroy these" demons ". This is said in retrospect by one of the sons, now grew up (Matthew McConaughey) to a skeptical agent of the FBI (Powers Boothe). Easy to automatically look at this movie; better than most serial killer features, is a controversial and anxious story, spelled out directly, with a minimum of cinematic films. Paxton, praiseworthy, shows no blood at all until the end. Action by everyone, especially the two actors of the child (Jeremy Sumpter from the recent "Peter Pan" and Matt O'Leary from "Spy Kids 2" and "Disturbance domestic"). The only reason I deduced all the points is that I can understand that some people can find it all hard to stomach. In any case, it's an atypical thriller with a decent screenplay. <br /> <br /> 8/10
