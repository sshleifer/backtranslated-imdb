Robin Williams and Kurt Russell play 30-year-old boys who have put their margins in jeopardy, deciding (somewhat unquestionably Russell) to resume contact with rival Bakersfield for years after doing so. Williams is ok but Russell is awesome as the legendary Taft defender Remo Hightower. Holly Palance makes a beautiful and attractive tower like Williams' wife, who could live without this rematch. The movie is worth watching just to see the renowned Remo in action. Highly recommended.
