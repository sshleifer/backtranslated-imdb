It helps a lot if someone knows the culture and the time period in which this film takes place. First of all, these ladies are NOT geisha, they are Orani (prostitutes) in the "Yoshiwara" green houses, around 1860, give or take. This should help clarify details that can be confusing to those who do not know. The film deals with issues of loyalty, love, and perhaps most importantly, how people face adversity, both their own and others, in their immediate environment. That, plus the scandalous photo, together with beautiful music, make a wonderful walk. Just plug it in, suspend your mistrust and get into their world. You will not be disappointed.
