I watched the show 10 years ago and I loved it! Now I'm in the possession of the DVD and watching the series and waiting for the scenes I knew they were in the show (when Lucas faced Gail in his house) and realized he was missing - all of a sudden I was looking at seduction without lead up. Then I went over the line to check all the BIOS of the stars and over the comments about the unusual shows. Thank you!!!!! But there seems to be a conflict. Several comments state "Strangler 19, then Triangle 20, when another has around the other." Also, Potato Boy 5 and Dead to the World 6 were also reversed.
