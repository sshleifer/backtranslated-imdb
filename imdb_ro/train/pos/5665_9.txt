They've had me since the first show. Welcome to Trinity County. A sleepy place, like Mayberry, with a slight difference. The sheriff is really Satan. It's the spoiler. Not as if you did not realize it in 10 minutes anyway. Oh, but that's not all. It seems Satan has a son named Caleb. Some people try to keep it well, but it's a mad battle. Shepherd Buck (Satan) knows who Caleb is and likes to spend time with him, learning the ways of darkness. Subtle. Sneaky. He does not always come as evil. He is often a hero. Everyone owes a great favor, because it often triggers a misfortune and saves them. So, every time you think someone will finally take him, one of his friends will come out of nowhere to sabotage him. In one of my favorite episodes, Lucas and Caleb came out into the woods in a cabin, and some boys with weapons have decided to rob them. Lucas used it as an excuse to teach Caleb a lesson about evil. The thief (Ted) was hesitant to shoot them. Lucas told Caleb that Ted had half consciousness. If he had no conscience, he would have shot them so far. If he had a real consciousness, he would never have become a killer. So he started calling him Half-Ted. It was pretty funny. He held criminals. And, of course, he was 10 steps ahead of Half-Ted at any time. And, of course, it was totally under control. In fact, they have favored Satan. it was one of my favorite horror shows of all time.
