In one of her first films, Romy Schneider shines as Queen Victoria Brittany, being suddenly placed on the throne at the age of 18, learning to govern despite the politicians' makeup and eventually telling and marrying the prince Albert of Saxony. Kitschy and campy (though surprisingly true to true events), this romantic piece is irresistible. Seeing this movie about British royal speakers in German adds his strange charm. In this respect, he wonders why an Austrian film about an English queen was made; but then it is reminded that in 1954 Austria was still occupied by allied troops, including the British ones. Perhaps this was one of the reasons for this film.
