Reed Hadley makes Don Diego better than Zorro, but this is coming to an end because this series has the best theme song of any series - the best version of the famous screenwriter Yakima Canutt tour. There are other good waterfalls and plenty of action and a lot of end-cap head traps, but if for no other reason, you have to watch this movie to watch the scene cascade, then re-watch it in slow movement. It's incredible, and despite the limited budget for this chapter, Yak is better off on stunts than he did in the much-celebrated "Stagecoach" movie. Indiana Jones, eat heart out: This is the real deal!
