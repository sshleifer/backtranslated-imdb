Documents of this kind are often very convincing. This movie seems to take all of the opinions and let the viewer decide what to do with the information provided. It's sad conditions for these poor people to work, this movie has a great job to show the ugly side of sweat shops. The Mardi Gras movie: Made in China was a good way to show the world how something as wonderful as beads for a holiday can affect the lives of so many people in another country. I had to watch this movie for an English class where we spent time talking about sweat shops and how some people are trying to eliminate them and this movie helped run the topic. It was a wonderful, very informative film and I would recommend anyone to see it, it opens your eyes.
