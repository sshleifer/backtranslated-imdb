This is just the best movie of all time! I'm sorry, Hollywood! I saw it in the early 70's as soon as it appeared on Bulgarian television and I liked it right away (then I was 14). 25 years later I bought her on a video tape and a few months ago she finally appeared on a DVD here in Bulgaria. I live with this movie 35 years ago, so do my friends and my family. My son was a teenager when he saw her for the first time and loved her immediately (and this is the generation that grew up in the practical viewing of Hollywood movies and did not speak or understand Russian at all!). What makes this Danelia masterpiece so special? It's hard to say, because it's difficult to describe what beauty is ... But the fact is you can watch this movie dozens of times with the same pleasure as the first time. I do not remember any other film of this kind, no matter how many millions have cost or how big the distribution has been ... Chapeau, Maestro Danelia! Bulgaria loves you!
