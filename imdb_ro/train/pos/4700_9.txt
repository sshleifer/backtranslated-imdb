I could not believe the rating was down 5.6 on IMDb about Johnny Dangerously when I wrote this review and I thought I had to do something to promote this memorable comedy as much as I can. Seriously, to get such a low rating, those who voted must have a limited sense of humor, not to mention a very little mind. If you do not like the humorous moves, you do not follow them! Combining the absurd humor, a very good story and a special rhythm given by the multiple gangs running, this movie turned into my DVD collection. And that is without mentioning the visual phrases embedded here and there and, of course, the use of "cli d'oeils" and "cliques" based on our favorite films of organized crime. <br /> <br /> I showed this movie to a lot of people and, being introduced without specific expectations (except for watching a comedy) - even the mood you should look at any movie in my opinion - everyone liked them very much. It goes well, there is not much time to watch and there is absolutely no slowdown in the evolution of the story, which I think is really simple. Of course it's not perfect, some gags are short, but no movie is perfect, especially when you consider other opinions like yours. That's why I rated this movie 9 out of 10. This movie is, in my opinion, a precursor like "Top Secret" and "Spaceballs" in the field of absurd but well-thoughtful comedies. Which are today more and more absurd, while reducing the appearance of thought and ingenuity. Sometimes gags need more culture than a lot of people imagine to be correctly understood, if not at all. As a last word, I would like to say: watch yourself, do not follow Joe's adage and if you do not like it then you will know it was not good for your tastes, which is easy to understand, but a little bit probably in my opinion.
