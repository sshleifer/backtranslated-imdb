I see a lot of people on this site wanting AG would come to DVD. Well, I bought it on DVD. (From the borders, no less!) Although it's great to have this extraordinary show in a DVD form in the box, I'm upset that they added very little in "extra" (A Shaun Cassidy's Episode pilot and episodes are displayed in the same order they were displayed on TV Missed episodes that were not shown before running on the Sci Fi channel are in the box but attached to the final DVD If you buy the set DVD, get the real order you're going to view and you'll be happier. (You'll have to change the DVDs to and from the player to see them in order but you'll be glad you did.) <Br / > <br />
