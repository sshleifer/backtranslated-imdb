After an anonymous call to a space ship that had collapsed in a frozen wood, two police officers found evidence that the event had happened and that a Martian seemed to have gone from there. He heads to the nearby Hi-Way Caf√© and finds a bus stop and seven passengers waiting for the reopening of a snow in the attic. However, the driver says he only had six passengers when he parked the bus. While interrogating travelers, strange things happen in the house, with start and stop lights and turntable on and off. When passengers are released and the bus travels, a passenger returns to the house and reveals a plot of invasion of the Earth. "Will the real Martian please lift you?" is one of the best episodes in this great series. The fascinating story has ironic and moody dialogues, funny characters and situations and a surprising and utterly unexpected plotting point all the way to the end. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Marciano" ("The Martian")
