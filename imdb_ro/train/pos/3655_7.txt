De Sica becomes one of my favorite directors, but it was a hit-and-miss for me. A young laughing idiot becomes the leader of a community of illegal settlers in a deserted area outside Milan. It is a detailed and brilliant story of the poor innocent mass, supplemented with wicked capitalists and police forces that trigger happiness, but slowly evolving into a magical fantasy story, as the miracle boy Toto develops unlimited superpower. I had it here, with the god who always smiled in 10 minutes, and when the magic took her, I was left in the dust. There were so many wonderful orchestrated photos, so many good colonial figures that I thought it was a loss, the film was not more serious with its material. The coupling of neorealism and fantasy is more like an experiment of the "look-what-can-do-mom" experience than a fully developed piece of work / art.
