Generally, this movie has been great for its time and will be exciting for many generations to come. Although the plot is not 100% correct for the book, everything is correct. The film just overcomes some important parts. I found the book and I immediately thought they made a movie (because I did not find the movie yet), but later I found the film in a Wal-Mart luggage basket and I decided to buy it and see if it was what I expected. Generally, I give the 7 out of 10 movies for her good tracks (relative accuracy and general sense) and for her bad pieces (big and high but overt, but visible but inaccuracy).
