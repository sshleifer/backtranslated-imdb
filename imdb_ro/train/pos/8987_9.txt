I recently rented this doc, reminding me that I heard about it from IMDb.com and I was intrigued by the premise. We knew very little about any of these troops, but I remember hearing long ago the hearings "Not if you were the last stab on earth" and they liked it. That being said, this is my perspective on the doc: One thing I found incredible about this movie is that you do not need to have any prior knowledge of any of these bands. The director (Ondi Timoner) does not waste any time engaging the audience and getting acquainted with the people in this movie. I became quickly attracted to both Anthony and Courtney, as well as their respective bands, The Brian Jonestown Massacre and The Dandy Warhols. I think it's part of what makes this doc so good and what makes Ondi Timoner such a lecturer. I also liked the story of these bands. Most of what you see is touring troops. Both bands start to play small locations and strive to do it in the record industry. Throughout the film, each tape strives to remain unique and uncontrolled. However, this makes the two bands to be similar and therefore a brilliant perspective on how two feather bands can go in so different directions. In principle, I would recommend this to anyone who loves the movie in general. You do not have to have a special love for documentary or any of the bands. An appreciation for music helps, but music itself has a backseat to the love / hate relationship between the massacre of Brian Jonestown and The Dandy Warhols.
