The first time I saw this episode was like a shock to me, it was actually the first time I saw "24". The speed things that are happening are amazing and are so surprising, thrilling and even exciting, almost like reading a book; once you turn it on, it's really hard to stop. From the moment Richard Walsh spoke privately with Jack about the possibility of having a mole inside the CTU, I would sit at 6:40, which means 10 episodes !!! (It sounds funny and crazy, but I'm the type guy who, when interested, can not stop) This series is one of the best of its kind. And it's built in a way to have some different stories that are tied together. Recommended in any way!
