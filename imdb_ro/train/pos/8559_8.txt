There is a certain genius behind this movie. We laughed all the way. The scene in the phone office phone, talking about how love heals the doppelganger, was a beautiful attempt at this genius / humor. Execution is poor, but you can see the writer's message and they have a talent. The sin of the doppelganger was like ... "ok, did not expect much, but let's see what the film has to say." Of course, ridiculous, but a sweet idea and, in fact, very consistent with the story in a strange way. Does the point of a movie be logical or should it be fun or communicated at an emotional level? I've been bored with many movies, but that has kept my interest all the time. I think the story may have some self-biographical roots, but that's just a guess. Very bad, but good. He searched for other movies that this person made (with more experience).
