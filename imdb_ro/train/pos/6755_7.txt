Ah, noir. My favorite genre. Otto Preminger's pursuit of Laura is a New York post-war film where corruption and violence unfold. Her name is Dana Andrews as sergeant Mark Dixon, a detective whose brutal tactics landed him in hot water with his superiors. <br /> <br /> When he accidentally kills a murder suspect, Dixon tries to blame Tommy Scalese. Dixon is almost attaining his goal when he engages in the dead wife, beautiful Morgan Taylor. Of course, in typical noir ways, things go fast down the hill. While the movie does nothing interesting about the room or wise narrative, it has a constant tone of horror and darkness. Just like the biggest novels, it is also a wonderful rhythm, under the viewer right from the start. However, like most of Preminger's work movies, it's not something I'm looking at again. He does not lack Wilder's verbal spirit, Hitchcock's visual flamboyance, or Welles space experimentation. Like Lang's work, "Sidewalk" feels a lot like a "clone" of what should be a noir, instead of something truly authentic from an artistic point of view. <br /> <br /> Tematic film is nothing special. This is a policeman who is slowly finding himself a killer. In a scene, Dixon explains that his father himself was a little scammer, the movie flirling with the notion of predestination, but this scene is up to Otto, or he dares to take his ideas. Working with the room is also disappointing. There is no information in Otto's room. No effort is made to assign anything to the camera. It does not play with space or architecture or empowers procedural procedural step by step. It's just tripod sets with occasional entry and exit. It does not make sense, although most people do not care about these things. <br /> <br /> There is, however, one good shot where our hero is trapped in a gangster car (noir cage), which itself enters a lift (another cage) and is taken in the main lutein gangster. Like Lynch's "Blue Velvet," Otto retopologizes the film, constantly resembling "upward" to hell. This works well, but the design of the set fails to reinforce it. <br /> <br /> 7/10 - Otto seems pleased to follow the Hawksian mold of what is noir, rather than a toy with the possibilities of where the noir can go. Like "Detour", "Night in the City", "Scarlet Street", "In a Lonely Place", "Act of Violence", "Bomberang" and "Johnny Eager" made secondary film noir. He is competent and engaged, but he does not have that special extra magic.
