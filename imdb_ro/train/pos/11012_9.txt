I was not sure at first when I was watching a documentary, a propaganda film, or a dramatic presentation. I think, given the production time, it was a mixture of all three. Of course, the plot was somewhat predictable. But you had the feeling that there would be interesting scenes as the movie continued. We were able to see what seemed to be realist training regimes and equipment. Where this movie came together for me was closer to the end of the year. The scenes had a realism (at least as I perceived it) that I have not met before. You could sit in action and imagine the thoughts of young combatants. This has been mixed with the usual portrayal of acceptable Japanese soldiers at a time when you might think that the real Japanese actors would be somewhat few. The film is excellent as a source of the state of the American mentality in 1943 as a war waged with Japan. Also, the interest has been a Japanese excavation on US aid in recent years.
