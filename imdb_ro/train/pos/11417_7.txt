This movie impressed me as a project that had many suitable ingredients but somewhere along the way they did not gather at all. I do not know who did it, but she has a simple Disney sense. While parts of it are unlikely (such as when a pre-adolescent is running for a public office) and tend to prevent the story from being taken seriously, there is a healthy dose of normality (no matter what) to maintain things balanced and in perspective. The actor is all right. Strange, the relationship between Frankie and her grandmother is convincing, but the relationship between Hazel and Frankie is a bit ... stopped. It's interesting to see how hard it has to work to keep a balance between her best friend, her grandmother and her two passions: ballet and baseball. Being a baseball player himself, it was quite painful to see Frankie trying to keep on a team of boys, but he has a good job of showing the fight he's facing. I read somewhere that she is not really a ballerina, but editing in this movie has done a great job of making her dance look not only natural but also beautiful. Overall, it was a good film about honesty and ambition, but Mischa Barton's mysterious failed to reach the level of realism I've seen in his "Lost and Delirious" Haley Joel Osment in "Sentiment 6".
