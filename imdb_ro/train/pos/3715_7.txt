Okay, that's a pretty small number, but I can not believe I've seen it before. It reminds me of another VCA movie I've seen in Poitier, called "OTHER DAYS OF RUBIE RAE". They also had traces of "Welcome to the Dollhouse" and "Ratcatcher" and Lynne Ramsay in his performance. Which does not mean they are not tasty references ... just that they feel very modern and very fashionable ... which makes me feel that it is closer to advertising (as a style and story approach) than the work of an original author and authentic to come. Cinema is just ... too perfect for my pleasure. Filter too coral (or charcoal) because I like ... too 12mm tilted. Therefore, the whole impression left me a little distance - pay attention to the art that is proclaimed too easily! The French (they are a bunch of conservatives) seemed to buy it, just like the jury did ... but the selection of Cannes is a notorious conservative compared to the selection of its features, although I wonder what's going on in recent years.
