After these years, I think this series is the best example of the documentary film during the Second World War. Interviews with many participants from all countries have put this out of any other project. It would be great to see a contemporary documentary (Ken Burns?) To deal with this subject and try to gather information from the veterans before they leave. With state-of-the-art technology to improve old archive imagery and the wealth of information that has been discovered since 1974 when The World At War was produced, an updated version of this series would be welcome. The Historical Channel has made some beautiful shows dealing with many aspects of the Second World War, but an expansive series such as World At War has not been tried successfully from the beginning. If you are interested in this era, do not miss this series. Viewing is required.
