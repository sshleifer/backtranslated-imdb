This is actually a groovy-groomed little movie, made on absolutely no budget discernable with shot on video crinkliness. It takes a little time to warm up. The act is so bad that it soon becomes a zen-like charm. After a few scenarios, stop seeing the awkward lines or the repeated sound of some deliveries. The characters develop a strange charm, especially "Richard". Look at Anthony Hopkins, Maidens is the guy I'm gonna hire to play a raving psychopath. He seems to enjoy so much of it! Shuffled with mischievous infestation scenes and zombies are some truly effective visuals of the title character, "The Skater Midnight," rising through the campus into a black box, looking everybody like a cross between Grim Reaper and, for example, Silver Surfer. These photos make sometimes ridiculous things the characters tell about Skater seem to be almost ominous. The soundtrack has some very fun tunes for Garage-Punk, and the horrible malice fits well with the movie's mood. Thumbs upish, say.
