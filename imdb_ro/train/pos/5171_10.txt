If I could go back, even as an adult, and relive the days spent at my summer camp, I would be there so fast. The camps I went to were not that great. They were in Texas where mosquitoes wore men, but we had horses and fishing. Cinematographic cinematography was amazing, fun and credible characters, especially Perkins, Pollack, and Arkin. The character and subantic of Sam Raimi were invaluable. So whoever ever thought this movie was a blade ... I'm sorry for me because I can not stop my unbelief enough to imagine the camp again as an adult or have never been like kids. The whole idea was that these people had the opportunity to regress and become juveniles again, so they did it on every occasion. I wish I could. It was funny, intelligent, beautiful, very brilliant scriptures, and the artist takes me back, so I want to keep track of it even for the landscape. Sort of Wolves Dances and LadyHawk ... good movies, but the wildness becomes a character as much as the actors. Hire it, see it, buy it and watch it all the time ... it never ages. ; 0)
