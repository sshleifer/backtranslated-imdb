I will not go into too much detail about the plot of this movie, as other reviewers have covered almost the same reason. I just wanted to say that I enjoyed the movie very much. Peter Falk's performance is a good reason to watch the movie. A short travel film with Falk & Paul Reiser in the last NY in autumn is the most important film. Very well written with an adult target audience in mind. A lot of humor based on reality and a good drama give the film the feeling that it could be your own family. Really can not say enough about this movie, except that it's a shame that a wonderful movie like this does not get more exposure while other junk no trashy out there. It's great to see Falk play a big part of the human role again and he does the most of it. It turns out that his famous friend, writer / director John Casavettes was right to distribute Falk in many of his core films from the 1960s and 1970s.
