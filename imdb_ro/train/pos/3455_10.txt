Steven Spielberg (24 years old) has already directed two gorgeous episodes from a 1971 series called The Psychiatrist with Roy Thinnes. One episode was about a 12-year-old boy emotionally troubled, and the other about a vibrant young man (Clu Gulager in the best interpretation) who had died of cancer. Both episodes were amazing, visual, unlike anything else on television, and the emotional and adult complex. The creators of the "Psychiatrist" were Richard Levinson and William Link, who created "Columbo" and also produced his first season. Peter Falk insisted first-time television directors for the first season of "Columbo", such as Bernard Kowalski and Jack Smight. But Falk agreed with Spielberg after watching a part of Clu Gulagher's episode of "The Psychiatrist." Spielberg tells Duel that he loved Steven Bochco's "Murder by the Book" on a story about Levinson / Link) and tried to make production look like a one million dollar feature, even if he thought he had far less money to work with him. This episode of "Columbo" is far more stylish and makes better use of audio and background music than almost any other "Columbo" episode, even though the series has always used top executives. Spielberg manages to keep Big Falk and Cassidy not to hit him too much, but both actors are still very entertaining. Spielberg also receives fine support from Martin Milner, Rosemary Forsyth and Barbara Colby. All shows have a freshness and vitality in relation to them. The only "Columbo" episode that was nearly as well directed was the episode "By Dawn's Early Light" by Patrick McGoohan (directed by Harvey Hart). I think the two episodes of "The Psychiatrist" and this episode of "Columbo" suggest that Spielberg has not developed as technically as a director. It was great from the beginning. In a "fight!" The 1962 episode's guest commentary by Albert Salmi, Robert Altman, says the episode was as good as the one he had ever been as a director. Perhaps the same is true of Spielberg.
