Maybe it's just because I have an intense fear of hospitals and medical stuff, but it has fallen under my skin (forgive the game). This piece is courageous, not afraid to go over and as satisfying as it comes to revenge movies. Not only did I feel satisfied with the screwdriver hatred and a lot of sympathy for the screwdriver, I felt terrified and felt the pain of disgust at certain moments that is indeed a rare and delightful thing for a terrific viewer of horror myself. Some parts are very reminiscent of "Hellraiser," but they are rather tribute than imitation. It's a hard-to-handle piece that does not give the viewer much to consider, but I like to be attacked by a movie once and for all. This piece brings and does not apologize. I liked very much. Do not look as you eat pudding.
