When I first saw the movie, I thought it was the typical "Love your neighbor" thing ... The more the movie unfolded, the more I got involved. The actor is magnificent from both actors, the direction was wonderful, the unusual story. I stopped my eyes, the first time in my life for a movie. A real must have in any serious videotape. 11 of 10
