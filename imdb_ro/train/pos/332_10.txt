Although I have not seen this mini-series in more than twenty years, I still remember how the balance of character, plot, and the story of wonderful adventures has succeeded. The use of special effects has been restricted by making a more poetical story than literal storytelling. The two variants I've seen have been called (English and French), but the actors seem to speak their language not just Italian, so there is a synchronization problem. It does not destroy the story. Among Irene Pappas cast as Penelope is the most recognized for North Americans. Recommended for all Odysseus' descendants who ever returned.
