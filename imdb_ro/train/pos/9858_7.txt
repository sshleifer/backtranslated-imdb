I would not go so far as not to recommend this movie because the only problems I've had with it are due to overexposure to the plot devices used in the movie - things common to every ever-made children's movie. That does not hurt, not just something that goes far. It's a little sugary, so I can say that for the most part, anyone looking for something with a little more wisdom is disappointed in a film that is obvious to children like this one. However, all of this goes out of the window when the squirrel (that of all trailers) comes to the screen. His time is limited, but it seems obvious that the decision-makers had the wisdom to tell these heres that you could stay in a bigger squirrel? every time it gets boring. That does not save the movie, but you can say "at least there was one thing I can not laugh anymore." Of course, visually you will not disappoint, but that's almost with Pixar filming. Of all things, I'd put this down ... but that's not bad in itself.
