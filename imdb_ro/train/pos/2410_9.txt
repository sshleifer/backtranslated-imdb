This movie is one of the most challenging movies of Jesus I've ever seen. He does not seek to tell the whole story, but merely to present an interpretative expression of the last day of Jesus Christ. It is full of witchcraft, playful and seriously faithful to the elements of Jewish tradition and modern scriptural interpretation. Judas is much more common than other portraits, not the dark and sinister evil we sometimes imagine, but a wrong, erroneously wrong man in his zeal. Jesus Saranden's Jesus is playful and earnest, faithful and determined - very human and at the same time divine. The final dialogue is thought and serves as a kind of tiny speech that two powerful men can do when they have just committed an atrocity. I would watch this movie and recommend it to others.
