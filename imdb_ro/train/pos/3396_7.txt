Interesting. The big tower was not such a big shock that they hoped and it was very dated, but it made me mind to work. I was really thinking of a world without vegetation or livestock and made me appreciate the world I live in much more. Charlton Heston does a good job, like all the supporting characters, and it was a very realistic movie that was surprising. The lack of direction and a lot of settings and backgrounds needed more explanation, but it was still a surprisingly good and intelligent film. The main mistake I could find was that I did not want to end the movie when it was, I would love to see what happened next.
