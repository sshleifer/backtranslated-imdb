This pleated and rocky film constantly offers. It is one of Frankenheimer's best and most underestimated films and is easily the best adaptation of Elmore Leonard so far (and if you scratched your head thinking "but I liked GET SHORTY" you have to be perforated in front of). In my opinion, no one captures the "feeling" of Leonard's characters better than John Glover in 52 PICK-UP. The relocation of the Detroit story to Hollywood (the film) raises the faint factor of the story at stunning heights. Be a man, have a few beers and watch this movie. For reference purposes, my favorite Leonard books are: Swag, Rum Punch, Cat Chaser, City Primeval and 52 Pick-Up. My favorite Frankenheimer films include SECONDS and MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE. I also have a special place in my cool movie for DEAD BANG and BLACK Sunday.
