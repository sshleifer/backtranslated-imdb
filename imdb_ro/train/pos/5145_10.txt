<br /> <br /> An old man works as a guard in a mental hospital to be close to his wife who is patient there and try to take her out. one of the most forgotten masterpieces of the silent era and a strange story in the history of Japanese cinema. Long thought has been lost, a fingerprint was discovered in the '70s and an added musical soundtrack that fits perfectly with the images. It could have been influenced by Dr. Caligary's office (director Kinugasa claimed he did not see the German film). Nevertheless, she overcame her style and her convincing (and cold) image of the inner mental state of asylum-seekers. To do this, the film uses every film technique available at that time: multiple exposures and subjective focal points, angled room angles, fast and slow motion, expressionist lighting, and overlapping among others. It's also a very complicated movie to follow because it has no interference. The film opens with a rain mount that hits the windows of the hospital, winding trembling trees and thunder. The cloudy weather metaphors the mental state of the patients and introduces one of them: the former dancer. The combination of sounds produced by rain, wind and thunder serve as music that incites the dancer to enter into a frenetic, almost hypnotic dance. In another sequence involving the same patient engaged in another frenetic dance, she is followed by other detainees. The multiple exposures of the dancer represent the view of the patients and their confusing view of the world. These are just two examples of this amazing film that tries to represent the subconscious of patients and the view of the "sane" world. <br /> <br /> With three words you have to see.
