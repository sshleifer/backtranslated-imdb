Very blurred but complex and finally very moving. A beautiful and very real look at the life of a small beach town in Florida in winter - I was there and it is absolutely accurate. It is also the debut of actress Ashley Judd, and she makes a great impression here. It's hard to believe that this movie is 12 years old - I remember seeing it in theaters and recently renting "Ruby" again. Except for those in the 1980s, he kept it very well. Ashely is so radiant and emotional here that it's hard to think of her later career without being victorious. Boys, you talk about failing to fulfill your promise! Anyone who sees Ashley here in "Ruby In Paradise" would suppose that this elegant, natural beauty went to all sorts of interesting art movies and to act seriously - instead, she became a "girlfriend" for fake action movies and slasher movies! Very disappointing, but at least we have kept this wonderful performance to expose our promise early. As some commentators say, this is not for everyone because it is very slow. This is not an action movie, nor is it a love story. The director (Victor Nunez, "Ulees Gold," another excellent character study) treats the life of the average young man with deep respect, allowing his story to build slowly and with much detail. In this way, I think this is one of the most exciting and respectful stories about young women I can recall - not about Ruby's sexual awakening or "how she lost virginity," but about her choices of life and maturity in increase. A great movie if you take the time to see it ... I think it would be a great movie to show teenagers and young girls (or boys for that) and give them a chance to think and talk. Kudos especially director Nunez, who also wrote the script, which is so realistic and beautifully detailed that I assumed everything through the film based on a written novel or female memorial, but in fact is the original work of Mr. Nunez. Rated 8 out of 10.
