I thought this movie did a good job. It was not as creative or original as the first one, but it was supposed to be. It was a whole lot of fun. the more I think about it, the more I like it, and when it comes out on DVD I'll pay the money for her very proud, every cent cent. Sharon Stone is great, she's always, even if her movie is horrible (Catwoman), but this movie is not, this is one of those films that will be underestimated for her entire life and will probably become a classic in 20 years. Do not expect to be a classic, watch it now and enjoy it. Do not expect a masterpiece or something that bends and touches the soul, just let yourself get out of your life and get involved in them. Generally, this movie is fun and I recommend people who have not seen her see it, because what critics and box office say does not always matter, see it for you, you never know, you could enjoy it. I put my hat in this 8/10 movie
