First, I'm not Justin Timberlake skirt obsessed to make it look good, actually I'm not even a huge fan of Justin, but I liked this movie. I'm working on a movie when I saw this movie with a huge cast that I did not even hear that I had to see what it was about. I did not realize that Justin's actress was so bad, obviously it was the worst in the group, but it's a pretty impressive group, Cary Elwes and Dylan McDermott being two names that did not even make the first list of credits. The story is basic, a journalist who discovers the corrupt policemen, but I found it well done. L L The character of Cool J was clearly the opposite, but I honestly did not know what he would do in the end. Morgan Freeman is like always, the wise wise figure he does so well, and as much as I love Kevin SPacey, it was kind of like that. The HIs character did not have a lot of substance, but it's Kevin Spacey, he can not do any harm. Surprisingly, I thought Dylan McDermott gave the best performance as a homicide cop. Really credible and indeed in character, he scared me a few times. I was really expecting a lot of joy to be honest. Horrible capture phrases, unwarranted action sequences, stuff like that, but it was surprisingly well done and we did not find anything out of it. Each film had a point, it was not a clich√©, it was quite solid indeed. In general, amazing casting, a decent story that interested me and just enough action to make me jump. I do not know why it does not show up in theaters, it was better than garbage on the big screen. I'd say it's worth seeing.
