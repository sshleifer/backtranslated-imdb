On October 24, 1955, Hadley Oil geologist Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) meets executive secretary Lucy Moore (Lauren Bacall) in the office of her chief Bill Ryan in New York and invites her to a conference with alcoholic playboy and son of a magnat Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack). On the way to the meeting, he confesses that they have traveled from Houston to New York to meet Kyle, who is his best childhood boyfriend, to eat a sandwich from club 21, and the encounter was just a pretext to the father Kyle, Jasper Hadley (Robert Keith). Mitch and Kyle immediately fall in love with Lucy, and Kyle effortlessly uses her money to impress Lucy; then he opens his heart and proposes to Lucy. They marry and travel to Acapulco, and Kyle makes sure he stops drinking. Meanwhile, Kyle Marylee's sister (Dorothy Malone) is a light woman and has an inappropriate passion for Mitch to see her as a sister. A year later, Kyle discovers that he has a problem and can be sterile and starts drinking again. Marylee's worry poison Kyle telling him that his wife and Mitch have a love affair. When Lucy discovers she is pregnant, Kyle thinks the child belongs to Mitch, and his distrust leads to a tragedy. <br /> <br /> "Written on the Wind" is an overestimated melodramatic soap opera with characters and artificial situations. There are at least two great movie characters with drinking related characters: "The Lost Weekend" (1945) with the amazing Ray Milland and "Wine and Roses Days" (1962), with Jack Lemmon's great performance. Robert Stack has a reasonable performance and the motives of his drinking character are superficial and clich√©. Finally, the memorable "Written on the Wind" is fun and is not an Oscar-nominated feature. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Palavras ao Vento" ("Words in the Wind")
