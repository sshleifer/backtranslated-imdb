John Boorman's "Deliverance" refers to four suburban inhabitants of Atlanta heading for the rapids of Cahulawassee? The river is about to disappear for a construction of the dam and for flooding the last non-taxable stretches of land? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The four friends point out different characters: a passionate sportsman who has never been assured in his life because there is no specific risk in him (Burt Reynolds); a passionate family man and a guitarist (Ronny Cox); an overweight seller (Ned Beatty); and a man married and quiet, with a son who loves to smoke his pipe (Jon Voight). What follows is the night exploration of men against hostile violence of nature? Is it also an ideal code of moral principle about civilized people who fall prey to the dark laws of the wilderness? <br /> <br /> Super-shot, this adult-filled adventure surely definitely contains really exciting scenes?
