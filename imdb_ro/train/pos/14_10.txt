This movie has a special place in my heart, as when I first caught it, I learned adult literacy. It was very true to me and even to a remarkable student I had at the time. There are scenes that make you enjoy sudden emotions, and those that make you even a smile on the face by simply identifying with their characters and their situation. The excellent performances of Jane Fonda and Robert DeNiro, who fit into the best work, a great return by a young Martha Plimpton, an inspiring story line and a musical score that provokes torture, makes a pleasant and rewarding experience.
