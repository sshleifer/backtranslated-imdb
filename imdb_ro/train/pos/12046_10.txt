There is nothing frightening about modern "horror," which is an insult to the word "horror". Freddie Vs Jason, Scream, Shooting, and especially Stephen King's infant trials - recycled every story of The Monkey's Paw to anything, often in the same story - horrifying both in writing and on movie (except the Kubrick's Shining version, which was actually scary, unlike King's books, which are as frightening as the big thumb - the left one with the nail.) But The Woman In Black is the modern movie that will makes the wires on the back of the neck come to an end. This must be done, the director creates tension, and the most frightening phantom ever seen simply by the fact that he suddenly raises it, standing somewhere or the other, with (Lewton) and Robert Wise (a disciple of Val Lewton and director of Haunting and The Body), he learned lessons from masters who knew how to do horror - Val Lewton Snatc Jacques Tou rnier (another disciple of Val Lewton who directed a really horrible zombie film, not the rough groom made by Raimi (thick is not scary, good people, it is rude), and Lewis Allen (The Uninvited) and, of course, Jack Clayton James Innocent and the way the master of suspense, Hitchcock, can still bring you to the edge of the chair, even with a slow building and burning piece, like Under Capricorn. TEN STARS ...
