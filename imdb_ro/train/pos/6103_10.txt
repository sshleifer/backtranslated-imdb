I have recently seen the film during the Boston Film Festival. The movie was very fun and is something that the world thinks, and black America is ready to see. It has comedy, drama, the soundtrack is great. It's a good movie everywhere. The characters have been well developed and the film has had a wide variety of prominent actors such as Wood Harris, Brian J. White (Trois 3, Mr 3000) and the wonderful Zoe Saldana, Pirates of the Caribbean). The film addresses many relevant topics in contemporary society in a short period of time and makes it with class and grace. This is not just a story about hospital life, it is a story about people and their personal journey to discover who they are or who they are.
