I understand that Paramount wanted to film this with Rodgers and Hart, but could not solve copyright issues, so Burke and Van Heusen, who wrote the most songs for Bing Crosby, scored a score very good. > <br /> I read Leonard Maltin saying that this movie, "matches Crosby like a glove," and I could not make it better. No, it's not Mark Twain's satire, it's a Bing Crosby movie, and in 1949 Crosby was the most banal Hollywood star. Once Paramount used technically and Rhonda Fleming was never more beautiful on the screen. This was a woman for whom the technicolor was invented. Brooklyn's origins from William Bendix are remarkable, but it's a comic effect. The trio of Crosby, Bendix and Sir Cedric Hardwicke have a good time with Nimic Occupied. Bing has one of his pioneering philosophical numbers, "If You Stub Your Toe On The Moon." The third song she sings once and always for herself and Rhonda Fleming. This song was nominated for the best song but was lost at Baby It's Cold Outside. <br /> <br /> Also nice that Bing managed to score Decca with Rhonda Fleming and Bendix and Hardwicke. One thing I love about this movie is that it shows Crosby's comic talents without Bob Hope. I like the pictures on the road, but Bing was a comic tale on himself, and this film proves better than any other. This is Crosby at the top of his game.
