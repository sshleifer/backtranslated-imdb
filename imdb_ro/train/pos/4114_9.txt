The title of this movie does not make much sense until you see it in operation, because it is the sound a young man makes late while operating his imaginary cart, what he does all day. And it is just one of the many strange characters in this surreal and sometimes tragic story of a group of inhabitants in the neighborhoods of Japan. There are two drunkards who change their wives, there is a man with aspirations to be an architect, and his little son whom he sends to ask for food. There is a wise old man who seems to be the pillar of health in everything that happens around him and there is a businessman with severe nervous tics who have a wife who treats him (and anyone else) as dirt. <br /> <br /> There is no special plot for this, indeed there is a bunch of stories that move back and forth between them, sometimes funny, sometimes tragic. Overall, I thought it worked pretty well and I've been dying to see this for a long time just on the basis of its description. I was not at least disappointed and I would certainly recommend this. 9 of 10.
