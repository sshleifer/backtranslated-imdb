I loved it wonderfully ... I would like to have followed this documentary to watch the lives of some and to celebrate the lives of others lost ... there should be a second part ... a real one. It was great .. the movie was not long enough .. I would like to know why the creator of the movie did not follow! this is so important for the community period .. even if you read this please consider doing another documentary of its kind ... I am really tired of hearing from naive writers how AIDS and men go together when they do not; in fact, the hero that we have to look for ... this movie did not even bother to mention HIV or AIDS and I was so happy about it. I really appreciated the breakdowns and definitions. Thank you very much for allowing this movie to exist.
