Meryl Streep was incredible in this movie. She has an amazing talent for accents, and she shows incredible insight into this global movie. I felt it for her when Lindy was persecuted. And she was realistically played. She was overwhelmed, upset and unpleasant because the media and the government continued their witch hunt. I did not expect too much on the film, but I was very interested, and the film is based on a real person and real events. It turned out to be better than we anticipated. Sam Neill was also remarkable; this is the best work I've ever seen from him and I really liked it in other movies (like The Piano). I gave the film a 7, but if I could only rate the act, I would give it a 9.5 and a perfect 10 for Streep.
