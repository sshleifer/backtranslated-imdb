A very promising directorial debut for Bill Paxton. A very dark thriller / who really did - was recommended by Stephen King. This is a powerful, well-thought horror story about a devoted, but demented, man from Thurman, Texas, who goes on a killing syndrome after receiving orders from God to eliminate the demons who are trying to control mankind. A few overturns of plot and a terrible end make your values ​​valuable. Most of the violence you do not really see, but still enough to double your stomach. Director Paxton plays the role of the twisted man to be known as "The Killer of the Hand of God." Matthew McConaughey is as impressive as the big son of demons, who ends up saying this story to a Dallas FBI agent (Powers Boothe). Boothe, as always, is solid and flawless. Suspension elongated white! Highly recommended.
