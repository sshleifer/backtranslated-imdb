It is such a joy that we have watched this interesting project. So refreshing and educative. Not just for a director who can learn what you can get in 5 minutes of the screen but also as an audience that may not be so prepared for so much love in such a short time. <br /> <br /> 20 short love movies in Paris are all unique, but some of them, as expected, are remarkable. I thought Tom Tykwer (Natalie Portman) was the best, though the mimes made me smile in the same way. I clicked the "spoilers" option for this bus review unfortunately ... what you read is enough a spoiler. Look at him. Do not read what I'm writing, but watch the movie. But smile.
