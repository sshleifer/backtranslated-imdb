Simon's carefully written dialogues are truly electrified by Matthau and Burns. You can literally hear the crackle of the script. There are few films that can develop such a relationship between actors and script. For example, the famous meeting scene could have been much tougher with the involvement of lesser-quality actors. Matthau seems to have been born to play Willie Clark (of course, Oscar moreso in the odd couple), and with all the idiosyncrasies and manners that Matthau makes them embody a character (the line in which he claims to be with him then he lives in the city while Lewis lives in the country that Lewis is "off-touch" is the quintessential example of this) to make one of the best performances I've ever seen from an actor in any role , whether it's comedy or drama or anything else. Period. Matthau and Burns work excellent together; the contrast that portrays accentuates Simon's talent to create a comedic conflict. This movie is simply one of the must-see and needs a prestigious place right on the pages of film history.
