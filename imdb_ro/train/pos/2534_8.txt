The scientist working frantically in isolation finds a way to locate the impact crater of a meteor carrying a new radioactive element. All the technological (pseudo) scientific and technological discussions discovered in the 1930s are right there, including the idea that radioactivity could cure any disease if properly exploited. When they call his rivals - who took him out of the scientific community and ridiculed him - to witness his discovery, they propose a "common" expedition to Africa ... of course they ended up stealing a lot of dr. Rukh's original discovery, giving him only a residual credit. In addition, a weak, who looks like a supporting comedy actor from the worst Abate & Costello (Lawton), literally steals Dr. Rukh, a young trophy wife (Drake) who falls over that scrap human beings. Raising the horn like a deer will not make Dr. Rukh (Karloff) more friendly, so he embarks on a covert revenge mission ... killing two enemies and friendly Dr. Benet (Lugosi), the only one who helped him. ... ultimately yield to the killer radiation that allowed him to launch himself in his revenge, but (to the utmost dissatisfaction) to save the adultery and that feeble excuse for a man because she married . The actor is very good, and Karloff & Lugosi is very good. Check the hysterical room scenario ... Other characters are not worth mentioning ... Recommended, like ALL old universal horrors ...
