Before watching this television movie, I did not know much about one of my favorite actresses. After I watched them, I realized how sad Lucille Ball was. They had wonderful moments, but I did not realize how sad it was. This movie was very good and he very well narrated the story of his beloved Lucille Ball. I recommend it a lot.
