Perhaps this may be the best film ever made, and if it is certainly not one of those who are burning your students, what Brian De Palma offers here is a great piece of cinematic art. Brian De Palma, who once again proved to be one of the best directors ever, is the superb performance of Al Pacino, who delivers an immortal immortal hero on the big screen (Tony Montana). many different (violent) scenes you will never forget (one with the chain saw, the one in which Tony is sitting in a bathroom that is as big as the living quarters of most people), there are the many superb many models or the word "f * ck" is used), there are superb details (the American globe shouting "The world is yours") or Giorgio Moroder's great discovery. Nothing can be called, which is not sublime here and is easy along with "The Godfather", "Good Boys" and "White Heat", one of the best gangstermakers ever made!
