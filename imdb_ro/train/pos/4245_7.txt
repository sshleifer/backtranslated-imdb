If the The Girl From Missouri themes sound familiar, you should. That's because Anita Loos, who wrote the script here, wrote and the classic gowns prefer blondes. Unlike Marilyn Monroe in this film, Jean Harlow will accept any kind of jewelery from men's means. And they are the men of the means Jean Harlow pursues. She leaves the house of her mother and her stepfather, for she has decided that the best way to make a living is to marry her. Her talent as a choir girl is limited, but she will be able to trade with that beauty. Her odyssey begins with her and her friend, Patsy Kelly, to receive an invitation to attend the party thrown by millionaire Lewis Stone. But ignoring Jean, Stone has only one last shot of wild before it's done because of the money he does not owe him. However, she asked for a few blows from him that Millionaire colleague Lionel Barrymore has noted. <br /> <br /> Lionel is amused by her until Jean sees his playboy son, Franchot Tone. After that, he is not amused, and he seems to shake Jean from climbing the family tree. The Missouri girl went into the average adaptation production of the Code, so she went under special censorship. I have the feeling that we have seen a movie much risque. Still Jean Harlow, as a younger and safer version of Mae West, is always appreciated. What a special talent the woman had, seeing The Girl From Missouri, is a sad memory of the great loss of the film world sustained with her passing three years later. Ironically, Patsy casting Kelly Harlow was undoubtedly influenced by the successful pants Kelly made with another platinum blonde, Thelma Todd. Harlow and Kelly have the same light chemistry between that Patsy and Thelma. Todd would also die a year later in a strange accident / suicide / murder that no satisfactory explanation has ever been given. <br /> <br /> Do not Miss The Girl From Missouri, It's Bright and Sassy, ​​It Must Be Of All Those Sparkling Jewelry.
