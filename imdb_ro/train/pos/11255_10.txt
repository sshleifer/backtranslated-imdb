This is undoubtedly my favorite novel, Le Carre, and is transformed into the silver screen with all the love and care you may want. I've read a review on this site that seems to find the wrong characters, but I think this is pointless. All of Le Carre's stories are basically love stories and this is no exception. It is an accurate reflection of the period in which it is established. Betrayal is the key to everyone's good. Ascending Pym is so close to my own that I find her worried. Peter Egan is in his best role, and the young lamented Ray McAnally is incredibly good. Even the smallest roles played by Andy from Tour, Tim Healy and Jack Ellis are on the scene. This cast is the dream of Theater Impresario. The story should not be spoiled by an inappropriate description, but it suffices to say that it refers to a slow but inexorable destruction of a young man, and a descent into espionage and betrayal. All my sympathies are Magnus Pym and his unique (non-sexual) love for Poppy (RÃ¼diger Weigang) - as wonderful as ever. His only true friendship, but by definition another in the long line of betrayal. L love.
