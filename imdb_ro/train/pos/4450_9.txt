An old man living in the mountains wakes up one morning and loses his cat. He wanders the forest to witness a murder, but has seen the murder or lost his mind? Is he aged? The movie is so great, because the viewer has to make his own mind about what's going on. Dialogue is very low in this movie, but it does not need words, the whole movie speaks for itself. You knew what was happening and I liked it. The other part that I liked was the forest fires at the end of autumn and winter. These were pretty pretty, but the only thing I did not like was the old man's vision in his underwear. He could tie his coat harder, but otherwise it was a pretty deep film.
