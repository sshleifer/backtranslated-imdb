Perhaps the most captivating and intelligent crooked police films are Otto Preminger's "Walking Paths Ending" from a truly excellent screenplay by Ben Hecht, based on Frank Rosenberg's "Night Cry" ... <br / > <br /> Dana Andrews is the honest and tough policeman of New York, always in trouble with his superiors, because he likes his own methods with powerful arms as much as he despondents the criminals ... When he hit somebody, his wounds hurt ... And the man he wants to be hit is a bad bastard (Gary Merrill) who points the title. - Why are you always trying to push me into the trough? Andrews asks. "I'm so right on the sidewalk like you." Dana Andrew's observation and neurosis are implanted in his hidden, painful discovery that he is the son of a thief ... His profound hatred of criminals led him to use his own illegal methods to destroy them, and the pursuit of justice became spoiled of private vendetta ... With a unique irony of the film itself, Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney "Laura" unite again, and Andrews seems to play the same detective a few years later but is no longer romantic, beaten by his job, cheap Croatians ... This time, he goes too far, and accidentally kills a suspect ... Killing is accidental, the worthless victim, yet it is a crime he knows he can break can send to prison ... Using police knowledge, covers her role in murder, false indications about plants, and tries to involve a band leader, but can not avoid investigating the case itself ... The double tension of leaving the case to the end without getting involved in the crime is nicely maintained and the final solution is both logical, satisfactory, and in no case a compromise ... The film is one of the best detective films of the 1950s, with curious moral values, also one of the best Preminger ... Preminger uses a powerful storytelling technique, designing pretentious camera angles and strange touches of the bizarre to outsource his suspense in realism ...
