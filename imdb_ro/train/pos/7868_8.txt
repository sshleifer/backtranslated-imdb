Again, Madhur Bhandarkar takes you on a walk to the wild side. And a wonderful one is, literally and figuratively. Mumbai hi-society - stars and starlets, glamouble dolls and witch doctors, business magnates and broker types, focus here. Typically a tabloid, their world unfolds, with each colorful story a smart sub-plot in itself. A starlet beaten by a producer after her pregnant, stewardess and her high-ranking husband, pedophile businessman and his neurotic wife, reporters and police captain; all the shades on the screen and the many nuances between them. Bhandarkar makes a bloody work of digging the dirt of dragon kings, dancing ladies, and living deaths. Atul Kulkarni packs a punch, like Boman Irani and Sandhya Mrudul. Konkona Sen Sharma is effective as an ex-murder crime reporter, but could have been dolled a little under the job change and party circuit. Very concentrated (operating time 140 min) and refreshing film different, well worth the money.
