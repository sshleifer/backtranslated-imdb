A hot, touching film that has fantastic quality. Ellen Burstyn is, as always, superb. Samantha Mathis has given a lot of extraordinary performances, but it's just something about it that will haunt your memory. <br /> <br /> Above all, you have to see this amazing 5 years. old, Jodelle Ferland. I was so captivated by her presence, I had to buy the movie so I could watch it again and again. It is a miracle of God's creation. Judging by the high IMDB assessment, I'm not the only one who was fascinated by this young actress.
