I've been a fan of this movie for years and years. Due to the fact that Teri Hatchers is moving, I had to take the film off the shelf and see it. Why did people in 1991 not see how wonderful this movie was beyond me? Sally Field and Kevin Kline are beyond fabulous. Although I have never seen soaps during the day, this movie kills me every time I watch it. The actress is not the second for any comedy and the writing is so intelligent. I recommend you to look at this if you have not already done so. You will see Elizabeth Shue, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher and Carrie Fisher ... to name a few ... all of them have splendid shows.
