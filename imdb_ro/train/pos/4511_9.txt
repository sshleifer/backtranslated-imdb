We just got the DVD release of this movie while on holiday in Norway where it was released with subtitles in English. <br /> <br /> The film is beautiful and powerful photographed has acted. The young portrayal of "Frits" the main character has an amazing open face that accurately reflects painful tragic events that unfold around him. <br /> <br /> At first in the film, we see that the father Frits loves so much has mental health problems and this is brought when the director of the brutal school denies boy aggression and suggests that he was his own father < <br /> The culminating scene where Frits refuses to show any report with the school principal. simply standing on the ground and repeating his "The liar", as he is brutally attacked in front of his colleagues is a scene are not likely to forget. <br /> <br /> Only weak points are rather the "Flower Power" professor who uses every "friendly teacher" trick in the book. Other than this I feel sure this is a movie you will really enjoy.
