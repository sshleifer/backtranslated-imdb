This animated feature (a co-production between Ireland, Belgium and France) deals with what is certainly one of the strangest subjects ever for a movie: the creation in the 9th century of a famous illuminated manuscript, Kell's book. In this fantastic replay of that story, a prepubescent boy named Brendan who lives in a monastery led by his uncle, a broken abbot who is worried to prepare the monastery for the imminent attack of the fearful Vikings, must enter the forbidding surrounding forest for to find the materials that a commanding enlightener called Aidan has to complete. To make that task in the woods, he suddenly finds out the help of a friendly fairy named Aisling. Wonderful and delicately hand-drawn (there is computer animation in some key passages) in a manner that wants to resemble both medieval and traditional art and with a very creative use of colors and all kinds of geometric shapes, this movie is unusually strange, but it's a weird thing, not the variety but the opening of the eye. If anyone had to see it - beyond some anachronisms, as an African monk in Ireland in the 9th century? we should say that the blend of Catholic mysticism with celtic paganism in this film never gets worse. And the comic relief is sometimes too broad. That's why I can not give them the highest rank. But these are minor issues with an otherwise delightful and imaginative film.
