People of Honor have many special aspects. Good action sequences, a lot of scenes "feel good", a good musical score, but the part that really makes the film is the great act. Most of Robert Deniro. The tale of honorable people focuses on Carl Brashear, played by Cuba Gooding Jr., who wants to become the first African-American deepwater marine diver. The chronicle of his harsh struggle to be a poor farmer to get to the diving school and even further. It's a good story, but it seems to have been done several times before. A person, against all odds, will not give up until they reach the goals they have set for a sentimental reason many years ago. It could happen, but a lot of fighting faced by Brashear in the film is questionable, including C.O. from the diving school, which would have affected the final test. However, all this is done for the scene when Robert Deniro enters the film. Deniro plays Sunday School Chief, who is a teacher at the diving school that Brashear is leading. As soon as Deniro enters, he omit this extreme arrogance that you can not climb unless you have an incredible power. Before the movie ends, Deniro reveals more speeches that would have laughed at how cool it is, but you are too amazed at the way it destroys them. Finally, you have to doubt some aspects of the movie, but acknowledge it, if it were the truth, you should have placed it in the first twenty minutes.
