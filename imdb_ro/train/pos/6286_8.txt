gone in 60 sec. where we started, it keeps you in the movie with something good and some cool cars. people say it is not a good film I do not agree that surely it has some pieces of cheese, but what action film do. I gave it 8 out of 10 cause of action and amelioration of comic if you like Rock or Face Off than this movie is right up your alley with a good job along with one of the under rated actors in my mind Del -Roy Lindo . I think sometimes people watch a lot in movies a few times you need to stay back enjoy the movie and by words ask that they have realized what they show where. that is where if it goes for action was the action pact. where if trying to make a movie to change the way the movies are made and trying to win each prize out of their good did it? I think they did the action movie they intended to do, give it a chance and you will not regret it.
