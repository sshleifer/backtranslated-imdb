This really funny movie has a lot of characters, almost any middle-aged woman in Hollywood, and a funny and fun story of love. Capomezza and Malacici are rival cafes in an Italian neighborhood in New York. These are also at the extreme extremes of the taste scale. Their children are thrown into the roles of a church production by Romeo and Juliet. Of course, they fall in love. On the scene! The chaos and confusion that this provokes as parents struggle with each other and their children is playing for us against the backdrop of Capomezza's magnificent house, as well as their wonderful-looking weddings. the four top parents and the charming young ladies, the characters include a vaguely wise priest, a grandmother full of words, a lady who gives birth to a wand and passes on the spiritual advice he receives from an environment called the Blessed Roscoe motel with beds in the shape of the back of a car and two pigeons. There is no visible gag or a punch line that does not click on this fast paced movie. Even the family names of the two families are part of the fun. "Capomezza" could be interpreted as "low eyebrows," and "Malacic" could mean "stiff snobs." <br /> <br /> If you are sensitive to Italian stereotypes, you may not like this movie. If Bette Midler grumbles you, maybe you do not like it, because all the women in this movie make Bette Midler look like Martha Stewart. The rest of us should love him!
