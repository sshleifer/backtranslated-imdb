First; I'm a dedicated fan of Modesty and I've been reading comics since I was a kid and I've discovered previous films about our unsatisfactory heroine, but if I can not, this ROCKS! <br /> <br /> Well, then we go: Mrs. Blaise is working at a casino, a band of robbers comes and starts playing gambling for the life of her friends. If the thief wins a round, he will have to tell her about herself. If he wins twice in a row, one of the staff members is released. (Sounds stupid, yes, well, I'm not so good to explain ...); she tells her about raising herself in a war zone without parents or friends, about her old help in the refugee camp, and how she avoids living by her own rules of nature. They hunt for food and teach them to read and fight. As they approach civilization, they are trapped in a war, and while they are taken for rebellion, they are shot and the old man dies, allowing her to meet herself. <br /> <br /> She meets the man who is the casino for now and the story ends. <br /> <br /> What is to be followed is that there is a wonderful fight and his line is completely cool. Alexandra Staden is a modest Blaise TERRIC! Just as modest and powerful, graceful and intellectual as the comic one. Still, he feels weird, hearing Modesty speaking with a slightly broken focus, but this is not relevant because the comic book library can not speak out loud, but it must certainly have a somewhat emphasis. (Not to mention that it is strange that everyone speaks English in the Balkans.) The actor is very good, even the child who personifies the young Blaise must have an applaud! <br /> <br /> My favorite part must be where she rips her dress to kick the stupid killer! Pretty wonderful! : D I can not wait until the real adventure starts in the next movie!
