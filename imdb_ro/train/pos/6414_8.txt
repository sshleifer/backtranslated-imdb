I was curious to know how the critics responded to this inspired film, so I went to Rotten Tomatoes and I was unhappy to discover that the pompous peanut gallery, which is the critic of our nation's film, gave the film an average of 43% (or "Rotten"). All I can say is that if this movie does not move you, you have no heart. (It's interesting to note that the same movie on the same site got a 74% rating from the viewers). Not that the critics' opinion is all that matters to me. After all, I can not think of a more useless and paid profession. Some schmo gets paid to go to movies (what a tough life) and do the same thing to anyone else on the planet: they form an opinion. But these chumps have a way to come across, like their opinion in a way more than yours, and even worse, they love to hate. I will grant you that this movie is old-fashioned (well, except for f-bombs), syrup and unpredictable ... after all, you know from the beginning that Cuba Gooding Jr., portraying the marine life hero real, Carl Brashear, will ultimately triumph in the way he meets: determined and joyful; but his performance and that of De Niro (like Billy Sunday, a composite character of many real-life people) are so powerful that they are so inspired that you will be on your feet applauding many of the scenes of the movie, climax of the court. You should be a real stick in the mud not to be moved by these scenes. Like the film critics of our nation. Michael Rappaport is excellent as well as a sweet-loving student who is friends with Gooding's Brashear. If someone has seen "Higher Learning", this character redeems this character altogether. However, this confirms what I have always felt: do not listen to critics. See this movie and inspire you.
