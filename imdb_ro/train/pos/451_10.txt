If anyone wonders why nobody makes movies as they are accustomed to, with conversation, character and a simple theme of friendship that struggles to evolve into something new, better and different, those people have to take in this movie and see letters top, and who behaves in a wonderful evening observing how things were used in Italy and England. Other days, sometimes amused in a great entertainment comedy, made in 1992 with Alfred Molina, Joan Plowright, Polly Walker, Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent, Miranda Richardson, and Michael Kitchens as the main cast. Under the stroke of Mike Newell, these actors perform memorable live performances that are photographed with a sublime eye under the painter. Remembrance of the theatrical bedroom fences at the beginning of the century, this movie could be called a friendship farce that becomes a useful experience in the growth of romantic nature in every character, and the viewer as well. An artistic telegram about the importance of caring for those around us.
