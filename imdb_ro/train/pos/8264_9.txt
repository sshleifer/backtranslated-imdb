Based on a real disaster, this early German talkie (with English subtitles) remains one of the most effective docu-dramas ever shot. With many non-personal actors, "Kameradschaft" offers a cool picture of the friendship that links miners, no matter what part of the French / German border they might be. A deadly crash brings out what is best in the world, canceling superior orders. A colleague in the home will need the help of his comrades, even at the risk of big losses, including life. This film recalls the self-sacrifice heroism shown by the NYFD following the Sept. 11 attacks. Abstracted from official rules and regulations, these men and women in uniform knew only one reason: saving lives and finding their fighters fighting. - More than 70 years later, "Kameradschaft" still has a strong and endless message: A friend in need is a friend in action.
