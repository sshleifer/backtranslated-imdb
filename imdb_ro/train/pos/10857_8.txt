Johny To make here one of the best style exercises, making a powerful movie with a good story of Yakuza. The election of the new Yakuza chief is the beginning of a war within the organization. In my opinion, violence is wise used in context, making a movie very strong. I really like the way he tells history, he moves around all the roles of Yakuza's family and makes us see the violence as the only way he has to solve his problems ... Talk about, the technical, the film is a good example of the pause, rhythm, and planned mode of filming a movie. A Hong Kong movie of the year. It resembles the inferior business, but without the easy scenes of action and violence and the confusing story. Highly recommended to all Asian movie lovers. <br /> <br /> (I'm sorry for my English, better doing in Spanish lol)
