Thirty years after its initial release, the third version of the movie "A Star Is Born" comes ultimately on DVD in a package that should thank Barbra Streisand's most devoted fans. That's what will mean me since I saw her in concert, singing among other numbers, the feminist anthem "The Woman on the Moon" in this 1976 film. Easily disregarded, the story of the film polarization career is so much a clump of clich√©s in Hollywood style that its variations exist in other films, including Streisand's "Funny Girl". This time, returning to the contemporary music scene, the sequel is followed by starring rock star, John Norman Howard, on his downhill career as he meets the club singer Esther Hoffman, who is waiting for a big break. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ). For John Norman, Esther is her last blow to happiness and, in turn, she is attracted by the creative, decent and creative musician under the facade. In the pivotal scene of the film, Esther gives her a great break at a benefit concert, and her career is breaking. Inevitably, he can not cope with the failure of his career in light of his meteoric success, and if you're familiar with any version of this story, you know the rest. Directed by Frank Pierson (although Streisand's directorial talent is clearly displayed), the movie still manages to shoot me, even though she knows it's shameful and manipulative. She still has some emotional resonance, despite her numerous flaws. Although Streisand in its forefront seems to be the ideal choice to play a star in ascent, her screen character is simply too strong and predefined to play Esther credible. The same can be said for his performance style because the script seems to be making talks about his adult Adult Contemporary material to be accepted in the otherwise hardened world of the arena rock. From the moment he opens his head like in the middle of the Oreos, he can only see it as a fixed star. I can forgive myself because it is an unparalleled voice talent, but what becomes less forgiving is how it makes Esther more strident than painful when John Norman's problems become overwhelming. This creates strange dynamics of discomfort in the last part of the film, when it becomes less about what caused the climatic event than Esther's response to it. This is limited by an uninterrupted eight minute shutdown of his memorial performance - wonderful, unless, unfortunately, he mimics John Norman's style to the end. Kristofferson, on the other hand, offers superb performance over time, managing a level of honesty that motivates the film and makes palpable its compelling feelings of love, pride and resentment to Esther. He's making food on a vodka scene that squeaks the work in this context. Otherwise, what always seems to me to be odd about this version is how all the supporting characters are downgraded in the background as if they did not exist unless they interact with the two main characters. The only ones to record are Paul Mazursky as senior manager of John Norman, Brian and Gary Busey as cyber boss manager Bobbie. Camera Survivor Robert Surtees offers a cinematic film, although a level of granularity persists in print. A great salesman in his days, the soundtrack is a mix of different styles from the 70s - some still good songs ("Everything", "Watch Closely Now"), some that have moved in kitsch "Queen Bee", Kenny Loggins "I Believe in Love") and, of course, the inevitable "Evergreen". The 2006 print transfer is clean and grateful thanks to remastered digital technology. Streisand's participation is the main attraction of the excerpt, starting with his long commentary. Offers inspirational information about film genesis, casting, and problem production. She is also sincerely delighted about the megalomania of Jon Peters, her hair stylist friend who became the filmmaker, and frustration with Pierson as a director. I just wanted to have been able to provide more scenario-specific comments that relate directly to what's on the screen. She also has the tendency to repeat the same anecdotes when her mood hits her, for example, gets tiring to hear for the third time as the person playing the driver is friends with Peters. I think having a second commentator could have pulled other nuggets out of it. There is a test cup for the closet that shows some fun clothes from the 1970s, especially the poncho and orange polyester t-shirt from Kristofferson. There are also 12 deleted scenes included in Streisand's optional commentary. One is a comical baking scene that reminded me how much I like Streisand in the phantastic comedies. Another is an extended scene in which she plays "Evergreen" on the guitar in front of a Kristofferson who does his job and then falls asleep. The most interesting is an alternative takeover of the musical finale that incorporates rapid cuts that I would have agreed with Streisand. Remarkably, theater trailers are included for all three versions of "A Star Is Born".
