The premise of this series of anime is about bread, about all the things that a plot must be based on! I really laughed. The main character has a special power of bread he gave birth to and goes to the school of bread. I wanted to be available on DVD, and it does not matter whether it's subtle or dubious - it's so good. Even the theme song is funny. At one point in the themed song, there is an African-American man with an African horse riding, with a French wand, as if it were a samurai sword. These pictures will make sense unless you see the anime. You'll laugh until your pains get hurt. It's definitely the only anime I've ever seen.
