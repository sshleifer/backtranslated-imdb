The star of this movie is the script. The attention to the details of the clothing period, language, social death (do not harm women) and politics are remarkable. It is a reminder of Kosovo today. Subtle tracks in action scenes are there for a careful spectator and the choreography of these sequences of action is superb. Perhaps this film will come closer to the bone of reality to win the support it should have received. It is like a scale of increasing violence, with well-taken steps of peace and serenity between each step. A great movie ....
