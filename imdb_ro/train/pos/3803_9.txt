What people do not understand about this movie is that it's not a beginning, middle and end, it's just the conclusion of a 26-episode long series of television. Remember that when you all talk about how the world has not been explored enough. This was done in the TV show. How big and amazing are the visuals, I think the SPOILER *** argument between Lian-Chu and Gwizdo, near the end of the movie, was what made me love this movie. Seeing the characters I had been doing in 26 episodes, the struggle of this kind was agonizing, and seeing Gwizdo, saddening himself in the flood ruins, while Lian-Chu sharpened his blade, was almost stuck . <br /> <br /> Then, we have a total contrast with Lian Chu fighting these wonderful dragons (who were in the evening), while Gwizdo creeps crazy and indirectly threatening to kill Zoe. * Shudder * I am surprised that this particular scene was not mentioned in the warnings. Any child who has a mind of sense will be able to see that Gwizdo was not himself and that he was fully in the intent to strangle that little girl. It was enough to bother me and I'm 15 years old. The world is amazing, the plot is much better than most millions of successes and it was a beautiful way to see some of the favorite characters going. Check it out. :)
