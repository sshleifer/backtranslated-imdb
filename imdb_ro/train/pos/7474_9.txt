This is one of those films that is difficult to review without letting go of the plot. Suffice it to say that there are strange things and unexpected upheavals happening beyond the initial superficial "Tom Cruise screws around with more women" plot. Quality casts up this movie above the norm, and all distributed are very suitable for their tracks: Cruise as an irritating smug playboy who has everything - and then loses everything, Diaz as the attractive lover but slightly disturbed, Cruz as the new exotic girl on the stage and Russell as a psyche psychologist. The story involves elements of romance, morality, murder-mystery, suspense, and science fiction, and is generally an entertainment trip. I should add that photography is also excellent uniform and the introduction of different visual metaphors is beautiful once you figure out what's going on. If you're enjoying well-done movies, with twists and suspense, and ready to accept a Philip Kick Dick resolution that's a little fantastic, then you have to see. <br /> <br /> 9/10
