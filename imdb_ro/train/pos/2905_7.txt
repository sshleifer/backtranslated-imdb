This is a very funny, easy-to-watch movie that has fun all the time. The activity of the director is recognized and the type of humor is his mark. The film is a typical story of police partners, such as the lethal gun, but the jokes and comedies are Argentinian. The spread is that one of them is a psychologist played by Peretti and has to go with Detective Diaz (played by Luque) during his missions while helping him (Diaz is troubled because his wife deceived them). Some of the dialogues are worldly hilarious: understandable and ridiculous anywhere. It is very good overall, it would be worth 8, but we rated 7 because it gets a little down at the end. In a personal remark, I must add that it is a "bravo" for the Argentineans, given that the little good thing comes lately.
