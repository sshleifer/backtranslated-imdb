I instantly fell in love with "Pushing Daisies". This show succeeds to smile my face with a wonderful story, a wonderful dialogue and an extraordinary adventure. But that's not all: it also manages to keep you up to the end. The basic idea behind the show - Bringing people back to life with just one touch, ending the state of dissatisfaction by one second - is interesting and could still be in subsequent seasons. But the cases of tortured crime, the unique appearance of the show and the extremely competent storyteller add to the experience. But "pushing daisies" is more than just the parts. It has a certain charm that I really like and I look forward to entering the world of Ned and Chuck for a second season.
