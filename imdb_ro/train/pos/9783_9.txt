How could you say that Peaches, with the complex narrative dealing with a multitude of problems, is "a little TV idea" is beyond me. In addition, I can think of many movies that have "a little TV idea" in their plots. Your obvious talk about the TV industry ("Sue Smith has not managed to rise above his TV background") is confusing. especially because you have such a "big thing" on television. If we could all be as talented as Mrs. Smith (no, I'm not a friend or a relative) - the AFI prize won the brides of Christ, the Coorain Road, etc. All made for television. You want to think about this at other "small television ideas" such as "Against the Wind", "Bodyline", "Downloading", "Scales of Justice", "Blue Dirty", "Water under the Bridge". I think Peaches is a good entertainment movie that I've been interested in most of my friends from start to finish. It's far from flawless, but I think it's one of the best Australian movies I've seen in recent years. Who knows, with more views (so much to think), it could be there with classics like "The Year My Voice Broke", "The Devil's Playground." I really enjoyed this film much more than "Somersault" and "Three Dollars". These films, I think, have had their moments - surrealistic, atmospheric, realistic and dealing with important contemporary issues, but in terms of entertainment simply for myself and for me, we were very accustomed if not boring. When I go to a movie, I'm always aware of the public's reaction to a movie (through in-camera reactions and conversations in the foyer and loo). Some came out of Peaches shaking their heads, some with negative critics, but many seemed to enjoy this experience.
