Strong actors such as Bruce Dern, Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward combine to make this modern noir movie a winner. Of the three, I do not know who was the most interesting because they all offer good performances and interesting characters. Patric makes the narrative in this noir, playing a boxer and a mental patient. Wow, that's just an interesting guy! It looks bad, but it is not. Ward is the slinky co-conspirator, attractive, cynical, intelligent and compassionate of a kidnapping plan that goes badly. Bruce Dern is also in the mix and Dern never manages to fascinate in any movie. The movie could be considered a kinder downer for the average viewer, but it seemed fascinating .... and I do not like filming normally. What we found was a kind of delicate film. Take a look and see if you agree. This is a rather unfamiliar film that should not have that status because it's simply a good story and well done.
