This crime thriller is a kind of film noir, although it changes the post-war context to the cold war and has something relatively decent to say about humanity. In Pickup on South Street, the cops are good boys, criminals are real boys, and the only enemies are "The Commies," who are finally differentiated from the good, in the sense that they are personally emotionally personalized, their own values, so as shown in the constant-looking-in-close-ups that speckle the movie. This movie revolves around characters. The personalities of this film are rather unique and detailed: skip the pocket that is able to look at any danger and sometimes pass through their personal possessions; Moe informant who only tries to save for a spectacular funeral, but manages to capture the hearts and respect of almost all other characters (and the audience); Candy, an innocent girl who only thinks she's doing governmental activity and does not fully understand the conspiracy she's involved with; and Joey, the former bad boy bad boy friend, who is trying to hide everything from everyone and, ironically, is the worst person who does it. Drop into a bunch of very colorful characters (such as sticks and cops) and Pickup on South Street treats you in a splendor of personalities while hunting mysterious and accidentally stolen microfilm frames. > <br /> --PolarisDiB
