With the amount of actors they have worked on the project have a wide variety of distributions. CGI ships in places, but their green screen needs something. Anyone who heard of Adobe After Effects 7, should buy it to make his key better. Stories are well thought out, a lot of moving elements to keep them in the right context. BUT, but the idea that two guys kiss me makes me give my episode. I'm not homophobic, but I can not help that I can not find men kissing fun (do not mind women). Anyway ... For a number of fans, this is good. With minor improvements in their green screen, the action brush and some orientation reviews this series is amazing. Anyway, I recommend this series to those who liked TNG and DS9.
