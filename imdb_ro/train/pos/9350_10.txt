let me say I like Adam Sandler, I look at the reign over me I was to pay special attention to act when he raises his voice can not help, but think of the happy gilmore shouting at a ball golf, then I came back as Adam Sandler sucks my reign over me is a wonderful movie, a movie that slowly comes out with you wait for excitement in every scene Don Cheadle always does a great job and is no exception here with some lines really great and worthy of an Oscar in any movie he makes sander adam was amazing in so many ways not only was it the most dramatic / film best act of his career. but I can remember the laugh aloud in many parts of this film The supportive distribution was excellent with Saffron Burroughs and Jada Pinkett Smith <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend this movie to him extraordinarily beautiful beautiful photos from NYC great comedy drama drama And a new respect found for Sandler Adam, if you ever bent him or a reassurance at how great Don Cheadle is
