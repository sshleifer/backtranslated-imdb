I have to be honest, I was expecting such a bad failure, because they really sounded like they were trying to milk the original movie to get money. But this was not the case with this funny (sometimes strange) movie. I liked how they told the story of Timon and Pumba, the story with Simba and that he had trouble sleeping was funny. Whirlpool bubble, and when Pumba leaves, the bubbles stop. It's a harmless fun, good for children and adults. I think this movie will take a while, because it's good for a movie direct to DVD and DVD. While the movie looks a bit strange and some sort of trails off to the end, it works. 8 out of 10
