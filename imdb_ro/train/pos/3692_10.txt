I watched this film a few days ago in a small independent Paris cinema. It was my last evening in the French capital and the best farewell I could have chosen. These twenty episodes have made me relive the impressions I have collected in Paris in a warm-up manner without turning into kitsch or sentimental schmaltz. Each episode is filled with surprising, powerful emotions and suggestive images, and each short film is directed according to the rules of a good story. For me, this type of film requires a lot more talents and qualities than a director and writer of storytelling than any two-hour epic drama, and they all managed to do their job well! The stories have been carefully chosen in terms of their fitting array and perfectly express the flair. Each episode was seen from another ankle, it had a different subject, a different style, and yet the twenty stories led to a harmonic orchestra of movies. The most important advantage of the episode movie concept in my opinion is that you can switch between a wide variety of feelings and dispositions, without the danger of overloading, just the opposite: the melancholy of sadness, melancholy, pure joy, despair, anger, anxiety, curiosity or passion give this film freshness and unique harmony. And let's not forget the whole theme of love! Love among the characters, love between the characters and Paris and the love of directors and actors / acts for this project. I do not want to go into the details of the episodes because there are so many, but I have to emphasize the range of famous actors and actresses from all over the world and their approach to this project. Some have played with their image, some have broken it completely and some have interpreted stereotypes about their country of origin or the roles they have previously played, so that intertextuality has been entirely given through the film. In everything I can absolutely recommend this great collage and look forward to DVD release.
