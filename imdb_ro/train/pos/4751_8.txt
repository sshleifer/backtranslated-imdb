I have no idea why this movie is getting such a bad thing by so many IMDb users (Some say it's its worst movie ever). What have you never seen on Cradle 2 The Grave?) my favorite is that the intrigue is totally bad and just an excuse to hang all the action sequences. Really! What nonsense do you expect from a Jet Li movie? Did you honestly believe that someone thought the story, then loaded it with action? Of course not! Black Mask is a great action, from wall to wall, throughout the entire operating time. It is also deliciously delicious, and we receive plenty of cut limbs, decapitations and creative ways of tracking bad guys (and a few innocent people!). Most of Li's other martial arts are nursery school compared to the black mask; there is no retention of free violence, bloodshed or sequences of action! And that made me a happy camp. Again: if you come into a Jet Li movie waiting for a wonderful dialogue and an interesting plot, you will leave for the wrong reasons. Black Mask is probably my favorite in his films (though, beware of terrible dubbing).
