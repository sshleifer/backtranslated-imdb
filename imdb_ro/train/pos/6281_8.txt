I had the chance to watch more movies in BluRay and HD DVD. This movie remains a wonderful action and a wonderful story. Though if you are looking for a movie with an excellent picture, this is not. Do not have this movie on DVD has helped make it easier to buy. I have always enjoyed intense action and excellent action that does not always go together. Generally, this makes this movie a fun movie to watch. Now, on the Blu Ray scale. In many Blu Ray movies you get two things. An image that is almost crystal clear, no distortion or a blue HD movie. I was disappointed when I made my first Blu Ray movie. I almost started to think it was a Blu ray standard. Although after watching other movies, I know better. I do not think they spent as much time as they should have transferred this movie to HD. This is generally the problem with some movies. And for the price of Blu Ray and Blue Ray players, you should have the best picture. So I think this is a useful investment for people who have never seen the movie or bought the DVD version.
