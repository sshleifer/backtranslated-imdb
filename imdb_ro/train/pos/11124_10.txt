SOPRANOS (1999-2007) <br /> <br /> Number 1 - The All Time TV Show <br /> <br /> Everyone thought this would be a stupid thing that would not go over a pilot episode. The sopranos have become a cultural phenomenon and have universally agreed to be one of the largest television shows of all time. <br /> <br /> James Gandolfini plays New York's enigmatic boss Tony Soprano, accompanied by a star cast. Edie Falco is gorgeous as a worrying middle class loving mother; Tony Sirico is great as a superstitious, tough conservative who is often very funny. <br /> <br /> While the show has often been criticized for the negative stereotype of American Italians as mafios, and to some extent this is undeniable, I can see so many positive from the show. Representing strong family values, friends, love and compassion; might be present in a rough show about gangsters? Yes. In addition, other burning issues such as terrorism, social inequality and injustice, homosexuality, drugs etc. are discussed. It's not a superficial and boring show about hard boys and violence. He has a lot more. Many of the issues we see in the show are very real. <br /> <br /> The writing that was big enough has infused so successful today's problems and managed to get them into the life of the characters, which makes it all the more exciting. <br /> <br /> Credit has to go to David Chase, who has created an excellent television treasure, and James Gandolfini for the most complex and enigmatic picture of television. <br /> <br /> Simply exceptional. <br /> <br />
