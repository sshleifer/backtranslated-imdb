I had doubts about another love story where people with disabilities find sense and redemption through honest communication. And it's still not at the top of my list. But the shows from Helena Bonham Carter and Kenneth Branagh and the exemplary, almost amazing, and saving her from being just another tear. Carter's representation of an ALS victim is strong, perhaps even troublesome sometimes (sometimes its dialogue dissolves in undetectable tombs). But the overall effect is commendable and satisfactory. Branagh can be a perfect compliment to her performance. <br /> <br />
