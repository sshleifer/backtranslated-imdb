I really enjoyed this movie. I've seen more Gene Kelly movies and this is one of the best. I would have put it above the most famous American in Paris. Sometimes it seems that the story is lost in Gene Kelly's movies at the wonderful numbers of dance and songs, but not in this movie. It's definitely worth renting.
