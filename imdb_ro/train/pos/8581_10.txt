This is one of the best movies I have seen for a long time. Everyone who sees this film as an absolutely absolute film is not intelligent enough to understand all the subtle humor this film can offer. This shows that real life and "fictitious" action can produce a winning combination. Also, as a romantic comedy, she has one of the smartest ways for two people to find each other. Name me another movie where you can see all this and Donald Sutherland playing a song like "They're Going to Find Your Anus on a Mountain on Mars".
