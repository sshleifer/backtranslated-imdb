This is an EXCELLENT EXAMPLE of Bette Davis's early talent. Production is above the average for the 1936s. I do not understand why the owners of the rights to this movie did not put it on DVD. Owners, please release. I'd buy it right away. I have not seen her in more than thirty years on TV, but remember well.
