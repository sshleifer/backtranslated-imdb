There is no such thing as a perfect crime. Lieutenant Columbo knows this. Ken Franklin, who is the other half of the detective storytellers team does not know that. He kills his partner Jim Ferris who has plans to go to solo. Now Columbo enters the picture and asks all kinds of questions from Mr. Franklin. And he returns for another question.Columbo: Murder by the Book (1971) is directed by youngster Steven Spielberg before his fictional days. Steven Bochco wrote it. Columbo is a fantastic character with his unhappy look. It's hard to believe that this man could solve any crime. But he could. Each and every one of them! Peter Falk is the only person in the world who could describe this character. So it's not a remake, please. This part is a very good example of how Columbo worked. Jack Cassidy interprets the killer, and Martin Milner plays the victim. wife of the victim Joanna Ferris. There is something odd in the scenes between Columbo and her. How does the orlet and everything do. Barbara Colby plays Lilly La Sanka. He really met a tragic fate when he died after a homicide like her. I have been a fan of Columbo since my childhood and I am still glad to look at them. It was a pause for many years that they did not show Columbo stories, but now it's back. One more question.
