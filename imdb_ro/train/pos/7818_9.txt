I think the context of this story has been covered by other posters, so I just want to write about the impact that this film had on me. I first saw this movie in the year of its launch around 1987. My school hosted a cinema trip to see it for a RE project that I think. We all of course went excited because we were on a movie trip! Little did we know what we were supposed to experience. Until today, I still remember the feelings he invoked in me and I remember crying very much like my friends. I think at the age we were in, we found it shocking and quiet, reprehensibly, terrified in our young way. It had such an impact on me that I joined the Anti Apartheid Movement the same year. served my purpose in my case.
