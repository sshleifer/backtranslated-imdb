I'm a great fan of Faerie Tale Theater and I've seen it all and this is one of the best! It's fun, romantic and classic. I recommend this for all ages. It's great for young children because it's fine, Cinderella and great for adults and teens because it's funny and it's not over. I saw her when I was little, and still follow him. It has wonderful lines that my family and I quote all the time. The actor is great and never ages. If you like stories and stories, you like this. I watched a Cinderella movie in my time and this is the best of them. (I'm sorry Disney) We highly recommend this movie and all the shows of Faerie Tale Theater. They appeal to all ages and are all unique and very entertaining.
