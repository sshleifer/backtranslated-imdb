This is by far one of my favorite American Pie Spin offs, mainly because most of the other main character (one of Stiflers' youngsters) always seems unrealistic in nature. <br /> <br /> For example AP: Naked Mile. You have a teenage boy surrounded by naked college puppies and has one particularly hot on his way to get rid of the "problem" of his virginity and eventually stops at the middle of the deeds and rides a horse back to sleep with his girlfriend, who keeps in his mind gave him a "blameless pass" for the weekend. I can appreciate the romantic aspect of the whole thing, but be realistic; most people watching these films do not particularly look for a romantic story. While the latest installment seems to figure out who the audience is and the old old man Erik Stifler seems to wake up and smell roses and as always, Mr. Levenstein gives a humor to the "perfectly natural" natural eyebrow at the equation and marks a touchdown with this new movie.
