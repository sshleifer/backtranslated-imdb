I suppose the last curse of the Toronto Film Festival's participation is the release date of the release date. Frankly, I'm happy that Fido was taken for distribution in the US. In any case ... Have you ever seen Shaun of the dead? Good. How about Lassie? Can we reconcile the two? Well, if you can call yourself it might be Andrew Currie, Canadian helmer of the first zombie comedy of family, or zomedy. Although not as violent, dry or British as Shaun of the Dead, Fido remains true to his roots: a devotion to the black and white TV of the 1950s, including both Lassie and Lassie. (Carrie Anne Moss, Billy Connelly, Dylan Baker, and Tim Blake Nelson) is a testament to the state of shine of the SF film, which was pumped during the period. script. The film explores all the implications of its premise: a world in which zombies have converted to servants because of the large number of them due to a strange accident. What would you use your new servant for undead? A butler? Manual labor? An animal? Inconceivable acts? Fido approaches all these possibilities in a nice and surprisingly classic way, with much congratulations for the work of Connelly (one of the zombies) and for the young TV actor K'Sun Ray, who sometimes seems to be a better young man than Elijah the young Elijah Wood was. If you expect another Shaun of the dead, do not waste your time. There is not enough gore and penetration to the genre to satisfy you and you will leave the theater bitter and depressed. But if you are willing to take a look at what happens to Shaun of the Dead when it jumps over the lake, you're on a treatment. Think of Fido as the most sensitive, most often beaten by the younger brother of Shaun's rebellious death row, and start getting drifting. If you like (or at least tolerate) zombies, small children, and a lot of death satire, Fido is the movie for you. If that's not the case ... well, you know the exercise. Just strike them between your eyes.
