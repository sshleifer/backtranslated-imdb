The first season was amazing, the whole idea of ​​adapting to the island, while the mysteries were explored (and seen) was just phenomenal; filled with suspense, tons of cliffhangers, and an amazing plot. I mean, I like the whole idea of ​​seeing them when they get used to the island. Then, the first time I saw the monster in the first episode, it caught my attention. From that moment, I was drawn to the second season was even on the season season I, just a little better. I really liked the idea of ​​trapezes and the DHARMA initiative. The entire plot and sequences of season 2 were mysterious, creepy and exciting. I liked all the suspense on the island, but the story of DHARMA really made the season 2 amazing. Season 3 was not as good as 1 and 2 ... but still awesome. I liked seeing the stories of others, seeing the camp, and seeing that the mysteries were further explored. ("Tricia Tanak Is Dead" is one of my favorite episodes). This season, while not so good, was still breathtaking and fun, but especially interesting! Now the fourth season. We had hopes for this season, and the first episode of the episodes is good, but then it really started to become boring and monotonous. I mean, I really despise the new "rescuers," like Miles and Daniel. The plot was drunk after the first episodes of couple ... and MOST OF ALL .... Season 4 was stripped of something that made LOST a perfect series: Mystery, suspense, comedy mixed in (Charlie left) and general enthusiasm. Also, some favorite characters have gone.
