I have a two-year-old son who suffers from the same condition as Jonny Kennedy. I did not have the chance to meet him, but I never heard that someone says a bad word about him. I hope she knows how much this program succeeded in helping other sufferers by raising awareness of this terrible condition. This man touched people in a way that a million charity brochures could not. I think this should be compulsory schooling. I also agree with other comments - what do I have to complain about? He took everything he could throw his life and managed to keep his sense of humor. God bless. I could not see what role my changes showed. I have enough trouble with my son.
