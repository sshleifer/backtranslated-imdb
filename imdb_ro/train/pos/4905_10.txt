"An album of such old songs that we think are new." This film has the elusive rhythm combination and the mood that has put some movies apart from the opening moments. Why not? False Dame's talent, Judith Dench as a widow who plays saxaphone with a street musician to help him sing the right songs at Olympia Dukakis as a cheerful widow living in a Scottish castle on her many retirement marriages, Ian Holm as a drummer who loved all the members of the Second World War all the girl (more or less) swing band. But wait, there's a lot more. Add to Leslie Caron bass, and the unparalleled Clio Laine on vocal lead, and blonde bombshells are the hottest band in England at the Beatles. Well, OK, not really, but this movie is a winner. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth (Dench) spends her entire movie trying to reunite the blonde bombshells to play her granddaughter school dance. And before your eyes roll, imagine how hard and courageous it would be for a bunch of sexegenic women to step up on stage with the Britney Spears generation following an act called "Open the Wound." <br /> < In an age when Actresses Careers are over when they are 30, the second album most of the bands is the biggest compilation hits, and the music older than a month has almost no chance of AirPlay, it's great to see real talent, real music and really welcome film from where else, the BBC. <br /> <br /> I love this movie, and I know that I look at it many times more, and enjoy it more than once every time.
