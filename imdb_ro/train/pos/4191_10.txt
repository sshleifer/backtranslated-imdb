This 1953 film, Sam Fuller, contains some of his best works and is sad that he can not continue to get the support of the major studios in Hollywood to do his thing. The story line is something like that. A long time (read prostitute) drives the subway on a hot summer day and picks up her pocket chosen by Skip McCoy. What Skip (and the lady) do not realize is that she also has a microfilm to be transferred to the common spies. This opening blow without dialogue and especially in the near moments is a beer, one of the many that Fuller uses throughout the film. Playing babe called Candy is Jean Peters, which has never been better or better. One forgets how beautiful she is and takes care of this role very well. The Pickpocket is played by Richard Widmark, who has already made his mark, and has established his Kiss of Death style in 1947 as a mad creep with creepy laughter, and although it's a bit "softer" here, it's still frightening . These strong characters have soft tones here and there, but the noir and the ugly all the way. The standout show belongs to the wonderful Thelma Ritter, who plays Moe the stoolie by saving her dough to pay for his funeral. Ritter has received an Oscar nomination for her performance, but has lost Donna Reed's boring but popular performance as girl B (read prostitute) in "From Here To Eternity". Hollywood loves him when a good girl goes bad and loves Oscar even if their performances are usually appalling. See, for example, Shirley Jones in "Elmer Gantry", set among docks and diving in New York City, with a black and white photo by the great Joe MacDonald, and a very good art direction. Metro and Widmark's basket by the river, made at the height of the cold war and the red scare, the play's play is the usual comedy played by Richard Kiley, which is far more dangerous than the pocket that is a killer, but is simply trying to do life and, above all, a loyal American.
