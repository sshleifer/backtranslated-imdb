I have to say that looking at Hamlet from a student's perspective, Hamlet's version of Brannagh is by far the best. Its duty to remain authentic with the original text should be applauded. It helps the game come to life on the screen and makes it easier for people who have the text while watching, as we did while studying it, to track and analyze the text. One of the things I've heard criticized several times is the distribution of major Hollywood names in the song. I think this helps viewers to recognize the characters more easily, as opposed to having actors that look and sound the same as that help in confusion commonly associated with Shakespeare. Also, his flashbacks help clarify many ambiguities in the text. How would really be a relationship between Hamlet and Ofelia and why Fortinbras happened to be at the end of the castle. Overall, not only does this version contain some brilliant performances of both familiar and unknown actors with Shakespeare. It is presented in a way that does not have to be an English-language doctoral to understand and enjoy it.
