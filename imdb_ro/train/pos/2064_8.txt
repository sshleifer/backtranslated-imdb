Scarecrow was one of the funniest Killers I've ever seen in this act! In addition, he is really bouncy most of the time jumped around, which was great! He also had an excellent voice, that was perfect for him. And the story lines were excellent. I like how the children's soul was transferred to ScareCrow, which was cool! Besides, he had a reason for all this killing, after what those people did to him ... And I would be angry! ScareCrows looks great! its appearance gives this person a "GMO!" when I see it! What a great view he was funny! These people were fools, who looked so much! They should look and fled for their lives ... even if that did not make a difference!
