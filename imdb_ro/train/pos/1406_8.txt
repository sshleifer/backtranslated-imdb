You remember H.G. Wells "The Invisible Man"? Well, here's another movie like this, just more extreme. "Hollow Man" is like no story about invisibility as a weapon of choice. Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, a scientific genius who goes out into the world of invisibility and makes him useful for military purposes. At first, the serum was an easy part, making the person come back, it was not. Most of the first attempts have become unsafe. Up to one night, when he perfected the formula. And who else, but Caine would be the lab rat. The Gorilla was the first one and almost died, so when it came, it was a close one. When he did Caine, he decided to use it for fun. Then, when he was tired of not being seen, the team tried everything he could bring him back into the world of flesh. However, the visibility formula does not work as it should have, and Caine will be born crazy. So he becomes an invisible crazy killer. You'd better get out of town instead of taking the lives of people close to you. I would care less about those who wronged you. Great movie, very fun. 3 out of 5 stars!
