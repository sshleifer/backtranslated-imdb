This movie was a fantastic comedy. She had a lot of comedians in her, such as Akshay Kumar, Rajpal Yadav, Paresh Raval and John Abraham. Rimi Sen was good at playing Akshay Kumars and all the hosts were. Mister. Hot as Mac (Akshay Kumar) and Mr. Cool as Sam (John Abraham) are two fashion photographers who like the same girl Maggie (Neha Dupia). When John Abraham deceives his work, he becomes Akshay Kumars senior and Akshay Kumar becomes really jealous, because his apartment must be given to John Abraham, and Neha Dupia begins to like John more. Akshay Kumar wants to be better than John Abraham, so he finds an apartment and leaves with three different faces (Nitu Chandra, Nargis Bagheri, Daisy Boppana).
