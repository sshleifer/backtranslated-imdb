Another silent film of Hitchcock love triangle, not a mystery, but very English, very good shame and photographed. Black boxer Bob Corby (Ian Hunter) recruits Jack Sander (Carl Brisson), a circus boxer to be his sparring partner, in part to keep Mabel (scary enough), Mabel (Lilian Hall -Davis). There are a lot of character and grotesque characters at Jack's and Mabel's wedding, the verger that sits in the corridor of the church, is shocked by the very tall and very short men's eyes, the fat lady, the twins who, of course, the aisle to sit, and the wedding feast is fun. The rest of the movie loses Jack leaving Mabel and returning back to his heart or something like that. It was another epoch, with the audience in the evening dress, and the boxers also dressed when they came out of the ring. Room angles, rhythm, use of symbols, cutting - all very elegant and great. Working with the camera and editing the last boxing match are very important. Brisson's art is well-used in it; his smile is not so forgotten about what's happening around him, as it is in Hitchcock's dummy, and it's not annoying. But can boxers have such shrubs?
