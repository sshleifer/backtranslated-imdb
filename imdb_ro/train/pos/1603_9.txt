I am very surprised that this film did not get a higher rating for IMDB. It's one of those movies that one could easily get by someone, but for the romantic comedy "Moonstruck" is really in a class by itself. Setting up and ethnic charm are the things people seem to accept. Only casting makes an almost perfect film. Some movies from the 1980s were as good as "Moonstruck" and it's fun too. **** of *****
