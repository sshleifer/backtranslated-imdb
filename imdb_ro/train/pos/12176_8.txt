Paul (Jason Lee) is a boy who happens to engage in a princess's actress named Karen (Selma Blair). She chooses her clothes and daily schedule. At the bachelor party, Paul gets a little drunk and ends up with a pretty dancer, called Becky (Julia Stiles), back to his excavations. "Nothing has happened," as the saying goes, but the duo wakes up in the same bed. Suddenly Karen phones. She's headed for Paul's apartment. Paul obviously removes Becky, though her panties are left behind. But there is even more fun before. At a family dinner at Karen's parents' house, Paul goes back to Becky, learning that he's Karen's cousin. Talk about some explanations to do! But instead, Paul chooses to pretend a stomach problem and hides himself in the bathroom. Will Karen ever find out that Becky spent the night at Paul's place? And what will be the consequences? I'm sorry for the critics filming such films. They should certainly relieve themselves because this film is fresh and fun. Of course, it's not a bad thing that Lee is a funny man, Stiles is a charming beauty or that Blair is a natural but logical but anal engagement. The rest of the cast, including James Brolin and Julie Haggerty, is also pretty nice. The appearance of the movie is great, just like the California costumes and settings. Best of all, the script is imaginative and inspired, creating great laughter for the audience. In short, if you want to joke funnybones, get this movie tonight. It may not be the Academy Award, but it is absolutely guaranteed to turn a bad day into a good day.
