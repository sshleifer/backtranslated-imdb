Wonderful and fun with two very different brothers, who are not just so-called "beginners of fire" (think of Stephen King's snore-fest about a book of the same name) but also forever in contradiction with a woman who has a bad habit of being a pirate! Particularly special effects (especially to the end), strange performances of a highly talented trio of actors and a very interesting and strange soundtrack, eventually make "Wilder Napalm" a unique treatment of a movie to watch. .. if you can find this is it! In a personal note, I was fortunate enough to rip it (like I say so) from the two-dollar basket from my local video rental store. (*** of *****)
