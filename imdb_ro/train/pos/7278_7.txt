Ghosts That Still Walk is one of those movies that takes you and does not let you down, especially when you see a child. Seeing the film as an adult, you have to admit it's not that terrifying, but the story is very fascinating and contains a lot of mysterious scenes (especially those with a terrible mummy). <br /> <br /> One of the best scenes in the film is undoubtedly the scene with grandfather and grandmother in their new RV; the rock scene is very exciting and quite scary. Also, scenes in which the main character discovers her mother's secret is quite frightening. Well, the act in the movie is not so great and the movie sometimes seems to be a bit boring, but in general Ghosts That Still Walk is fun. Too bad just a few people have seen this movie, this movie is really worth it. I just want to say, Mr. Flocker, you did a good job! And for all Hollywood producers there; If you want to remake a movie, remake it!
