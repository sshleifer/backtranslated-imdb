I found the film to be the usual French slit in front of America. The camera, too often, focuses on people with fat, unwanted dwellings and crowded rural areas. While the story seems to sympathize with and admire the young people in the city who are introduced to the movie, the cinema exploits and destroys them. There were, of course, thin people to be seen in Glencoe and well-organized houses, but Malle chose to show us the worst of what was to be seen. <br /> <br /> I can only hope that some American producers will go to France to disclose to the American public its most serious elements. I can assure you, as a frequent visitor in France, that everything is not good there. Foreign immigrants are not easily assimilated, generating serious social inequalities. But Americans are not eager to discover the French for their prejudices against their compatriots and their envy with the US, so we are not likely to see films on the subject.
