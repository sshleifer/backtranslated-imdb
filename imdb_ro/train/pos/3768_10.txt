I realize that many people hate this movie, but I have to admit it's one of my favorites. I feel better than its predecessor and I'm glad to like better than many movies. First of all, I think people do not give the story any credit, like Back to the Future, Time The journey is hard to write, and Time Travel and a spiritual journey included in this movie. I also feel that Keanu and Alex were on the best shows in this movie, they looked colder, and said cooler things. The design set by this movie is also awsome The sets are quite detailed and massive at times and it can be hard to believe that these sets were made for a movie about two teenage buds that can hardly spell ... but it's not that genius of the entire franchise, making these two idiots bigger than the characters of life that are responsible for the whole utopian future of the earth. The design of the costume was awsome as well. Bill and Ted actually look cool in Bogus Journey, where, as in Extreme Adventure, it looks like it would be FAGS !!! Even the music in this movie is awsome, especially the score. There's so much about this movie, because I love him. But this is one of those movies I grew up in, watching and every time I liked more, so I can understand why people hate or just think of their Bogus compared to the excellent adventure (which I also love her). <br /> HELP WITH YOUR SELF!
