If you come in the movie with expectations, throw them now, because no amount of hype will do that movie right. To classify this film in a single genre would be a criminal. It's a spy thriller, it has noir elements, bits and action tracks, science fiction and cyberpunk all tied together with a brilliant story of narrative, tilt of the mind and superb cinema. A lot of the comments here focused on the fact that they are derived, both in good and bad, from other films. But, as they say, every Shakespeare rooster story, so once you get through it, you'll take a walk. You must suspend your unbelief in certain points, and while the set never becomes unbelievable, there are portions (read: elevator) that suffer from a low budget and somewhat visual cheesy. Do not move this to mean it's on the same level as sci-fi movies, because that's on a much higher level. If you are looking for an action, you should turn away. This is pure psychology. But if you are willing to sit down and devote 90 minutes of your life to a romantic cinematic experience, by all means, DO NOW! Watch this movie now before it's cool to have seen it!
