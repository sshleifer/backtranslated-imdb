This movie is basically shot on a hand-held room by the actors in it. In some ways, a mockumentary in other ways a video log from the killers is full of a "Columbine" style attack. While this movie does not answer all the big questions, it gives you insight into how easy it is to get rid of. Through the film, you are shown how actors have illegally shortened their guns, made pipe bombs, and came up with a Zero Zero action plan. The actors (if you can call them) were brilliant, obviously borrowed hard from their own lives, but at no time did they really detect them acting (Something Tom Cruise should try) . Using CCTV and 911 at the end was brilliant, but I'm not sure if I needed the last scene. Overall, although a very good movie on a very hard subject.
