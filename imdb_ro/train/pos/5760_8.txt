My roommate has ordered this one from the web, while I finally got to see him. It's rough. It's noisy. It's pretty stupid ... but it's also a lot of fun. I mean, it was the funniest thing I've ever seen a movie like this since "City Of The Walking Dead" has gone a long time ago. It was like being back to the old Drive-In Theater! You could tell the guy who made this movie all horrible zombie movies. It has all the clich√©s and tricks of those films that have rolled in one part and is cared for because it is SUPPOSIBLE to be so. The cheeze factor is high, the gore is flowing and laughing! The effects go from negligence to good, with the one in which the guy breaks in half and the one in which a guy makes his heart tight through his chest, both of which are excellent! The actor goes from terrible to good enough. There is not much plot, just a bunch of gore. This is modeled after the zombie films in Italy and Spain, I think, because they are sitting on the rough scenes forever, like this movie. If you like Troma, cheezy B-grade movies then you can not do anything wrong by following this. A great way to lose a Friday night!
