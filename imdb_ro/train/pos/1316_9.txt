I just finished watching this wonderful and well-played / directed film. It was a blow and suspicion if I lost my time watching a movie on the Lifetime Movie network due to distorted advertisements. Reading the previous comments convinced me to give him a chance. After all the worst things that might happen would be that I could fall asleep during one of the boring, but still long, scratches. Why did I look? firstly because when IMDB produces a movie, a "DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT" of 5.8 CINEMA STATISTICAL STATISTICS was 7.3. It must be a safe shot. I was totally delighted that I had time to watch this movie, and so on. Helen Hunt continues to amaze me with her ability to take on difficult roles, adapting her basic character to fit each role. The portrait he painted in this tough yet perceptual film was beautifully executed. When the scene appeals to a verbal act with a quick, timely understanding, it can stand upright with any actor. However, she is adept at delivering volumes of emotional response without saying a word based only on facial expression and body language. Without ads, which, by design, kills the continuity of any good film, it would have been a true bitter angle. I gave her a 9.0
