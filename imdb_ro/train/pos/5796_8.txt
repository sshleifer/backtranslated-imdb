Moonwalker is a Fantasy music movie with Michael Jackson with different segments. I will evaluate each individual segment. <br /> <br /> Segment 1 opens the movie with a Music video. The music video is a concert of Michael Jackson, who plays the song "The Man in the Mirror," the music video also features historical figures like Gandhi, King Martin Luther JR, John Lennon and many more. The first segment was a good choice to open the movie that I liked the song and also loved mounting the historical figures. I really enjoyed the message in the song. I get the first segment on 9/10. Segment 2 shows Michael Jackson's start at Jackson 5 on his solo career. The installation was well done, I liked the animation they put in it and I also liked their choices of songs such as "I want you back, Beat it, Thriller, feel this and the way where you feel. " The only thing I would like to have done a little better in one of the pieces is "We are the world." The reason why everything you see is rain drops, and those drops are Michael Jackson's pictures and celebrity choir, but it's a little hard to see the choir. Apart from the fact that the segment is still good. I give it a 9/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 3 is the Bad song. You probably think Michael Jackson's video is bad, well yes and no. This segment is the Music video, but is re-edited by Kids. The segment was nice, but it was not as good as the other segments. I give it a segment of 6/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 4 is a short film Claymation Music, which takes place after the version of the child called "Speed ​​Demon". Brief is Michael Jackson being watched by his fans and his beloved press and he disguises himself as a rabbit and ride a motorcycle to try to get rid of them. The plague in the tracking sequence was great, but some parts of the film Claymation characters seemed a little fake when interacting with real people. Also, at the end of the movie from nowhere, Michael Jackson's rabbit costume comes back to life and dances with him. I liked the dance, but it was like I was not. I give her a segment of 8/10 <br /> <br /> The 5th segment is Michael Jackson's winner, Grammy, the "Leave Me Peace" video. The music video is about the mass-media that is hitting his nose in Michael Jackson's personal life, and Michael Jackson feels he will not leave him alone, no matter how much he has proven innocent. The music video really speaks (but keep in mind that this happened before the child molesting this just about his rumors in the 80s.) But I did not feel this Video should be in this movie because it's a movie for children and does not believe that the child will understand what he is playing. We gave this musical video 8/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 6 leads us to the main story of the whole movie called Smooth Criminal. Michael Jackson plays a gangster who uses his star powers to protect children (including John Lennon's son, Sean Lennon), a Big Evil Bigg (Joe Pesci). The segment I thought made the film especially when she danced and sang the song "Smooth Criminal" with a bunch of criminals. I also thought the special effects were good. The strange thing about the segment is why the kids are dating an elderly man who has not explained why. Also, Joe Pesci's character talks about Drugs and what he plans to do with them. I mean why you talk about drugs in a movie for kids. Otherwise, she was fine. My rating for this segment is 8/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 7 is the final segment of the whole movie. The film ends with Michael Jackson singing a cover version of Beatle's "Come Together", and then during the credit we see Michael Jackson singing with Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Michael made a good cover of "Come Together," and I think it was a good idea to put a bunch of good singers with a talented musician like him. My rating is 9/10 <br /> <br /> This movie is a good Michael Jackson movie I think it really brings children's imagination. The movie is almost as imaginative as the animated Beatles movie "Yellow Submarine" if you like Michael Jackson and you are at a movie with a lot of creativity this movie is. My overall rating for this movie is 8/10
