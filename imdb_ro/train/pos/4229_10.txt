Do not waste time reading my review. Go out and see this amazingly good episode that can be the best Columbo ever written! Ruth Gordon is perfectly interpreted as a mystery writer, but still charming, killing her son-in-law to avenge the killing of her daughter. Columbo is his normal, broken and smarter than himself, and this particular rate is a fantastic chemistry between Gordon and Falk. Ironically, this was not written by the creators announced by Levinson or Link, but it is possibly the most dense, the most complete and original plot full of Columbo returns. Satisfactory welcome in almost all departments and full of wise and droll thinking and dialogue. A truly unexpected and inventive culmination achieves everything. 10/10 ... look for this on Netflix!
