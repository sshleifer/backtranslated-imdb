After reading some of the other comments, I was expecting something really terrible, but I was pleasantly surprised. REALITY CHECK: The original series was not that good. I think some people remember with more affection than they deserve, but, apart from the car's chases and Daisy Duke's feet, the scenarios were poor and inappropriate. The Duke boys were too smart and cute for the hicks, and Boss Hog squeaked was too shabby to be sorry, and Rosco was just hyper at every moment of the screen. It's amazing that the series actually lasted as long as it did because it ran out of story lines during the first evening. Back to the movie. If you watch this movie itself, not as a direct comparison with the TV series, it is not bad at all. The real star is, of course, General Lee. Hunting machines and stunts are excellent and that's exactly what D.O.H. it's all about. Johnny Knoxville is his usual eccentric self and along with Seann William Scott as Cousin Bo, the pair make this movie really funny in a crazy and cute way like the TV series never did. Wonderful Jessica Simpson is born as Miss Daisy, Burt Reynolds makes a much better improvement of Boss Hog and M.C. Gainey makes a Rosco P. Coltrane credible, as it should have always been. If you do not like hurtful humor and mad cascades, then you will not be watching this movie because you should know what to expect. Otherwise, if you want a fun car-action movie movie with some good laughs that do not really tax the brain, then go to see this pleasant thing with an open mind.
