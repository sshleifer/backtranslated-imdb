I first heard this movie after buying the 1971 movie "Snuff". I was told that the Devil's Experiment was much better, so naturally I went and ordered the set of Guinea Pig cages. I was really interested in hearing that Charlie Sheen went out trying to forbid either this movie or the second, so my interest peaked. The Devil experiment is a storyless short story. Only 3 men tortured a woman for about 45 minutes. They torture her in various ways, such as beating her, turning her around in circles, and then forcing her to drink alcohol, forcing her to listen to long-loud noise for 24 hours, crushing her hand with a hammer, burning and wrinkling the burns, throwing the courage at her and finally pushing a pointed needle through the eyes. I have to say that a lot of this movie was fake, like the scenes of beating. But then, some of them were actually well done to the extent that they sum you up. The scenes in which the woman was spinning in circles made me dizzy to follow her. Or the scene in which she is forced to listen to sharp noise for 24 hours is painfully thoughtful. The worst is the scene of the eye. I did not obstruct when I saw him, but I simply thought, "Damn, that looks pretty good for such a low budget movie." I liked the movement, but I do not know if I can really recommend this if you have not seen the majority of what the horror genre has to offer. 7/10
