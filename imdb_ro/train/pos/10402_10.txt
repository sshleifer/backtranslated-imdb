I first saw Thief as a child who makes me almost as old as Jinn. Like any other child, I was delighted with the imagination, inventiveness and energy of the film. A few years later, I realized how much satire and intelligence of the scenario I lost in my first view. I have not been able to look at her over the last few years. In addition to the scenario, production transcends the genre of fantasy. This is Korda, the best storyteller. When you see the thief as a child, you know you had a wonderful time. When you see Thief as an adult, you know you've seen a masterpiece. It is as endless as the story it treats. An amazing work. Thomas McCarthy
