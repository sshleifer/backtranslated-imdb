Do not look for a surplus graphic line here ... just sit back with some popcorn and enjoy it. A gallery of stars appears as classic cartoon characters in this live action comedy that offers incredible makeup and set design, not to mention the knockout performances of Beatty, Madonna and Pacino. Great fun for children and adults. <br /> <br /> *** from ****
