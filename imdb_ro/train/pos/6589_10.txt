I liked this show from the first broadcast and I always waited to watch each episode every week. Behavior, characters, writing, special affections were remarkable! Then the science fiction channel hurt again and canceled a very interesting and well-written show. I say bring it back, I know all the actors would come back. I would suggest buying DVDs, I am. I hope that SF channel managers get these comments and realize they have to get more involved with their viewers. I'm just watching a show on this channel now (Ghost Hunters), but I'm pretty sure they'll soon be canceling that too.
