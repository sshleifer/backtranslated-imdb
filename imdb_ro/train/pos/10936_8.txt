Most martial arts films from the age of 70 (and the 80's) do not work as movies; usually there are some well-planned battle sequences, but the plot is scrawled thin enough to fill the gaps between these nodes - such as porn movies, indeed. But this does some good things. Clearly, there is direction and choreography, which limits every fighter to a "style" - is really based on Chinese acrobatic circus and comedy drama, but the effect works. Secondly, there is camera language that uses some impressive techniques (even by the current measure), changing real-time slow motion projection speeds and unfiltered filters to filters to illustrate the direction of the story to the past or to the future . <br /> <br /> The least obvious, but the most powerful and unexpected, is the construction. The winner of this contest is determined by who "reveals" the story. Master (writer) creates a game in which the main character does not know who he is looking for, which is the same situation in which we are the spectators. One by one, he determines who is who, at the same rate we find who he is. Everything follows a tragedy / a noir arch. The end tends to irony at "The Sting". It's a lot smarter than what we usually get out of this kind. The idea of ​​"the Five Venues" is the model for Tarantino's "dead vampire killers" in the "Kill Bill" volumes.
