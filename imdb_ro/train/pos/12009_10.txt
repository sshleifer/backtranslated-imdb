I really thought they did a great job, there was nothing wrong with that, I do not know how they could say the first commentator would have been terrible, they moved me to tears (I think everyone moved to tears) , but I'm not trying to complain about a movie because it's embarrassing, but it took me. It was very good! I hope it will launch them on DVD because I will definitely buy a copy! I feel he has renewed my faith and gave me a hope that I can not explain, made me want to strive to be a better person, have gone through so much, and I think we should, I guess. Compared to that, I feel like my own attempts are nothing. Well, not anything, but they do not fit hard with what they had to go through. I liked. Who played Emma ?!
