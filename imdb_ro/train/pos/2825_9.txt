This movie was a pretty big surprise. I did not expect too much to be honest. Greta Garbo first Hollywood movie? So what? Probably tough and with the usual exaggerated counters of arms and face movements that often show quiet, low-quality films. Well, I was wrong. Greta Garbo just has to shock students as much as I did, because this movie made her a star and, of course, like that. She instinctively understood the power to stand or simply to wear a meaningful expression for a long time, so that its effect was felt and not just seen. I always thought about myself, how did this modern actress get into a silent movie? She was only years and years before her time. The story is not so interesting, it is the usual story of love found and lost. It's just Garbo's show that Leonora, a poor girl who does good in the big city and then returns to bring the man who escaped, which gives him life. Co-star Ricardo Cortez is a servant, but his character is never developed and is disguised by the scenario throughout. At one point, he is forced to wear Garbo's clothes, to go into a huff, then return ruthlessly and give them back. And let's not talk about his horrible final scenes with Garbo and then with his wife. As usual, he did not have a lot of career after that, and I understand why. But it is sufficient as a somewhat mysterious object of Leonora's obsession. There is an extremely fantastic line in this movie that says just about everything. - Leonora, you're obvious. Yes, really visible. If you really want to know what it's all about without seeing the whole movie, just look in the last 30 seconds or so - Garbo's glance when she's alone in her luxury car. "She has to be so happy, she has everything she wants" - yes, Garbo's face says it all. I have to see this again, Garbo is amazing.
