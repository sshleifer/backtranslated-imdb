I gave this movie on 10/10 with some reticence, because it is hard to praise something that so haunted me and terrified me for years. All the threat faced by the woman with the black face is just a pure horror, and the accompanying music just makes the horror worse. <br /> <br /> I saw this when he was the first time on television when I was 10 and even bothering me for years. I am fascinated by the fact that so many other users have said this. So many reviews of the film relate to how disturbing or terrifying a movie might be, but you can believe everyone who posted on this forum, this is really incredibly powerful. I mean, I really like horror films and generally find them funny more often than not, but this is really threatening and probably disturbs most people. I have not seen her since I was 10 years old and I'm tempted to see her again, but I'm afraid I might have sleepless nights. I can not put my finger exactly on what is exactly, but I think it is related to the fact that fear is the woman's biggest weapon and that we, as spectators, are just as sensitive as we feel so much fear. It is remarkable that the feelings of other viewers are so unanimous. I also saw the stage song, which was an excellent production ... but nothing can compare to that.
