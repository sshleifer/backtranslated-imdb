This version of Anna Christie is in German. Greta Garbo plays Anna Christie again, but all the other characters have actors different from the English version. Both were filmed backwards because Garbo had such a story in Germany. Garbo herself preferred Anna Christie in this version over the English version. It's a good story and a must-see for Garbo fans.
