Excellent film. The whole picture was filmed in Budapest, so I feel proud. My little problem was that the film trains belonged to the Hungarian State Railways (M√ÅV) and it is clear that they were used in the big train, not the local railway - according to the story that Chikatilo took its victims to stations local railways. Besides, the movie is superb.
