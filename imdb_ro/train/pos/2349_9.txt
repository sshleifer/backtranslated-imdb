It's a pleasure to see such creativity again on TV. This show is poetic, artistic and fun. Characters relate well and writing is not bad (I think it will improve as they get their feet). Definitely worth a look. Girls steal the show so far in this series. Chuck is adorable like Olive. The two aunts are a delight. I sincerely hope to write them in larger parts because they are magical. Well, that's all news that's right for printing. Go make a big bowl of popcorn and enjoy some fun in an old-fashioned way. This is like Dr. Seuss for adults.
