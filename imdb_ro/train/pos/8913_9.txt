This is my favorite classic. He was filmed a bit west of Philadelphia, PA when I was 13 years old in 1957 and we launched next year. Then, in 1970, I seemed to be working in the same county as a PA State Trooper. I always enjoyed checking all the places where scenes were shot. I knew the owner of the Downingtown Diner restaurant, and he had a sign of a way ahead, telling all the drivers that this was the "roof house." The theater scene was in Phoenixville near Forge Park and still shows movies today!
