First of all, this is a great series, although we have some sort of James Bond effect. What I mean is that while the new Casino Royale takes place in 2006, it is chronologically the first adventure of 007, Dr. No (1962) being second, while in Golden Eye, the first film with Pierce Brosnan, Judi Dench as a new substitute for the male "M" as it might have been in the beginning before Bond became a double-0, except that she is 14 years old? This is more or less a "poetic" license to be delighted. We have to turn our head a little if we want to be entertained. No, the new Star Trek movie has no primitive electronics of the original series nearly half a century ago. In the 1960s, communicators were fantastic. (now we call them mobile phones) and instead of the buttons there were sliding levers. OMG, do you think 400 years later would have perfected Rogaine for Jean-Luc Picard? So, please, give manufacturers a certain degree of freedom. But to try to make things a bit consistent, let's just think about creating the Cylons just 60 years before the end of the Battlestar Galactica. If so, where do all the Cylons that have populated the original earth come from? We know that technology exists for spontaneous jumps through space. Well, what happened if one of the Cyclon ships in war with the Caprica fleet was fired or there was a sun or anything else and a ship loaded with Cylonian-looking human beings who finished not only by jumping through space but also through a thousand or ten thousand years, with a buried ship near Earth One. They colonized it, found it could repopulate it and eventually destroyed it, but not before they sent a fleet to search for the legendary Caprica, just to find a habitable, yet unpopulated planet, which they colonized to become the people who eventually invented the Cylons. The Paradox of Time? Of course. What came first, the chicken or the road? Who cares? It's fun fun!
