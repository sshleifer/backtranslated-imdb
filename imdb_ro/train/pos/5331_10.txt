just saw it on the sky TV missed the first half an hour. I was wondering if it was a true story, so I saw it all the way. there was no amount at the end to tell what happened to everyone. reminded me of the speed, but at the end of the day I do not think it was released at the cinema as I saw the following error. that we saw was pulling out the hood (hood) and then later two pictures of the car with the police car in front trying to slow it down when the hood is back. put me on the edge of the chair, especially when I thought the baby was going to hit the bridge and of course when the bridge was not going to be lowered and then it was. I'm afraid I burst into tears, so it was not so bad !!!!
