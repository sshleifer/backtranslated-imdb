This movie is close to being my favorite celluloid piece. I do not really need or I want to say here. Except for "See this movie" and "Enjoy the excellent work of Daniel and Pascal", which brings you through this clean, funny and unimaginable story about the "Eighth Party" - your day! <br /> <br /> Watching this movie made me think seriously about the way I spend the eighth day = my life! It seems that some of us are wasting precious time doing the things we think we have to do. Whether it's like a career or just eating TV shows and gambling. What we tend to lose is the satisfaction of being something for another person - make a difference. About taking place and time to be spontaneous and live - NOW! (on the eighth day) ... At least that's what I received from "Eighth Day."
