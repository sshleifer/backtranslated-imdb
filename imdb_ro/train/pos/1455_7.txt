Mardi Gras: Made in China is an excellent film that describes how two cultures have much in common, but they are not even aware of the influence each society has on each other. David Redmon opens his eyes and lets you see how Chinese workers manufacture beads that cost little to nothing and are sold in America for up to $ 20. When Redmon asks the Americans where the beads came from, they had no clue and seemed to be grounded. When he told them they were made in China for less than horrific payments and unacceptable working conditions, the Americans seemed sad, wounded and a little regretted, but they did not seem to stop buying the beads after they learned the truth. When Redmon asked the Chinese workers, they did not know that the Americans wore it over his neck and paid so much for these beads. The workers laughed at what purpose they were behind the beads and could not believe it. This movie is a great movie that gives us something to think about in other countries besides ours. <br /> <br /> M. Pitts
