I think everyone needs to come back at some point. And that's what makes Jack Dundee (Robin Williams), who feels in shame, he plans to do in "The Best Time." Yes, the man who went mad with radio in "Good Morning, Vietnam" is playing football. In this case, he is trying to play a game that cost a high school a prestigious title. But ex-teammate Reno Hightower (Kurt Russell) is not just going to go along with her so easily. Granted, it's not the best movie for every man. But Williams and Russell are actually quite a good comedy team. And some of the names in this movie are likely to give you chicks (say at least). Check it out.
