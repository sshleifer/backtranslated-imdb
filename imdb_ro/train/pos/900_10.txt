This is one of the best Bollywood films I've ever seen. Family and friends feel the same about it. This movie is truly romantic and dramatic at the same time. In my opinion, we need more films or movies like this to keep the culture of South Asia alive. Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao have acted very well in this case, too, their couple attracts many people to the movies. This is a movie to be seen, it is a romantic and romantic film. This film is also from the manufacturers of Hum Saath Saath Hain and Hum Apke Hain Kon. This movie is the best at this moment ... the film setting was beautiful, which is also a huge attraction. This movie is you must see ... recommended to everyone!
