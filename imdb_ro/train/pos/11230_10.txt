Hidden Frontier has been discussed and reported by several press agencies for their longstanding commitment to creating the best Star Trek stories and to provide an example of collaboration that was the mission of Gene Roddenberry. Their focus on homosexuality, depression, war, and acceptance of different races is on par with or exceeds those of other Trek series and films. The value of production began as smaller and more aggressive, but in the seven production seasons the act improved, the stories are more complex, the visual graphics became quieter and more impressive. In season 6 episode 1, Countermeasures, there is one of the greatest space battles in the history of Trek. Ships are well-played, and space battles are impressive and exciting. Real love for Frontier is not the ships or the background, but the people and the interaction and the growth of the characters. There are also nodes to other series and Trek movies with places and characters we all know. I recommend any Trek fan to check your Countermeasure and you will be hooked!
