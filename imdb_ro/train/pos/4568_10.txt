Seriously, can you imagine such a spread of talent in a movie without a huge budget: Daniel Day-Lewis, Ray McAnally, Brenda Fricker, Hugh O'Conor and Fiona Shaw? There is no doubt that Fricker and Day-Lewis deserved the awards, but it would have been entirely justified to have seen O'Conor (Young Christie) and McAnally: the clich√© is true here: they do not fulfill their roles I live. Day-Lewis performance is a power tour - a transformation that causes admiration, but it was truly an imprint of the Academy's intelligence, which along with this performance also honored Brenda Fricker's beautiful work as Christie's mother . By the way, if you have not seen this magnificent actress in "Swann," it's another movie that deserves to be checked for her contribution (and sublime Miranda Richardson).
