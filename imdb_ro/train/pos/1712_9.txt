This movie was disaster at Box Office, and the reason behind it is the innocence of the film, the sweetness of the story. The music was good, the story is very simple and old, but the presentation of such a story is very good, the director tried the best. Abhay is excellent and impressive and shines again in his role, has done everything in his comedy or emotional scene. Soha looks so sweet in the movie. The cast cast was simply fine. Music and all the songs are good, Himesh is impressive as an interpreter here. Do not miss this movie, it's a great movie and a good feeling for us. Abhay to work the best so far. I'll give 9/10 to Ahista Ahista.
