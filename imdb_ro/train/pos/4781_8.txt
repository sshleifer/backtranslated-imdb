MULHOLLAND DRIVE has made me the definitive fan of David Lynch. He is a modern genius, because he is not just a film producer. His stories and style have a spell that crosses the screen. Therefore, STORY STYLE was a surprise to me, with easy to follow story and sunny sets. However, Lynch is there and, while this is far from the best, is a movie that should not be missed. Late Richard Farnsworth's performance is one of the reasons. 8/10
