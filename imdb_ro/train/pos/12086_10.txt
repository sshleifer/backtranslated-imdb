Wonderful drama / family comedy with MacClaine and Garr who entertains and heats it every time I see it. Firmly recommended for all ages from the age of 9 to grandparents. The beautiful story of the year 1962. The story includes Garr, his two children and Aunt Zena (MacClaine) trying to meet without a man being the head of the household. The family is heading west to take the legacy of a forgotten relative who left Garr to collapse, a café on the road in the late 1940s. The tenacious garrison, like a sweet but determined mother, brings the entire family to restoration and opening of the café. But wait ... Aunt Zena is an old circus performer with book tricks, magic powders and a sense of joy humor ... ... loves kids and them in stupid and sometimes dangerous games. ... What happens next, is a delightful combination of "Miracle at Lords," thrown together with Cuban rocket crashes (with authentic TV news from the real event) and a "ghost" joke that is completely out hand. This film distracts, philosophizes, casts doubt on religiosity, and provides an unwavering look at the terrifying fear of the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962. Finally, one is left with the wonder of faith, family, and rediscovered love. Oh, and the music of the early '60s is great! Recommend STRONG as a FEEL GOOD FILM 10 out 10
