Although this was obviously a low budget production, the performances and songs in this movie are worth seeing. One of Walken's musical roles so far. (he's a great dancer and singer and he's also demonstrating his acrobatic skills - watch the wheel!) He also plays Jason Connery. A wonderful story for children and very nice characters.
