Here I thought "Nanook in the North" was the last word in semi-doc archives "eskimo". How wrong! As a passionate sea kayaker, I stayed until 330 o'clock to look at it hoping to see a series of "leather boats." The film did not let me down. Any student of kayak / umiak construction should have a look - see here. (Note to ski colleagues: they seem to use Norton Sound kayaks with the only blades of blades). But the film has overtaken this narrow interest. Even though they have existed, as others have seen some fake little ones, the film has so much heart, it's just a little offense. It was (probably from the point of view of the highly amateur anthropologist) probably the perfect time to make this film. The thirties: "the words" are so new that they (including Louie B. Mayer!) Actually left the Inuit to speak in their own language. And there are so many things in spite of the authentic, infused melodrama. I'm really hit by the polar bear, whale, and caribou. A fifteen-year version of this movie would have been so brunette with "stars", Technicolor, etc. Seventy version? Not even. A great piece for this great film is "White Shadows in the Southern Seas" (1928). From a geographic point of view, the mirror image of "Eskimo" also deals with the deep and profound interruption of Western culture / technology over a people who do not.
