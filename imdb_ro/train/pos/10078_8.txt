It's a story that could have happened anywhere, given the right circumstances. Street fun attracting the attention of the famous opera star and the friendship that followed. The aging artist discovers / buys a male child to promote his art. From there, we pursue them through the rigors of their provocative but free life along the river. He travels the city to the city, does and has a certain degree of notoriety. Despite times and influences, man is good and good. In general, performances are primarily Xu Zhu, who plays the street performer. The child (Renying Zhou) is beautiful and powerful, with good resistance to obvious prejudices. The two protagonists, together with the support of the opera singer, master Liang (an interesting androgynous Zhao Zhigang), paint a very interesting story about forgiveness, sadness and love. Some have mentioned the remote similarities of the film with BA WANG BIE JI (FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE); however this film can not easily stand on its own, any resemblance at the highest level. <br /> <br /> My only calm with the Emperor of the Masks is the end. It was weak, clich√© and subtle like a noise. The audience has already been wrapped in the story, why was the useless manipulation? What a shame. To bring a cinematic image so far away, just to teach emotional pathology (and corny) like that. He honestly did this good film, instead of the classic, he should have. Beyond that, the KING OF THE MASCINS deserves a long time. I was happy to see the Shaw brothers still producing good movies. Highly recommended.
