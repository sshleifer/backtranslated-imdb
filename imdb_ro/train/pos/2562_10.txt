This is one of the greatest love story I've ever seen. Yes, I can agree that some parts may seem dated, but this does not distract the film's attention. We must try to observe, criticize, and enjoy any form of art from the perspective of time. Clearly, through the "Sex in the City" standards, Charlie Chaplin was terribly boring. However, when judged from America's perspective in 1925, it was fantastic. Also, Sayonara is a discoverer film in his gaze in a mixed race adventure, arrogance and American prejudices "manifests of destiny" and the complexity of different cultures. It's a natural step towards other films like the Gentleman Agreement. His goal, however, was not just a social comment, but rather fun and enjoyable, with countless lines that you do not forget. However, even when it's taken just as a love story, she's terrible. Although, some accent Brando's emphasis, he is at almost the best in hue and characterization. Buttons and Umeki (who have won the Oscar), and the rest of the supporting pieces add a lot to the film. So, the real star, has a fabulous job that makes you feel the passion he has for Brando, as he is broken by the sense of commitment and loyalty. Her speech when she first meets and talks with Brando is a classic and rare thing if she ever matches in cinema. The dialogue between Taka and Brando in her dressing room in Tokyo at the end of the film is just as good. Of course, it does not have the breath of the mouth, the spitting and the evil that exemplifies love in today's movies, but that is all the better. It expresses true love and passion, not just "warmth." If this movie does not touch you then you are too young, too cynical or dead.
