I have seen this movie many times and I will never get tired. It is a classic in every sense of the word. The movie is hysterically fun and yet quite exciting at the same time. For those who are not fans of "subtitles" or foreign movie in general, open your mind. This is a great movie for the "novice" because the story is so fun. Do not get me wrong, it's 100% Japanese (and that's what makes it work), but everyone will get something out of it (even if it's just a big laugh at one of the main characters called Mr. Aoki - one of the most funny characters I've ever seen!) I can not even think of this movie without smiles! I like ... and I think most people will.
