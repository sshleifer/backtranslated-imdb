This animation has a very simple and direct story, good for evil and has everything to do. What distinguishes it from other animations is how well animated human movements are. It was very nice to see the woman running on the screen from left to right and looking around, her movements were so good. Why do not I use this rotoscopic technique these days? It's pretty efficient. Fire and ice, in the prehistoric setting and the little dressed women, were clearly consecrated to show the beautiful woman in distress in various sexy ways, her voluptuous body serving as a pure cat. Some may hate it and consider it another masculine sexual fantasy, others (including a lot of women) will adore aesthetic quality. I certainly have not bothered! Bakshi just loves lush-nosed and voluptuous babes, as can be seen in the Cool World, and I do not think he has to apologize because it's a pretty big animation for adults. But I also enjoyed this animation as a child, and I never forgot. This was just special, so different from the standard Disney or Anime tariff, and for this reason alone deserves the clock when it is possible for Bakshi to be the best. For those who like animations with lush women: try and Space Adventure Cobra. Got fire and ice 8 out of 10.
