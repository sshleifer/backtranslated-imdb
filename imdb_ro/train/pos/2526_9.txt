Is awesome! In Story mode, switching from punk to pro. You need to complete goals that involve skating, driving and walking. You create your own skater and give it a name and you can make it look stupid or realistic. You are with your friend Eric throughout the game until he betray you and give you the start of the skateboard team (you can choose a team to be on) and then start your own team! There are many levels like New Jersey, Manhattan and even School II (not part of the story, though) from Pro Skater 2 by Tony Hawk. You can unlock secret skates like Iron Man, Gene Simmons and another skater. You can create your own goals such as SKATE letters, COMBO letters, Tricktris, Gap and many more. You can create the pedestrian lens and write what you are talking about. If you get bored to do this, you can do the premade objectives in premade parks. The only thing I did not like about this game was that it was sometimes hard to drive cars. 9/10.
