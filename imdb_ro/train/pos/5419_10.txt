This is an old, old-fashioned adventure thread. I understand that by today's political standards Indian treatment was unacceptable. But this move has nothing to do with politics. It's about action, dialogue, comedy, action, direction, music and photography and it's great for all these factors. Grant, Fairbanks and McLaglen are together, and Jaffe is great. This is the last friendly movie.
