He enjoyed this film in 1936 with a lot of veteran classic actors and, in particular, William Powell, (Dr. Lawrence Bradford), "Mister Roberts," who played the role of doctor and detective. Dr. Bradford married Jean Arthur (Paula Bradford), "Shane," and divorced, but they managed to live with each other and fight all the time. Paula wanted her husband to investigate a homicide and did everything he could to convince him that it was very important. Jean Arthur plays a pretty impatient guy and there's a lot of 1936 Comedy and the method of killing is something you'll never believe, especially with a jockey on a California Race Track. Robert Armstrong (Nick Martel) King Kong played the role of lighter with James Gleason, a detective who needs Dr. Bradford's help to solve this very strange mystery. If you see this movie, remember that it was produced and directed in 1936, and people in the audience believed that during this time it was great entertainment and it was even in DAY!
