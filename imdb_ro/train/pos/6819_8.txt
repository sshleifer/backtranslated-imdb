I found "Time At The Top" a fun and stimulating experience. The actor, while not generally brilliant, was perfectly acceptable and sometimes very good. Being a film that obviously targets younger demographics is certainly one of the best works of the genre (Sci-Fi for children). Normally, I would say Canada, UK and Australia produce the best movies and TV shows for kids, and "Time At The Top" does nothing to curtail this theory! I do not think continuity and great action are important to young people. A good plot and an imaginative scenario are more important to them. Both are abundant in this movie. The special effects are good without getting rid of the story, or shut down viewers from their own imaginations. It would have been very easy to inject an overload of SFX into this movie, but it would have completely destroyed its entire "Raison D'etre". <br /> <br /> Camera settings and work are a very high standard in this movie and complement the fine cabinet and historical precision. Overall, this film is very satisfying and I recommend it to all viewers who can see the world through the eyes of the children or through those who try to do it, just like me! Now, I have to really read the original book as soon as possible.
