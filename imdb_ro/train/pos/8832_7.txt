"Hey Babu Riba" is a film about a young woman, Mariana (nicknamed "Esther" after an American celebrity), and four young men, Glenn, Sacha, Kicha and Pop, all aged 15-17 in 1953 Belgrade, Yugoslavia . The five are friends and crazy friends about jazz, blue jeans, or anything else American seems. The very close relationship of adolescents is full of beatings and eventually a sacrifice is done willingly to try to help one of the group that has fallen into unexpected difficulties. After changing communist politics, they guided each other separately and reunified in 1985 (the year before the film was made). I liked the film with some reservations. Subtitles for one thing were difficult. Especially in the beginning, there were a series of dialogues that did not have subtitles. Perhaps the rhythm of conversation asks for it, but I have not always been able to read both the text and the absorption of the scene, which made me not always understand which character was involved. We watched the movie (a video from our public library) with a friend and none of us really understood part of the story about buying streptomycin for a sick relative. This Yugoslavian film of age has actually conveyed the adolescent's sensation of invulnerability, idealism, and strong and loyal ties between them. There is a leading role in the game, and it was interesting, keeping me guessing about who these characters were in relation to the 1953 cast and what actually happened. 7 out of 10 and would like to see other films by director Jovan Acin (1941-1991).
