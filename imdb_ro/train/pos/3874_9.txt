And I love Isabelle Blais !!! She was so cute in this movie, and she was much more different than her role in Quebec-Montreal, where she was more like a man-man. I think she should have been nominated for a Jutra. I mean, Syvlie Moreau was good, but Isabelle was much superior, IMO. Pelletier did a great job for the first time and I noticed he slipped in a couple of friends from Rock et Belles Oreilles, Guy A. LePage and Andre Ducharme. It was fun to see them in this, I did not know they would appear. I do not think I saw a romantic comedy in Quebec that I did not like and it's as good as anything I had the pleasure of seeing. And if you are in the States and wonder how you can get a copy of the DVD, www.archambault.ca delivered it to me in less than a week.
