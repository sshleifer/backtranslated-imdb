This is a wonderful movie about Mormon struggle and about their final settlement in Salt Lake, Utah. The beginning and the end are particularly strong, and the message is one that we all have to remember - God does not speak, but communicates, if we just listen. As I write this in the midst of the horrors that happen in New Orleans and the surrounding area of ​​Katrina, I was particularly excited by the fact that Mormons had to leave everything behind and move after Joseph Smith was assassinated. People have come to this country to escape religious persecution and yet they have been unable. The struggle of the Mormons to cross the country, the cost of their lives, the difficulties they have suffered were truly amazing, demonstrating their extraordinary power. Regarding the true beliefs of Mormons, this is not very difficult, and polygamy is mentioned, but it is not a central piece of the film at all. Distribution is of prime importance, although others who have commented know more about real characters and can talk about how true portraits are. But, as actors, Dean Jagger, Mary Astor, Brian Donlevy, John Carradine, Jane Darwell do well with the script they gave her. Although the film could have stayed alone on its own today) Tyrone Power and Linda Darnell were added to the distribution to gather crowds in cinemas to see a movie about Mormons. The power is marvelously beautiful as a young Mormon, and Darnell, like Zina, is not a Mormon, but remains with his family after his father is killed. Power does not have much to do until the end of the movie, when it has a big scene, and Darnell (still a teenager at the time of filming) has even less, though they make a wonderful couple. Their fate is left blurred with regard to her conversion and she asks for polygamy in their case. However, you can not beat none for eye candy.
