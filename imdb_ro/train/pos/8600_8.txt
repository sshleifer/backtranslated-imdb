There was some hesitation on my part about what this movie had to offer. For beginners, casting did not seem right. Kiefer Sutherland has already done well in "24" and the preview does not seem to offer any challenge to him or to the public. Eva Longoria left the room and the rest did not seem very interesting. When the movie was over, I was not completely dissatisfied with the fact that I saw a decent thriller that could have been much better, the responsible parties were more careful to watch the narrative gaps and to pay a little more attention to the development of character. I have seen threats of this type before, which made the main conflict more difficult for writers. As an audience, we do not want to resume the same old story again. We want to see something different, be excited and entertained. There is nothing wrong with pouring. From Kim Basinger's first lady's first lady. She is dealing with enough grace and sexual intercourse to make the memorable part. Michael Douglas was and has done this before. Unfortunately, the president is an entity that does not care for his fate. Sutherland rehashes the approach of the "24" tough guy, with enough power to make it big enough for the big screen, and Eva does an acceptable job as a newcomer. Do not expect too many twists and fireworks because some of the established classics ("Northwest North" and "The Fugitive" come to mind). Leave your expectations outside and enjoy the walk for whatever it may be. It's good.
