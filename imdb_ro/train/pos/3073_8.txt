This is the kind of film Hollywood needs to do more. No extravagant props, no trace of car, no intelligent lining. Only people who deal with being people. William Macy plays a high-potential attacker working for his father, Donald Sutherland. Macy is the responsible son, Sutherland is the domineering father. Son wants the business, the father will not let him. Macy loves his son, played beautifully by David Dorfman ("The Ring"). He also begins to fall in love with Neve Campbell, a girl he meets in the waiting room of his psychiatrist's office. It's an interesting juxtaposition of the characters, and the movie follows the reluctant killer as he balances his own with his family. There are many attractive scenes, especially between Macy and his boy. And as you'd expect in a movie with William Macy in it, it's a bit of humor. <br /> <br /> Excellent work around the actors and the director. It's good to know that I can still make a good Hollywood movie with a small budget.
