I read the other reviews and found someone to be a real-life comparison (for example, what is needed to get into the music school), Britney Bashing, etc., so focus on the movie and message. > <br /> We rated this movie 7 out of 10 for the age range from 8 to 14 years, and for a family movie. For the average adult man ... 2 out of 10. I like pop / rock music, I'm 45. I know about Britney Spears, but I never realized that she played stronger until I read credits and these reviews. I did not recognize her poster on the wall, so I'm not worried about any "own promotion". I watch movies to have fun. I do not care about casting, lighting, manufacturers, directors, etc. What is the movie and I am having fun. I watched this movie for the message. The biggest epidemic in the world is low self-esteem (which is a whole story altogether) as it was thought with mind in mind that this is an area of ​​interest. The film is bright, bright and shiny, great for children. I have learned that the Texan twang has begun to fade throughout the film and, of course, there are just so many ways to convey the message of giving up / leaving the message, so you were easy to predict. A big message, though ... should be more of them. This movie is a great family movie, but for a boy who looks at himself, leave Hannibal.
