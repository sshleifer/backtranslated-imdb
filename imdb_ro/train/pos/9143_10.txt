It seemed that 1984 was anything but the Orwellian nightmare, calculated to be with George Orwell's science fiction novel! 1984 turned out to be one of the happiest times in America's history! The evolution of the economy and the re-emergence of American fundamental values ​​have cultivated an idealistic aura of innocence resumed, which has been seen by the American people with a very good mood! In the past, there have been many classical movie performances, but the originals are almost always considered superior! "Purple Rain" is such a movie in this category! Made in 1984, "Purple Rain" offered a lucky eighty-year-old quality singer, lucky-lucky, embedded in making this great movie! Certain indicative artifacts from the eighties are really classic! Screamps comedies, accent neon clothing, and, of course, music! The music of the eighties is considered by experts to be the best decade for music in America's history! Located in Minneapolis, "Purple Rain" hosted the use of naive entertainment with the change of time. When I was young, I lived in Minneapolis for about eight months, when the white population was under 3%! By 1984, African Americans had made some roads in Minneapolis and therefore established a well-built culture of their own! The film "Purple Rain" evokes a stylistic outfit in the eighties and a whole ensemble of music, which captivated the audience's film effortlessly! I liked the music at "Purple Rain" and the innovative approach that this film has for the success of the confrontation is indeed brilliant! Watch this movie if you have not already seen it! The Prince has become an icon of eighty with this masterpiece! For a short time, he gave it to Kim Bassinger, he must do something right! "Purple Rain" put Prince on the map! This movie gets my harsh verdict from THUMBS UP !!!!
