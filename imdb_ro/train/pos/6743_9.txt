Dana Andrews is one of those actors I've probably seen in a dozen movies but never really recorded me. Often strident, taciturn, playing the same roles and showing just like Glenn Ford undervalued in a similar way, is an actor who strives to truly appreciate; but once you hit the right movie .... And that's it. Preminger's upscale at New York's underground is as dirty and dirty as almost any 50 noir, and Andrews is in his element as a too-tough cop Mark Dixon who just does not know how to play the game to move on : hates criminals too much to always play the rules. At the beginning of the film, he accidentally killed a crime scene involving an illegal game of gunfire created by a mobster whom Dixon hates for personal reasons, and he spends the rest of the film trying to cover his involvement and bring the mobster his way of "justice". Along the way, she gets involved with the strange wife of the man she killed (Gene Tierney), and she also has to try to get her father off the hook for killing. The photo amazed by Joseph LaShelle, with Ben Hecht's tough and shining dialogue and a really strong end with elements of tragedy and found gracefully in just a minute or two, is another noir all the time and it could be my movie Preminger favorite so far - well, as Laura announced more.
