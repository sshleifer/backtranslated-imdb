A talking parrot is not an extremely imaginative idea for a new film, but Paulie turns a simple idea into a brilliant film, the heart that will delight the whole family. During the separation of Marie and Paulie, he manages to put an end to the gap between sentimental rubbish and brutal hardness, and all the events in the film lead to an extremely satisfying emotional conclusion. Animal training is well done - everyone will be affected when Paulie stretches out his wings and flies for the first time. Paulie is an extraordinary character and should have been much more successful, though this film was not a climax of 1998, unlike Ryan's private salvation. This hour and a half will certainly be a pleasant one and one that you will remember. Paulie's story is a cool, sad, happy, and exciting - from the moment it's first seen until it's united with its original owner, you'll enjoy it by watching him learn about friendship and the grim realities of life along the way. You do not have to miss if you have any kind of heart or emotion. 9/10
