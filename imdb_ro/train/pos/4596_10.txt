This is Jackie Chan's best movie and my personal favorite. After the US disappointed he did "The Protector" directed by James Glickenhaus, Jackie took the concept and put it in Hong Kong. This is probably the most violent movie Jackies, with the audience timing at banging stunts. The action is fast and angry, Jackie and his crew have really done maximum effort in the design of the fight. The bones were broken and the blood shed in the process of making this film as you will see in credits. The script is a simple matter of cops and robbers, nothing special, as it was written around the action. I have to say that the English version has a double double, but it should not put you too much. <br /> <br /> So take your beats, open the beers and enjoy yourself. By the way, the movie was nicknamed "Glass Story" by the stunt team. Why? I'll let you know for yourself!
