Freddy Krueger, the stalker of dreams on Elm Street returns, the character of the great character Robert Englund returns to this continuation of nightmare 5, dream child.i hope to receive the correct number.Here were so many and this is one of the most good for the casinos: Rosanne Barr (then Arnold) Tom Arnold, johnny depp (who made the first nightmare in 84) alice cooper (singer) you will see Freddy as a tortured child, a teenager who loves the pain and a family type (creepy) the effects are very funny and creative, including Lisa Zane (Billy's sister) Breckin Meyer (road trip) yaphet kotto (alien, alive and die) and Amanda Donahue one of the 3 this in 3d, and at the end of the movie. I love 3d movies.i missed the first 3d wave in 1953 (I was not born yet), the second wave was in 1983 like all the Freddy movies. it is remarkable that one of the best that did not count the first, who was absolutely brilliant, Freddy became the new monster of the '80s and' 90s, along with Jason voorhees, chucky, micheal myers and skin face.can do you imagine a movie with all this? I recommend this to all Freddy fans and horror fans alike.that Freddy is such a cut up.8 out of 10.
