I've seen The Running Man a few times since I'm a Stephen King fan and I have all his movies, but now it's even better because until two days ago I did not know about this site and I did not realize that Paul Michael Glaser, who was involved in this movie, was the same Paul Michael Glaser as watching TV Starsky and Hutch. For me this is a pleasant surprise, because I can not tell you how many times I cried when Starsky or Hutch were injured. The episode in which Starsky (Kill Starsky) almost died We cried so hard My father had to walk away from the show. What do you expect from a child at the age of 12? Now, I'm deliberately looking for movies and programs involving Paul or David Soul and all Stephen King's hands are so much there !!!!!!!! I just have to say Happy Birthday Paul !!!!!
