I liked Antz, but I loved "The Life of a Stick". The animation that was put into it was paid. I will definitely be on DVD. By the way, Disney should make a large-scale version of this movie on tape. (I heard talking to break all characters on the screen to standard video). Most will have to agree that the final credits were the most funny! I saw only one of the two sets, but I can not see the other!
