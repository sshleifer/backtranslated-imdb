Let's remove any discussion about using non-Asian actors playing Asian roles. The film is 67 years old. In 1937, studio executives believed that any actor could / should play any role. The actors were in contracts and they were not always able to choose what role they played. The end of the story. This is a truly epic story of love, individual rights, class layers, and men / women issues. In the center of the film there are two brilliant shows by Luise Rainer and Paul Muni. <br /> <br /> Muni interprets Wang, a Chinese farmer who is about to take a wife (Rainer). From the beginning, she treats her with respect, at a time when women are seen as more help than hired. Without giving too much of the film, they go through the heights and minuses of all relationships, and even if the story can happen at the end of the nineteenth / early twentieth century, the story and many of their feelings seem credible. > <br /> <br /> Aside from the fact that the movie is about 5-10 minutes longer than it should be, and Charley Grapewin and Walter Connolly's performances are typical of the 1930s cartoon, this is a great movie that unfortunately , has become a victim of political correctness. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
