I've seen a lot of movies, but "In Cold Blood" is alone in the classroom. Excellent in every department. The fact that it contains a few big stars helps push it over the top, while paying more attention to their characters and stories than the brand name. Blake and Wilson transform the stellar performances of the killer duo. The fact that much of the movies are filmed in the crime scene, even inside the house, adds extra chills. The black and white photo darkens the mood and the photo is magnificent. There are many remarkable cinematic works there, but if I could only vote for a top one, it would most likely be "In Cold Blood."
