Bored with regular movies, from movie movies to watch this Halloween I've seen many times, I had a chance on "The Sentinel," hoping it could make my horror juices come back. Remember, I just came back from watching the Dark Castle remake of "House on the Haunted Hill" - complete and complete nonsense. Fortunately, "The Sentinel" let me go! In a riveting story about a model that moves into a terrible building in Brooklyn Hights, the film offered everything I hope to find in a good movie - (1) Campy and fanciful slut characters, exchanges and dialogue, including hilarious towers Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldblum and Martin Balsam, as an absent teacher - (2) Horror Terror! Do not give a dial, but there are scenes in this movie that chilled me to my pancreas - (3) Fantastic Gore, terrible makeup and unpleasant direction (if it is very uneven) from Michael Winner, which is pretty nice with this unreal treat. If you loved "Evil Dead 2", "Dead Alive" and "Deep Rising" - this will be the queen of your favorites. Just to emphasize my love for this movie - after watching it for the first time, it fell with the jaw, I resumed it and looked at it again. Now it's one of the favorites of all time. Do a favor and see it!
