I saw this movie about a year ago, and I found it to be completely funny Laugh-Out-Loud. A true winner, in my mind. He had a bad comedy, but he really had a real plot. Just like the hit comedy, Elf, actually. There were some serious moments between the trick. When Stiller shot Black's horse, a usual sober moment, you found yourself laughing about it. You can really find a common ground there, because I'm sure many people did something they would not want a friend to know, so your friendship is not over. When I learned how much people did not like this movie, I was completely amazed. That terribly terrible movies, such as Napoleon Dynamite, had higher ratings than it makes me wonder about the health of people on IMDb. Take my advice and rent it. If you do not find laugh at least once, I'll pay you the rent. = D
