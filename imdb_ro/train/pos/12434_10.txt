For a first film in a proposed series, it achieves the right balance. It is made with the style and class that depicts Modesty's early days as a refugee and the beginning of her emergence in power in the criminal world. I think it is a very honest / true portrait of her character, just as the writer Peter O'Donnell intended. Alexandra Staden as Modesty is amazingly beautiful and an excellent choice. It acts very convincingly as the tough survivor with a cool / smart / innocent exterior. And whole notes for Tarantino for choosing an unknown actress for the role - much more credible to have a new face to create the role. I look forward to the next movie.
