after watching The Deer Hunter, which is a masterpiece, the Jacknife movie had big shoes to fill. It has the same topics as The Deer Hunter, the devastating effects on a person after the Vietnam War. Robert De Niro is in this movie, like The Deer Hunter, and is very good here, as Kathy Baker.but belongs to Ed Harris, which offers powerful, emotional and impactful performance. the movie is based on a stage play and there are one or two scenes where this felt obvious to me.by that I just want to say that for those one or two scenes it was like I was watching a stage game. which was not such a big deal, and did not really diminish the film. Actually, this movie.it is not an epic like The Deer Hunter. they are about the similar era and have similar themes, but these are two very different movies. thought Deer Hunter was great, and I also think this movie was great.it is acting in this that makes it so wonderful. For me, Jacknife is 10/10
