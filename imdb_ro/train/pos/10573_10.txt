An excellent example of the spectacular musicals from Busby Berkeley produced in the early 1930s. Audiences must have been very surprised to see James Cagney on this type of vehicle. A fair contrast to that of the "Public Enemy" for two years. Cagney adds sparkle and interest to a fairly common and ordinary story. But the highlight of the film is the three production numbers produced in the back. First of all with the conservative Honeymoon Hotel, followed by the amazingly stunning "By A Waterfall," followed by the "Shanghai Lil" closing sequence, Cagney only takes part in the last number of hoofing on top of a Ruby Bar Keeler. The "Shanghai Lil" number alongside Cagney is excellent, but a bit of comedown and anti-climactic, after a more exciting and incredibly rich choreography, "By A Waterfall". If I were the director, I would have inserted the "Shanghai Lil" number in the middle and close with "By A Waterfall", which blows the other two numbers in the water, so to say the best of the three numbers in my opinion. The three production numbers are cake glaze and James Cagney's performance is added to the cake decoration. A remarkable musical achievement, a 4-star film, the latest musical, is worth looking, you will not be disappointed !!!!!!!!!
