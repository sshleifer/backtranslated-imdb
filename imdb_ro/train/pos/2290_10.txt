As Alan Rudolph's "Little Champion" sneaks into the theater with a little fanfare and a lot of trouble, it makes me think in 1996, when Keith Gordon's "Night of Mother" came out. Now that Kurt Vonnegut is "unfathomable", it is surprising that he has received two superb cinematic treatments (the other being "Slaughter-house Five"). "Night Mother" is certainly one of the most underestimated films of the decade and I do not understand why. It's genius! She remains almost entirely faithful to Vonnegut's book (without being strange or too literary) and adds to her a purely cinematic poem. How many film adaptations of any author's work can they do? Vonnegut himself even makes a cameo look at the end of the movie, and can you ask for better approval than that? Not only is it a beautiful movie, it is a beautiful action, written and directed film and is one of my first films for the first five American films in the 1990s. It is a surreal, inspirational, surreal masterpiece that does not deserve to be neglected . I would encourage someone to see Mother's Night - she does not even get acquainted with Vonnegut's work to fully appreciate it (sometimes she does the "Slaughterhouse Five"). It is a powerful piece that affects cinema.
