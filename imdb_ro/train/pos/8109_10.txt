Story by HG Wells, shape of things to come, was made into a film in 1935. Very well done science fiction story about a war that lasted tens of decenii.Great include Raymond Massey (arsenic and old lace ) Sir Cedric Hardwicke (ghost of Frankenstein) Ralph Richardson (bandits while) and Margaretta Scott.Un little helicopter, holograms, a rocket ship and futuristic cities. The film was ahead of its time, led by William Cameron Menzies (Invaders from Mars) very pleasant, (1927), but still avoiding the so-called shape of things to come, which was made in 1979. This film has nothing to do with original.hg well as Jules Verne had a vision for future stories sale.Un classic science film fiction.10 10
