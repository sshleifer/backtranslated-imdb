I was really excited to see this movie. I finally thought Australia was doing a good movie, but I was wrong. It was the most pathetic attempt of a slasher movie ever. I'm sorry that Molly Ringwald had to come to Australia to make a terrible film. The act was terrible (especially the one who tried to speak in an American accent) and it was pretty bad. When I first heard about this movie, I thought the title was pathetic (because it resembles the "Stab" movie in Scream 2), but I was willing to let it slide if it was a good movie. WARNING !!! MAJOR SPOILERS !!! Perhaps the worst thing about the film was the end. I was expecting a big surprise about who the killer was, but the killer was not even human ... who turned this realistic movie into a terrible horror movie. You do not see this movie. you will probably be disappointed!
