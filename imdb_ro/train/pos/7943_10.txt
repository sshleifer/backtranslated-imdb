I love this TV series so much. contains exciting and beautiful animation. I can not believe they cut him off the TV and I never found out if cybersix and the date7 die or not, apparently survive, but I'm not sure. Cybersix has by far been the best TV show ever. I know that until late we hope the series will start again, so I'm very glad I have to look at it. I LUVED IT SO MUCH <3 <br /> <br /> about a woman named cybersix, she is not human. She goes by adrian seeldman, a high school teacher at a high school. Now, cybersix is ​​actually a woman, she's just disguised as a man that day. At night, cybersix patrols the city. A guy named Von Reichter is the one who created the cybersix, and once he finds the put, he's alive, uses everything he can to catch it. > <br /> If you have never seen it before downloading it completely. It was the best TV show in the world. Why did they cut it off? some people have problems. but I'm glad I have to look at the 13 episodes.
