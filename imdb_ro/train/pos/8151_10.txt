I saw her in a cinematic film, where the audience is usually white, educated and urban. The show I attended had a sprinkling of African-Americans, and made the difference in the audience's reaction between the two groups a wonderful social commentary on the state of racial relations in this country. Practically, white people were AFRAID to laugh or laugh nervously at the funny bits - and there are many! - because he would be "wounded to black", while the blacks were also quite silent, because many could not laugh at themselves in front of the whites. <br /> <br /> I, on the other hand, being Asian (and so do not belong to any group), have long seen this satire of rap culture and of ego / values ​​/ pseudo-philosophies. Distribution is talented and fails to become portrayed characters. The songs are too fun to be believed. This movie is one of the best pseudo-documentaries that come together, including "A Strong Wind"
