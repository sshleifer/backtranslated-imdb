I've seen this movie in an advanced review and found it great. New York I Love You is a real rotation on a love story exploring intelligent, fun and sometimes shocking situations around the most powerful emotion of the human race. The distribution is immense, a true ocean 11 with Andy Garcia, Ethan Hawke, Shia Labouf, Natalie Portman, Bradley Cooper and others. All of this gives great performance in one way or another. It is not to be mentioned that there is who is the director who interconnects stories in a smart and interesting way. Brett Rattner, Shaka Kapur, Natalie Portman, I mean - WOW! This movie is not a romantic story or romantic comedy, even if it is both romantic and funny. It also has serious stories and notes. But that's good in my opinion. Go see this for you and answer my review, I want to hear what others have to say.
