The characters were alive and interesting, the plot was highly ritualized, the effects of the pirograms were mastered, and take a basics triangle love story and throw into a science-fiction element in it. I could identify with many of the characters and their motivations logically rationalized in the story. The work on the camera was great, the clear and precise sound, the perfect background music, the firemen singing a pleasant odor of memorable talents, the brilliant artisan sets and the special effects made with a talented talent. I am a little puzzled as a mini-carnival whole in a parking lot of the store stores could be fed by a single lamp socket. This seems impossible to say at least. The struggle between brothers at the end of the film was brilliant. Having Jim Varney in a non-clown role was a wonderful touch as well, as he played the semi-serious carny role very well.
