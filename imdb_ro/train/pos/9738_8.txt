Oh dear, we do not like when our love interest superhero develops a new brain? Something happened to people, they lost their ability to enjoy, a simple sense-good, love story / comedy? Kirsten Dunst is a revelation - funny, sexy and real. I laughed loudly at least five times, and I'm not ashamed to say I have a tear in my eyes and a few times. The show, the script, and the script are wonderful, I see many movies along the picture and I have not seen one of the kind that was just as successful. Those who do not agree please tell me where I can find some! I'm sure the book is good too, but I think you have to judge it on your own merits.
