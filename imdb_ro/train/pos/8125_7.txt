Things that come are a rarity of rarity, a movie about ideas. Many films present a vision of the future, but few attempts to show us how the future arose. The first part of the movie, when the war reaches Everytown, is short but powerful. (Ironically, the movie publisher of his release year laughed at the reports that enemy planes attacked England - the calm was at its height. Wells' predictions were confirmed too soon.) The endless warfare following, seems like a model work is most effective. Explanatory headlines strongly reminisce with German expressive graphic design. The director of art was the great William Cameron Menzies, and his sets of Everytown ruins are among his best works. Margaretta Scott is very seductive as the boss's mistress. The Everytown of the 21st century is just as striking. The actor acting in the 21 st century story is not convincing - perhaps this was a mistaken attempt to contrast the technocratic rationality of this time with barbarism in 1970. Unfortunately, the model's work, representing annoying crowds that rush over the high corridors, would be could have been done much better, even with technology for 30 years. This is particularly grueling, because the scenes of giant planes are very convincing. This is redeemed by Raymond Massey's magnificent discourse that ends the film - rarely the ideal of scientific progress has been so well expressed. Massey's final question is more relevant now than ever, in an era of very limited airplane flight space. The scene is helped by the bustling music of Sir Arthur Bliss, whose family name they proudly share. Unfortunately, VHS versions of this movie are absolutely horrible, with serious technical problems. Most versions have drafted a quite interesting assembly of futuristic workers and cars that we take from 1970 to 2038. I hope there is a good DVD of the whole movie.
