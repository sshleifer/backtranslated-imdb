Paul was abolished by someone who did Dave. It's the same story, not as funny though. Paul told me this morning about the scene in which Sammy davis sings the paradise's new national hymn. he arrived in Brazil after a long flight from the vegas, three planes, a car ride to the set, etc was beaten. could hardly stand, had to use a reed. he stood in a trailer about the size of the bath. He did not know he could do that. then saw the crowd of 6,000 extras, paid $ 7. he came to life and shot that scene for two hours. he was magnificent, then almost collapsed. Paul is a great guy, though very liberal. a real talent.
