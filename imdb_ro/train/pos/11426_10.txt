I think this movie would be more enjoyable if everyone thought it was an image of colonial Africa in the 50s and 60s, rather than as a story. Because there's no real story here. Just a vignette on the top of another as small points of light that does not mean too much until you have enough to paint an image. The first time I saw Chocolat, I could not "take it" until a few days later. Then I realized that there were many things that had to "come", including at the end of colonialism, which was just around the corner, just no plot. Anyway, it's one of my favorite movies. The airport scene with the short shower and the beautiful music was pure poetry. If you like "exciting" movies, do not look at it - you will be bored with tears. But for some of you ... you can thank me later for recommending.
