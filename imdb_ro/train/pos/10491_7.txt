A wonderful gentle comedy gem until the last five minutes that have degenerated into the British British farce farce. The last five minutes cost 2 points in my ranking. Despite this major flaw and style, it's worth watching the acting character and the unique setting of Cornwall. Many great bits to relish, like the whole tense eternity that we are going through just waiting for the bank's approval, after the clerk broke the credit card ... became more painted when we're not sure - that the card is not over.
