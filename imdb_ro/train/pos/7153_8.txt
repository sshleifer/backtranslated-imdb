My wife is a teacher and she is very familiar with the story after reading her in some of her classes. I never called everything I was interested in and bought my DVD, imagining that it would be a movie that would not really be mine. The first half of the movie has a lot of set-up and I woke up thinking I was right. It starts a bit slow and I have to admit I was a little bit bored - but curious enough to stay with him. Well, I'm glad I did it, because it was a very satisfying and rewarding film. I would definitely look at her again! The castration was very good. Since I have not read the book, I can not guarantee accuracy, but I have to say that Jon Voight was really delightful. You liked the characters you ought to love, hate those you ought to hate and laughed at those that were supposed to be fun. I can see how some people do not like this movie. It is sometimes tiring, especially at first. All flashbacks can divert attention (though they are essential to the story). Once the story begins to meet at the end, however, I think you have paid for your patience. When everything is said and done, I think this is a very good movie - 8/10
