Wow! So fun! Probably a little bit more for normal American children, and it really is a stretch to call this kid film, this movie reminded me of a bit of Time Bandits - very Terry Gilliam all the way through. While the general story is quite straightforward, Miike still throws in a lot of surreal moments and Bunuel-esquire. The whole first act acts violently from scene to scene, the normal family life of the child / main hero, the spiritual world and the evil that flows from it. And, although the end has a slightly ambiguous appearance, which is accustomed to Miike's work, the layers of significance and metaphor, especially the anti-war / anti-revenge message of human folly, are quite brutal. As manic and imaginative fun as Miike's wonderful movies, instead of torture and gorilla from the top, it gives us an endless amount of mongers and yokai from the Japanese folklore creatively conceived by CG and dolls wrapped in an imaginative adventure with many facets. F'n laugh and one of Miike's best!
