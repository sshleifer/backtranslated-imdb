This movie was hysterical. I have not laughed for a long time. I mean, it's not "Good Chase of Will," but was it supposed to be? In fact, I went into the advanced screening waiting for much less and was pleasantly surprised. Comedy appears hard and is quite constant. Amanda Peet is hot and wonderful. The whole audience I examined seemed to enjoy the film how much I did.
