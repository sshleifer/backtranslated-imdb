Sucks my free Boob references, so I'm going to write a flat flat review (no intention). I love Elvira, not a kind of "my-to-print-just-for-print-jodi-foster-fanatic," but it suffices to say that I think she stones. The film is played as a horror film of 50 years, much more fun, looking for "ankle reference" referring to what I mean. what relay shines in the movie is the absolute charm of Elvira (or it should be cassandra). I first saw this movie at the age of 8, and I've seen it many times since ... I should go and buy a copy, the video-viewer version looks worse for wear. If any fan of the movie wants to send me an email about not feeling free. In another extraordinary performance by Edie McClurg (paria chastedy), an actress who never gets the attention she deserves.
