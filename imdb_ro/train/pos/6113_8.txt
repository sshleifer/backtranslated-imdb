After I saw "Mafia Marriage," I would have lost faith in Korean film business. But this has brought my faith back. The female character, who is a student at the university, was forced to teach the high school student, rich but charismatic. He is actually the age of the female character. By some hilarious quarrels, these two will become great friends. I was pleasantly surprised that the new Kwan sang woo and did his job with excellence. He was such a revelation! Kim ha actress actress was also charming as usual. This movie has tried hard to avoid any loopholes that can be seen in romantic comedies. And he did not show us any nude scenario, sex, useless. It was wonderful, wonderful, fresh, made me want to see again. <br /> <br />
