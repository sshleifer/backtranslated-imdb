This movie is one of Tom Cruise's best movies. He captures the audience's imagination as David Aames. His character can relate to us all in a way. The story line is very smart and keeps the audience on the edge of the whole movie. I have never looked at the cruise movies long before, but after seeing it, it showed me its true talent. My favorite part in the film is the end of everything that comes to a big conclusion and he finds the truth. If you have not seen this yet, you should definitely try. It's one of those movies that, once you start looking at it, you have to see it all the way, or you'll think and regret it. My point is that you have to buy it and take the risk of doing what I did, and it has become one of my favorite movies of all time. It's A * 10/10 I promise you're gonna look at her, she'll stay with you and you'll love it forever.
