The holes, originally a novel by Louis Sachar, have been successfully transformed into a fun and well-done film. With Sigourney Weaver starring as Shia Labeouf as Stanley and Khleo Thomas as Zero, the roles were very well done, and the actors presented their roles well. The film had intertwined stories that all led to the end. The main story is about Stanley Yelnats and his sentence to spend a year and a half at Camp Greenlake. The second story is about Sam and Kate Barlow. This plot deals with racism and is a deeper story of the film. The third is about Elya Yelnats and Madame Zeroni, who explains the 100-year-old Yelnats curse. In my opinion, these stories were very well intertwined. Contrary to the beliefs of many people, I think you do not have to read the book to understand the movie. The movie is pretty easy to understand. The film was well done, especially Shia Labeouf (Stanley), Khleo Thomas (Zero), Sigourney Weaver (director) and Jon Voight (Mr - Mr. Other members of D-Tent, Jake Smith (Squid) -Zag), Miguel Castro (Magnet), Byron Cotton (Armpit) and Brenden Jefferson (X-Ray), but the best parts were with Zero and Stanley, who made a wonderful team together. a Disney movie, deals with some serious issues, such as racism, shooting and violence, and the film's drama at some points is very well done, and I would suggest this film to people of all ages, whether they have read the book or not. you have to miss.
