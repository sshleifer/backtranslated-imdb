Director Otto Preminger reunites with his star Laura, Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney in this brutal and rumble film: where the sidewalk ends. This film is complemented by a well-written crime story, interesting characters, unexpected transformations, clever dialogue and pleasing eyes, extraordinary camera movements and dark and dark enlightenment. Dana Andrews plays the role of Detective Mark Dixon, a mobster and a partial cop, who has the reputation of being too physically tough with criminals. After one case, he sees Dixon in search of suspects and answers, he gets involved much more than he wants. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews is awesome in his hard and frightening role, Andrews' Dixon is ready to beat anything if he is on his bad side. It's the best movie anti-hero movie - it's not very nice all the time, but we're still wandering it. Gene Tierney does a solid job in her role as she is, being a sweet shoulder for Dixon. It may not be too much for Tierney's role, but she certainly goes beyond and beyond what others can do with the role, beating every member of the audience with a good smile, a gentle and blinking look . It's also not a bad deal to support - Karl Malden being the most memorable, incorporating and providing good support for Lieutenant Thomas. If Endwalks is not a Laura, but it's a wonderful noir movie filled with characters, story and image.
