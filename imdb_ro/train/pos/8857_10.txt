Director Sidney Lumet made some masterpieces such as Network, Dog Day or Serpico. But he did not have much luck in the latest works. Gloria (1999) was pathetic and Find Me Guilty was an interesting but failed experiment. Now Lumet brings the best movie in decades and, in my view, a true masterpiece: Before the devil knows you're dead. I think this movie is like a revival for Lumet. This movie has an excellent story that profoundly has many layers. I also think the end of the movie is perfect. The performances are brilliant. Philip Seymour Hoffman brings, as usual, a magnificent performance and is undoubtedly one of the best actors of our day. Ethan Hawke is also an excellent actor, but he is undervalued by my point of view. His performances here are great. The rest of the song is also excellent (especially the great Albert Finney), but these two actors bring monumental performances unfortunately unseen by the Pathetic Oscars. The film has a good level of intensity, partly tha nks at shows and partly due to the brilliant scenario. Before being seen, Devil Knows You're Dead is a true masterpiece with a perfect direction, great scenario and excellent performance. We need more movies like this.
