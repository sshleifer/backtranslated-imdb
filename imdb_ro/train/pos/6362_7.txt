I've seen a Speed ​​Racer, but I have never seen it, and I've seen other shows that have personal cards dressed like birds that flew on a ship called Phoenix and another that roamed around a spacecraft which looks like a giant ocean ship and flew back and forth from time to time, for some reason, and it was really dark and hard to understand for someone for five years. This, though I looked at almost every episode and amazing for me at that time was that this show had a certain resolution. In fact, it ended, the bad guys that were made, unlike almost any American cartoon, where nothing ends, like the last episode of the One Transformers generation that ended with Galvatron and this new bad guy who promised that Autobots, Dungeons and Dragons make her home with GI Joe and Cobra still ready to try again and so on. This ended and he had a cool cool robot, who received new weapons while the show progressed, was a bit bland in the beginning because he could not fly and he had only a few very cold weapons. As he went on, he got a cool punch, like the one from Android 16 used against Cell in Dragonball Z, then the weapon evolved to include shavers that shot. Then the big robot even had wings to fly, and more weapons were embedded in the wings. She would also have taken a couple of allies into a female robot and a pretty funny one called Bobo in America. The villains not only consisted of Doctor Hell but a really strange person, half a man and a girl with a flying head. An interesting show and it was nice to see a conclusion.
