Barbarians can not be the best movie we've seen any of us, but really ........ It's so funny ...... I can not describe how I laughed when I saw it for the first time .. The director really wanted to make a serious adventure movie, but it is badly unwelcome ... so bad that it is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. .... so advise me is that you should see it ..... and if you did an alredy, do it again !!!!!!!
