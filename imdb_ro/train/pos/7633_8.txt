Reading Roger Ebert's various external reviews and other well-known film critics makes me hesitate to admit how much I like this movie, although I only have a double-in-Japanese video version of it. It seems like many critics seem to take as a little that the story premise has been used before, the most famous in the wonderful "It's a wonderful life." For me, a big premise is a big premise, no matter how many times it is used, and I would be happy to see more films using this particular premise - the discontented man who has the chance to gain a new perspective on his own life through a bit of "divine magic". I suppose the people and the critics of an intellectually inclined are not so in the story, but I'm not going to movies to critique them with a notebook in my hand - I'm going to movies to throw me in them and let them take me where will. <br /> <br /> If you are a kind of feeling like me, you will be well rewarded seeing this image. The performances are excellent all over the world and the film has been very well distributed. Wonderful choice of music. Michael Caine is gorgeous as a bartender. Jim Belushi does a great job as an "average type" guy who asks if his life did not work the way he should. Linda Hamilton, always excellent, is again here as a loving wife. Jon Lovitz has fun as usual and he even has some surprising moments in "Mr. Destiny". No, "Destiny" is not "a wonderful life," but who says it must be? Taken in his own terms, "Mr. Destiny" is a pleasant, well-done, funny and moving movie. I have seen my video called Japanese many times and I'm sure I will see it several times. If that makes me a little, so be it! I'm glad I did not read any comment about Mr. Destiny before seeing it. I suppose I should have the courage of my beliefs and give the movie nine or ten stars, but I could not doubt it after reading all the critical reviews!
