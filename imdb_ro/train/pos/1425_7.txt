As if Al Gore let us go with the documentary film "Awful Truth," directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield remind us that it is time to improve our lifestyle to save our beautiful planet. "Planet Earth" is also a wake-up call that the global warming of our planet has disastrous consequences for all living creatures around the world. Al Gore showed us the gloomy future of Earth, showing solid facts, supported by documented examples, through long, but always interesting, monologues. The creators of this documentary choose a different but equally powerful way to achieve this. They do not present us with a future representation of what our planet might do if we do not radically change things around, but they would rather show the real beauty of the planet Earth in all its amazing glory. We see places where we know they exist, but they did not think they could be so beautiful. In this film, we see a wide range of extraordinary places, such as abandoned deserts, huge forests full of fauna and flora and frozen landscapes to the eye. And in all these extremely different environments, we see the most beautiful animals that try to survive. This is exactly the type of film that was to be made, in combination with that of Al Gore, in order to make us realize that our planet is too precious to mix. The voice-over by Patrick Stewart is always relaxing and therefore very well done, though at first it sounded like I was watching an X-Men movie in place! Cinematography is probably the most remarkable thing in this documentary. Sometimes: what you see is so unrealistic that you tend to forget that a man with the camera had to film all the lovely movies. In short: It is certainly a necessity for everyone because it refers to every person on this beautiful planet Earth! The truth is, I never thought our planet was so amazingly beautiful!
