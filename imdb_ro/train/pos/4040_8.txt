An inventive and suspending exercise in claustrophobia. A Japanese thriller that faces a challenging challenge, being entirely in two rooms. It was not completely successful, but it was stretched out, surprising and well acting. Could the movie somehow remember SAW ?? two men caught in the room and penetrating against each other? but unlike the movie, he dares to stay with the premise and keep the hero locked in the cell throughout the movie. It's like watching a laboratory experiment. Some might find the pent-up suspense, but this reviewer found her enthusiastic. The sound and images of the movie are amazingly well done. This is certainly a good movie that can be used to show a good video system at home. Just for a festive night movie when someone is in a paranoid mood. I definitely woke up that night.
