"Woman in Black" is easily one of the most fantastic British ghost stories ever made. A young lawyer, after arriving in a small town to handle a dead client's legacy, is haunted by a mysterious black woman dressed in black. with an extremely dizzying atmosphere and fury is calculated for and offers the maximum possible effect. The action keeps the deeply involved viewer and the end is quite disturbing. The actor is excellent and the tension is almost unbearable at times. So, if you want to see a really horrible horror movie, it's an eye on it. I dare anyone to look at the "Black Woman" alone at night with the lights off. Highly recommended.10 out of 10.
