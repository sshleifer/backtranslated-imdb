I'm always bothering my family and friends for my tears on the movies and they were not disappointed when I looked at it. I've been crying innumerable times, but believe me it was not sappiness. I fell in love with the family and hooked myself up for this man as he tried to redeem the only way he knew how. Denzel was fabulous as always, so Chris Walkin. Mickey Rourke, I did not even recognize; years were not good with him. My husband is not the one to render movies if they are not specific war movies (snore !!!!) He has watched this movie 5 times now and I will have to see him again because he wore tape and jumped all the time I was following.
