I'm usually very happy with movies like "I'm Chance", but I was not quite happy with it for some reason. The first half was pretty well done, Alex Finch dying and reincarnated in a new body (played by Robert Downey Jr.). He meets his wife (Cybill Shepherd) and his boyfriend (Ryan O'Neal) and his daughter, who is now grown up. The scenes with which they meet again and Downey rediscover who once was, are well made and there is plenty of emotion and happiness once Shepherd thinks her husband really is reincarnated, but that's where the movie goes down. There are several sex scenes that have stopped me completely, especially Downey and Shepherd who want to reunite despite the age difference now. After that, however, the film manages to end in the most satisfactory way, taking into account the circumstances of the plot. I was disappointed because I did not expect the movie to become so immoral until the end. There was great potential with this story, and scenes in the sky are well done. There is a good theme song sung by Peter Cetera and Cher, but eventually the movie is not great. For a better movie, try "Heaven Can Wait." Decent, but I really would have liked you not to have seen it because of the scene in the second half. <br /> <br /> *** from ****
