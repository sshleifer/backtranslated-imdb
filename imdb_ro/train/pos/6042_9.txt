Running out of rental films, I took Freebird. I fought in the first third of the movie asking if the rest would be a loss to see. Fortunately, it really warmed up, and I really liked the movie. The second half of the movie made me laugh and laugh all the time. Fortunately, although CGI bits were included, they were not overloaded or predominant. However, I have to say that the actors have all the European heavy accents, so be warned if you have problems understanding their voices or their cultural humor. I really enjoyed this movie and will have to order a copy for my collection.
