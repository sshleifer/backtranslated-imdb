What a delightful movie ... Accompanied by the lush, emotional and dreamy music of the composer Oscar-Rachel PORTMAN, this film remains a worthy viewing pleasure several times a year. <br /> <strong> Casting incredible ... Gwyneth Paltrow was perfect for Emma's role. Toni Collette was great as Harriett Smith. The character who stole the movie was MISS BATES !!! She was fascinated to look, she was on the edge of the chair, hanging every word and laughing hysterically with her. One of the most bold characters I have ever met. From one of the opening scenes, when he thanked Woodhouse for sending "that wonderful pork ... PORK, MOTH !!!" she calls in the daffy and clearly heard Mother, Mrs Bates (played by Emma Thompson's mother, Phyllida Law), who seems to lose and lost. The funny ways that Emma would avoid Miss Bates's network builds face a really scary scene at the picnic when Emma insults Miss Bates, who takes her blood in her heart. Then we see that poor Miss Bates is upset and is at the edge of the tears and just so crushed that she can only help her feel that a heart has stolen her in her name. It's a classic scene, one to be resumed and played over and over ... The ending is right up there with "sense and sensitivity" and offers one of the greatest life lessons about how best to marry my friend ... I hope this movie will enjoy you as much as I do. I adored her!
