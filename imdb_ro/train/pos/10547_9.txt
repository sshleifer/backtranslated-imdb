I watched the DVD trailer after seeing the movie and I think someone who saw her before watching the movie would be very surprised and possibly disappointed. He made a lot of the fact that the movie was "by the director of Cube" and made her look like a horror film, when in fact it is an absurd comedy (the IMDB spell checker does not seem to believe that the Absurd is a word , but it is), remember Rosencrantz and Guildernstern are dead. I like how the story slowly accumulates in the beginning, then gradually climbs. I also like the fact that there is no explanation for what is happening in the movie. This and the fact that the story mainly plays in just one set are the only aspects in which this movie is similar to Cube. I recommend it.
