One of the most sensitive comedies that hit Hindi movie screens. A remake of Priyadarshans in the 1980s Malayalam hit Boeing Boeing, which in turn was a remake of the Hollywoon hit of the 60's, Garam Masala raises the comedy standard in the Hindi cinema. Akshay Kumar re-started to prove to be one of the best super-stars of Hindu cinema that can make comedy. He got along well with the new John John Abraham. However, John still remains in the shadows of Akshays and fails to rise to this occasion. The new girls are nice and do not do justice to their roles. You have to watch a comedy. Leave your brain away and laugh for 2 hours !!!! After all laughter is the best medicine! Ask Priyadarshan and Akshay Kumar !!!!!
