After confusing the re-broadcasting of Orson Welles 'classic adaptation of Orson Welles' World War on a true Martian invasion, a group of moronic Martians show up on Earth seeking to conquer only their plans to wander, reality all alone. This is often pretty good and funny, with some decent lines (just check the memorable quotes) to boot. Most likely he will agree with Sci-Fi fans. This has passed the test of time for me because seeing it again turned out much better than I expected it to be. In spite of a cast of unnamed stars, it may be just the funniest Martian invasion ever made on the film. Quite interestingly, the Martians themselves seem to represent almost any classic hero / sci-fi heroic stereotype action (50-year-old cold teenager, hunting pilot, fearless astronaut, courageous scientist and scientist). Fun for the whole family. <br /> <br /> "Prepare to scramble!"
