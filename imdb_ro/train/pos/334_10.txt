It's very easy to qualify that movie: "A PURE MASTERPIECE". This opinion is formulated for the following reasons: performance of the actors, they seem to be citizens of that time, 1100 BC. Personalize your characters perfectly. A second reason is that the poem expressed by Homer in his poem is well given by production. Among other things, narrations made by the choir offer a special atmosphere that is part of our artistic teaching. The third reason: the reconstruction of the decoration is absolutely perfect, in the Mediterranean regions, where the poem's action took place. And, above all, emotion is at the meeting. I repeat my appreciation: "A PURE MASTERPIECE".
