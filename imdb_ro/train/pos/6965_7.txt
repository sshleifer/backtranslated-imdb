This film answers the question: How can a relationship survive when your girlfriend is coy, hanging, needy, jealous and has powers and abilities beyond those of mortal women? Without damaging the movie, I can safely assure you that it is not, but there is great fun to have had along the way. Uma Thurman is perfect as the mercurial superhero, a uber-babe, with the mysterious name G-Girl who, unlike most of her sister, is not always dedicated to truth, justice, and the American Way. <br /> <br /> Thurman is also credible as a wholly deceiving but still somewhat tangled, curator Jenny. When taken to the garbage for a less-endowed, but safer and better-adjusted rival, G-Girl goes ballistically and what's next is not beautiful. It's funny, but it's not beautiful. It's a delightful premise, damn it has no anger like a despised super heroin, and those involved do not remove it altogether, but it has its moments, and I think I'll get the DVD. I liked this movie ..
