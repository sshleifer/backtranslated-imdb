This cordial comedy faces some bizarre characters. Especially, of course, the two main characters. Jack Lemmon plays Felix, a hypoconder whose husband lost her because she could not bear the cleaning and cooking attacks. So he's trying to commit suicide, but every attempt fails. Walter Matthau plays Oscar, his boyfriend, a foolish, uncertain sports reporter who lives in a divorce from his former wife in a bachelor apartment. He offers his unhappy friend Felix a new home in his apartment. And soon the problem starts because two such contradictory characters can not live together for a long time. Felix turns Oscar's apartment into a clean apartment. He cleans and cooks all the time. After a short while, Oscar feels the persecution of mania ... Filmed in a theatrical and excellent way he acted. Above all, Jack Lemmon's play is great. He is the perfect clown. It makes us laugh, but in a tragic-comic way. Look for the wonderful scene when both men invite their two neighbors for dinner because the Oscar needs to touch something softer than a bowling ball. While preparing drinks, Felix sits with the two young girls in the living room. To get out of this embarrassing situation, start talking about weather. A minute later, he changes the subject and talks about his ex-wife and children. Suddenly he starts crying and when Oscar returns with drinks, three people are complaining in the living room. The film is full of fun and funny scenes. An intelligent and fun comedy with a lot of heart. 10 out of 10!
