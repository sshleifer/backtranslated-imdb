I watched this movie with some curiosity. I wanted to see if 1) Paul Muni could play Chinese and 2) Luise Rainer deserved the Oscar. I left the YES movie! After seeing Muni in a single movie that was very strange, I was expecting the same kind of show here. I was happily proven wrong. Although some might criticize him as being too childish and simply stereotyped in the Hollywood idea of ​​the Asians, I thought he was right in the role. Keye Luke, if he had given him the chance to play a major role, could have played him in the same way. I was particularly impressed with the camera and the use of crowd scenes, especially during the collapse of the palace where O-Lan was once a slave. The graphic and gloomy atmosphere of the burning group and the drought made this an epic quite different from others at the same time as it was all glitz and glitter. I watched this movie from start to finish with excitement. I can not say the same for the "epics" today.
