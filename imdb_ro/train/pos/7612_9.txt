OK, to be honest, when I first saw the program trailer, I thought it was an ad for a solar-powered product. With all the people walking on the beach. Despite this, I decided to look at her, thinking it was a new show I could laugh at. But I was very amazed. From the first 10 seconds of the program I was hooked up, why I was sleeping on trees, why the airplane collapsed etc. etc .. <br /> <br /> It does not happen every day to show a show combining intelligence, humor , action and suspense. But "Lost" manages all this. With a cast and a great crew, beautiful locations and quite decent special effects, "Lost" will catch everyone who fits in and has to see for anyone who is sick of sitcoms and a tangled reality television. <br /> <br /> The loss is Tuesday at 10 o'clock on Channel 4 (UK) 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 = O
