From the beginning I was so excited to see this movie. The poster is probably the most funny I've ever seen for a movie. I immediately bought one for my home in September. Every element came together in this beautiful movie. I do not often see a movie with so many penis, homosexual and racial jokes so praised by critics. Carell and the rest of the cast deliver every joke. Carell remains sweet throughout the movie, where you endorse the movie by the end of the movie to succeed in his relationship more than to be put. The support is brutal, each of them having some problems with the ladies themselves. One of the things about this movie is the abundance of memorable scenes that we give you. This is what makes a film easy to remember loved. This film will often be brought up when it talks about "chest epilation" and the "condom" mentioned in the conversation. Watching him in the theater, I was surprised how many older people were there to look at her. I saw a group of four women in the mid-60s. Despite an older audience, this movie filled the theater with laughter. I think the kind of people who want this is the fans of Office and Steve Carell. Many jokes remind me of the jokes you see on Family Guy. The film is deep enough for teenage boys and still pretty sweet and intelligent for middle-aged women. I do not recommend going to this movie if you are not a fan of profanity or if you are slightly offended. However, when you are on the film, just remember this movie is all in good humor. The jokes are not "gay jokes", but just jokes. And they're funny.
