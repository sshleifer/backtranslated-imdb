This impossible story is a witch that follows a mortal man in a mortal world. Its "community" is open among its members, but it conceals witchcraft from mortals. Hmmmm ... that sounds familiar. LOL. It's not your typical movie. The "campy" shows by Jack Lemmon and Ernie Kovacs prevent things from becoming boring. Kim Novak is always a pleasure on the screen, but I found an association with James Stewart unusual (but not fatal for the story). With renewed interest in all things witch and dark, this film deserves to be discovered and re-discovered by the old and new audience ...... It's still a HOOT!
