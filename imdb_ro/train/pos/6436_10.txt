Ingrid Bergman is a temporarily impoverished Polish Countess in the 1900s, Paris, which is pursued by the most popular general of France and a number of charm - and that's also to be betrothed with a shoe magnet. This is the premise that can not be restored, which drives one of the most delirious plots in the history of the film. There are political machinations behind the generals' working chambers, an inclined balloon, and a lot of ecstasy from Bastille Day, but the heart of this gorgeous film is the frenzied floor / downhill intrigues involving wounded servants and only slightly more restored aristocrats. Yes, it is the rules of the redux game. First of all, even Gaston Modot, the jealous caregiver in the Rules, appears in a gypsy capo no less! Things happen a bit too fast and fast to the end, giving rise to confusion for this non-French speaker, but what the hell - Elena and her men is another deeply human Renoir masterpiece.
