While the story is sweet, and dance and singing in the main part of the film are joy, the uniqueness of the film (and what makes it a masterpiece) is the dream sequence. It is a combination of the highest form of truly American music (Gershwin), the engaging beauty of French Impressionist Art, the fascinating choreography of Kelly (including the "pas de deux amour", a separate genre) with the most magnificent color palette ever created for the set. The matching of growing music and the visual explosion with these dances was a real work of a creative genius and a great artist.
