I was forced to see this because: a) I have a 11-year-old girl, and b) I have shown her Bonita Granville Nacy Drew films from the 1930s, which she liked very much. Personally, I did not think it was as humorous as the 1930s movies, but on the other hand, it was not the fluffy brainwave of insulting, which I fear it would be. It was a harmless, easy-to-play film. Although I am pleased that they have not tried to "upgrade" Nancy to the "hipness" of the 21st century (Veronica Mars holds the title of Modern Nancy Drew), I think they have done it a little too gentle, do not do enough to Nancy Drew develops - the movie could have been titled "Jane Doe, Detective Girl". I have to blame on the script: I think every actor did a good job with what they had to do. I liked Emma Roberts in this role, but they gave him a script for television, not theater, script ...
