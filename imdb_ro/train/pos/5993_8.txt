Cure uses voice to create an intense mood. Although VO accounts for all the film lines is amazing, do not take it from the visual story. Using multiple movie stock adds a lot of story to the text. Choosing the combination of colors and colors has worked nicely to increase leaps over time. The end will make you jump, despite the fact that you can anticipate the outcome. I was particularly excited about the emotion of the movie. Buildings close to the scene of love are also wonderful and reflect a good eye. The song is pretty short, but it does a lot. Close editing helps a lot to show what a short movie can do. It's worth watching more than once!
