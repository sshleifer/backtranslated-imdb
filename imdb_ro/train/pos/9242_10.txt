Is it hard to evaluate movies like this because you evaluate it for production or just fun? I saw the movie back around 1988/89 sometime when I was a boy and I'm sorry to say he started a long-lasting fascination with the ninja. The plan is terrible and the action is of course terrible, but there is a certain mystic surrounding the ninja in this movie, which makes for a pretty good atmosphere. What is important is battle scenes, while a "small" sparse, are really good. I have to say that it was better when I was a boy, but now I can see the brilliance of unbelievable credibility in the film, but as a film of "getting back with a few beers," a martial arts movie can not, blaming him, is better and better than the "Ninja American Style" mountains, which was thrown in the 1980s with hundreds of boys in black suits, but not very good scenes. In an interesting note, Dusty Nelson, writer and director of Sakura Killers, made another ninja movie under the Bonaire pavilion called "White Phantom". I have no idea if this should have been a sequel to Sakura Killers' , but the Sakura clan is again a main feature, including the same logo and a story similar to only a white Ninja, had a little sense of the atmosphere, but the battle scenes are even less strict and honest, they are pretty awful. , if you are a fan of martial arts, give it an explosion to kill a few hours!
