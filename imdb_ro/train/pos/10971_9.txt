Gray Gardens is shocking, funny, sad and fascinating. I was astonished to see that Ediths Jr. and Sr. played and played as they remember the past. Their existence in a dilapidated mansion (which they had not left for more than fifteen years) is both a comedy and a tragedy. This is a movie you will not soon forget.
