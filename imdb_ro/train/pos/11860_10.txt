This movie has everything. It is a classic description of the events surrounding the migration of thousands of Cuban refugees. Antonio Montana (played by Al Pacino) is just one of the thousands to have the chance to choose his destiny in America. This kinematic but extremely precise representation of the Miamis Drug Empire is breathtaking. Brian DePalma does a stunning job pointing this image, so much so that the spectator gets involved in both the story and every character in the cast. With Tony's gross talent, Brian DePalma loses his raw talent exposed by Steve Bauer (Manny, Tony's best friend), Mary Elizabeth Mastantonio (Gina, Tony's Sister), Robert Loggia (Frank, Tony's Boss) and Michelle Pfeiffer (Elvira, Frank's wife). I liked every minute watching this movie, and yet I watch it weekly. This year, the 20th anniversary of this classic crime film, I am a true believer that in the next 20 years people will still refer to this film in stunning numbers. With other criminal films that are so dramatic, I find this movie is a shock to the system.
