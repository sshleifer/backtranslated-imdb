I did not have much expectation to get into the movie, but I thought it was fantastic. Pierce Brosnan is remarkable in a very different role. He threw slick armani suits for a ridiculous look and paid for showing that he is an excellent actor. Pierce and Greg Kinnear play each other and make one of the best pair of friends for a long time. Humor is dark, the performances of Brosnan, Kinnear and Hope Davis are wonderful, mixing with an emotional element the story of friendship and a wonderful movie. This is probably one of the best comedies for a long time. This is a movie that surely shows that we can expect extraordinary things in the post-Bond era of Brosnan's career.
