I really enjoyed Timothy Dalton, even if he was a little young and too beautiful for Mr.. R., but I thought Zelah Clarke was too strange and short. This version, however, was very true for the novel and very well filmed. I saw 4 versions, Orson Welles is still my favorite D, but George C Scott did a good job and it's a throw-in between Joan Fontaine and Sussanah York, though both were a little too old for the role. Recently I saw a brilliant TV version of Rebecca with Charles Dance and Emilia Fox. I'd love to see the two of them do Jane Eyre. When I watched the Ciarin Hinds version, I think I was Jane Eyred, but I will never bore the first few minutes of Joan Fontaine's voice. the first version I've ever seen. I always want to go back and read the book again.
