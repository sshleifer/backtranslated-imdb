From the screenplay of the main actor, we are given an early vision of how so many men's lives are led by women in them, and the humor that comes from everything that happens in the days of life " normal ". Eric Lartigau, the director, recounts how so many European men feel they have complete control of their lives, yet without the help / support of women around them do not seem to do things. The use of facial imagery throughout the movie is superb, and its intelligent positioning of the senior member of the family (mom) is on the scene. While there is more laughter in the film, it deals with single parents / adoption and family power in society. Really rewarding to pursue, and again, one that only the French strip capable of doing. So far one of the 50 Best Movies I've seen this year, and well worth a five star rating. I look forward to adding this version to the DVD collection when launched and I highly recommend it to all ages.
