WHEN THE KILL OF FRIENDS, in my opinion, is a very moving and unimaginable drama about the consequences of an anorex or bulimic. Whenever Lexi (Katie Wright) or Jennifer (Marley Shelton) threw away, I wanted to spill. It's hard to explain why. If you ask me, she should have cooperated more about things. However, I liked to see that they were doing things together, as well as reading their parents. Before I finish this, I would like to say to you: "If you ask me, WHEN KILLS FRIENDSHIP really shows you how anorexic or bulimic can affect a person's body." Now, in conclusion, I recommend this movie to everyone who has not seen it. You come to some tears and a good time, so next time on TV, go with a friend and look at it.
