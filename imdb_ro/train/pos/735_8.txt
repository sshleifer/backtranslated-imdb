Wonderful worship film in 1979, where High School students Vince Lombardi faces a new dictatorial director named Miss Togar (Mary Woronov). Togar is a musical hater and blames the musical tastes of students for their violations. Leading her accusation is Riff Randell (PJ Soles), Ramones fan # 1, who, more than anything, wants the rock band to record her songs. The impossible film to resist. First, the soundtrack is incredible, with songs by artists such as Alice Cooper and Velvet Underground, in addition to the non-stop infectious assortment of Ramones. "Teen Lobotomy," "Sheena is a Punk Rocker," and "Blitzkrieg Bop" are just a few of them. Then the cast really gives it all, with Soles an ideal choice for Riff's role; it is a real delight. Vincent Van Patten and Dey Young are serious while Tom and Kate, Woronov is well-liked by the type as a tograst and slander, Clint Howard has one of his best tracks, such as the Eaglebauer Entrepreneur and Occupy New World such as Dick Miller, Paul Bartel (particularly fun as music teacher Mr. McGree) and The Real Don Steele are fun as always. And, of course, it's a treat to see that Ramones are playing themselves. The movie has the true spirit. The energy level is high, the author and co-editor of Allan Arkush, who bring a lot of confidence in the procedure. There is also a great sense of humor. The paper jet is a superb example of this. This extends to the "delete" style of stage transitions. There are even hilarious giant mice created by remarkable future makeup effects Rob Bottin in one of his first concerts. <br /> <br /> About a kind of good as an authority-defying, defend-a-right-to-party can get. "Rock 'n' Roll High School" is simply a wonderful movie of worship. 8/10
