Two great comedians in a great film Neil Simon based on his successful song. Great combination, especially when the comrades concerned are Matthau and Burns. No wonder why Burns won an Oscar for this; he is as sharp and fun as ever. And Matthau is every match of his, if it is a more crotchety tad. This is Simon's family territory: two old old-age partners come together for a special TV, but still can not stand each other after all these years. <br /> <br /> It's a delight to look at these two picks to one another, their scenes together make this movie an absolute pleasure. I myself, I especially enjoyed "bat, knock, knock / ENTER!" scene. And if you are a fan of Burns or Matthau, you will also enjoy it. In fact, you will enjoy the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Ten stars. Put a little "Sunshine" in your life.
