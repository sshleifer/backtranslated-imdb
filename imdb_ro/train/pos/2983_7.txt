BASEketball is really a very funny movie. David Zucker manages to make us laugh our heads again, in a really silly, but often clever, comedy. <br /> <br /> 2 South Park's creators, the main actors in this movie, play very well, surprisingly good in fact, but this is the first time I see them as actors. The movie reminded me of the often South Park - one of my favorite shows. <br /> <br /> It's a very good and funny movie, so do not miss it. <br /> <br /> Vote: 7.5 out. of 10.
