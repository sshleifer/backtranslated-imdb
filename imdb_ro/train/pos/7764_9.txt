Another classic study of the effects of wealth on a Southern family is illustrated in Written on the Wind. Kyle Hadley has everything. Wealth, a plane, you call it. Kyle's best friend, Mitch, has always been in trouble. Mitch finished college, Kyle was thrown. Mitch is not from a rich home. Kyle's family, with Hadley Oil, controls most of what's going on in town. While in New York, Kyle meets his dream girl, played beautifully by Lauren Bacall. After a wind story, he marries her and brings her home. There she meets her dad-in-law, who warns him how difficult Kyle is. Kyle is sleeping with a gun under his pillow. Bacoll's character meets with Kyle's sister, Mary Lee, a tramp if ever, played out to the fullest by Dorothy Malone, who was voted best supporting actress. Rock Hudson plays Mitch, the faithful friend. <br /> A year of happiness for Kyle and his bride ends when Kyle tells the doctor he can not have children. When his wife reveals that she is really pregnant, Kyle, believing that the baby is Mitch, goes into a drunken frenzy and accidentally shot dead in a memorable scene. Mary Lee, who has always loved Mitch, tries, but fails to blame Mitch for Kyle's death. In a memorable room scene, Malone pulled all the stops, eventually admitting that Kyle's death was an unfortunate accident. Her Oscar was well worth it. Surprisingly, Robert Stack, brilliant as Kyle Hadley, was nominated for Best Supporting Actor and lost in an upset by Anthony Quinn, like Paul Gauguin, in Lust for Life. Douglas Sirk was the master of 1950s soap operas. Writing on Wind is no exception. *** 1/2.
