I'm always glad to see movies that make you think and not only feed the audience responses. "Revolver" is one of these films and, although many commentators have said it is difficult to follow with little concentration and open mind, we have succeeded. First time. True, it does not compare to other "muscles", such as "Ordinary Suspects" or "Memento," but in itself is a smart and challenging film. <br /> <br /> Another thing I really liked this movie is how beautiful it is beautiful. Each scene, every corner of the room, seems to have been thought of for centuries. If you see her, you'll know what I mean. So, to finish ... watch him with an open mind and you can enjoy it. If not, nobody said that "Revolver" is for everyone. And that's two cents.
