"Broken Bow" takes us back where everything started. Set 150 years in our future and 100 years before Kirk, Spock and McCoy. This tranche of the Star Trek franchise is, in my opinion, the first series of "TOS" to regain the feelings of wonder, danger and enthusiasm of "Going Where No Man Gone Before". Scott Bakula is perfectly interpreted as Jonathan Archer, the first captain of the first Star Ship Enterprise. He and all the cast show a respect for the true Star Trek Legacy. John Billingsley is brilliant as the alien Dr. Phlox, and Jolene Blalock is absolutely full of love as the scientific officer Vulcan T'Pol, tempting but logical. Broken Bow is, in my opinion, the best premier episode of any Treks and I think Gene Roddenberry would certainly be proud.
