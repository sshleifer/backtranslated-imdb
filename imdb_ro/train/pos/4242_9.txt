I read the book and saw the movie. So great. The film is a diamond among coals in this era. Liebman and Selby dominate the screen and communicate the intensity of the characters without defects. This movie should have made it starry. Shame in the studio to not put everything behind this movie. It could have been a franchise. DVD release is a must and a remake worthy to revive this movie. Search for it in your TV guide and if you see it listed, no matter how late, watch it. You will not be disappointed. Make another favor - read the book (the same title). It will throw you away. Times have changed dramatically since those days, or at least we like to believe they have.
