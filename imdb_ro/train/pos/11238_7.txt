Hidden Frontier is a fan show in the Star Trek world. The story takes place after Voyager has returned from the Delta-dial. He has some characters from the official Star Trek shows, but most of them are original to the show. The show takes place on the base of the Deep Space 12 star and on several spaceships, giving them opportunities that they do not have official shows. Characters have the opportunity to rise in the hierarchy, which single-ship characters do not have. The show has a good animated animation of spacecraft, but the action takes place in front of the green screen and offers a glowing green around the actors. Not all actors are as good, but it is best. Episodes are personalized and characters develop in more episodes. It's a bit more like Babylon 5 than in most of the official Star Trek shows. Hidden Frontier takes taboos that even the official series has dropped from use. Generally, I liked to look at her.
