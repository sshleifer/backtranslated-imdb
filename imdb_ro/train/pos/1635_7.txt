during my high school days in the Kansas Salt, they shot at the local level something called "The Young Youth of Weinberg," and the film crews were quite prominent for weeks. Finally, I found out that the movie was "Up The Academy", and it was a bit ummm, "the inferior head" than we were entitled to believe. <br /> <br /> I had to see, since I was there, and the local audience seemed less pleased with the presentation. I was 17 years old and I thought it was a pretty artless attempt at a comedy "Animal House" post, even to jokes. <br /> <br /> I have seen many times since then and my opinion has softened a bit. he is crazy, but sometimes he gets a humor of the magazine "crazy", at least as much as "Mad TV". Ron Liebman might hate him, but he's almost perfect and unforgettable. For me, my favorite moment would have been a short scene on Santa Fe avenue, where I parked my car while I was buying some guitar strings. Too bad Pinto's short look, usually seems to be cut for television. I did not see the new DVD, but if my old pinto is visible, they have a sale.
