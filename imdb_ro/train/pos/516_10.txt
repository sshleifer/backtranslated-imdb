One of the few best movies of all time. The change from black and white to the heavens and the sequences on the ground was the executive excellence. The plot is extremely clever, the full movie leaves you overwhelmed by all human emotions, and although a war movie does not discriminate. I've probably seen this movie several times, and I'm not bored with it. It's a film that casts doubt on your own mortality and beliefs about what happens after our disappearance.
