The chances are, you'll think this movie is incredibly bad the first time you watch it. But if you happen to watch the second and third, fourth and fifth (I'm fine in hundreds now), you will find that you spit a line here and there and break you! My friends and I have actually dropped the Fear of a Black Hat party to get more of our friends, "as they say, down with riots."
