I love this movie so much, I'm not tired of seeing it. The only line I can not stomach in this case is when Riff is called adolescent lobotomy, but otherwise than everything, everything is perfect. I have never been a fan of PJ Soles and did not help to hear that she did not even know who Ramones was until she filmed this film, but I can largely ignore her face. Most people watching this over and over are Ramones fans and really .. that's the only reason I love him so much. I've never tired of seeing DeeDee messing up his pizza lines, or that Joey is confusing his teacher's name several times, haha. One of the best parts of the movie is to see them singing you want to dance down the high school halls .. I like it. The special DVD edition has a good, surprising retrospect PJ Soles is not on it. Perhaps she was working on another * project * laughs * Anyway, a great movie, even better if you are a Ramones fan.
