Well, for starters, it was, in fact, the most elegant Clausen movie ever since. Man always has a meaning for characters with a piece of humor for them, but I think he in this movie adds an inappropriate dimension to anything done earlier. His work was accepted by the general public, but not so critically, in very black and white words and I always appreciated his sense of humor and his ability to mix it with human problems and a distinct way to let the audience know what he needs to say. In Villa Paranoia, however, for the first time, he surprises with invisible wisdom and respect for minorities. Not only the ethnic, but the ordinary people trying to forget, who are in Jutland - in the "country" - deal with the eternal problem of lack of love, but in a way almost and sometimes brutal that keeps you and keeps you focused. good thing, but he has no idea how to get there, and that's why people suffer. /> I should say that is one of the best movies I've seen this year and I'm very much looking forward to the next movie .
