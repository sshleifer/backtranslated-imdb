Indian directors have difficulty competing with films such as Laggan, where 11 cucumber men defend their village and half of them are certified idiots. "Devdas," an unfortunate, fedar-festoara return, drinking in oblivion, with characters running in endless corridors who do not realize the feelings or feelings of each one - unfortunately, live in a misery decorated with red upholstery. But to make a good movie, you have to ride a tight rope to lighten the elderly, which are hunting dogs that are mesmerized with split skirts and Dishum-Dishum fights, preferably involving a Bollywood nitwit actor, which is marginally handsome. So you can get in touch with a director who wants to tell a story about the head of Leonine village, which in his words "defending his village" is considered a violent or too masculine film for a male audience. There are very few actors who can transmit anger and pathos like Nana Patekar (Narasimhan). Nana Patekar lets you find yourself in his yard and watch his beret and beat the politician when his loyal admirers burst into laughter with every word of satire thrown on him, while his daughter bathes his nephew .This is an authentic scene that you can get in rural India. Nana Patekar is the essential actor of the old school of acting, a race missing in Hindi movies. The described violence is a complicated part of the Song & Dance story, cast for gawkers without whom the movies will not sell, a sad but true state. Faster changing for Bollywood. Everything said and done this is a good movie.
