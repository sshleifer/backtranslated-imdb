The movie moved very much. It was tender and funny at the same time. The landscape was absolutely beautiful! Peter Faulk and Paul Reiser made winning shows. Olympia Dukakis was great. I understand because of the story line that her side was supposed to be short but I would have liked to have seen more of it - it's a real pro. You have to remember the experiences of your own life, we hope in a positive way after seeing this movie. We were lucky to see Paul Reiser at Q and A after watching. He is a wonderful, intelligent, eloquent man and a "real person". It was really a nice night! This is a shooting you must see. You will be so grateful that you have gone.
