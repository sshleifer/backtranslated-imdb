I like all the versions of this story, but this is my favorite of all time. George C.Scott gives a deeper Scrooge character that others do not give. The film shows more about why it gets so bitter. Changes in Scrooge gradually appear as they encounter the different ghosts and incidents they have shown. <br /> <br /> This film has by far the best Tiny Tim. He is the right age, rather than being played by someone who is almost a teenager like in other films. But Anthony Walters has all or most of his teeth. <br /> <br /> David Warner is great as Bob Cratchit. He is such a versatile actor. He portrays a man who clearly loves his family. He plays the role with dignity, not a frightening man who clothes under Scrooges'thumb, but as a man who takes care of her with grace, because he has a family to secure. Susannah York and the other actors do a good job of bringing the characters to life. Edward Woodward is the best Christmas ghost I've ever seen. Most often he is played as a funny character of the Santa type. In this he shows anger at Scrooges' attitudes and really does Scrooge reconsideration. <br /> <br /> The costumes and sets really bring a life to London to Dickens. A wonderful movie.
