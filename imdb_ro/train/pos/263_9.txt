It was a powerful selection of Poirot / Suchet, the mystery of television. The characters were alive and well-behaved. The plot and the main location - a student home - were excellent. Japp was nothing special, but for me I did not distract the story. A significant point, many Poirot observers do not recognize a good action or good characterization. I also think I'm pretty tough in their judgments on Poirot's mysteries. Finally, I read some Christie novels - none in the last few years - and I think it is annoying that so many viewers are upset about the changes in the novel. Please, the spectators, think about what is presented to you on the film, not what you think should be there. That being said, the Poirot mysteries vary in quality, but not as much as the reviewers and evaluators would have believed. With the exception of the singular of the five small pigs, which was fabulous in plotting, character and theme, Poirot's longer films are neither good nor bad. For recording, I have seen all of the longer films Poirot / Suchet. Finally, movies without Lemon, Hastings and / or Japp are not good or bad because of their absence. However, the presence is either obtrusive (almost always with Japp) or irrelevant to Hastings. Lemon is in the middle.
