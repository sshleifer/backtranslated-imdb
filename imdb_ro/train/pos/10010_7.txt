There are many diseases that were born in the mind of man that were given in modern life. A constant vigilance or information accumulated in the Pyschosis field kept psychologists, counselors and psychiatrists busy with enough work to last for decades. Occasionally, some of these mental phenomena are discovered by those who are unaware of their remedy or even of their existence. This is the premise of the movie "The Night Listner". She tells the story of a popular host called Gabriel Noon (Robin Williams), who spends their evenings blowing up their audience with live stories about Gay lifestyle. Perhaps because his show loses a genuine veneer that makes Noon admit that he is no longer himself. Feeling abandoned by both his lover Jess (Bobby Cannavale) and his best friend (Joe Morton), he seeks shelter in his despair and isolation. It is here, a mysterious voice in the night asking for help. Noon needs to feel useful and reaches the desperate voice of a 14-year-old boy named Peter (Rory Culkin). Read the boy's bestial manuscript describing the early life and sexual abuse of his brutal parents, Noon is captivated and wants to help. However, things are not what they seem and the night is soon wrapped in an elusive and bizarre story ripped off even from a medical nightmare. This movie is pure Robin Williams and it was not for Toni Collette who plays Donna D. Logand, Sandra Oh as Anna and John Cullum as pop, this could be comic. Instead, it may prove to be one of William's most serious performances. ***
