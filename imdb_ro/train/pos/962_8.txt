I just finished watching this movie and I have to say I was so impressed. Everything was gorgeous. Acturing the characters, the story. A credible child who grew up in courage, always willing to help others. His mother must be proud. I could not take my eyes off this movie because of the fear of losing something. It is the prefect's fable / moral story, cute and frightening spirits and "monsters", but nevertheless the folklore of the heart. A child beat and tortured at school, becoming a hero. He was chosen as a horseman at the local festival and on a trip to Mount Goblin, where he discovered Yokai, which are stunning creatures that Brian Froud would be proud of. And evil Kato and his siderer who needed a hug. These wicked men capture the Yokai and throw them into a red pit together with unwanted objects such as motorcycles and other mechanical things, and mingle with a violent robotic monster whose only purpose is to kill. Takashi a little boy is the one who became their savior alongside a red / dragon man, a turtle and a river princess, and a pretty creature that if it were America it could have turned it into a toy cute and sold at all good toy stores. The lines are good, in particular, Do not try children at home and other stones that bring you a smile on your lips. Suspend the faith and follow it with a child or yourself and enjoy! Although I must admit that the end was a bit sad. And not necessarily like that. Luck Furdion
