In September 2003, Jonny Kennedy, 36, died. He had a terrible disease, called Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) - which meant that his skin literally descended to the smallest touch, leaving his body covered with agonizing wounds and led to a final fight against skin cancer. In the past few months, Jonny has decided to work with director Patrick Collerton to document his life and death, and the result was a first-ever film in March that was an uplifting, confusing and humorous, challenging story , of a singular man. Without moving away from EB's bleak reality, the film was also a feast of a life that lived fully. Produced and directed by Patrick Collerton and first introduced in March 2004, the boy whose skin has faded became the most discussed documentary of that year. It has attracted nearly five million viewers, and after screening, the audience donated over half a million pounds to Jonny's career, DEBRA. A Jonny Kennedy Memorial Fund was created to raise another half million in order to make sure that Jonny Kennedy left a million pounds of inheritance.
