There is a very clever humor in this movie, which is both a parody and a tribute to the actors. However, after a while, it seems to be an exercise in style (although it was not a big gag, such as Balasko continuing Dussolier's role and a very good action by all those involved) and I was wondering what did this movie Blier do? Everything is finally revealed when Blier, who leads Claude Brasseur, receives a call from his father (Bernard Blier) - from the sky, and gets the chance to say how much he misses. An effective and obviously honest emotional trap. But there is not enough dramatic tension or emotional involvement to keep the rest of the movie all the time running. However, some really beautiful scenes and sequences and anyone who likes these "mosntres sacr√©s" in French cinema should get a lot of pleasure from this movie.
