Elegance and class are not always the first words that come to my mind when people (at least people who could do such a thing) sit around and talk about the noir movie. However, some of the best films of the genre, "Out of the Past", "The Killers", "In a Lone Place", "Night and the City", manage a level of sophisticated sophistication that raises them beyond a phrase with a moody trap and its connotations of preposterous shadows, fedoras and femme-faces. <br /> <br /> "Where the pavement ends", a hard-to-find film - the only copy of the best video store stored in Manhattan was a tough bootleg from the AMC cable channel - belongs to a category with these classics. From the moment the black cloud of opening credits passes, a curtain draws around the world that breaks up with Detective Mark Dixon, and once it passes, it gets closer and more, threatening suffocation. Sure, he is the famous "dark-haired policeman," but Dana Andrews gives Dixon a state of uneasiness and a disturbing intensity that makes you feel uncomfortable as it sounds. And yes, he has been beating the suspects for too long, and the new-promoted boss (Karl Malden, on a typically robust and commanding trip) warns him "for the last time". <br /> <br /> However, Dixon hates these thieves too much to stop now. And the boys did not come to come? <br /> <br /> "Hoods, dusts, mugs, nickel-rat rats" spits when that tough shade of a boss removes it and uncovers all the complaints the office receives about Dixon's right hook. It is advisable for him to cool himself for his good. Instead, he takes things in his own hands. <br /> <br /> And what world of trouble he finds when he relies on his instincts, and he returns to nature which may or may not have been passed from one generation before. <br /> <br /> Immediately, he is in the deep with the cops, the union, his partner. Dixon's questionable involvement in a "crime investigation" threatens his job, making him wonder if he is simply the basis of the ones he swore to bring. Like Bogart in "Lonely Place," maybe "get rid of what it is?" /> <br /> When he has no place to return, he discovers that he has practically condemned his unexpected relationship with a seraphic beauty (the wonderful Gene Tierney) who seems to be able to transform the bachelor's existence into something worthwhile to come home to. <br /> <br /> The pacing of this gorgeous film is stretched and tight. The group of writers who contributed to the production polished the script to a high gloss - the dialogue is fast without disintegrating into dated parody feeds, passionate without becoming melodramatic or sappy. <br /> <br /> And all these top-notch directions and acting is not too slick or polished to weaken his emotional film. Gene Tierney is angelic, soft-focus beauty is used with great effect. She appears to be a wide-range actress, and her gentle and good nature is as unlimited here as her psychosis in "Let It in Heaven." Andrews' scenes between Tierney and Dixon become more intense and touching as close as possible seems to be self-destructing. Near the end of the string, cut, crushed and exhausted, Dixon sums up his crowd: "Innocent people can also enter into terrible blocs ..." he says. "A false move and you're in your head." Perhaps what makes this movie so convincing is the feeling that things could be wrong for almost anyone - especially for someone who is trying so well to do good - with a slight change in the wind, a wrong decision or a punch, or, most scary, because of factors you do not control. Noir always reflected the darkest fears, brought them to the surface. "Where the pavement ends" does it in a realistic way. <br /> <br /> (A part-of-a-part film: this sterling film has a double double of a blonde model that would not seem out of place in the Mystery Science Theater. <br /> <br /> But fans Noir - heck, any film fans - who have not seen this are in for terrible treatment.
