In life, we first organize stones (Piedras in Spanish), such as a career, a family, friendship and love. In this way, we will find a space between them to fit the smaller stones, our small needs. If you act in reverse, you will not have enough space for larger stones. The five protagonists in this film are women who have failed to organize the big "stones" in their lives. Ramon Salazar, a film director in Spain, defines his first piece Stones in this way. The film tells the parallel, contradictory trajectory of five women: Anita (Monica Cervera, 1975-), Isabel (Angela Molina, 1955-), Adela (Antonia San Juan, 1961-), Leire (Najwa Nimri, 1972-) Maricarmen , 1954-). Everyone strives to remove the stones that appear harshly in their path or, worst, in their shoes. There are five Cinderella in search of Prince Charming and a new chance in life. The best story of the five Cinderella is Anita (Monica Cervera), who also plays in "20 centimeters", "Busco", "Crimen Ferpecto", "Entre Vivir y Sonar", "Hongos" and "Octavia ".
