Crush offers a combination of drama, humor and irony, which the English find very well when it comes to heart issues. The best known for John McKay's direction has written this wonderful script about three friends of forty years in a small town in England. All three professional women who have come down with luck with men have formed a ritual meeting of ladies with gin, phagas and sweets included, with all sorts of erroneous behaviors or the needs of their libido. Andie MacDowell, once again cast by the British (which is the place she finds most emanating), is absolutely charming as the master master of a prestigious school that engages with a younger man. A gossip in the small town and disapproving jealous friends (casting of great support) are confronted with her relationship. Discovering a series of unfortunate brutal events and showed us many difficulties when someone follows true happiness. Keep in mind that the main premise of this film is friendship, and the closure shows us exactly that. This is the type of movie you love or hate, which is why I think there have been many mixed reviews and not the greatest success when this movie was released. Because I'm sure most find the movie now. I really enjoyed this movie and I recommend it to those who enjoy movies like "Love Actually" and "Three Weddings and a funeral". Not to mention the soundtrack is extraordinary capturing those crucial moments.
