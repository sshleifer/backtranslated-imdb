This movie is great and I would recommend to rent it for anyone with their own local video store. Or even better, you could buy it because you have a chance to look at it all the time. I remember seeing this movie as a child and it was great then. But after seeing her again yesterday we found it amazing. A good combination of comedy (though not as big as "Mr. Magoo" - another favorite) and action. This deserves 10/10 and I hope they will make a follow-up soon (crossed fingers). If you do babysitting or need to take care of little children for something, then I would recommend renting this movie because it will keep them entertained by hours :).
