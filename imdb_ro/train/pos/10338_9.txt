Norman, are you here? it was (this is the third hand, so take it with a grain of salt), adapted to an African-American family from the Jewish one, when it made the transition from the stage and screen. It was also one of those films originally filmed in movies, so the prints from the theater could not have been so great. However, Redd Foxx and others' performances were pretty good. <br /> <br /> What I wanted to tell you is that the movie is a PERIOD PIECE: it reflects the attitudes of the mid-70s to finding a homosexual or daughter son in your family. For this reason alone, it is quite interesting - if not a little "hollywood". Do not you believe me? Check curtain lines, etc. Very stereotyped. Not too deep. But ... the film really shines in a few areas. There is a side split scene when Redd Foxx tries to find his wife who ran with his brother (!) La Ensenada in a twisted Pinto. The phone conversation across the border is really memorable. <br /> <br /> But ... the best scene in the movie is when Wayland Flowers and Madame made their gay routine that she did in gay bars and nightclubs. As far as I know, this is the only time a routine has been filmed. And, it's a slightly clean version and much shorter, I was told. However, it is a time lady, and should not be missed. People still have lines in Wayland; the man was genuinely endowed. Enjoy the movie!
