I really did not expect much of this movie, but it was not bad; in fact it was pretty good. This movie contained some of the funniest bits of writing I've ever seen in a cinematic picture. Now I'm not saying that this is one of the funniest movies of all time, but I laughed quite hard in some parts. "The police led the death of my father a suicide. They said he fell on a lift shaft, on bullets." Now this movie is not for everyone, its worst humor like Zoolander or Dodgeball; So if you hate these movies, I'd probably recommend you go out clearly. Overall, it was a nice film about a group of wannabi superheroes who eventually become real heroes. It's a highly overrated comedy, which many people probably have not seen yet, because, like me, before she saw it, she expected it to be a total garbage. After watching this movie, I finally understand why this movie has managed to assemble such a superstar cast that includes Ben Stiller, William H. Macy, Hank Azaria and even the Good Burger child. It's because Mystery Man is full of the great comedy era of 7 out of 10. A very big surprise.
