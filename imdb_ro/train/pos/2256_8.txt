I do not know what to expect from his partner and friend / coach Van Damme and his choreographer for most of his films. It was nice to see him play as "TONG PO" in "Kickboxer and other Van Damme movies, now he is alone; he and his wife make a wonderful team, in which Qissi is the director of action and leads a bad guy and he a woman was the writer, the producer and directed most of the scenes that did not require action. She also did a good job of editing the film, together they did a good story job made sense, , the rulers were real fighters and they showed themselves well together - the story gathered well and if you can consider it ... there is no bad language, no sex, no action, no new for me.
