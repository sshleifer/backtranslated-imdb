As I understand, after the Chinese took Hong Kong, infamous Cat. 3 Hong Kong movies have disappeared. At least until now, and how amazing this movie is. I knew it was a serious crime scene, but it was the first Cat. 3 I bought something that was done recently, I was not sure what to expect. A hit-camboaic goes to Hong Kong to beat the wife of a judge, who is also a lawyer. Apparently, the judge made the arrangements for the man struck, because he divorced the judge and threatened to take all his money. All these are known in the first ten minutes, so nothing is given away. After the blow, the cops find the hit man pretty quickly, but trying to arrest him, more cops and civilians are killed. He eludes the police, and now the race is to catch the guy before he escapes back to Cambodia. This is a movie that never stops and gives the spectator the chance to catch his breath. Yes, it is very violent and intense, many cops are killed, because the man-stroke turns out to be very hard to follow and gets down when I find him. On the way, the one who hits trying to hide in a pit, finds a woman raped and maltreated by a man. He helps and rescues her from the guy, and she convinces the man-shot to take him to escape. I liked this movie, it's like a roller coaster that continues to move and moves at high speed because an incident leads to another, and police sometimes are as bad or worse than the one that strikes. The actor is extremely good, and shooting and location photography are breathtaking. There is no way to leave in this movie, not even with the very incredible ending. The conclusion is quite incredible, and also a fitting end for all actions and violence. Yes, violence is sometimes brutal, but this is not a crime of crime that will not do you anything. "Dog Eat Dog" needs a wider launch, including a launch R1 certainly. Great movie, highly recommended.
