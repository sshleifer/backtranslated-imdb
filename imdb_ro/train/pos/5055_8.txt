I did not expect too much when I first saw the DVD cover. I mean, Pierce Brosnan like Gray Owl? Ah ... but then the story started in progress, unfolded in a beautiful film photographed and rhythm. I was surprised and delighted by this true story. It made me want to read more about this fascinating character, which means that the director fulfilled his purpose and the movie was a success!
