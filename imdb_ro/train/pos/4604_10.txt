This movie is undoubtedly a perfect 10/10 .. for all those in there who are evaluating this movie because it has no "good plot" or something like that, that's ridiculous, saying that a Jackie Chan movie is bad because of its plot is like saying a porn movie is bad because it has no plot! you look at Jackie Chan for battle scenes because the action does not focus so much on a good story or something like that if you look at how he makes movies and compare it to other American films of that era and even later you will realize that Jackie Chan's films were on top of the top scenes scenes and not the very good plots, while American movies had fat scenes but misleading scenes of action compared to what Jackie Chan did at the time. Porn is tracked for porn, Jackie Chan is watched for ACTION, I think people are rating it bad because there is no plot, because you think it is how a clever movie critic would evaluate a good movie, but the way in which I see it is a good movie is a movie that can entertain me. Sure the middle of the movie was boring, VERY BORING, but it put the rest in that way, which is all action scenes and stunts greatly to pay for all this. This has changed the way in which the American action films have been created, they even have scenes from this film. If you want a real man, a real entertainer, then watch this movie and many more from Jackie Chan, it's just everyone. He literally makes American movies look like a walk in the park and even in the movies TODAYS. American films are based on both special effects and safety threads and stunts and many more. The police story and many other Jackie Chan movies are a piece of work for a true entertainer who just goes everything and is very talented about what he can do. a masterpiece
