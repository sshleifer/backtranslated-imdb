Of all the football films I have watched, this is one of the best two. The other is the pitch of the fever. But the hero is the world's best tournament and, consequently, the greatest player ever to play in a world cup, Diego Maradona. This story is centered around it mainly but also revolves around the other giants of the game at that time. The musical score is evocative and the pictures are strong. Michael Caine's narrative is impartial and also dramatically calm. This story does not refer to individual World Cup games; rather it is more about the players' emotions and the beauty of the event itself. Exciting games such as France / Brazil (one of the greatest games of all time) were covered in the same direction. The Argentine final in W Germany was also in the same direction. highly recommended. A classic of world football. to be watched over and over again, especially if you are a Maradona fan.
