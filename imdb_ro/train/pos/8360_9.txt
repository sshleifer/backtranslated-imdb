This is one of the most famous films of the French sexual empowerment of the seventies, with Gerard Depardieu and Patrick Dewaere in extremely sarcastic roles. It is also one of the many dark psychological dramas of the seventies / eighties, such as "Serie Noire", "Buffet Froid", "Beau Pere", all made by Blier. I want to correct the previous comment that was posted on the film: the title translated in English is very far from the French version. It is true that both protagonists are the "places", but the title in French could literally be translated by "waltz dancers", which is a metaphor of the testicles movement ...
