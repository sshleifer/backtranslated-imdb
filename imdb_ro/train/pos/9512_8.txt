This is a movie that can make you want to see it again. Especially I liked how it was over. I did not see the end come, but when the law was not rejected the first time, one suspects that it will come back again. The story collapses and could have been more psychological, but understanding the story had to capture the spectator and the action was necessary for that. It's hard to believe that Michael Jr. might be so apparently dissatisfied as his younger brother and mother were injured. But I can appreciate the fact that the stage piece could not draw our attention there because it had a bigger story to tell. Some have complained about Hanks as a gangster. I think this is not justified. If his character had been harder, he would not have cared if his son pulled a trigger or not. Eight stars for that. Although it was released in 2002, I just saw it for the first time yesterday on DVD.
