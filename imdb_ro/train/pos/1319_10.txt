This movie is a great fun. I recommend you to look at yourself and then look back with your friends. I did last night and it was fascinating how well Norma Khouri could bring everyone into her world! I felt a little weird watching my friends walking through the same roller coaster as I did the first time. But they all thanked me and I loved the movie. You know it's a great movie if you spend 2 hours after the movie talks about the movie! <br /> <br /> I once saw a man cone up to Norma Khouri's level, but not where the same size ring. He fools good and rich people to my old Berkeley CA A.A. a group in which everyone trusts the others. He would "sponsor" only the people who seemed very good to do. Who knew he would have stolen more than 100k (in 1987, when it was real money) after being in town for a month. His victims were very fragile because they were in their first month or week to be awake. He was sick with a big laugh and a big smile on his face. The crime above is nothing compared to what Norma Khouri did to her old neighbor. But I do not want to give anything. I found her one evening in a night movie, "Showtim," I think. This is always the most cinematic experience to be completely cheated to see something and blow your mind. Drag your friends to see this and tell them nothing. It's a very fun movie, it's moving fast and never catches you. It should be an international classic for all time. I think all the great movies finally rise to the top. Time will be great for this movie. I'm sorry no one has ever heard of it, in some ways that makes surprises even better. The director and publisher were fantastic. They deserved the best documentary. <br /> <br /> BROWSE THIS FILM!
