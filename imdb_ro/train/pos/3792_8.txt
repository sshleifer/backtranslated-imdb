I saw this movie earlier today and I was amazed at how precise the dialogue for the main characters is. It did not feel like a movie - it felt more like a documentary (the part I liked best). The top ladies of this movie seemed as real to me as any 15-year-old girls I know. Generally, a very nice movie for those who enjoy independent movies.
