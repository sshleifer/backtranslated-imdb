I'm 14, so you probably think I never heard of George Burns or Walter Matthau or somebody like that. You guys are wrong. I heard that George Burns was in this movie and that he won an Oscar for him. I've been a fan of George Burns since I was ten years old. I saw the movie Oh, God recently and I loved it. It was also very wonderful. George Burns did a great job. So did Walter Matthau (this is the first time I've ever seen him). And even if they had very small roles, Phyllis Diller and Steve Allen did a good job. The special thing they were filming would have been great if it had really done. Let me say this, if you are a fan of George Burns or Walter Matthau, you should see this movie right away!
