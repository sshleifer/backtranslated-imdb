Easily, the biggest low-budget horror film of all time. I saw the first movie when I was nine years old and I must say I was afraid of the hell. Now that I have all grown up, I see the film for what is really ... a genius work. Everyone, or at least anyone who has a taste, dreamed of seeing a snowman walking around killing people, even if they would not recognize it. I've always found something really scary about the snowmen, so naturally, for a horror thief like me, this mummy was a dream come true. Some people say this movie is bad or otherwise devoid of any intelligence ... is a movie about a snowman in series, what the hell would you expect? Anyone who gave this film a low score is obviously too rigid to sit back and have a good laugh at silly tools and cheap gore. I like this movie for what it is, a comedy, and until the cinema industry raises and makes a serious horror blow to a killer snowman (which, unfortunately, seems to be impossible) I will always keep this great piece of indie horror close to my heart.
