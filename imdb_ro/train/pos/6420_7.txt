This is a wonderful one! Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding joined to make a powerful and influential film. This is the true story of the first US Navy's first black diver and the obstacles he faced in obtaining his certification in the hands of a racist Master Scout. Along the way, he must also face a common bigotry from all his classmates, none of whom he wants in the classroom. She moves from the barracks when she arrives. Eventually, he gets certified and continues to have a great career as a US Navy diver. Look at this! It's a wonderful story about courage and honor. As the story unfolds, we see that racism fades slowly and everyone begins to respect people one by one.
