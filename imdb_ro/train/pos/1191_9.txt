Robert Taylor as the crazy buffalo hunter Charlie Gilson is the main character in this movie. At first I thought Charlie would redeem like John Wayne in The Searchers or James Stewart in The Naked Spur. But as the movie goes on, Gilson continues to make more atrocities until you realize that there is no hope for him. Stewart Granger is Sandy McKenzie, who wants to stop the hunt because he realizes that buffaloes will soon disappear and become disgusted by the killing act. Gilson is a natural killer who does not distinguish between animals or human beings. Debra Paget as an Indian girl is a surprising character, given the censorship imposed by herself at that time. She is with Gilson's resignation even if she hates him. The last scene of a frozen Gilson is unforgettable.
