I do not remember how this movie received a cinema show here. I saw her only when he came to the cable. The film deals with dehumanizing children in killing machines. Specifically, a person, the way he is replaced and cast (literally) into a community outside the world where he is unable to cope with what he really is and what he feels. for me, a lot of people expected Rambo to be in space and would have been happy if they were. I'm happy it was not - Kurt does a good job of portraying the emotional disorder. The scene outside of computers shows this, although the decision for two replies is slowing down at this point. This is not a classic SF movie in the way Bladerunner, Alien, Silent Run, Logan Run or THX1138 were, however, unfortunately the closest I've seen in a long time. He changes into the film to a credible level, he does not crack Arnie a lining, he does not become Snake Plissken and there is no definitively happy ending. That's why this movie did not do well. She did not follow the formula, and among an 18-25-year-old American audience that was unforgivable was not what they were expecting to see. Fear and discipline. <br /> Always.
