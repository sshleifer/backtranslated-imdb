I'm not going to lie, it's a great movie. I saw her four months ago at my local theater. I saw her the second time, and I felt bored in slow scenes. Sid (lazy) is not all that boasts me, but Diego (a mountain lion, I think) is really good in the movie. The animation is remarkable, and the story has a touch of touch. It's worth taking kids under the age of 10, but teenagers would probably be a bit boring. Also, character uniqueness is so exciting. As I said, it's a pretty good movie, but I'd love "Big Story 2" or "Shrek" bigger. 8/10
