This is a very exciting movie. It 's a comedy action movie mixed in. Foxx teams with Epic comedian in this movie to give a comedy spin. It will keep you awesome what will happen to Foxx. It was a good shot, the director used the right colors in this movie (dark blue colors) to give him some sense. Kimberly Elise has also starred in this movie and it's always a pleasure to see her on the big screen. She plays her role well. Even Jamie Kennedy is in this movie. It is worth seeing that you have not seen it. It's definitely worth it if you have a Jamie Foxx fan. It deserves more credit than it actually is.
