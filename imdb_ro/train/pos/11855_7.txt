Wow. Something of surprise. Though flawed, it is much better than I expected. Arcturus with nearly 3,000 passengers is in the last days of his sixteen-day trip to Jupiter. Without warning, the ship's brain (the central computer) sounds a disaster alarm and orders everyone to evacuate. <br /> <br /> Soon, there is only a handful of remaining people, including one of the ship's astronauts (Penny), the captain (Cary), and the head of the shipping line (Kenyon). The alarm appears to have been false and the main Cerebral is acting erratic. All passengers and crew must escape the ship and avoid personal conflicts to survive. The movie starts very well. The opening trade is a very pleasant touch. There are parallel evidences with 2001: A Space Odyssey and Titanic Dive History. The film slows down from time to time and has stimulus problems, but is generally well-developed and well acting.
