That's right at the top of my list of the most funny hysterical shows I've ever seen. I laughed so hard, I'm sure I lost half of my jokes. He presents Izzard as an extraordinarily talented comedian. What I really like is that he does not seem to "cut" the material for his audience. Its time is impeccable and the routine is tied together as a performance piece rather than just a series of gags. Eventually.
