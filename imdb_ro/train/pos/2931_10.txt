Eddie Murphy Delirious is undoubtedly the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life. When I saw her for the first time 2 years ago, I was in sewing for weeks after that. So far I have seen it 17 times, and I have always laughed my ass. For those who do not know Eddie Murphy was a brilliant comedian before being a Hollywood superstar. There is no tedious point in this piece of genius, unlike Eddie Murphy Raw, which was released in 1987, which unfolds in the middle. If you are not a kind of person who can not stand then I would not advise you to see her as you will probably hear swearing of a form every 5-10 seconds. I gave it to 10 out of 10, because it presents the greatest comic genius of them to the best.
