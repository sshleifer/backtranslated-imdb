A very good shot. A necessity for any musical snob. You do not really have to know about the troops enjoying the film. Before the movie, I only heard two songs from Dandy Warhols. The only necessary thing is an open mind. <br /> <br /> The film centers around the massacre of Brian Jonestown. Dandy Warhols have a role in the film as a "rival band," but they are the second time at BJM. Dandy Warhols does not play an important role in the movie, as I guessed initially, but again, they did not have the element of enthusiasm and unpredictability of BJM. It can only help you to be fascinated by the band and its very charismatic man, Anton Newcombe. In itself, it is a film and insightful study about the music industry. Just watch this movie and enjoy yourself.
