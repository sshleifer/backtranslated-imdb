Sydney Lumet, though one of the oldest active directors, still has a game! A few years ago he shot "Find Me Guilty", a proof for everyone that Vin Diesel can act effectively if he has the right opportunity and the right director. If she had gone after this movie (a true masterpiece in my eyes), no one would have blamed him for it. But he's still going strong, his next movie already announced for 2009. <br /> <br /> But let's stick with this movie right here. Distribution list is incredible, their top performance. The few shades in their performances, the "real" dialogue and / or the situations that evolve throughout the movie are just amazing. The (time) structure of the movie, which holds your toes all the time, mixing time lines so tightly that editing seems natural / flawless. The story is accentuated by the fact that, even in a "normal" time structure, it would have been at least a good movie (Drama / Thriller). I can recommend it a lot, the rest depends on you! : O)
