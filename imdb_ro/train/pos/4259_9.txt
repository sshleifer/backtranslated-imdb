Solino really moved me with his deeply drawn characters. While it was just a story of rivalry between two brothers, it was not just hatred or jealousy. What I liked most about the film was the way I could identify with the feelings Gigi had, especially when he had to take his mother back to his hometown in Italy and miss the participation in the ceremony to award the film's film awards to his film. To see this character struggling so loudly between his artistic dream and his sense of birth to his mother was so frustrating. Even in the end, when he made another attempt to reach his father, he was so brave. And as in real life, most dads can never go through their walls to reach their children. I could even identify with Giancarlo, the brother who, while he was even more sure of his brother, was so insecure. A very nice movie that made me laugh and cry.
