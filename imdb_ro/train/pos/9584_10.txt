Yes, these movies are the charts. Cant recommend more. Homosexual or Strait is a great doco for anyone who likes the film. Very funny, sad and interesting. Never boring. Great access. A movie made with passion and interest in the subject. Some of the shows and just amazing. If you find this film only on VHS, it's worth watching. That's great. 10 out of 10. I have to see a part of this doco now for almost ten years and I did not understand what I'm watching. Interviews are very revealing about the ego of performers who are like heavy boxers trying to put their way out of the ghetto. The director was apparently a first stopwatch, so an achievement. Cold. Watch it.
