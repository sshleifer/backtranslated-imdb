Bourne Ultimatum (2007) Review: After an impressive set of two, we get the last installment. Here I am: <br /> <br /> Bourne Ultimatum has everything. We have Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) on the elbows of those who know everything. He ran too much time. This time it's over. Bourne Ultimatum has a wonderful plot, great writing, fantastic direction, suspense and some of the best summer action. Matt Damon probably has the best performance so far. He has the conviction and swelling of the disturbed assassin's desire. There is a clever humor here and a bit of suspense. Reactions to certain events will make you laugh (in a good way) or cheer up. (or both) I heard a lot of clever laughter in the theater and a lot of stutter. The audience loved him. <br /> <br /> The Bourne Ultimatum offers everything in a nice package wrapped in gifts. All the goods and then others. This is, in my opinion, the best movie this summer. The last word: Excellent conclusion. The best of the trilogy. That's what should be the summer movie thrillers. I like the Bourne trilogy.
