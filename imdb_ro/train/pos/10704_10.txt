Are you a giraffe? ... ask John for Nadia, and she, answering well, answers: yes. In this way, start communicating between a man and a woman who does not know each other and, at the same time, the questions and doubts of "The Face of Birth". A movie I've heard many times but I dare not see ... up to two hours of writing this. "Birthday Girl" is a passionate film that makes me count at the same time that Nicole Kidman is one of the best actresses (besides she is beautiful and intelligent) I've ever seen. "Birthday Girl" is the story of a lonely and routine man who is looking for a wife on the internet. The woman he finds comes from Russia. She seems to be that delicate, normal woman, no more. One day, on her day, suddenly comes her cousin and boyfriend. The man begins to discover certain things. Because here, he will not be the only routine and routine man who have always been. Much of us will think that this movie is just a normal one with a exploited plot. Much of us believe that action and emotions are safe and not Romanian. But "Girl Birthday" is exactly the opposite. This movie is full of good surprises, good performances and an imaginative plot that I have not seen or even imagined. This romantic thriller, with some funny touches, is an excellent natural movie with plenty of suggestions for such movies. "Birthday Girl" has some beauty and cruelty in her scenes, but at the same time a certain nature touches and makes it so profound. "Day Girl" is sometimes sad, sometimes funny, sometimes violent, but in the end it is totally satisfactory. And I'm not sorry to say it's a masterpiece. I'm sorry for mistakes ... well, if there is.
