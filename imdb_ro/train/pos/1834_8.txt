This movie is very moving. I do not care what people say about this movie, this is a very good movie. The performance of Amitabh Bachchan's role has his father dying, because he wants to teach his son how to handle life if anything happens to him and Akshay Kumer was great in the role of Aditya Thakur. Supporting role Shefali Shetty, who played the role of Sumitra Thakur, was magnificent. Priyanka Chopra was good at her little role in the film. Ragpal Yadav, the dead brain servant and Boman Irani as the father-show-off, have a very good connection and the comedy scene was hilarious. The direction is very good.
