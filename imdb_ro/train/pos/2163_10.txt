I just like this movie. It is a perfect example of the surprising stories that emerged from Asian cinema. It was a recent remake of Hollywood in this film, with Richard Gere and just the terrible Jennifer Lopez. Do not confuse the two movies. The original Japanese film is exciting, subtle and wonderful. The Hollywood version is exactly the opposite. I was tough when I first saw the trailer for the remodeled American version and played in it. It's Hollywood Holistic Typical Commercialism, the worst. The remake cherishes the argument that some foreign movies can not be improved. The only reason why the original film has not become more widely seen is the American public's aversion to subtitles. One of the main reasons why this movie would never work in an American story is that the reserved, highly socially conservative character of Japanese public staff is under discussion in this film. Of course, the main character wakes up to a fuller understanding of live life through dance, but half of the film's tension stems from stereotypes and stingy dancers they face in Japan. Please try to see this movie in its original form, not on the terrible screen. And please let go of the American remake ... it's a superficial transvestity compared to the original Japanese movie. Yes, I know the "original" movie is much older, and it's just a Japanese story, but the only two people are likely to see this and the new US remake soon. Speaking of foreign movies, I will make some quick recommendations: 1. Monsoon Wedding-I list this first for a reason, remarkable movie! 2.Johnny Stechino - Very funny Italian fake idiom! 3.Shiri - A bit of Korean action that mixes both the Asian flame and the American-style plot 4.Run Lola Run - A German film that integrates its ingenious techno score. Well, just a quick list anyway:)
