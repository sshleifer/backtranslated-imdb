Since I heard about Ralph Bakshi's version of "The Lord of the Rings," I was wondering: What the hell is the "rotoscope" animation? Well ... I finally found ... I saw this movie about three years ago without having any idea of ​​who Ralph Bakshi is ... And I liked ... a lot ... The line of very good story ... even has a wonderful character development that's great for a cartoon ... See if you're bored with contemporary animation ... Do not get me wrong ... I'm not saying it's just a cartoon. .. It's a pretty good movie ...
