I was the only one who saw the connection between Camus' discussion "the myth of Sisyphus" and Mary's life? In the Camus version, a man is condemned to spend eternity with a giant boulder he has to catch on a hill. unfortunately, every time it reaches the top of the boulder and ends back to the bottom so that it starts. it might have been a hammer knocked in his eyes, I'm not sure right now. in the film, she spends her life struggling to make her life together, unfortunately every time she wins any leg she falls and loses everything. where he is the party he throws where he gets sick, offends his falafel lover and is practically attacked by liev schrieber. If you question this theory, keep in mind how this scene ends with an attempt to climb a star flight while the books fall from nowhere, hindering its progress until it eventually passes. The next morning, when he wakes up, he is still on the stairs, never reaching the top.
