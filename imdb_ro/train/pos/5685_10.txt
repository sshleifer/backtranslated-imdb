Kudos to direct and sing for such a realistic film. The misfortune, the lack of brightness and despair attracted me to the film and kept me there. I was really impressed with how the data and information was transmitted in the film; ie newspapers, letters, etc. He kept the movie moving at a rate so fast that I did not feel the need to advance once. Personally, I thought all the principles did a great job ... it was great to see Bosworth and Kudrow in such difficult roles. It made me want to cry at times. Val Kilmer did not surprise me ... his performances of this nature usually leave me with respect. Generally, this is a brilliant movie that should not be missed!
