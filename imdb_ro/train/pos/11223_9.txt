Tommy JOnes and Matt Dillon make the gaming world proud. The various wrist movements had to be taught, because cramping is a skill in itself. <br /> <br /> There are some surprises. As cynical as today, I fully expected a "good girl" to weep over her grave instead of his Buddha. Especially with her remarks about "going to the funeral of her best friend" when she met Matt. And, of course, you expect Matt to kill the guy who dumped the battery acid in front of Mr. Allen, illuminating it (an interesting role for Bruce Dern). WRRROOONNNNGGG !!! Some of the other Hollywood tips happen, but the writing is so excellent, acting so carefully that you are not aware of blissfully. And the music is OUT OF THIS WORLD. Returning to the 1950s when our "native passions" were first unleashed by Ray Charles and Bo Diddley's music. Even a small racism avenge his nasty head in Chicago, but in a club called the "Biloxi," with a Confederate flag, claiming racist remarks. I'll look again, just to hear the music. Okay, I got the FACTOTUM audio track, so I can hear it in the car. Watch both of you together and see Matt mature ... playing bar characters in both. Even if he has a bar at Paramount HOtel in New York, he probably has great opportunities to do his studies. Big actor, who just came to his own. He shows fine tonal performance ... good and bad in his characters. "His farm boy" is a wonderful study, made particularly boring by the bassett-hound eyes. He makes love, convincing, too. Since she was in several movies with Diane Lane as a teenager, I wonder how it was ... to make love with an actress with whom you've grown pretty. Add conviction, I'll say that.
