This has to be one of the best, if not the best film I've seen for a long time. He had enough action to satisfy a fan and yet the plot was very good. I liked the film a lot and got myself trapped from start to finish. He added blood and gore there, but brought the realistic nature of what is happening to the film face and even had a tearing jerker end for many people I should believe. It's a watch I have to watch for anyone. He has seen many reviews by sliding the film, but to be fair, most of the movies that get bad reviews prove to be the best. this proves it once again. Rent this movie, buy this movie, come out and watch this movie. You will not be disappointed.
