Despite the other comments listed here, this is probably the best Dirty Harry movie made; a film that reflects - for the better or worse - the country's socio-political sentiments in the years of Reagan's glory in the early 1980s. It is also a kickass action movie. Opening up with a female liberal judge reversing a murder case due to lack of tangible evidence and then going straight into the coffee encounter with more unfortunate miseries (the scene that suggests the famous "Continue, make me"), "Sudden Impact "is a non-stop roller coaster of an action movie. The first time you catch your breath is when Inspector Callahan is sent to a nearby city to investigate the background of a killed cap. It's getting better out there, with a group of grotesque batons for Callahan, with a sheriff with a mysterious past. The gorgeous direction and photography and an eye-catching scenario make this film one of the best in the '80s.
