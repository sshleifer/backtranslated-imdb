It looks like there are only two types of reviews of this movie on the net. Those who hate and curse Ralph Bakshis and those who love him and call it brilliant work. I'm inclined to be in the middle. I have to agree with most of the critics of this film (for example, the cruel cutting of the story, the evil rotoscopic dragons, the actors, etc.). But you are missing this thing I still love this movie. Rotoscoping (when done properly) adds a strange animal dimension to the charecters and the final battle scene at the end of the movie is fantastic. The surrealist scenes when the Neroers follow Frodo are elegant and well executed and the musical scores ... magical. Unfortunately, the bad movie where you can win a movie, but if you can ignore it, it's a great movie. (No doubt I will be licked by a furious crowd of people who hate this movie after I write this review, ah well, so is life)
