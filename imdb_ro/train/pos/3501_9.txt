One of the best movies I've seen in the past five years! The spectacle is universally spectacular in a story of love and bravado young on the lower side of East Side in New York City, with the two directions being superstars in the process. Funny, charming, sad and inspired, this is a totally rejuvenating attempt by urban youth who put Larry Clark's often tedious stream into the trough where he belongs ... though I must admit that Bully was a reduction over its normal tariff. Victor Vargas's growth is a movie that you will kick with because you missed ... so do not miss!
