I'm a fan of the two actors / singers, especially Gackt, and when I first discover this movie and watch the trailer, I think it's crazy. After a long wait, I finally saw it and here is my comment ... I think everyone knows the story and will not talk about it, instead of this my applause first appears in acting, in general, that Japanese movies have not had brilliance and action. Still, in MoonChild's all cast is simply great and he has come into it, especially Gackt reflects the emotions of his characters and changes quite well, I like many of his scenes both dramatic and humorous, and for HYDE, his role is good, respectively, as his character, along the film. I did not like some movies, especially lighting and some colors, but because of the small budget, it still has brilliant moments, but the real jewel of the film is a story. it's ok for me, and the theme of friendship is the movie that is very well developed and appealing sometimes, and on the other hand, the story shows a cruel world that no one's life guarantees, and some memorable scenes of death reflect this theme in visual. An interesting note in part, this film has some similarities to the excellent movie vampire Interwiew with the Vampire, which is also played by the most beautiful (not beautiful) actors of American cinema, in fact, Moon Child is somewhat seen as a brother with Interwiew , but native to it. bit slow at times, I am a Japanese film fan and I used it for that, but there is no change MoonChild has some unnecessary scenes or characters.But all in all, this movie is very good and very emotional sometimes like for actors / singers duo I hope to see other movies in the future and recommend this to everyone who likes vampire-action-sci-fiction and romance movies 8/10
