I remember this movie since I was 12 years old, it was amazing .. I remember that the day does not resemble the most things that I chased then, I even tried to buy it, but like the horse rocking sh * t! Anyway, the act is a bit weird, but the story is amazing considering it was a real B movie with a low budget and the event that the battle scenes were amazing to watch, I must have seen it about 20 times. It was a very good movie and I liked the idea of ​​fighting robots controlled by a giant man, they had to ruin it by doing a broken spin "Crash and Burn", do not watch that movie how it is total pants! If you see a real fan of Sci-Fi, if it was re-created today, it would be a winner. I really would like to see a remake or even release it on DVD.
