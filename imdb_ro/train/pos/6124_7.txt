This movie is terrible! I think it was written as a serious film, but when the time came, Michael Cooney said, "Hey, let's go mad and condemn!" Characters are, in fact, easily developed. Oh, and the death sequences are the best. One thing I hate, however, was the weapon for a hair dryer. What was that about?
