I saw this movie when I was little - It was called "Glacier Fox". I was completely traumatized by her! There's a nice fox family. The beginning was great and I remember that I became very attached to the little foxes. I also remember that my mother took me out of the theater while I was in hysteria. I will not tell you what happened, but let's say it does not end well for all the foxes. I was used to Disney-type movies in which the animals do not really die. Oh, man. This movie made me cry for hours. It was a good movie ... I think - I was very small and telling the truth - I still remember that she is happy for the foxes and then I see that one of them dies. Hire it if you can, but you do not show your kids!
