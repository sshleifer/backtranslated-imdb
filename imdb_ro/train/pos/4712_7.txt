The bills are obvious, the bands are blurred, and the characters are the characters of walking - but I could not stop laughing at his very funny film. No matter how many times I see it, I still take a shot of it and I highly recommend it to all lovers of mindless entertainment.

If you had a bad week and you need a chicot, rent it on your way home home Friday night to give you a good start to the weekend.
