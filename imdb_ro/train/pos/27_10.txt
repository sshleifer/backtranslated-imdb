Emilio Miraglio "The Red Queen Kills Seven Times" (1972) is just about the most perfect giallo example I have ever seen, mixing all the necessary elements into one sinister stew. First of all, and of great importance to me, it has a complex, twisted plot that ultimately has a perfect sense, and the killer does not come completely to the left. The story of a series of huge crimes (you already know how many of the film's title, is not it?) What happens in the apparent fulfillment of an ancient prophecy about two sisters is implicit, and the killer, a red cock figure with mad laughter of a madman is so frightening and memorable. Every big giallo needs some glamorous actresses, and here we have a pretty big assortment led by beautiful beautiful Barbara Bouchet as one of the two sisters and, in one of her previous roles, Sybil Danning as a polished tramp at Barbara's fashion house. Another necessary ingredient of a superior giallo is a viscous and humble score, and Bruno Nicolai offers one for this film that should stay with you days. Great landscapes? Check again. Filmed largely in Wurzburg, Germany, the picture is really a treat for the eye. Okay, okay, but what about these crimes? After all, is not it about gialli? Well, I'm delighted to report that most viewers should be well pleased with various knifings, shots, impalements and other dishes that carnage this movie taste good ... not to mention the crypts, the sequence of strange dream, rats and bats (and lots of them too!), drug shots, a scene of rape, the red binding herbs and, in the person of Ugo Pagliai, a man's chip leader for female viewers. As I said, a perfect giallo. And even better, this DVD is from good people at No Ruam, and you know what it means: a superb print and a lot of extras to boot! Thank you guys!
