In the film, several references are made subtle to the Blade runner, but one of the most obvious is that the Cain 607 and his unit are all genetic constructs, race to be warriors consumable. But my favorite quote in the movie is "you should have made them smart and fast." Kurt Russell did an incredible job, his facial expressions or his lack in movies gave more about the story, then the rest of the piece combined. Even when he falls in love with Sandra, but he does not know how to deal with these emotions, his tears after being expelled from the group, or when he's embraced when he's embraced, and his attachment to the dumb boy, who in many ways remembers Todd about himself and what he could have been, if not for the selection to be a soldier.
