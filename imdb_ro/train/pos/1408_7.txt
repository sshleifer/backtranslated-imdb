A Pentagon's scientific team seems to have perfected a serum that causes invisibility, but when the lead boffin tries it, he can not reverse the process. Frustrated and drunk by power, he becomes psychotic in the tradition of HG Wells tradition. This is an invisible Blind Man story, gladly delivered by tasty Verhoeven and always Bacon as the genius-advanced-loonytoon-maniac. As with many of Verhoeven's works, he has a terrible and unrelenting sense of adventure for Boy's Own Own Comic Book (combined with the most horrible and depraved visions) of their linen being tortured and attacked by an invisible son, animals beaten to death, literally gallons of blood and wholesale slaughter in the last two drums). While the story does not bring any new change to an old idea, the great effects of CG Scott E. Anderson are brilliant, while we see veins and arteries, cardiovascular systems, muscles, tissue, bones and flesh. out of nowhere. In particular, a sequence in which the team brings a gorilla back from the invisible state, and the scene in which Bacon drowns Devane in a swimming pool absolutely absorbs the image and the inventive artistic effect. The film also features a good soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith and a classic horror film by Jost Vacano. The young cast is pretty much shaded by the technical pedigree of the film, but both Shue and Dickens are impressive in depth. This is a great ugly fun movie.
