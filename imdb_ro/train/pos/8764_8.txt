Alice (Claire Danes) and Darlene (Kate Beckinsale) were the best friends throughout their lives, and after graduation they decided to make a trip to Thailand. Due to an incident, they meet a mysterious stranger who invites them to go with Hong Kong for the weekend. But at the airport, Alice and Darlene are confused with the drug smuggling hero and are sent to prison. Now is the time for supreme survival and true friendship. This was a pretty good movie, I've seen it a few times and after a while, you notice there are some holes in the plot, but the movie keeps you entertained. Claire Danes did a good job as usual, she's a great actress. I would give Brokedown Palace 8/10
