Well, I just discovered that there is a more disgusting and shocking show than "Little Britain" and I like it! "The League of Gentlemen" is a sick British comedy that is the most terrible, crazy and disgusting city in the whole of Britain. This place makes the island Dibley and Craggy Island (from "Vicar Dibley" and "Father Ted") seems quite normal! The format of the show resembles much with LITTLE Britain, except that it all focuses around the inhabitants of this ugly city. Both shows have the same sketches again and again in each episode, and some are obviously inspired by "Little Britain" (in particular, the job seeking job). But the show differs because, although it is brutal as "Little Britain" (this is not a show for children), the performance has a sick and sadistic quality that differentiates it from all these shows. In particular, animal cruelty and serial killing are recurring themes throughout the show. Now, if you have not guessed, this is NOT a show for kids, people easily offended or normal, and that's probably why I liked it. However, you really need very thick skin and a love to terrible to enjoy this at max. Amazingly and incredibly irrevocable beyond faith - you have to see him believe that.
