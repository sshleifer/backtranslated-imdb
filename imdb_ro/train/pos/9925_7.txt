When I rented Domino, I expected her to be very stupid. I hate cinematic movies that really have brilliant editing and cinema, and Domino has just received very bad reviews. The only reason I was looking was that I liked Keira Knightley, Mickey Rourke, Christopher Walken and Tony Scott on other occasions. I'm also happy with adventure stories. Yes, editing and cinema were disturbing, the story was poor, and the act was mediocre, but I still enjoyed this movie for a bizarre reason. Domino was very, very fun and often very funny. He was horribly undervalued when released. I think everyone wanted more of an emotional journey than the last Scotts Man on Fire film and instead of getting great fun. In fact, I understand why everyone hates Domino so much, even if I loved it and I recommend it.
