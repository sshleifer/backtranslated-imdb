"Before sunrise" is a wonderful story of love and must be among my first ever favorite films. Dialogue and acting are wonderful. I like their characters and ideas and their thoughts. Of course, the romantic Vienna introduced into the movie does not exist (you will not find a poet standing by the river in the middle of the night) and it is not possible to reach all places in one night (especially if you are stranger and your first night in Vienna). But that's not the point. The relationship between the two characters is much more important and this part of the story is not at all unrealistic. Though nothing ever happens, the movie will not become boring. The end is really sad without being "Titanic" or something like that. Even if you do not like love stories, you should watch this movie! I'm a little skeptical about the sequel that will be launched in the summer. The first part is perfect, as it is, in my opinion.
