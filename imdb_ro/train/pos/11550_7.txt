If you delete the first twenty minutes of this movie, you will have a fantastic comedy. As I found out, I still thought it was a pretty good film that is not a small girl, given the coma I put in the opening scenes. To make it easy, this movie has an amazing start that was not even distant from the fun, or even optimistic. Once things get stronger, you still have a comedy that still remains well after more than three decades. It is definitely worth checking out, especially if you are a younger fan of Lemmon and Matthau who want to see their previous work.
