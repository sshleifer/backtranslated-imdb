Finally, a thriller omitting machines, explosions and other eye-catching effects. The film combines a simple plot (assassination of a French president) with an excellent background. He takes a look behind man's behavior with the authorities and explains why we would almost listen to every command (even murder) that would have been given to us. In addition, it shows how secret services can handle the running of history and how hard they can be controlled. The best thing about this movie is that there is no classic "Hollywood End" that can be easily predicted.
