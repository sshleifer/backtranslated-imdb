Okay, so I got away from Houston so far, but whenever I see this movie, I'm going back to a little cowgirl dream that someday I ride Gilley. (She burned before the drinking age.) If you grew up in East Texas, then you know that this movie is an accurate picture of contemporary life at that time. If you did not trust me and you were not watching the movie. Either you will join those who love it (and at the same time will be strangely replicated) or, at least, you can have fun with your red neck. (There's plenty of fun stuff.) This movie does not try to be P.C. (what was in the 80's) or hide the white garbage element and it is honest time and place. I have to be 10 for me!
