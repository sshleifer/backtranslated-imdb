This is a film about deep and unspoken human relationships. Finally, there is talk, but there is a chance to change something about the situation. <br /> <br /> Originally made in Shanghai in 1948 and quite free of propaganda, the film introduces us to the Dai family. There is still a lot in the history that surrounds the family. History is usually a weight in Chinese literature and a serious film. A young married couple - Liyan, an invalid, and Yuwen's wife live in a large family family that is partially ruined. <br /> <br /> A bright contrast is Liyan's young sister, who can not really remember the family's past but accepts everything naturally. Her spirit is as bright as the other two. <br /> <br /> In this seemingly stable world comes an unexpected visitor ... I felt rather sad - but certainly a superior movie.
