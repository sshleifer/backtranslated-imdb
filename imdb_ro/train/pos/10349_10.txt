This is one of those movies that made me feel strong for the need to make movies at all. Generally speaking, I'm a fan of movies based on real-life stories. And this is GREAT! In addition to Meryl's performance, which has won much recognition and praise, the greatest value of the film is the story on which it relies. The stinging story of a couple who suffered social and legal torture after suffering enormous emotional pain at their child's unexpected and brutal death is indeed a fanatic that opens its eyes, exposing the inhuman side of the men and discovering the barbarian a very refined and legal society. It is interesting to see how people who consider themselves as good and intelligent (the ladies of the emotional jurors in the film, for example) are in fact nothing but selfish evidence which, for their dogmatic beliefs and prejudices, shuts their brain to any deliberation and contemplation even in the light of all facts that clearly show their views. The other side of the so-called "civilized" society that the film exposes is apathy for the pain of other people (it is not necessary to say that this is very general, even though this particular story is in Australia), which goes to end becoming a real cruelty. You have to see if you are willing to take something serious and perhaps provocative of thoughts.
