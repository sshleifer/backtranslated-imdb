Dennis Hopper and JT Walsh steal the show here. Cage and Boyle are fine, but what gives this neo-noir its juice is the creepy, violent character of Hopper and the wrath of JT Walsh. A monk gets confused with a man who strikes and tries to do something beyond it, but gets over his head. I found a strange parallel in the opening scene of this movie when Cage enters a Wyoming trailer to get drilling with the help of his friend ... and the opening scene in Mount Brokeback when the character does the same thing! But that's another story. Dennis Hopper is the best here ... a bad man, one step ahead, bad, angry, and violently explosive. JT Walsh (RIP) is also wonderful as a man with a dark past, trying to live legitimately (well, close). There are only 4 real characters here, except the hard-deputy in the city of Red Rock, Wyoming. The first twist kicks early, and from there is a nice neo-noir adventure in a small sleepy city. Meeting. 8 pts.
