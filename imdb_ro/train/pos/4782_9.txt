Well, it's definitely different from anything Lynch directed. No supernatural, no violence, no profanity. However, it is a beautiful movie. It's a little slow, but maybe it was intended, because it's the story of a 6-week-old's journey (which is the best estimate of its duration). Characters are ordinary people, and so they are credible. The performances are good and the final scene was incredibly exciting. All those who have a brother can refer to him. Lyle and Alvin do not even have to say anything. For a moment they are back in the old days and all the fighting is forgotten.
