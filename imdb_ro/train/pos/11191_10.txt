This dreadful and pretty heavy adaptation of Stephen King's great novel features remarkable central performances by Dale Midkiff, Fred Gwynne (who died a few years ago) and Denise Crosby and the really terrible effects of Gore. Director Mary Lambert has a wonderful sense of visual style, and manages to make one of the few versions of King's work, which deserve not only to be seen but also really disturbing. The image of the child zombie Gage (Miko Hughes - later in the "New Nightmare") is just as remarkable, a laughing character is made menacing and scared. As for people who think this is not scary - look it alone in the dark (eventually with your squeamish friend) and I guarantee that "Pet Sematary" come out. Some horror movies like this or "The Texas Massacre Massacre" should not be seen in the group. Recommended for horror fans!
