If this had been done earlier in the Zatoichi series, it could have been one of the best. It's pretty good, because most are, but the plot and the characters seem too complicated for the evening at this moment. The situation is unusually interesting: farmers in the province have two champions, a benevolent chief (for once) and a samurai philosopher who begins a sort of Grange; both run by regular local gangsters who want crops to fail because they increase their gambling revenue and their chances of breaking a land; their boss or powerful ally is an apparent puritan, which is death in drinking and gambling, but he secretly rewards his perverse appetites. (It also resembles Dracula, as the villains in the Zatoichi films tend to do more and more.) These characters have enough significance for them to deserve to be confronted with Zatoichi as originally drawn, but up now has lost many of its shades, and the changes in some of the characters, such as the good boss and furious sister of a man Zatoichi killed, need more time than the film has to give, so the story seems to be getting worse, as if some scenes were missing. In addition, the film presents the virtues of most of the others in the series: good action, sometimes a lyrical photo, creating a living, credible and uniquely recognized landscape (the absence of which is evident in the occasional episode in which the director lacks) and a technical quality , by its nature, disguises: the imaginative use of varied sets of limited, so their limitations seem to not exist. And, of course, there is a key actor, whose presence, as much as his performance, makes it work. This has to be one of the most sustained series in film history.
