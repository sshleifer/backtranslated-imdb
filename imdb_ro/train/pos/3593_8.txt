Michelle Rodriguez plays Diana, a high school girl with an insolent abrasion, and 2 x 4 on her shoulder. She's ready to fight someone, especially her father who pays for her brother's boxing lessons. Diana decides boxing would be a good way to focus his anger. I liked the relationship between Diana and Adrian. Santiago Douglas as Adrian is excellent. Watch how their emotions towards each other are modeled by the square circle.
