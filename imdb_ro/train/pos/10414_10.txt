I first discovered the fantasy of Alexander Korda (1940), THE THIEF OF BAGDAD, in the early 1950s, on a re-show titled "The Wonder Show of the Century!" Both Korda Technicolor, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD and JUNGLE BOOK were featured on a program that was never forgotten. Miklos Rozsa's music has improved both films. Technicolor in each was incredibly beautiful! THE BAGDAD TAG has remained on my list as the best fantasy ever made. With the passing of the years, it has become harder to enjoy the color of the film as it was originally presented. True Techicolor set off Eastman Color in the mid-1950s. Both Kino and Samuel Goldwyn have re-edited the film both in theater and video. But Eastman Color prints were more pastel in nature and deactivated the vibration of the original Technicolor. The release on this laser's laser disc also has the pastel look - beautiful, but not as it should be. Now comes M-G-M DVD (3 Dec 2002). THE BAGDAD THINK has once again the wonderful Technicolor that looks at it on a DVD that is nothing less than STUNNING !!! It was so exciting to see this once more that once I watched the DVD once, I saw it a second time. The only "Extras" are a double Spanish version, subtitles in English and Spanish, as well as an original theatrical trailer. Thanks M-G-M for this EXCEPTIONAL DVD version. Now, we can only hope that in short the DVD will be followed by four KORDA verses and a restored version of JORDLE BOOK of Korda (which will be replaced with prints of poor domains in circulation).
