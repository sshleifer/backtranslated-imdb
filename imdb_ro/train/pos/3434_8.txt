If Australian post had ever needed a recruitment promotional movie, then it is. This is one of those movies that the heart is in the right place and you can look back and forth again. Miranda's performance is exciting because it looks like an aspect of Australia, which is not imagined by many Europeans, because it can be cool, damp and gloomy, just like anywhere else and just like anywhere else, what matters is the one that surrounds you . The characters in the film are warm and welcoming and make the career prospect transform into a "dead letter office", a thought to be considered. Miranda continued to make bigger movies, but I hope he always keeps a thought in it for that?
