This film speaks a universal language; we can relate it to ourselves, to the community, to society or to the whole world. It has a way to open not only a few questions, but also to establish one in search of finding and asking the right questions to reach that point of self-convincing / self-possession. The representation of film stereotypes addresses the archetypes around us, which must be recognized as the repeated cycle of destruction, the force opposed to innovation, creativity and growth. Factors that disturb the natural flow of things must be highlighted and addressed. Idea is definitely a movie that needs to be experienced and not just watched, while it strengthens your inner voice / consciousness by looking, makes some feel unlike the clock.
