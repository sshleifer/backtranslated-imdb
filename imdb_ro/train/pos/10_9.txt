I am a man, it is not given to women's films, but this is indeed a special story well done. I do not have personal love for Jane Fonda as a person, but he's doing a hell of a good job, while DeNiro is his gorgeous habit. Everything is so well done: actor, director, visual, settings, photography, casting. If you can enjoy a story about real people and true love - this is a winner.
