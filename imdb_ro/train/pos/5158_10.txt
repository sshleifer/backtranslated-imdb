There is something convincing and strange to believe about this episode. From the beginning, an atmosphere of tension is created by knowing that a certain planet will explode in a few hours. Kirk, Spock and McCoy let go of evacuating the inhabitants, all of whom seem to have left for unknown parties, except for an elderly librarian. The polite but cryptic librarian's advice about where all citizens have been interrupted by a crisis in which all three members of the Enterprise crew unexpectedly awaken in different epochs of the planet's past. Kirk finds himself in a 17th-century England-like period, while Spock and McCoy are stuck in a desert and frozen desert. <br /> <br /> The interconnection between the two stories and the various dangerous situations that people find themselves is perfectly confronting the return of an unknown chance at present, while the minutes are up to the explosion of the planet. <br /> <br /> The imaginative letter and delicate action characterize this episode, with the exciting performance of Mariette Hartley as an exiled woman in the ice age and Ian Wolfe as an urban librarian. Somehow I remember the classic City Episode on the Edge of Forever, this travel story is a rich and convincing end to the series that ended an episode later. This must be one of the best in the series, remarkable especially in view of the lower overall quality of the third season in general.
