I thought this movie was very nice. I watched this movie with my wife before my first child. Therefore, I was not regarded as a family fun and I enjoyed it very much. It seems that many of the reviews indicate that this movie is not shattering the ground, there were no unexpected changes to the plot and that the movie was predictable and boring. If these people were looking at this film, expecting to have a religious experience, they were obviously disappointed. This is simply an animated movie; no more. If you want to see this movie simply be quiet and have fun, you will not be disappointed. Finally, this film is definitely not the best film that Disney did, but it's fun and does not understand the bad reputation it has received.
