May 1938. Hitler in Italy. Preparations for the historical appointment with Mussolini. Emotions, tensions and forms of self-affirmation. an empty city, a housewife and a journalist. Meeting two different worlds. Refugees for a sad mother. Short fill for a classic victim. A story of loneliness and silence. About the form of life nooks and the desire as a form of battle. The great character - a book endowed on a spring afternoon. This film is a poem, remarkable for art to describe the nuances of a single man. A plea for an ineffective relationship with reality. And with your inner world. The images of Il Duce, Antonietta's embarrassment, Gabriele's fragile patience and strain, the art of the director to give gratitude to two great actors make this film sublime, prefectious of subtle delicacy, a wonderful film about hypocrisy and arbitrariness , about the essence of life and the rejection of any tyranny. Loren and Mastroianni are the masters of intelligent smart show. A clear masterpiece.
