"9/11", hosted by Robert DeNiro, presents images from outside and inside the Twin Towers in New York on September 11, 2001. Never too grisly and gore but powerful and moving. "9/11" is a true treatment. Anyone who is not moved by this television show is immune to anything. <br /> <br /> 5/5 stars - <br /> <br />
