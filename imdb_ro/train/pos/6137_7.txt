What a great jewel. It's an unusual story that's fun to watch. Yeah, she sings, but she's very nice in the story and it's very melodic to hear. It was so nice to look; I enjoyed from beginning to end! The movie takes place in England during the Second World War. It's an apple witch who is looking for a missing piece of a spell he needs. She uses her coarse "magic" to carry her and her 3 children under her care for various destinations to find them. They joined the correspondent professor, who is surprised to learn that the lessons from his school actually work! <br /> <br /> Although the special effects may look a bit dated at first, once you get used to them, they become part of the charm of this movie. In fact, the movie won an Oscar for these effects! <br /> <br /> The film is innocent and fun - and it's hard not to like thundering songs. The characters are wonderful. I think anyone, at any age, might find something to like about this movie.
