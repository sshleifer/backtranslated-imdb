Winchester '73 is a great story and I like that. It's not the everyday western - it uses a rifle, which passes hands from different characters - as a mechanism to tell the story about these people. Rock Hudson plays an Indian boss, Jimmy Stewart plays a great man with a heart and power, and Shelly Winters plays a gallop that has to cope with the realities of her husband and the wild west. It is important to observe those kinds of correct policies - they kill many indices in this film without remorse. By standards today, it is still quite violent. But it's a wonderful story and it's worth watching. Enjoy!
