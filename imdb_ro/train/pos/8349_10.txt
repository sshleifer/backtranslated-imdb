Depardieu's most notorious film is Bertrand Blier's pioneer (1974). He has many sex scenes that fit into an X-rating, one of Jeanne Moreau, who makes a decided version of Jules and Jim in the 1970s, calls a trois with the two French hippies (Depardieu and Deware). There is no such thing as a sacred territory in this film; everything is a fair game. It is very strange that Americans tend not to enjoy this film very much, while many French people I met are classic. Something about this goes against what Americans have been programmed to "like." Gerard and young Patrick Deware are two hooligans, hippies with many sexual incitement, walking around molesting women and committing minor crimes. They left for the strikes and the anti-capitalist, Euro-comic freedom. Blier satirized the hell out of these two guys, while at the same time the bourgeois society itself eventually looked much more ridiculous. The best of all, is how the wonderful score Stephane Grappelli transmits the agitated soul of the drifters, the deeper consciousness of the subconscious or the "superior ideal" that motivates all the madness they are engaging in.
