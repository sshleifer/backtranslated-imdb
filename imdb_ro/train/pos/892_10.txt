This movie sees Dick Wei with Billy Chow and Chong Grass. sammo lau kar leung in a casino, sammo loses the fight, but what struggles is full of high-tempo actions and comedy elements thrown in. some wonderful moments and touches in the movie, lam ching ying appears in a cameo and is killed off - eviscerated. the end sequence will have you reach for the scroll button, as one of the best end battles I have seen. Sammo takes a lot of boys and ends up drinking.
