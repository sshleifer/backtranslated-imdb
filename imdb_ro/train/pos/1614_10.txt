There's nothing that does not like Moonstruck. I'm from an Italian family in New York and actually have a little home when I look at her. The actors and actresses, the plot, the subplots, the humor ... were all fantastic. Start a little slow, but there is much going on in the two days! I fell in love with LaBoheme because of this movie. On my favorite list of movies, Moonstruck is number 3. It's a "good" movie in which you let the theater walk "who's amore" or repeat some of your favorite lines: "Elder, if you give those dogs another piece from me food, I will strike you until you have died "; "Chrissy, bring me the big knife," "who's dead," "you love Loretta ....., well, because when you do it, you're crazy because they know I can." I always put Moonstruck when it's okay to look around because it makes me happy.
