First of all I have to say that I am Portuguese and is not used to spending time watching Portuguese films, probably one year or none ... And the reason is the almost generalized idea between the Portuguese people that national images are terrible, very close to the worst ever done! However, in the last decade, I start to surprise when we return the amusement of the 1940s when "Leão da Estrela" and "Costa do Castelo" were among the best in the world with films such as "Pulsação Zero" or "Sorte Nula "both from director Fernando Fragata and with some actors and music in common. This is also good, not the same, because it's not a real comedy; in fact, it is officially a drama, a woman's drama, has unexpected parts of amusement, causes of humorous characters, or funny things happening to them, such as the hypothetical trip to the Caribbean just to be put. <br /> <br /> The plot works and can surprise us several times; the actors are fine, the locations are regular as the score; but the truth is that everything makes sense, then we can count it as a nice effort for national cinema that seems to start from ashes like Phoenix. If you want to watch a Portuguese film, you definitely can get a better option, but it's one that needs to be measured.
