A classic Biopic from Hollywood is the best sense of the genre. Gooding and DeNiro deliver spectacular heart performances in the two main roles, and the support is excellent, with outstanding performances by Carl Lumbly and Michael Rapoport. <br /> <br /> The only "thread" I could choose is that Theron's role was useless and distracting (not her performance was good, it's just that the movie seemed to add two unnecessary scenes to her role.) <br /> Besides, the characterizations, dynamics and action of the real-life story are riveted and unforgettable. The evolutions of the main characters and the way in which they experience experiments develop their beings are uniquely characterized by the performers. Despite the extreme length of the movie, pacing remains intact throughout. The score is also terrible. <br /> <br /> Are we a Hollywood predictable movie? You bet. So, addicts from Mike Leigh should drop a star, but anyone else should enjoy power.
