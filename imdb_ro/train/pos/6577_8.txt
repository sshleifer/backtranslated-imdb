With a few exceptions, most of George Bernard Shaw's pieces have practically disappeared from the theater these days. Too arc, too talky seems to be the general verdict. This BBC version of one of Shaw's most fun tracks does not reject this verdict. It is certainly arc and talky, but it is also wonderful. And because of the quality of British theater, it is perfectly distributed with actors who - except Helena Bonham Carter - whom most probably never heard of. Carter is splendid as the Bulgarian girl who shelters professional "chocolate soldier" (Pip Torrens) and then falls in love with him. We may be arguing with the particularly ridiculous interpretation of Sergius (Patrick Rycart), the Bulgarian cavalry officer who led the accusation in the enemy lines and succeeded only because the enemy had the wrong ammunition for his machine guns. However, the role invites to action and Ryecart was clearly told to act too much. The other players are perfect letters. Carter, as a self-dramatist Bulgarian "aristocrat," and Torrens as the elite Swiss soldier are, of course, at the center of the game and are wonderful. Yes, "Arms and the Man" comes as a movie. But it's unlikely you ever see a Shaw movie that does not betray its origin. Plots are generally intelligent. However, Shaw is about dialogue. The action is minimal (even in St. Joan), and the sets are immaterial. Enjoy what it is.
