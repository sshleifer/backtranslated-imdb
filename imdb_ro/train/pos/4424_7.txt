As incredible as it may seem, Gojoe is an anime inspired action inspired by Hong Kong with a pacifist message. This ankle of the film is actually shown by the protagonist (a great actress made by Daisuke Ryu), a Benkei-cast-to-bodhist monk. Benkei vowed never to kill, but he still takes his sword to fight what he thinks is an invasion of the demons ... Gojoe is a difficult film to evaluate. Visual images are amazingly crafted and beautiful, but they use too much deception (moving with camera and high speed, expressive photos, chained colors, digital effects, etc.) so the end result is somewhat tedious. That being said, the beginning and the end of the film are still elegant and powerful. If only director Sogo Ishii would have been wise enough not to use his bag of tricks. Another problem with Gojoe is the amount of violence. For a movie with such an anti-violent message, Gojoe wasting too much energy and screen time to describe the endless battle scenes. Also, the way in which violence is presented is always at the limit of being indulgent; in fact, a shower of blood against the night sky seems to be one of the images signed by movies. Luckily, Ishii is wise enough to show the ugly, tragic appearance of violence. However, it seems that Ishii is not sure if he makes a film of traditional action or a profoundly moral allegory. The audience can not be sure of this until the end of the movie. The strong end (though cynical) is what saves Gojoe; clearly points out that this film is more than just a gore-fest.
