Cassandra Peterson originally created Elvira as the host of nighttime horror films, and when the character turned out to be unexpectedly popular, she suddenly discovered everything from beer advertisements to spots on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson . It has reached its peak of popularity in the late 1980s, and the film ELVIRA, MISTRESS OF THE DARK was the result. Elvira horoscope television dreams of success in Las Vegas. When her great aunt dies, she travels to New England, hoping that her estate will provide enough money to support a stage show; she is disappointed that she has found herself inherited a small house, a poodle and an old book. It happens that the city is puritanic beyond any description and provokes indignation right wherever it goes. It also happens that his great uncle is secretly an evil and intentional warrior to get hold of the "old book." Throw away some teenagers, a muffin and a hateful woman with fake ones, and you go there. No one would accuse it of being a cinematic masterpiece, and that's what happens from time to time. But Cassandra Peterson demonstrates a tremendous flair from the beginning to the end: pungent humor, sexy, and mixing humor with sharpened comedy, dancing the film as a ringing engineer in a corny circus, and jokes often joked. From a FLASHDANCE disaster to wizards' madness, it is never less fun. It's a lot of fun and the film's conclusion even manages to generate considerable suspense. Will Elvira be her best uncle and save the day? Well, I do not want to give anything, so let's just say you'll have a lot of fun to find out. The quality of the DVD is fine and there is not much bonus material, but if you are in the mood for something stupid, it is sure that it responds to the need. And if you've never seen the tyrants, you're going to a treat. Recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
