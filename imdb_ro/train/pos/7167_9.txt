I could not keep the comments after reading the very short comment "Not bad". This movie is much better than not bad. The actor is a star, even from cast children who do not play cute or anything but act just like my son's friends. The movie is smart and expects the audience to be as good. The double-story story lines are imaginative and contribute to the story, rather than act as a fill of time. I watched this movie with my children and then watched it again a few days later. If you have children and you are sick to the death of movies that inspire a diabetic coma with their sweet syrup, then check out "Holes". My 6-year-old has enjoyed so much at the age of 11, and my husband liked me just as much as her two. How many movies can you say about this?
