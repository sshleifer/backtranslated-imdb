<br /> <br /> If you are all interested in pirates, pirate movies, New Orleans / American history of the nineteenth century or Yul Brynner, watch this movie for yourself and create your own mind about it. Do not be fooled by various reviews. My reaction to this was that it was fun, has a good attitude (mostly), has a very witty dialogue, and it does a great job of describing the charm, appeal and fascination of legendary private Jean Lafitte. Although not all the events in the film are historically accurate (can you show me a historical film that does this?), I think the film is right in treating Lafitte's role in the history of New Orleans, a hate relationship between "respectable" citizens of New Orleans and this prostitute who was one of the city's favorite children. Do not worry about what the film does not do, but watch it for what it does, that is, to study one of the most fascinating historical figures of New Orleans and America.
