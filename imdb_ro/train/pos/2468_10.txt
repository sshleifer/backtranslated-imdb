I went to see Hamlet because I was between the trades. I thought four hours would be great, I was a fan of Branagh; Dead Again, Henry V. I was completely overwhelmed by the direction, the act, the cinema that this movie captured. Like other reviews, the 4 hours pass quickly. Branagh does not interpret Hamlet, he is Hamlet, he was born for this. When I look at this movie I always try to find mistakes, I looked at the goose and I did not notice them. How he managed to move the room in and out of the Hall with all the mirrors is a mystery to me. This movie was shot in 70 million. It's a shame that Colombia has not released a Widescreen version of this on VHS. I own a DVD player and I'll take this over Titanic any day. So, Columbia, if you listen, put this movie in the way it should be watched! And I do not know what happened to the Oscars. This should have included the best picture, the best actor, the best direction, the best cinema. What movies were watched? I'm sorry for Branagh at Oscar, when he paid homage to Shakespeare on the screen. He should have paid tribute to Branagh for bringing us one of the greatest movies of all time.
