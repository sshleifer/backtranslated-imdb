It's a refreshing breath when a movie gives you a story with a beginning, a means and an end, a pleasant and intelligent mystery, an attractive hero for all ages, who earns us with its spirit and charm. Andrew Fleming's film is indeed a modern wonder, a return to the good, old, trustworthy story that was the Hollywood rule. He gives up the excessive dependence on special effects that now passes for entertainment and gives us a terrific film with a very young actress and a talented cast. The film is based on the old books but has been updated enough to put it in this century; however, the props might be different, the heart is still a good mystery, and here is an intelligent one, one that links the traditions of the old and the nuances of contemporary youth. Emma Roberts is an old girl who believes in good behavior and respect for others; details that are largely missing from today's films. She is still good enough to attract the attention of boys, but she also knows how self-respect and self-esteem are present. She earns her medals by working hard and is not afraid to show a little bad when necessary to achieve her goals. While we are making a holiday in California, our heroine is attracted to the mystery of a Hollywood actress who has been the victim of a wrong game; she is suddenly "visited" by her ghost and this triggers a series of events that could solve the mystery or lead to something terrible for herself. What makes the movie quite fun is the little details, as it discovers that the ordinary world is nothing compared to the California scene, and this is well presented without resorting to vulgar vulgar language or any other graphic or explicit sex. Finally, the director has enough control to make everything very enjoyable for all audiences, from young to adult audiences. It's a movie that deserves to be seen, appreciated and enjoyable, a film that is rare and delicate and is not afraid to be classified as fun! Five stars
