Now, I had the pleasure of watching the first contaminated man when he premiered on television in December 2000. An infectious disease expert (William Hurt) loses his family when an unknown disease enters his home and kills her. A few years later, he is now in Russia or in a place. I'm not exactly sure where exactly, all I know is that it's happening somewhere in that area. However, due to budget cuts in an infectious disease lab, they are forced to leave most of their workers. One of them, an extraordinary security guard called Joseph Muller (played by Peter Weller, best known for his role as indestructible robocop), goes in there and asks for his job back. She needs this job because she is divorced and needs the child's support. So he goes in there, there's a fight and some things are beaten, dangerous stuff. Soon it was discovered that Muller was infected with a deadly pathogen. In fact, it's so deadly, a drop of his blood will kill a person in seconds. Soon the word comes out and the disease expert (Hurt) is called to investigate and later joined an American reporter. Now, Muller is determined to go home to see his wife and son, and he will not stop at all, even if he has to infect the entire Russian population. Now, as I said before, this movie is very similar to "Falling Down". We have a disturbed person (Weller here, Michael Douglas in Falling Down), who will stop at anything to achieve his goal, even if he has to kill some people in the process. Then we have a character hero (Hurt here, Robert Duvall in Falling Down), who is so sympathetic and determined to stop the antagonist. The contaminated man is actually a very good movie, with a good line story and some very good performances. <br /> <br /> 8/10
