Then I remember that I was quite surprised and amused by this film. I referred to this as the most important film I saw in ten years and I woke up to people who said similar things. <br /> <br /> Bernhard has an unusually perceptive behavioral notebook. And she has shaped the bitter personality of adolescence that we all had, in a crooked vision, on the adult world. The two together offer an amazing combination that can be too exaggerated for some viewers. (Hi Skip, I wish you were not my brother, so I could feel you!) Bernhards searches after returning to LA in New York, resulting in the immersive attempt of various characters all fit badly) for our amusement, but far enough involves acting to call upon a "black imperative" value system, that the real barometer of his resuscitation is if black culture accepts it. (It's been a while, Nina Simone comes to mind and has an impressive and solid black boyfriend built in the film). A nice black girl participates in the shows and seems to authorize Sandra's darkness but eventually rejects it. <br /> <br /> Just as Catholics think they are lucky to suffer for Christ, Sandra describes her suffering in the hands of a black culture in which she desires a place; as if she values ​​her value and rejects her. It is the only system of values ​​involved in the film world, apart from Bernhard's artistic confusion. For a nation whose main issues are racism and money, it is refreshing to see one of the two topics treated in an atypical way.
