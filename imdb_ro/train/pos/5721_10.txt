I'm not sure I understand where all these people are talking with anti-aggression enthusiasm, maybe it's just that some people like to harass things. The film was certainly imperfect (uneven action, some may have had difficulties in changing times, actors too willing to go to places I would not like to go, etc.), but IMHO there were a few things that have done more than imperfections. <br /> <br /> First of all, I loved breaking the rules. Normally, when you leave the haunted house, the bad ones leave you alone, giving you time to regroup, get close to your friends, and find the mysterious paranormal type. NORMAL (semi-spoiler warning) when you're hiding under her caps can only take you through that little opening that you look at. Normally, at the end, ghosts have become less horrific, because you have learned that they are only misunderstood, or have been released or not. Second, production was exceptional. While the movie was tough for special effects-loaded supernatural bit while short was extremely well done. Probably not the best kind of movie for those who think that Freddy and Jason are the last kind of horror against them, they have their place) but wonderful for those who have begun to accept the conventions as agreeing and having no problems with time distortions.
