This is a very funny movie, especially the second, third and fourth moments of watching. It's a pretty short movie and we certainly recommend watching it several times, you'll do it a second time. It's like pressing the rotary button but the rap version. It has a lot of attitude that can be a a negative thing in rap movies, but it's just a total step and it's not a problem because of the irony it creates. A lot of stand-out bits, one of those types of movies on you will find them quoting lines with your colleagues and will raise laughter. My favorite personal part is the "middle guerrillas" section.
