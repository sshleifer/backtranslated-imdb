If you are uninitiated in the Gundam world, this is a good place to start. If you're burnt on Star Wars or Star Trek, here's a realistic science-fiction series that you can immerse. This is not the simplistic story of the boy-save-robot-world-in-giant that one might have expected, but rather a complex, dramatically emotionally dynamic, where the line between the "good" and the " is far less distinct. Gundam 0080 focuses on the story of Al Izuruha, a young naive boy living in a neutral space colony. He spends his days hanging out on mobile costumes and playing war with his friends. During this series, Al befriends an "enemy" soldier, Bernie Wiseman. After all, little Al learns a few hard lessons about the reality of the war and about the necessary suffering and sacrifices. I liked this FVO series, with its cool mecha designs that involve storyline and nice characters. We recommend this series for anyone who likes realistic SF anime, or for those who think anime is just stupid or sexy fun.
