Alain Resnais' films are stunning in the way they are not really edited for continuity, but instead the shot seems to end exactly where he edited the memory. Love to death is sometimes a quiet existential drama and a magical realistic film, and in any way treats the audience in a totally new aspect of the Eros / Thanatos relationship ... or it can create a new relationship, that of Agape / Thanatos. <br /> <br /> The beginning is like a bizarre surreal horror movie. A woman is desperately breaking around the house while a man is dying in his bed - killed or what happened? Soon, this tension is dissolved as a doctor comes and pronounce it dead, but there begins a drama newest and brightest: man wakes up and after he died, a woman and man in love with consequences quite tragic. Meanwhile, their friends, who are both priests, follow and present their own debate in the nature of love, faith, and devotion. Resnais seems to always have a device to make these kinds of work narratives, and what is so amazing in his films is that these devices always work. In this case, Resnais intersects scenes with snowflakes that fit into a horny orchestral score that fades and bleeds in subsequent photos that continue the story. Trapped periodically in this elegiac, the film develops a rhythm that is not much different from an epic poem, and we have some strange flashbacks of Dante's Comedy Divine despite the lack of direct reference in the film. Resnais is known as a very poetic director, but this extends only through the structure of the cinepoem to something that forces a certain degree of introspection on the viewer, which has the possibility to bring some strange memories to the surface. Memory-narrative, Resnais creates. - PolarisDiB
