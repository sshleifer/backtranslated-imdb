Sidney Franklin, "The Good Earth," has earned a classic status thanks to an unforgettable story and a gorgeous actor, especially from Luis Ranier, who won Oscar for his O-Lan portrait. Rainers performance is so complete that it's almost unrecognizable. Having a very little dialogue throughout the film (and it's a long one), Rainer relies instead on facial and body language. She looks and acts Chinese to the point where anyone who is unfamiliar with her work might easily mistake her as such. The film remains relevant today because it explores the story of rags for the riches and universal themes that come with it. When Lung and O-Lan finally reach financial success after years of famine and poverty, they find a life full of goods but meaningless. Only when they return to the ground after they fought on a swarm of locusts (the special effects used to create them are still incredible and beautiful to watch), they find fulfillment again. A common formula shattered with the unique perspective of a Chinese family (especially for 1937) makes the movie classic. Money does not deserve anything without friends and family, a point that the film leads home perfectly in the last 10 minutes, with a complete emotional conclusion.
