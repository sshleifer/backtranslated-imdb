It's not one of your toughest stories, and that's a real force of this movie. There are at least two relationships where less confident writers would have added a romantic, equally predictable tension. They not only lost the audience, but they also have surprises at the same time. There are some moments of Disney, especially at the end of the year, but they are easy to manage. Overall, it was worth renting and it was good fun, relaxed. BTW, if you get the DVD, watch the segment where the director teaches you how to make alo gobi. I followed her directions and was BRILLIANT! Next time we will do the day before planning to eat it, because it is a kind of food that definitely gets better with a full night in the refrigerator to leave the spices out!
