Okay, this movie is about Bedknobs and Broomsticks, it's one of the most charming and delightful movies you'll ever see as a kid. It's the unforgettable movie about two adults and two kids kneeling on a fun adventure. It may be a little negligible to watch but try it, my mother did not think she was bad, I was very excited about film and animation, they were all pretty good. <br /> <br /> It's a great comedy for the whole family to enjoy; even children. Age 7 and older will enjoy this wonderful, musical comedy along with you and your family, especially the animation. Animation moves and layouts are really enjoyable and worth a big finger. It's a terribly good music for the whole family, so what are you waiting for? Go to the video store and rent Bedknobs and Broomsticks NOW.
