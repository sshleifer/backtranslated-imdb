A fragment of the life of one of the first female painters to achieve historical fame, "Artemisia", tells the true story of a young Italian young man who follows the artistic expression and the vicissitudes he faces. The film features sumptuous costumes and sets and a good cast and act. However, he is embarrassed in his attempt to describe the esoteric art and time and is uninspired in representing the artist's passion as it is painted on canvas and explored through its implications with humans. A good film for those interested in Renaissance paintings or antique films.
