David Zucker directed one of the best comedies of the year with this empty farce. Yes, it's a taste of it and it depends on a multitude of sophomoric gogos, but it's constantly funny, unlike some recent comedy efforts. The film is loaded with all sorts of jokes, ranging from the obvious to the most subtle, that you have to pay attention to everything in the frame or you will probably lose them. Like previous efforts including "Airplane!", "Top Secret!" And Naked Gun, humor flies almost every second. There are so many moments that work, it is easy to overlook the few who fall down. What makes this film apart from other pale imitations in the kind of spoof is that it has a real line of story. While others depend on the fun of too many famous scenes in almost random films (take "Mafia!", Please), this film tells a new story with nice characters. It refers to sports movies in general, as well as satirizing the real sports industry, instead of praising any specific films. Even for those who do not care about South Park, her creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, make a good pair of leading actors in natural chemistry. The film also uses an extremely efficient use of camouflages, athletes and other celebrities, especially a bit of hilariousness with Robert Stack of "Mysteries Unsolved". By the way, stay in credit for a final joke with Bob Costas and Al Michaels. On the whole, Zucker succeeded, in words, probably by applying to the sports mix of the film, a dunk home.
