Larry Fessenden was hit by most of the comments on this forum. Well, the most serious mistake, obviously, is the marketing of the movie and how the DVD could have been targeted. Obviously, this is not a real horror film, at least not for people waiting for something that will be gorilla and instantly satisfactory. <br /> <br /> "Wendigo" is basically a movie that seems to be said from the minds of young Miles. Things that are not easily understood by children tend to remain in their young mind and ultimately dominate their fears and the menacing world they do not understand. It is obvious that Kim, mom, is a psychologist, but she has no idea what is happening in her son's mind. This is also a story of alienation. It is clear that the father, George, is a distant figure, maybe a worker who seems to live in a different world. Miles's fears come to a point of crisis during the weekend in the country. That part of the state of New York, with its winter landscape, sterile trees, plays a role in the boy's imagination. It does not help that he meets a strange figure in the city, he creates even more doubts in his young mind. Eventually, Miles's world collapses over him and can do nothing, even evoking the spirit of Wendigo. The film is well off and has acted. Patricia Clarkson is excellent, no matter where the movie is. Jake Weber is perfect as the distant father who has the opportunity to approach a son he does not understand. Erik Per Sullivan, as Miles, conveys his inner respite. I thought it was extremely effective because the whole movie is Miles's own, and it's happening around him. Finally, John Spredakos is perfect as Otis menacing, a man who resembles the world for the way he has proven. Instead of putting this film down, future viewers should approach him with an open mind.
