Los Debutantes is the story of two orphan brothers who moved to Santiago from the south after their mother dies. Silvio, the older brother, has a job that works for a strip club owner after taking the naive Victor there for the 17th day. When Silvio blooms under his boss's tutelage, both brothers become involved in the mistress of the sexy and manipulative master, Gracia. As the movie unfolds, the characters are redefined as we begin to see the subtle and obvious ways that each manipulates the next. The film is well done, with good cinema and fast rhythm. It's also pretty sexy, with a lot of nudity and some pretty sex scenes quite explicit. It uses popular technique to stratify different scenes from different points of view, from the chronological sequence. Many people hate movies of this kind because they do not understand what is happening - Reminder, Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs and many other good movies are using this device. The plot itself is really nothing new, there are elements of body heat, pulp fiction and many other good film noir. As the different layers are revealed, our understanding of the characters and their motivations evolves. While the plot can be somewhat clich√©, it's also smart and fun. I would call it a nice movie that deserves to be watched, but nothing memorable. I have not seen many Chilean movies and it's always interesting to watch the noir movie in other countries. Besides, rent it if it's available, but do not miss sleep if it's not.
