The title is onomatopoeic, the sound of a tram pulled on the rails. It is metaphorical to everything that people who dwell in dump can not have. The misery of these people is illustrated by the passing tram representing the relatively inaccessible rich life of the middle class. The baby's patsy and his loved, but sad, mad father is the most exciting. This was Kurosawa's first colorful movie and uses beautiful shocking shades, colors seen only in dreams. The film is surreal and surpasses beauty. Compassion for mankind is the basic force, but as usual, Kurosawa focuses on capturing the beauty of the film. It's a masterpiece of a cinema genius.
