I watched Walking Tall for the first time when I was 8 years old and I thought both Joe Don Baker and Bo Svenson did a good job, but he must have anyway because, as I watch the movies, I tried to learn as much as possible about the true Sheriff Buford Pusser as I can. All three parts of the film gave me chills and Buford Pusser was a real hero, I just want to be alive today and there were more people like him. I would like to thank him for getting rid of all the crime and he was so brave. I'm very sorry that his family had to go through such horror and pain. My heart is coming out. So, from a 30-year-old fan of Sheriff Pusser and the Walking Tall 3-piece movies and the actors who portrayed him, please do not be negative about these movies and actors, they were just trying to get us tells what wonderful man the real Buford Pusser was and what a great family he had. And to all the young people who probably did not hear too much about Buford, I suggest you watch the Walking Tall movies and find out more about it.
