Things to come is indeed a classic piece of speculative fiction; both an essay on the destructive nature of war and on the terror of progress. It does some surprising descriptions of the war that would follow years later, but is terribly naive in its utopian ideals. Raymond Massey, Cedric Hardwicke and Ralph Richardson form a fine cast, though the drama is played more like a play than a cinema. There are grandiose speeches, if I'm tough, often delivered as if the actor tries to get to the back of the theater. However, there are some profound words there. Is technology the savior of mankind or the instrument of its destruction? The film is a visual feast if someone can detach from the age of effects. Sure, Hollywood is more sophisticated today, but rarely inventive. For imaginative purposes, the third act is a treaty: a world with underground cities, massive deco bombers, space cannons, giro copters and secret organizations of scientists. It has all the creations of a sci-fi pulp adventure, but it also uses traps for a philosophical exercise. Things to come and Metropolis were the hallmarks of the Hollywood Neolithic science fiction cinema. They are operative in scope, and visual inspiration. Technology has left them long ago, but their ideas still break out. There is an art there, one with more heart and excitement than the computer-generated cinema today. These films are made by artisans, not by industry.
