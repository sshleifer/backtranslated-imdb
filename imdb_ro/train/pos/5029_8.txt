We went into this movie, probably a little jaded by the hack-and-slash movies that shake on the screen these days. Bath, I was surprised. This little treasure was full of pleasure with a dark and dark atmosphere. More surprising was the very limited amount of blood presented. As with the best movies, this leaves something to be imagined, and Bill Paxton did a great job at directing. Scenes in the car, as they are well done, and after watching the episode "Anatomy of a scene" at the end of the video, it was good to see that some of the subtle but wonderful things I noticed were intentional and not just a direction type "Oh, looking good, keep it". This is a moody movie full of grimness. However, for the dark subject, much of it is filmed in the light of the day, even some of the most disturbing scenes. The act is exceptional (Okay, I've always been a fan of Powers Booth), and never passes over the top. Have Counter, is very subtle, that works very well for this type of movie. If there is a field where this movie is not available, it is finally what seems to be a bit too controversial, but it still works at a simpler level without destroying the mood or the message of the movie. What is the message? It's something that every individual decides for himself. Overall, on a scale of 1-10, this film scores 8 for those who like the Southern Gothic genre (ie, "Body Heat" or "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil") and about 5 for those who do not.
