I tracked this in my Women's Health class to highlight how women are treated inferior to men in many societies and I loved this film absolutely. I'm going to try and make a copy of it for me to look. The story is very moving and I would recommend it to anyone. I'm a fan of different cultures and this movie was exactly what I needed. This is a movie for the whole family, despite the rating. This is a movie that I will show my children. The teacher of our class meant that the film was primarily too educative for women, but this film was more than that. It is one of those films that will remain in my mind and will be favorites.
