Todd Rohal is a crazy genius. "Knuckleface Jones," his third and best-made film, has a sense of humor and will leave some scratches. What the movie is about the heart and that I almost certainly disagree with me is how a director Joe finds the confidence to pass his life with some inspiration. Or not. You just have to see for yourself. The short intermittently flashes on the festival circuit, so keep your eyes open and catch it if you can - you'll be glad you did. It's hilarious. And check Todd's other short films, which occasionally appear: "Single Spaced" and "Slug 660".
