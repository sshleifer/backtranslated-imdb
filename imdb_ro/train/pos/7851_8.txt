Cameraman's revenge is a short unusual, not because of the object (adultery) or because it is animated (Winsor McCay introduced Little Nemo to the movie at the moment) but because it describes bugs to tell the story! Ladislaw Starewicz originally wanted to shoot real fights but could not make them do it because of the hot light they suffered, so he took the dead and started using stop-motion techniques to manipulate the movements to his satisfaction. This short one does a good job of putting human characteristics on small creatures such as riding bikes, painting, shooting, kissing and dancing. Starewicz would also do Frogland (1922) and The Mascot (1933), but his first notable work would be this. If you are interested in this and other short ones mentioned, check out the local library to borrow the Cameraman't Revenge DVD and other fantastic stories from Image Entertainment.
