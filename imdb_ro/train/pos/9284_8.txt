This movie is described as a comedy, but it was not a comedy at all. Like any Panahi film, it was a very realistic drama that illustrates the common thread of social inequity and hypocrisy. But it was very funny; much easier than the director's dark and serious Circle (my favorite Iranian movie). The dispersion of the girls and the banter between them and the soldiers was so credible (as if it were a documentary) and hilarious. The shooting of the current match and the track was amazing. He added realism just like Kenny in Australia, of course a very different film. The performances of all non-professional actors? soldiers and girls ?? were very credible. She moved a lot to see the passion, disappointment and enthusiasm of these girls. Anyone in this country who thinks Muslim girls wearing a chador are different from their own daughters should go see this movie? will be a true eye-opener. For me, the soldiers represented the current paradigm. They began to respond to standard official policies for all girls' reasons. As the movie progressed, it has been increasingly difficult to maintain this position. When it seems that Tehran is bursting into a wild feast, everyone is trapped in it, and the ridiculousness of current policies is obvious to some and all. It was a very moving and unexpected ending, and gave the film a very nice mix of emotions, frivolity, drama and social commentary. Although it is an adult cinema, I believe that children under the age of seven begin to appreciate this movie (as long as they can read subtitles). It is remarkable that a repressive country like Iran is capable of producing such quality films as Panahi and Kiarostami. Perhaps there are constraints where the force directors are extremely inventive. Australian (and other) filmmakers could take a leaf from their book.
