I am quite surprised that no commentator has so far commented on the elemental chess mistake in Luzhin's play as white against an unnamed opponent immediately before the final. Despite the use of Jonathan Speelman as a chess expert, Luzhin is the winner of the game with an illegal move. Between quick cuts and backs on board, it is not difficult to see that, after Luzhin's combination culminating in a queen sacrifice, his height on d1 is still fixed by the black hook to c1 against his emperor in the corner of h1. Thus, he is unable to play the alleged Rd1-d8 mating movement, which would be illegal - but has shown that he has done so for rapid public applause.
