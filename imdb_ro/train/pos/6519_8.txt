This movie has big stars in their early years: Ingor Stevens has never been more beautiful; Yul Brynner was a very convincing Jean LaFitte, in conflict with his piracy and wanting to keep neutrality with the United States. Charlton Heston did a pretty good job like Andrew Jackson, but a few moments were a little stomach. It's a good movie for students to learn that part of our history and shows that all the happy endings do not include lovers who meet each other - sometimes the happier end is that they leave and find partners with a similar background that will understand them better in the long run. I have seen her every year at least twice, for 16 years; and though it's not the best movie I've ever seen, I love it every time!
