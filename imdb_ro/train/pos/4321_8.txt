I'll hold pretty little. I think this is an extraordinary movie. I see other reviewers who have commented that they are badly written, badly shot, they have a terrible soundtrack and, worse, it's not real in portraying life. Okay, maybe it's not quite credible for its entire length, but this movie carries a message of hope that some others have left. I hope it's not too late to save people from terrible things that happen in so many lives. Ganglion violence is real, right? It's right, no! This film carries an important social message that cynics can not dislike, but which, however, must be praised rather than denigrated. I have watched this film with great joy at least eight times, each time with equal enjoyment and every time with the feeling that maybe the world could become better and can not be saved (not yet until 2008). 9 out of 10 from me for this. It's almost perfect in my opinion. JMV
