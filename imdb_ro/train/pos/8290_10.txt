This is just another example of Gene Wilder's absolute genius. He wrote and played in this terrible mystery. Nobody could have done better. The suspicion was palpable over time. I wish Mr. Wilder to give us another. I enjoyed everything I've ever seen Mr Wilder, but I had no idea how talented he was until I saw Murder in a Town Town and this pursuit. He really has a firm understanding of what the public wants and how to deliver it in his writing and, of course, in his brilliant act. His subtle mind comes to a halt. I would recommend this film to everyone who likes the mysteries and / or film work of Gene Wilder. His star becomes brighter and brighter.
