This sophisticated visual game presents a story in a story. The protagonist is screenwriter Bart Klever, who fights persistently with his new text? which is, at the same time, the screenplay of the movie we are watching. In Bart film plays a screenwriter writing scenario film? Bart's struggle with text becomes a narrative theme, just as the environment in which he lives and where he cares about his little girl. The intimate environment offers ample opportunities for illusion games involving space, light, colors and some cats. The simple exterior of the room is further complicated by the unstable dimensions of a text permanently influenced by cinema interventions, which appears on a computer monitor and serves as a counterpoint to the similitude shift environment. The ever-changing viewing angle complicates the answers to the questions that arise: What is "truth" and what "illusion"? Which of the worlds observed is primary and superior to the others? Can something serve as a base point in the narrative space?
