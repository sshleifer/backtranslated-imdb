Twenty-five years ago, I showed this film in some entomology lessons and I can still remember the enthusiasm of the children; they were scared! It is not just termites that have built and live in "clay castles" but also by other animals that use mounds. There is a fantastic scene in which a cobra fights a monitor lizard while a mongoose clock colony. It is a good thing not only for entomology classes but also for ecological learning because there are so many interactions between termites and other organisms and the whole ecology of all organisms that live in and around the mounds. <br /> <br /> I wanted to be available on DVD so I can see it again and show others.
