Thief of Baghdad is one of ten favorite movies over the years. It is exhilarating without gore, it is beautifully shot and the direction of art is perfect. Casting could not have been better. Rex Ingram made me believe in geniuses. And the symbol of evil is certainly captured by Conrad Veight as Jafar. He put the big bar. I watch this movie at least twice a year ... and never get tired. This movie is an adventure for all ages ... not too old to enjoy it. Thief of Bahgad is making his memories in a more innocent time ... I was ten years old when I first saw it and the US was about to enter the Second World War. Conrad Vieght was such an actor that he managed to continue this basic "malice" a few years later in "Casablanca." And Korda collaborated with Justin and Dupree again at "The Four Feathers" ... a great movie!
