You like a really inventive comedy or you like "wedding hammers" if the answer is the last stop reading now. I can not believe this movie does not have a higher rating. Practically, Meadows plays a character different from Austin Powers. There are so many inventive moments in this gagorama. From cruelty - Leon playing with himself on the porch, the ex-boyfriend has tricked to eat. . Good. To inspire lunacy-clown sex, Broadway routine, the voice. Meadows is great as Leon, baby, but very sweet. Some wonderful lines "do not blame Wang" "the weird world of weird sex" too many. . . Why this movie was not great is a mystery. Great comedy.
