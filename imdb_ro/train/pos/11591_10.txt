I've also been searching for this movie for some time and how wonderful it would be to find it on DVD ... I saw this movie when I was about 6 years old in the Netherlands. And I was very impressed with that. It was shown before Walt Disney's JUNGLE BOOK! <br /> <br /> What I remember about this movie is fragmented. I remember an Indian boy being an eagle friend. That impressed me a lot. For some reason he was thrown out of the village (he did not understand the reason for that). When other boys stoned him, he climbed a stone and jumped. At that moment he turned into an eagle and flew with his eagle friend. As an eagle still wearing his turquoise necklace. <br /> <br />
