These slasher photos are past their sell dates, but this is fun. Valentine's books are spiritual, well thought out. The film has a peach of a line ... "He is not Angel ..." when he is, in fact, Angel! Watch Buffy's rerun will never be the same! Distribution is a sizzling display of young talents, but the story does not give them enough real depth. Denise Richards on DVD Extras seemed to believe that the girls on the set pinned tight together and this would give the feeling that you have empathised with their characters. We're sorry but not! The direction is very good, managing to show very few current ghosts and relying on your imagination involves threats. There are many things to say about the way Miss Richards and Heigel do not remove their clothes ... :-( <br /> <br /> Essentially, the main plus director is in the "loan" of other ideas from Previous slasher films The psycho shower scene is a tribune along with Halloween's "masking." Killing a person hiding in a body pouch is a pretty original one I know!> < br /> Watching bright, not very frightening, but some good moments of jump. If it was a choice between The Hole and that, however, choose The Hole, Slasher movies spent their day and that's just another shot. slasher, but nothing innovative!
