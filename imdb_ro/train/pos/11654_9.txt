I agree with the comment above, I like realism in this case, and in many films (not just the films about eating disorders) the producers seem to forget that. They take a daily problem and create an extremely dramatic scene and then come to the end of the film everything is perfect again, which I do not like because it is not reality. It does not mean that things can not be improved and it does not mean to say things in this movie, but it does not spend most of the film creating all these issues, and the end of the movie is all right again. When people have eating disorders, people do not recognize it and want to improve, and then life is full of peaches, it takes time, and I like how we grow with the characters in this movie, we go through the difficulties with them, better and better bad, because it's a very important part of the movie. It enters the minds of people with eating disorders and shows complications and pain, in a very realistic way, and I liked it. I also like what this looks like. Secrecy and betrayal feel when it suffers from eating disorders, it is scary to see how people react when they find out, especially if they approve of it. I thought this movie was very moving, beautiful and well said, and defiantly one of my favorites.
