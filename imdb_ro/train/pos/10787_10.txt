So when I was young, I received this movie as a gift and my sister and I loved him. we would keep track of it all the time. when our friends came, we would have slept and looked at the mountain candy and the grandfather's magic toys. I am 21 years old and I still love this movie, some old friends and I recently gathered and watched it, I knew all the songs and I danced and talked about how much I hated Profster when I was young . A friend actually bought this film and the grandfather's magic toys for her daughter for 2 years because she wants to convey our love for this movie. This is really a movie that you can let your children look and feel safe, without violence, without bad language, just a bunch of great songs and important lessons.
