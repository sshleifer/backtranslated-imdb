Johnny and Jun Carter Cash have funded this movie, which is a traditional rendering of Gospel stories. The music is wonderful, you have a real sense of how Jesus' world was (I was there), and June comes to Mary Magdalene with a passion. The cash narration is also good. <br /> <br /> But .... <br /> <br /> 1. The actor who played Jesus was the miscastast. 2. There is no edge to the story, such as Cash put in some of his music based on faith. 3. Because it is unwavering, I doubt we will see this distribution again. <br /> <br /> I would like to buy the CD. Tom Paine Texas, USA
