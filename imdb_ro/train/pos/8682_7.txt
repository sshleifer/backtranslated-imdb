I'm sad to say that I do not agree with other people about this Columbo episode. Death gives a hand is frankly a kind of boring Columbo for me. A few times, I got bored and changed the channel. I love Robert Culp and Patricia Crowley and Ray Milland in their roles, but the story was poorer in this episode than in the other. First, Robert Culp plays an investigator for Ray Milland's character. She pledges to investigate the beautiful young wife played by Patricia Crowley to see if she has an affair. Instead, Culp's character blackmails the deceptive wife who intends to expose her scheme to break her husband's career. From anger, Culp kills her by hitting her face and putting her body elsewhere. I do not know. Maybe I did not care about it at all. Of course, Columbo finally gets it. It's just how.
