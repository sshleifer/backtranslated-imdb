Whoever is new to the incredibly prolific Takashi Miike's work, he might want to think twice to make this movie surprising the first experience of this true maverick director. In line with Miike's practice of taking over any work that comes in and then grafting his own sensibilities on the script, this is based on a fairly basic yakuza thriller, with an ambiguous moral policeman throwing a band on who his lawyer brother has fallen. What pulls the film out of the same old and same old man's environment is, however, an absolutely unwavering attitude, so some of the most subtle and horrific violence seen in today's cinema. And this is not such a sweet and clean violence so loved by American cinema - this is ugly, painful and HURT thing! That being said, the rhythm is shattered, the characters are unusual without being simply burdened with stock excentricities, Miike's sense of humor is revealed and the most unexpected moments, and his room is never exactly where you expect it to be, making them hard to look away from the screen, no matter what it might look like! It's not the end of Dead or Alive Ohmigod, but if you're not squeamish, now is the time to get on a Miike before you get to the new John Woo's Hollywood studio shopping list ...
