I could not believe the comments made about the movie. As I read the terrible opinions about the movie, I was actually wondering if you saw the same movie I did. <br /> <br /> What I saw was incredible! I think the actress and the director have done a fantastic job in the movie. I did not have the pleasure of seeing any actress in the past, and I could not have been stunned by the incredible work that they had to say the most credible movie I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> What I do not see is why everyone has such a problem with Deanna choosing the drug in her attempt to commit suicide, from the comments you made to call the actress's choice and the choice they are bad. I do not understand, it's a movie written by someone else and directed by someone else, as can be the error of the actresses they do not see. I think it was a true credible movie that I would see again and recommend it. Opinions are what I am too bad for so many are so close. I hope to soon see any of the actors, I think they all played great roles. Philipps busy will be the best paid actress one day and I hope he can laugh in front of everyone who criticized her! You're going girl!
