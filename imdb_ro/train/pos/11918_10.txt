"Angels in the Outfield" was originally a 1951 film from the Ted Turner library; Disney remodeled her in 1994, this time using California Angels (now Los Angeles Angels) as a team (Disney used to own this and Anaheim Mighty Ducks Hockey Team, too, good use of words, right?). This movie was about a few orphaned children who wanted a family. A man promised the boys a family only if the Angels had won the hunt. So he called on God one night about it. The boy who was praying could see the help coming along the way (and the only boy); for example, when the first angel descended, a player hit a ball so hard that not only beat the beating, but the ball did it !!!!! For much of the post-All Star season in 1994, Angels was at the top of the AL West (of which my Rangers home team is one and still is). However, they lost a game because the boy was in court instead of the White Sox / Angels game (at that time there was no central division in the Baseball, so Chicago was in the West) and no angel was there to help. Thus, a new rule has been created: no angel can help in the championship games. But wait! In the final game of the championship, Angels won !!!!! It was indeed a miracle! What I liked about this movie: This is a good movie. I mean, I prayed every evening, in the last few years, to ask for help for school and other things; Look at me now! My work was good !!!!! So, for one, it shows that if you think, God can send angels down to help you in any problem you have in life. And secondly, this is a family baseball movie, which is always interesting. This is also an old Disney movie; I saw this only recently on the new Disney channel (blech !!!!!). "Angels in the Field of Action" will change your life forever once you see it! <br /> <br />
