After watching the Star Reality television series, I was delighted to see the winners' video straight away. I was foolish about such a talent presentation, but I was pleasantly surprised and delighted. Billy Zane, of course, was his usual self, but Corinne and Sean kept him with him. It was also nice to see Jared and Jeanne (also from the competition) in their cameo roles. The character of Sean, not Billy, is hunted, and his frustration to discover new rules in the game is well played. Corinne walks well between her character who likes Sean and the only one who was in it for money. I liked how the game was played until the last second. And then beyond! It's not a great movie, it's fun and a wonderful presentation for two people at their first exit.
