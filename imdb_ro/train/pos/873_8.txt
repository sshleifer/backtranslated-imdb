I saw this movie did not expect too much and does not know much about it. I liked. A very good plot, tightly, an intriguing hook in the form of ugly, fat, deaf and ex-con, and a rhythm that keeps things flowing without hurrying. <br /> <br /> A movie much better than that of the same director Batter mon coeur s'est arreté, which was boring and unbelievable. The only thing that did not work was the fact that the girl, supposed to be ugly, fat, was neither ugly nor fat: solid, certainly, and far from being conventionally beautiful, but so much in the face she had took the screen whenever it was on it. Superb. I'd like to be in more and better movies than she does in general. I saw a husband of Gilles and a little mustard, and both looked like a garbage, and I saw everything battre mon coeur s'est arreté, and surely it's a pit. He seems to have a few come in, so I'll keep my fingers crossed.
