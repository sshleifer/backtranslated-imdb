Someone already mentioned "being in the right place at the right time". It was so true for this documentary that I had doubts about the authenticity of the scenes and I thought it probably included some who act, but it is not. Everything is real. The story is nothing new to developing and / or poor developing countries. It highlights the manipulation of people through corporate media, misinformation, artificial polarization of people by deliberately creating tension on the streets, sometimes to the point where the military, the intelligence agency, or even the US government) use agents attacking any " part "to provoke the masses in violence, and therefore justifies their blows. A marine officer in the film also mentions this. That they wanted to see the peoples who face the streets. All these scenarios have been played in Turkey (an American pet dog in the Middle East) throughout its history, which has experienced 3 blows, and lately the Turkish army secret plans have been ironically exposed through a a pro-government religious / conservative environment opposed to the army's a-religious doctrines in which a very important mosque is bombed by an army agent to provoke the people, etc. What makes this unique movie is that they were filming from inside, perhaps by chance, when the events happened. It is clear that directors are Pro Chavez. If this would cause directors to filter and manipulate events and information, I would not know. And if Chavez defends the people of Venezuela against US dictatorship and the global economy without repressing any force forcefully and eventually becoming an undisciplined tyrant, history will tell. But at least Chavez is hope and I think it is worthwhile to take the chance.
