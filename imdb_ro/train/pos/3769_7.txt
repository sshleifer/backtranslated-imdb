Come on, learn to have some fun. When I was a kid, this movie was Oscar-worthy for me. I thought it was absolutely hysterical. One of the best movies I've ever seen. It's a little bad, but come on. If you enjoyed "Excellent Adventure," you should probably have fun with "Bogus Journey". This was the movie before "Man, where is my car?". Only this is funny. As I said, it's just a good time. It should not be taken seriously and if you enjoy the first, you should like "Bogus Journey". It's just a funny movie with some memorable characters. Just for your pleasure, look, let it go and remember it's a stupid comedy. That's all. <br /> <br /> 7/10
