Undoubtedly, Beat Street is the best breakin scene. Everything is on the spot, clothes (puma), music and, most importantly, dance! The story is basic, but what's up there to tell a story? The whole point of the film is to show what the children are doing at that moment in time, which has meant them. She shows that adolescents are generally good, all that has meant for these children everyday is music, dance and friendship. After I recently watched the DVD, I was surprised how well the time test was! The clothes did not look dated (probably because Puma now has a massive comeback), the music still sounds fresh, and the dance is still exciting to watch. A film aged between 10 and 25 years should see as part of their youth culture.
