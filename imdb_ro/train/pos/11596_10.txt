I saw this movie when I was 7 years old - 33 years ago - and I never forgot this movie! I was deeply touched and moved by the brave little boy and the beautiful eagle. And I just could not believe when he turned into an eagle just when everyone in the theater believed he would die ... My sister was in the movie with me and I recently asked her if she remembered the movie she I saw him with the boy and the eagle and said he remembered how I just saw her yesterday. So it's not just me. <br /> <br /> This movie is a MUST YOU! <br /> <br /> You will never forget it - just like my sister and me ...
