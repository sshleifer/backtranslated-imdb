I liked this movie. I thought it would be easy to look and easy to forget. I ran after I saw this to buy the DVD, but I did not forget easily! The scenario is brilliant, and pouring could not be more perfect. Each character has their time and I laughed hard throughout this movie, the comedy time was on the scene. <br /> <br />
