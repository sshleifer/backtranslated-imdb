I was attracted to this, as apparently ABC licensed this show at Pearl TV in Hong Kong. He was surprised by me because it was a break to listen to something Chinese. But I started to get tangled because the distribution lines and story are just enough and thoughtful for NYC. Nothing incredible, though I think it is very stereotypical for them to write Damien as a potential black with a sheet !!!! This was the most disappointing aspect. The rest is great and I'm sad to teach IMDb that I can not wait to watch the season 2 when I'm back in the US. I am as disappointed as other commentators that it has shown much promise, quality and taste. But, just as the approaching characters look, it's probably harder for people to see if the beginning is seeing more episodes. Which seems to be too late for desirable networks.
