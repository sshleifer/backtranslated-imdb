The filmmaker instilled Andy Goldsworthy's art, searching for the nearness of land and water, and his sense of proportion - and so easy, so delicate that he inspired her so nicely to film the others. "Rivers and Tides" loves Goldsworthy's work and combines it as a visual concert of time and human presence in a flowing world, a world that conceals its power. View this movie!
