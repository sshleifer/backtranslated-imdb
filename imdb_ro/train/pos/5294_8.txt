"Pecker" proves that Waters has no intention of changing his sticky ways in old age. Many things have changed since Waters started making films in the 1960s, but 40 years later he does everything he wants to do. Over the years, Waters' budget has grown considerably. This is one of his latest productions, but I was amazed to see that Waters still has that "trailer-park". Edward Furlong plays Pecker, a child who is obsessed with photography. He lives a pretty good life in Baltimore, MD, with his friends and family. But Pecker attracts the attention of a New York-based artist (Lili Taylor always watched) and his life changes for the worst thing. Once again, Waters enjoys art, fame and heterosexuality. He is not one of his best movies, but there are big bellies here ("Memama" has the best lines in the movie!). She's constantly smart and funny, and she has that very "weird" sensitivity I've come to love in Warters' movies.
