So, often, a band will meet for a concert meeting just to find that they can not unite them. Not so here. This concert is just brilliance from the beginning to the end. These three musicians have obviously met beforehand and planned and planned what was necessary to make sure it was not just a nostalgic fairy tale to satisfy one's ego. This is obvious from the beginning before they even go on stage. Many faces from the crowd were not born even when these boys met for the first time. From the first song it captures the old magic that was Cream, 3 men, 3 instruments, without agitation. Clapton said he had to hang out for this concert because there were no keyboards, synthesizers, etc. so we came to see him for his sake. Ginger Baker demonstrates why so many musicians today speak of him as a kind of drum guru. Jack Bruce is great. They have been able to put together a piece of magic that will endure the test of time for many years to come. This is a 10 for me.
