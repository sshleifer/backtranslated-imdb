We do not see movies about the brother-sister relationship in Indian cinema or any other language or environment. This relationship has several aspects that have not been exploited in movies or novels. Usually, a sister is described as a bunch that can be used for redeeming at the climax. This film treats the subject in a totally different light. It is inspired by George Eliot's novel "Mill on the Floss". The brother is very prosaic, very good, a blue-eyed boy who is a good and favorite son with his mother. The sister is romantic, savage and defiant of unwritten rules of society. However, the brother's sister's love is the winner. This film is about the love of the two brothers who are separated in childhood and about the revival of the same feeling when they meet many years later. It's also a quest for the brother to come together with his sister, who chose to be savage to defy the world. Although the film and the novel are established around three centuries in two distant countries, the feelings are the same and still true.
