Boys work outside a recording studio when they hear the "voice of an angel". This would be Miss Van Doren, listening and going under the name of Miss Andrews, because her father does not approve of being a "radio singer." However, she hopes that a big wig, Mrs. Bixby, a father's girlfriend will hire her, and then she will have to give her approval. She leaves, but in a few minutes the guys go amok in a disaster studio and have other musicians kill them after they ruin the recording session. Eventually, things get calmer. "How many times did I avoid," says Moe. "Yes, we've gone too far," Curly says. The boys fool in the studio, Mrs. Van Doren puts it, and Curly puts on clothes for women and pretends to sing. Mrs. Bixby enters, is impressed and hires "Seniorita Cucacha" on the spot! For a sum of $ 500, she asked to come and sing to their party in the society that night. The rest, as they say, is history, as Curly claims to be an opera singer with some funny results. By the way, he was accompanied by "Senior Mucho" and "Senior Gusto". What happens at the party is simply that the truth is overcome, but not before some antiquities take place. In all, a pretty good episode. I liked it, but I would not like something special.
