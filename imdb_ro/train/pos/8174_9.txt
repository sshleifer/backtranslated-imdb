I love this movie. As a child, it was one of the first movies I've ever seen, which made me change my mind. Sure, now it's gentle, but back in the day, it was great. Dentists are one thing so many people fear, so why not make a movie about a criminal dentist? It's camouflaged, it's fun, sometimes it's scary, but it's great. And I always had a love for medical horror. And Corbin Bernsen plays Dr. Feinstone perfectly, no one could do it better. And for a horror movie, the effects are pretty good. And I like the themed music, it works well with the movie. Ken Foree (Dawn of the Dead) is also in this game that plays a cop, and does a good job. There is a fair amount of blood and some really tortured death scenes. Check this!
