A misery of genre, but it is mainly based on Stephen Chow's mock-ups for his inspiration. There is kung-fu magic, college romance, sports, gangster action and a voice-filled melody for a topping. The production is excellent and the speed is fast, so it's easy to overcome the defects in this film. A child is abandoned near a basketball court. A homeless man brings him to a Shaolin monastery located in the middle of a city, alongside a special kung fu manual that a homeless man has, but he can not read it. The old monk teaches the boy, but he exits when he tries to master the special technique in the manual. The school is taken over by a fake kung fu master who is assisted by four stoned monks. The new master gets mad at the boy 20 years ago because he does not claim to be hurt by the master's blows and to throw him out for the night. The boy is found to throw garbage into a basket from an incredible distance from a man who brings him to a gangster club to play arrows. This leads to a great fight, the expulsion of the boy from the monastery and the man's decision to turn the boy into a basketball sensation in college. This happens in the first 20 minutes, most of them happen in the first 10 minutes. Apart from the extreme storytelling, the first problem is how little we know the main character until he enters the movie. The man who uses the boy is more clearly defined until the first third is finished. The land does not follow a new plot, except for the crazed action of the film. I'm sure you can easily imagine how strange nuns will appear until the end. Effects, photography and stunts are all first and get to the uninspired plot. <br /> <br /> Stephen Chow has a much better command of plotting and comedy writing and this movie will live in his shadow, but that's not a good reason to ignore it. It's quite fun, even with a shotgun shot shot. Recommended.
