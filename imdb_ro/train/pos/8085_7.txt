One thing I can say about this movie is fine, very long! In fact, I recently bought this movie a few months ago, seeing a new version appeared. I was happy to find out that it was made in 1978 because The 70's (even though I've never lived in them) is actually one of my favorite decades, especially for music! when I watched this movie, the story was actually very good at first, but after about 50 minutes it started to become very dull and repetitive. I will admit that animation impressed me! it was nothing I've ever seen before and it was pretty cool to see. but the honest movie could have been a bit better, it could have had a lot more to talk about and a story for him than just 15-20 minutes of scenes that just struggled. then in the last 5 or 10 minutes the movie took it and it started again, but ended unexpectedly. in my opinion, I thought it was EXTREMELY long. I know 13 minutes over 2 hours and that's a long time for a cartoon, but since it was boring for most of the movie, it made it look like it was 4 hours !!!! but overall it's a good movie, and I think I'm going to follow one more of those "nothing to do." I'll see a new one and I hope it's better!
