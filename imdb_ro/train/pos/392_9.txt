Zu's legend, as we have seen, was a very interesting story. I think many of those who did not like did not see the underlying mythology of the film. They were expecting something similar to Star Wars, and it was not. Joseph Campbell, I think, would have liked this movie. There were a number of hidden metaphors and meanings that an average visionary could have overlooked. We all have a sword mountain in us. We all have to go to our cave of blood sometime in our lives. We all have to face our insomnia one day. He gave some of the story was a bit confusing, and some of the actions had a bit of hokey sometimes, but I think other points in the movie made it easy for him. I would look again. <br /> <br /> I do not know if there is a difference between the Zu Legend (which I saw in Mandarin with English subtitles) and the Zu Warriors (American version doubled). audiences who would have turned away from this film.
