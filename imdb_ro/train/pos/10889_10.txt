What's with all the negative comments? After seeing this movie for the first time tonight, I can only say that this is a good holiday comedy that will make the day of every single person shine. When I saw that Drew (Ben Affleck) could only spend the holidays, I wanted to cry. You will have to watch the movie if you want to know why. Even if I liked Tom (James Gandolfini) and Alicia (Christina Applegate) after a while, if you ask me, they were real snobs. However, this movie made me smile and feel good inside. Before concluding this, I would like to say that Mike Mitchell obtained a pure holiday blow. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this good holiday comedy that will let any lonely person shine to any fan of Ben Affleck or Christina Applegate who did not see her.
