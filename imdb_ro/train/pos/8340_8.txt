This is a very fun romantic comedy, full of light. You can not be deceived by Meg Ryan's sweet love, combined with Albert Einstein's genius. Normally, I'm not a fan of completely fictitious stories about real people, now deceased and helpless to defend themselves, but I think Einstein's delays might have given a whisper of it. <br /> <br /> It's the 1950s ... Princeton, New Jersey in the spring. The story revolves around a mathematician, Catherine (Meg Ryan), fairly young and scattered, Catherine, who will marry a madman, a behavioral researcher named James, just because she has the brain she is looking for in her future baby's father . However, love is at first glance when the car breaks and meets a car mechanic named Ed (Tim Robbins). Because she does not think Ed is intelligent enough, her uncle, other than Albert Einstein, plays the role of the maker, assisted in his efforts by three malicious chronicles, all theoretician physicists. Uncle Albert has to make Ed look clever, so he makes a charade interpreting him as a physicist ... naturally, with funny results. Walter Matthau is his hilarious self and he's used to pull Einstein's character quite efficiently. With the three college teachers, Kurt, Nathan and Boris, many laughs take place. The truth of Einstein had an authentic human part, and this movie takes one step (scandalous) further. If you interrupt all the logic, you can imagine that this stupid story is happening! It may not be rocket science (despite its main character), but it is a wonderful sweet and refreshing film. One of the best genres of comedy romance.
