While Fred Schepisi's "IQ" does not really have important qualities, he deserves to see. Walter Matthau plays Albert Einstein, trying to help mechanics Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) fall in love with Princeton's doctoral candidate Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan). Probably the funniest scene is when Dr. Frizzyhead and his friends (Lou Jacobi, Gene Saks and Joseph Maher) try to make Ed look like a scientist: he ends up as a French impressionist. the film is historically correct, but that's not the point. It is not intended as anything other than a light comedy, the exact opposite of Robbins' most famous film of 1994 (The Shawshank Redemption). A film about Einstein's entire life should focus not only on his scientific achievements, but also on his political activism, namely how he wrote a letter on behalf of Scottsboro Nine and came out against nuclear weapons (he reached the point in which the FBI kept a file on it). So anyway, this is acceptable. Also with Stephen Fry, Tony Shalhoub, Frank Whaley, Charles Durning and Keene Curtis.
