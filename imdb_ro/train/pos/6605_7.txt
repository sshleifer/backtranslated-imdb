2054. Paris is an Escher drawing with people and vehicles groping along several levels in an obvious homage to Fritz Lang's Metropolis. Paris is both ultramodern and collapsing. And as soon as he is in surveillance, a rather young researcher is kidnapped as soon as he has left his sister in a nightclub. A tough police captain is investigating. Displayed in black and white, with dark corridors, shady alleys and unique source illumination, characteristic of the hottest noir films, comparisons with Sin City are inevitable. But the story owes more to Masamune Shirow and William Gibson than Frank Miller, because high-tech surveillance, almost invisible stealth suits and ruthless super-corporations are just as much part of the landscape as weapons and cars. The film never generates the atmosphere borne by Gibson's cunning vision, its large marginal characters facing corporate types from corporations that all seem to have their own Ministry of Fear, but the viewer certainly has the sense that the future of Paris does not Utopia and future science is less than benevolent. And as the line of police behavior breaks down, we are brought into the dark shelters of individual ambition, under the brilliant paint of the PR image cultivated by the Avalon corporation. The motion capture process used here produces a look somewhere between B & W and next generation rotoscoping books and is exciting or intrusive according to your tastes. However, a great visual sense is exposed here, and the future Paris is completed to the tiny details, giving the picture a unique look that is both Spartan and Baroque. You should look.
