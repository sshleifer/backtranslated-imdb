This game is one of the best RPGs. Fist, In fact, it's funnier than any other because of the combat system (you're bad for the enemy depending on how you direct the attack, you can turn into dragoon, special attack, magic ...). The script is very good. Characters are great and you do not have long-lasting dialogues, as you did in several Final Fintasy series games. I'm bored with those dialogues about the past, when you just want to continue the story of the game. Ambience is a jewel on this game, combining middle-aged fantasy with futuristic science fiction. It's remarkable that the animation effects are incredible, I like more than others in other modern games (we do not remember that the Legend of the Dragon is 8 years ago). Then the map is immense, there are all sorts of places an enemy. Finally, music is not the best game monster I've ever heard, but it's perfect for a game like this.
