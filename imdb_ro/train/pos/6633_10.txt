The first movie ever made. Workers crossing a factory, some with the bicycle, most walking, moving to the right or left. Together with Melies, Lumiere is both the starting point and the starting point for cinema - with Melies he begins narrative fantasy, cinema, fantasy, artifice, show; with pure Lumieres observation, unadorned. Truth. There are many intellectuals who regret the ossification of the cinema from the latter in the tired formulas of the former. But consider this again. There is nothing "objective" about it. The film is full of action - a static, inhumane scene burst into life, activity and the quiet harmony of the frame is broken, decent from the back to the right or to the left (but never, of course, the front where the room is). Still, the camera stays still, contains energy, possible subversion, subordinates to its will. Cinematography can be a revolutionary invention, but it will be used for conservative purposes - to change the world, edit it, restrict it, limit it. The reality of the film is worse. These factory workers are employees of Lumiere. The bosses spy on their workers, the unseen eye of their unruly minions. Therefore, the film describes two types of imprisonment. Behind the gates, workers are at work. Opening the gate seems to be a picture of freedom, escape, but they face another wall, the fourth wall, further frozen. The first film is also the first example of CCTV surveillance, a picture of the unseen, totally vague authority that crashes its servants. A frightening and too prophetic movie.
