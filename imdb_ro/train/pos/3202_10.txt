I do not understand why many IMDb users do not like this movie. Why he thinks it's so bad, etc. It's not worse than anything else there. Personally, I think "Soldier" is a great movie, much better than most movies of the same genre. Reasons why I liked "Soldier": Kurt Russell, Connie Nielsen, Jason Scott Lee (David Webb Peoples), big visual effects and direction (Paul Anderson). I really think this is the best work I've ever seen from director Paul Anderson, who previously led the fun of Mortal Kombat and the Horizon Event, which is not so fun.
