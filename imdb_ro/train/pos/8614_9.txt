The movie kept me interested, mainly because Dianne Keaton is my favorite actress. I do not agree with some of the other posts because the land was not complicated. I had no trouble following him (maybe some people had too many eggs before the night). The film was very sad and excited. What do you want more? Alexa Davalos is a new talent (beautiful), and Tom Everett Scott does a great job with his role. The relationship between mother and daughter may have been a bit unreal, but the young people's behavior in the film was not. It was sad, but bright. Sure he beat the other shows that were on New Year's Day TV evening
