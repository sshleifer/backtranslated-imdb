A very good adaptation of the novel through amrita pritam. Urmila and Manoj Bajpai gave everything in their power. <br /> <br /> There is a natural flair in the movie and I felt it. It turns out that Bollywood eventually gave a shine and had some performers performing on the screen. Wise content, the film described very much what happened exactly during partitioning by showing the sufferings of a particular family, and also shows that trust in one's life goes beyond religion. The best part was that they did not make a drama with a lot of tears and melodrama. I just loved it.
