Homicide: The film proved to be a good preparation for a well-written, well-targeted and well-run series. The late ends were linked, which were not properly addressed at the end of the final season. The whole series, and especially the movie, offered a life-and-death look at Baltimore, a unique cultural city with an extremely high crime rate. My attraction to the series started long before I moved to Baltimore, but once I lived here for myself, I realized how realistic it was. The film has certainly preserved this spirit. I'm definitely going to lose some of the original episodes of the show, but I'm very grateful to NBC and the producers, and we just gave it a last look at the dark side of Charm City.
