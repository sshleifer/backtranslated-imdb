What a delightful story? a very competent film that has so much charm and a common sense that many romantic comedies are missing. Einstein is brilliantly acted by Walter Matthau, while Catherine Meg Ryan is unforgettable? better than I saw in those films opposite Tom Hanks? because the young mathematician is struggling to be recognized. You do not have to be a young woman who understands Catherine's struggle and feel right for her right away, and as a young man it's easy to understand what must have gone through Ed's mind (Tim Robbins) in seeking true love . There is a universal appeal in these emotions, even if I.Q. keeps everything light, fun and beautifully bound. Of course it is not hard, but if you show that there are some subtexts. People remind Albert Einstein as a scientist, but he was a great spiritualist; his words, like something like, "If it's not impossible, then why do we do it?" suggests that he is a believer in the fulfillment of higher goals beyond the immediate understanding of man. In this movie, there are questions about what an accident really is? such as Albert and his whack intervention in "Catherine," away from the lip of the lips, James (Stephen Fry? who gives this character differently and can not feel unwell) counts. How much intervention happens in our lives, which we do not see, and does it happen to be serendipit? And, of course, we'd like to think in real life, despite what we often see about the people we know that Edwards we are getting Catherine and Jameses have to learn to thaw the ice in the veins. How nice you know it could happen in an innocent (and worrying, exclusively Caucasian) country of Eisenhower's era, I.Q.
