Perhaps it's not the biggest absolute entry in the Hammer House of Horror series, but it certainly earns the prize for the most inventive episode with the inventive title! "The House Who Was Death to Death" ?? I could call this title all day without ever getting tired! Besides the wonderful title, this short film also benefits from a solid written script and a few really tense moments. You may need additional viewing before fully understanding the final whims, but it is certainly an original idea for a short horror. The story opens with images of an elderly couple drinking tea in their middle class house. The husband kills his wife sadly, and a few years later the "cursed" house is still for sale. A young couple and their cherubist daughter are moving and are starting to restore it, but mysterious events appear and especially affect young Sophie. Her beloved cat is killed, even if her birthday party gets ruined when one of the house pipes suddenly splashes blood on the invitations (a particularly refreshing sequence, that!). The old house is haunted? Or maybe apparent neighbors of help cause all the horror? Answers to these questions are provided in the original and quite unpredictable climate and there is room for real shock at the end. The tension is crafted with craftsmanship, and the house is filled with wonderful landscapes, such as the pair of rusty machetes used by the husband to kill his wife. The little warning, however, the succession with the cat is hard to follow when you are animal-loving. In conclusion, another Hammer short TV series winner!
