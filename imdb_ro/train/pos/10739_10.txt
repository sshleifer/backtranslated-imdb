Amazing documentary. He has seen it on the original date and on the DVD several times in recent years. I was shocked that he was not even nominated for the Best Documentary Oscar for 2002, the year he was released. No other documentary is approaching. He was on TV recently for the 5th anniversary, but I missed the "where he is now" segment at the end, except that I caught that tony hazmat work now. I've seen critics about the documentary film from some on this list. I do not see how it could have been otherwise. They had less than 6 months to assemble this thing and bring it into the air. The DVD contains more material and background. I'm also surprised that, according to IMDb.com, the brother had no projects in the four years since. What did they do?
