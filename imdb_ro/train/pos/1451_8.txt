I've seen this movie about 6 times. And every time I see her, I'm more impressed with storytelling and acting. It's like a train wreck. It is subtle in its approach, but very effective in reaching its goal. <br /> <br /> Spoilers-> At the heart of the story is a very beautiful dichotomy. On the one hand, we have the major deputy, Eddy Calhoun (Cusack), who breaks harmlessly to the old age-old network of the New York administration, and on the other hand we have the Zapati mob head who is trying deliberately to maintain the status quo by all means. This situation culminates in the end, when Zappiti orders Alselmo to relieve himself by killing him and Calhoun, which forces Pappas to do the same from a political point of view. The film also contains (my personal weakness): - Do not summarize the life of a man at a time - The only new thing in this world is the history you do not know, a wonderful movie worth a lot of rating bigger.
