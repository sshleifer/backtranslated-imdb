Steve Carell finds himself again in a romantic film about elections, family and pressure. Judging by the plot and the art of film coverage, I was expecting a colorful comedy, many laughs and unrealistic elements, but I think I was wrong. Of course the movie had a certain comedy, but it felt a lot more dramatic light for me, and Steve Carell once again gave extraordinary performance. The film itself really addresses real observations and it was a powerful element I found. But the end felt a bit hurried and predictable. Over time, the cinema was great, the acting was great, and the message it sent was obvious but still very important. However, it reached the old, flat and predictable end. I would think if different choices were made at the end of the movie (perhaps for the bad ones, even) this movie would have better advertising. Another fun movie.
