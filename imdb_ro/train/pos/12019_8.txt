I saw this movie on Sky Cinema not long ago. I have to admit it was a very good West, which has 2 big names. On the one hand, there is Charlton Heston playing the legendary infamous and retired Samuel Burgade. On the other hand .. How late James Coburn plays evil Zach Provo .. seeking revenge on the Burgade, no matter what the cost. The good thing about this movie was that there were some very good characters. . Most of the actors played very well .. Especially James Coburn, whom I find was really bad in this movie .. But how was it .. Christopher Mitchum, I have seen everywhere in other movies .. Playing Hal Brickman .. I felt that his character was left in the cold, but he managed to come back through the collaboration with Burgade to bring Provo's possession! <br /> <br /> All in all, it was a wonderful movie .. Very good to look .. High score from late Jerry Goldsmith .. Wonderful piece of western person ..! 8 out of 10.
