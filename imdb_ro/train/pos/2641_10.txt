Green Eyes is a great movie. In the current context of supporting our troops, it is interesting that this film shows a lack of respect for the soldiers received from their debt at this time. From the historical perspective, the end of the Vietnam War has left us all with something to remember and learn. Gene was very proud of this film and deserved the credits he has received since writing "Green Eyes". I agree, I do not understand why this movie is not shown more often or not at all. This movie is a kind of movie that should appear on television every year, just like the Wizard of Oz. Dedicating a man to his lost son moves entirely. I was a friend of Gene Logans and I was proud to know him. rocky
