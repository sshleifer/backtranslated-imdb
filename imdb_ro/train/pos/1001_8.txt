A sort of funny and action-packed action thriller that has Jamie Foxx as a madman and a quick talker, chosen by an excessively demanding treasurer (David Morse) to be released on the streets of New York, hacker (Doug Hutchinson), who stole forty-two million dollars from the treasury and left two guards shot. <br /> <br /> "Moleala" marks Antoine Fuqua's second character ("The Killers of Replacement") and he does the task quite well, even if he does not exceed his first film. What the two films have in common are the action sequences that are excellent. Foxx is pretty good here, though his character is annoying at first, but in the whole movie, I started catching on. Hutchinson is wonderful as a brain that can be ruthless like John Malkovich and patient as late Laurence Olivier was in the "Marathon Man". Morse is fine as the agent who comes with the ingenious plan to do anyone who has done it at all costs.
