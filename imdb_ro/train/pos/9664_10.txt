Bette Midler presents her talent and beauty in "Diva Las Vegas." I'm delighted to have registered it and can see whenever I want it. It has what it takes to hold a audience in captivity. Her voice is as beautiful as ever and will really impress you. The culmination of the show was her stay "Stay With Me" in her 1979 film "The Rose". You can feel the emotion of the song and get to the goose foot. The show will leave you with the desire to go out and rent a Bette Midler movie or go to the nearest music store and buy one of Bette Midler's albums.
