Now I really enjoyed this movie, it was so funny. Acshay Kumar and John Abraham are brilliant actors, I think after watching this movie, they should do a lot more movies together in the future. Akshay Kumar gets himself in a bit of trouble, dying 3 women at the same time, but the way he dealt out of the door and then the other was so fun to watch, he played very well in his movie and I hope he makes more great comedies like this in the future, John Abraham plays his best friend, he plays his role very well and he is so understated I am glad that some of his amazing work has noticed but he is a very good actor. I love John, Neha Dhupia has a small role in this movie and plays it well. The museum is very good, I even recommend this movie to everyone.
