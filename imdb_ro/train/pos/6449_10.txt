I was taken to this film by a friend and I was skeptical of a Swedish film with subtitles. However, I enjoyed every minute of this beautiful movie. The unnecessary cruelty of the man himself was portrayed with confidence without overwhelming images-though animal lovers could protect their eyes for a few seconds somewhere in the first 10 minutes. A traditional story about humility towards brutality and hope for tragedy was illustrated from a satisfactory angle using a spectrum of characters with flaws and very natural features. I really enjoyed the way the film managed to address several aspects of man's hypocritical behavior regarding bias, discrimination, and sanctifying claims. An absolute jewel of a movie that I will promote to all who will listen to it.
