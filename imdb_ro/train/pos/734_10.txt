This movie is fun punk rock fun from start to finish. Ramones, the lords of the rock rock gangs of the '70s, appear like themselves. PJ Soles plays Riff Randle, a rebellious high school girl living and breathing rock 'n roll. Riff is obsessed with writing songs for Ramones, her favorite rock band. She keeps Rockin School, and encourages her colleagues to join her in her jubilant antics. Meanwhile, the school that Riff attends, has just hired a brand new brand called Mrs. Togar. It is a tall and intimidating Amazon of a woman. And she promises to do the "toe-the-line" students. She even has a few students acting as monitors, who relate to her with the dirt of their classmates. Ms. Togar is particularly determined to leave Riff and put an end to Riff's anarchic shocks. But Riff has clever ways to drive Togar away at every browse. Kudos to the superb performance of Mary Woronov in his role as Principal Togar. Mary is a legendary film actress B. And in this film, she plays the fascist lady Togar with pleasant pleasure. PJ Soles as Riff, turns into electrifying performance. Clint Howard as a duplicate Eaglebauer, has a lot of fun with his role. Ramones performs many of their songs hit in this movie. And so the viewer sees why Ramones were so influential in the Punk 70 rock scene. Of course, this is a good movie for the Ramones fans. But even if you are not in Ramones, or in rock punk, this movie is a terrible (literally) explosive energy.
