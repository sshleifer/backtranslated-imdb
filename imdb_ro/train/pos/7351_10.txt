This is one of my favorite films Govinda of all time and the best film since 1994. David Dhawan does a wonderful job in the direction of this film, makes him funny and adds family drama. Govinda is great like Raja Babu and offers great performance. Karishma Kapoor is an actress I hate, this movie is a little less annoying but still bothers in some scenes. Kader Khan is a master in acting and still offers superb performance. Aroona Irani is wonderful as a mother and offers remarkable performance. Shakti Kapoor is brilliant while Nandu is the opponent. This movie features comedy, action, family drama and entertaining romanticism.
