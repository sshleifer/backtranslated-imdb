"Life's Life" is a parody of life and death, of happiness and depression. Black and white always present in our lives. Mel Brooks's performance is brilliant as always, and the other actors work well. This film has a Goat flavor, so it's so good. There are some unforgettable gangs like Brooks trying to earn some money dancing on the street and all the people who go through just to ignore him or when he meets a funny madman who thinks he's Paul Getty and then starts to quarrel and slap each other. If you have not seen him, you do not know what you are lost. This film tells us about the old and eternal struggle of the poor against the rich. <br /> <br /> The only difference between this film and reality is that this movie has a happy ending, and reality did not exist. Yes, indeed, life is moving.
