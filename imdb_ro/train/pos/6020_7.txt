A beautiful new print of "Zabriskie Point" is playing in Paris and seems to be doing well in the Latin Quarter. It's time for a full film review. Let's hope the new pattern will mean that a DVD with an insightful "extra" will be released in the near future. I remember looking at ZP when he came out and thought it was a collapse. This time I was absolutely wonderful and I would classify it as a "near miss" masterpiece. The first part of the film is a Los Angeles time capsule in the late 1960s, I lived there and Antonioni did a delightful job of capturing the essence of the place. Kudos for production designer Dean Tavoularis, who has found some incredible places and made remarkable work. The prince we saw is 1 hour 50 minutes. It is forbidden to people under the age of 16 (or 18 years old, I do not remember). I guess there are quite a few images recovered in this pattern. SPOILER - I wonder how much the scene of the dessert sex was originally cut. What appears today seems rather tainted by current standards. There is no sound music up to an hour in the movie. Before you hear external noises, such as radio shows, etc. Antonioni was very daring to do so. I remember how much it was done in the absence of acting skills Mark Frechette and Daria Halprin. This time Frechette did not bother me. Halprin is weaker but gradually improves as the movie continues. Much of the student's filming material looks like a moment for me. A single photo has a different aspect ratio and is distorted by the wide screen. Of course, there are concrete records, but not all of them. I'm still trying to figure out how Antonioni made some photos of Frechette flying on the plane. It seems he really did a part of the flight - there is no blue or double screen in some photos. I hope to go back to see the movie the second time. Recommended for all fans of Antonioni.
