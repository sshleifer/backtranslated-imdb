I'm not sure if the term "serious comedy" applies to this movie, but I'm not sure if this can be applied. In recent years, cinemas have become filled with comedy movies that are too bad to make us even stammer. So we considered films that do not meet these requirements as "serious comedies." Does the 40-year-old Virgin in this guild? It's ultimately up to you, but in my opinion this is a very funny movie. You laughed a lot, plus a social commentary through some really great characters and situations. There is a lot where there is more than 40 years old, and even people who do not exactly match these specifications can feel identified by one of the movie characters, especially the men. The story, as the title says, is about Andy, a shy, silent guy who picks up the action figures, watches Survivor with his octogenarian neighbors and whose favorite band is Asia. Kal is Andy's collaborator at SmartTech. He thinks Andy is a psychopath until Andy's secret is revealed. Kal is clearly a perverse sex, but yet he seems to get what he wants with the opposite genre. David is the passionate guy who's still in love with his ex-girlfriend, who ran away with another guy. And Jay, a man in a relationship that seems to be affected by his deception, continues to be caught. I'm pretty sure most young people from 13 to 21 have already watched this movie, but they really do not have an age limit to be able to enjoy it. So if you have not seen it and enjoy a little laugh, with a social commentary, than just go to your video store and rest from profound and depressing independent movies. you will really see from top to bottom.
