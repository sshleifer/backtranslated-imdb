Julie Waters is remarkable, and Adrian Pasdar is a revelation in a very warm, very real and extraordinary view of the complications caused by gender dysphoria and transvestism in the life of the young executive. At the heart of this movie is the very real truth that you must accept before you can hope for others to accept you.
