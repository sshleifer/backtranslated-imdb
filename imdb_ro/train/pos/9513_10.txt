A great movie of gangster. Sam Mendes directed this beautiful film showing another father-son camaraderie. Brilliant star-cast headed by Tom Hanks (Michael Sullivan) did a great job. Great, who is acting again. It's a legend that works. also acting by Paul Newman, Jude Law and Daniel Craig. Singing is too good. The plot is pretty good. You will be able to enjoy the movie. A great portrayal of the gangster of the 1930s. Set in the 1930s as the zenith of all the gangster films of that time. The poll is good enough for a movie. A great movement in full, showing what the father does to protect his son. She undervalued for my taste.
