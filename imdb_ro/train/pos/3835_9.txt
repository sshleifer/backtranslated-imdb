This movie is amazing - it's like a nightmare. The bizarre story, the dark décor, the redheaded insects everywhere, the idea of ​​salt and the surreal dreams ... Very cool! People who love cult movies or very dark thrillers will find this fantastic. It seems a little for David Lynch's films: strange story, bizarre dreams, red curtains. Nuit Noire contains almost no plot. It is rather a succession of surreal happenings, nightmares and meetings. This is a disadvantage. If the movie had a truly fascinating plot, full of tension, with an exciting distraction, I would give it a 10 out of 10. But that is missing and that's why I gave a movie to a 8. Nuit Noire movie is worth watching . Look for your DVD and you'll be rewarded!
