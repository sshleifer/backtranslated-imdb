I wanted to see this move in the last few months. In fact, I was surprised at how good it was. The plot is revolving around a group of high school teenagers aggressing on a boy named Marty. They stab him constantly until one of them makes a horrible mistake that leaves Marty burned. A few years later, the group of careless teenagers is invited back to their own high school, which is now abandoned for a party. However, none of the careless adolescents organized this party. Later in the film, adolescents begin to die in the greatest possible ways. I can definitely tell you that they are poor. At the end of the movie, find out that everything was a dream and nothing happened. But Marty is in hospital with serious burns. Though the crimes have not happened, the burns and the jokes seem to have happened. The act is terrible, but that's fine. I like the story. I really feel with Marty. It's like Tamara (2005). Battles get what happens in the end and you will feel satisfied with the fact that the victim gets the cute revenge. We strongly encourage someone to take this if you are looking for slums in the 80's. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 8 stars out of 10. Slasher good cheesy!
