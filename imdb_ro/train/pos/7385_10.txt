At all of yall who think 1. This was a boring broadcast 2. Halle Berry and Denzel Washington do not deserve their Oscars SHUT F ** k UP! This was one of the Academy's best awards, because it was a moment in history to have a black da "black actress" wins a prize for the best actress, so many black sisters were ignored by the academy more years. To be honest, I have stopped viewing the academic prizes because of the lack of diversity either in the winners or in the nominations. For me, it was nothing but a bunch of white men who were muttering in the back. The Academy had many chances to vote for the black actresses who were brilliant in films, for example, Alfre Woodard, Whoopi Goldberg, Diana Ross, Mary Jean Babtise, but she did not. 2. Halle Berry Deserved The Oscars Has No Competition Academy Was Under Pressure To Vote For It So Worthwhile The Actress Has Been Ignored by The Academy, Most Of Which It Comes From White Voices Yes yeah Baby Nicole plays very nicely in muling rouge! but it was time for the black people to have been staying in these awards. As for Washington, the academy owes him long after this unjust loss to MalcomX. For all those who think the race is not a "probably white" in the cinema industry, it is good that many of the most talented black actresses around were either reduced to the stereotypes made by white men's roles of what they think is a black woman or no existence "Angela baset". I do not expect many of the white peoples to understand any of these things, because they never had to deal with any of them. How much to think about them, they are the ones who challenge it
