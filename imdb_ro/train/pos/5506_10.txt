I can not understand why any of the "reviewers" has given this documentary "0" other than for political reasons. No, the film did not investigate both "parts" of the story, but certainly a film in favor of Chavez against the tides of propaganda against it should be seen as an attempt to balance the general narrative of CIA involvement in Latin America the fertilization of civil unrest - the national security archive of Google, and B. the coverage of the clearly falsified scenes of Chavez supporters in the country and other parts of the country. What is most striking about this film is that movie makers have stayed in the presidential palace despite the fact that the coup - the first ever documentary - of the coup on both sides!
