I first saw a song on this DVD at a hifi show in November 2006 in London (I was not really in the cream until now!). It was through a high-quality Arcam system, sounds great with dts .I had to get this DVD and tell you that this is by far the most interesting DVD of music I've ever watched. The performance of Cream at their age was just breathing and the sound quality is the best I've ever heard on a music DVD. the kind of music you want, it will definitely grow on you.It is the pure glow of their performance that will make you watch it again and again.Even new musicians do not cut mustard these days as make these old rockers.
