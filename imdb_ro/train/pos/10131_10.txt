In the first episode of friends, which broadcast on September 22, 1994, "One in which Monica becomes a roommate," there is a song that plays as Rachel sits in the window towards the end of the show, the playing line is: "... does anyone know the artist singing or the title of the song? It seems like a great song ... I would love to get a copy of it ... Thank you for your help. . <br /> <br /> I have performances that are available for purchase and enjoy this show over and over again. It seemed credible ... thanks to the hours of entertainment you've provided over the years.
