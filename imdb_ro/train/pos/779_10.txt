In northeastern Brazil, 12-year-old illiterate (Fernanda Carvalho) sells her middle-aged daughter to a prostitution organization, Tadeu (Chico Dias), to be employed as a home and have a better life. However, the girl is resold to the farmer Lourenço (Otávio Augusto), who unleashes her and gives the girl abusive to her adolescent son to have her first sexual experience. Then she is sent to a brothel in a gold field in the Amazonas and explored his owner, Saraiva, the clever (Antonio Calloni). When Maria escapes to Rio de Janeiro and is expecting a better life, she is explored by Véta Cáften (Darlene Glória). Anjos do Sol portrays the sad and shameful reality of child prostitution in Brazil through the fate of Mary. Last year I saw "The Lilja 4-Ever" that tells an identical story in the former Soviet Union; therefore, this problem exists in the third world countries. Director and writer Rudi Lagemann presents an extraordinary film that portrays reality, but never presents nudity or explicit sexual scenes. It's the debut of Fernanda Carvalho's promise, which has an excellent performance as a scared child fighting for survival. Most prostitutes are amateur and it is impossible to recognize the famous Darlene Gloria so differently that it is after many plastic surgery. The bitter and hopeless end of the story is also very realistic. My vote is ten. Title (Brazil): "Anjos do Sol" ("Angels of the Sun")
