If you still remember the summer when you had your first kiss, the first boy / girlfriend, or the first puppy love fling ... this movie is for you! OK, this movie would win and never win an Oscar, but as a Dominican I liked it ... there are a few things in the movie that could go head-on if you're not part of the culture ... the kids being raised of a grandmother who is mother and father, the youngest son being a boy and a boy with a Bustelo coffee shirt (sooo Dominican!), Judy being harassed by the people in the neighborhood, going to the church and lighting a candle of prayer ... the glow the film was in those little details. Granted, it was not an extraction of all extravagant cinematographic works, but it was not meant to be NOR but was an educational tool for those who want to learn about Latin culture. More than a sweet-sweet, faux-cumenterie, this movie has kept it real without taking too seriously. As in the tradition of "Y Tu Mama Tambien", it was simply the story of an elderly person. I recommend it (especially Dominicano!) = O)
