Wow! It's one thing I can say about this movie. Personally, I am one of those people who loves cats, so it would have been a big part of the movie, but I liked how the cats from each of them came out at the end of the year. I liked the film, but I have to admit that it was because I found Brian Krause, who played Charles Irish very irresistibly, I think the appetite had better me as I watched this movie. was disappointed. I saw Charmed before and Brian Krause is married to Holly Marie Combs, the kiss scene was O.K. in Sleepwalkers, but really bad compared to her kiss scenes with Holly Marie Combs, I do not know if it's because Krause and Combs have a great chemistry or maybe a little more, that was the only disappointment in the movie, but I think it was made with Brian Krause in those tight blouse blouses she was wearing in the movie. If you are helpful to see Brian Krause as Holly Marie Combs's husband and her son's father in for a great surprise with this movie, he was nothing like a little boy. Though now that I think about it, it would be great to see Krause's character on Charmed picked up by the evil that makes him something like Sleepwalkers. I also have to say that music was EXCELLENT in this movie too!
