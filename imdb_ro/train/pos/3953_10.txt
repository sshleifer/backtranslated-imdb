I saw this movie on TV when it came out, and I never saw it. For my life, I did not remember the title, and I just got over it while checking the credits of Roy Thinne's movie. Extremely dark, dark cinematic film of horror in the same class as "Crowhaven Farm"; "Do not be afraid of darkness"; and "Satan's School for Girls" all lost the classic Satanic. I also think it has many parallel to Clint Eastwood's classic "High Plains Drifter". Why not release these wonderful movies, especially when you think of all the latest garbage that fills up Discount DVD shelves at Wal-Mart? Most of these blows have a culture, so sales should not be a problem.
