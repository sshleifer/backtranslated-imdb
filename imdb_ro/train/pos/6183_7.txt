Paramount, financially linked, has pulled out all the stops for this stage of adaptation at the '34 stage: big budget, big distribution, extravagant production, and Mitch Leisen labeled as a director. What happened? Two things: Busby Berkeley did not work for the black stone and for a crime murder script that does not deserve to be in the same trash as Charlie Chan's worst debut on the street. I have to believe that the cut came out of Leisen's hands because the big Ellington duke is cut wild, but that does not mean it's not worth a glance: the number "Sweet Marijuana" with topless choir girls is a breathing mind, the production code that pretends to be and also has Toby Wing (who unfortunately fed the horrible lines and played dumb prototype blonde) as a hot raid for a Jack Oakie, otherwise preoccupied. Carl Brisson's act is weak as Melba Toast, but he is a competent singer. MacLaglen gets to the new platters as a bad stereotypical detective. Try to see Lucy in the choir. It misses a curiosity of 7.0. Feb 2010 Re-think: I recently gave the film another look and now I feel like I was wrong to realize the lack of Busby Berkeley production numbers. I understand Leisen's argument for more realistic production figures in the context of the plot. I still have enormous problems with editing. Paramount, the most sophisticated major studio in the city, has faced major problems with the Production Code in the worst possible time in its history from a financial point of view, and has taken all the stops at this point (also check out the Search for Beauty from 1934). O must see for pre-code buffers.
