Prominent lawyer Walter Pidgeon takes a pro bono crime case, wins an acquittal and discovers that his client (Keefe Braselle) was not only guilty, but also part of an extortion ring that reached the city's tallest escorts. Worried about his own complicity, he undertakes an investigation, stops identifying the "unknown man" who runs the union and kills him. The irony engages when Braselle is accused of this second murder, and Pidgeon has to defend him by indicating the existence of another "unknown person" - himself. Though slightly larger than urban and long rhetoric, the Unknown Man belongs to the noir cycle less by style or structure than by recognizing the ubiquitous corruption of US municipal politics that emerged in the post-war years.
