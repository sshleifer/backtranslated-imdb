I've seen Dirty Work a few times and it's probably my favorite Stan and Ollie short. In this, Stan and Ollie are returning the chimney and are taking the job to clean the basket in Professor Noodle's house (Lucien Littlefield). While Noodle is making crazy experiments in his lab, Stan and Ollie cause a lot of chaos trying to clean the chimney and make a mess out of the living room. The end is where Ollie falls into a special formula tank that Noodle uses for his experiments, and that turns him into a chimpanzee! The best part is where Ollie falls down on the trash and a lot of terrain bricks on his head, but he does not seem to suffer much pain from that. Dirty Work is Stan and Ollie at their funniest. Very fun. <br /> <br /> Rating: 5 stars out of 5.
