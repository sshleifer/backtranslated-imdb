I thought racism and prejudice against Carl Brashear were strongly overdrawn for the Hollywood effect. I do not think US Marina was ever so racist. I can not imagine a full captain, the commander, ever telling his boss to make someone deliberately. Of course, not at the risk of his life. And there has never been a Chief Petty Officer as an unbeatable bias against all, except WASPs, as a character of DeNiro. No boss was anymore pitiful and drunk, as he would have been, he should have ever risen to the Chief Master. Cuba Gooding has saved a film otherwise badly done.
