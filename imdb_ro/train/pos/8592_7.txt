Good for evening entertainment - but the plot was not convincing. Garrison's business with First Lady was unreal and passionate; the president was a cardboard decanter. And who were really the bastards anyway? Nothing has been developed or explained enough. I still do not know why they wanted to kill the president or how the moaia involved. The villains were nameless and undeveloped, so you never felt involved in their plot. Michael Douglas and Kiefer Sutherland did everything in their power to inject some realities into the story - the pursuit and confrontation were good. But Kim Basinger and Eva Longoria were so incredible in their roles, Basinger had no character, and no way could Longoria be an agent of the Secret Service. It could have been a very good movie, but it somehow missed the way with too many unanswered questions. The disappointment in general, despite some very good scenes. And did they use the "West Wing" set for White House scenes? - I expected CJ or Charlie to appear!
