Finally, I have prepared for renting DVDs to find movies that are not available in stores. I chose The Souler Opposite because I love Christopher Meloni and also like little films, often ignored. This is such a treatment! Meloni has such a charm in this part. It's easy to find the bullets you ever see as the alter ego of Elliot Stabler (LOSVU). In this film, Meloni is a passionate step step outside, who hits the skies in many ways, just to find a way to happiness in someone unexpected. The relationship between Barry (Meloni) and Tim Busfield's character is realistic and not overcome. I have not seen Busfield yet, and it was fun to watch. But it was Chris's whole movie. I've become such a fan girl all over again. It's a little slow at first, I'll admit. I thought some of the "flashbacks" could have been edited down. But overall, this movie will delight you - man or woman - having a honest, revitalizing vision of today's relationships.
