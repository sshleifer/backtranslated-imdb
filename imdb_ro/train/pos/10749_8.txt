I hired this for my son who was recently interested on September 11th. At that time he was a kindergarten and had no idea what was going on. I liked the way it was said to be a "documentary". If there was a movie that I would recommend seeing it in terms of 9/11, it would be one! Normally, you see a movie with known actors. No one knew this movie. You also see a movie about 9/11, heard about a fire fighter or two who lost their lives by saving people. I did not feel like this has any of this! I just rented this movie and I will definitely add it to my collection! Very well done indeed! My heart goes to the survivors and families of the September 11 victims!
