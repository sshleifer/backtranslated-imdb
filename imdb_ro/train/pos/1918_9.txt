I'll be honest with Yall, I was a high school junior when this sitcom broadcast ABC for the first time. I do not think I would like it at all. But with John Ritter in him I felt he had little potential in it, plus it was something I liked. The actor was great, not a lot of horrible comedy lines, John Ritter always brings A's play when it comes to comedy. This was a great show to watch and tell you why it was a great show. My father, who never pursues cinema, just watches movies, sports, law, and order, sat with the three brothers and sisters, my mother and I, and saw the show, because John Ritter was this one. I honestly believe that this show will continue to happen if John Ritter rests his soul and I wish he did not die.
