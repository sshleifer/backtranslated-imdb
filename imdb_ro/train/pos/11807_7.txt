After seeing Dick Tracy in the $ 6.99 basket from Future Shop, I decided to give him a way without previous knowledge and being a big fan of Mafia and Crime. I was very surprised to see a very fun and entertaining film with solid performances around the world. The film moves well, of course, it has another solid performance from Warren Beatty, but the true aspect of the movie is Al Pacino and Madonna. I was happy to hear that Pacino was nominated for his performance as a top gangster trying to get out of town. Madonna was awesome as a woman in distress, really impressed, and brought me deep into the show. If you're going to want to watch a fun, intelligent movie with an excellent acting and a solid script, then you'll try Dick Tracy. I do not think you will be disappointed. And look for the cameos from Paul Sorvino, James Caan, Kathy Bates and Dustin Hoffman, among others.
