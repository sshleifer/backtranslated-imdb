I want to add praise for the production of this film, especially for lightened cinema. The fire shining on the smooth and muscular skin creates extraordinarily beautiful images. The film was nominated for (and won) a single Oscar - the first one to be edited. Mala's performance is moody, penetrating and powerful.
