Master Blackmailer, based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's short story, "Charles Augustus Milverton's Adventure," is the first story about Sherlock Holmes's feature film with Jeremy Brett that I've seen. The story is interesting and dark. The film has a sad, sad feeling, but it's quite fun (with some very funny scenes). * Spoilers * Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are trying to discover the identity of an illusion that has destroyed some of England's most prominent families by publishing private letters that in one way or another will destroy their lives. They eventually discover that he is Charles Augustus Milverton, an "art dealer," after some tragic consequences for victims who could not pay. Our heroes have to help Lady Eva Blackwell, who has to pay an amount that exceeds her means or else her future marriage will definitely be canceled. The scene in which Holmes and Watson face Milverton's house are intense. Although the film has an extremely happy ending, the tone is sad and regrettable. The remarkable performances of Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke (as usual) and Robert Hardy in the notorious role (most audiences probably recognize him today as Cornelius Fudge in Harry Potter), Serena Gordon as Lady Eva Blackwell, Norma West as Lady Swinstead and Sophie Thomson as Agatha (the scenes involving her and Holmes are a rebellion). I give her a *** 1/2 out *****. My only complaint is that Inspector Lestrade was not enough. (I would have liked to have added to the scene at the end of the short story where he describes the two thieves, one of which fits with Watson.)
