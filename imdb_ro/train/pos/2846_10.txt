I'm not a writer or a critic ... I'm just a student who saw this movie a few minutes ago ... And I want to thank the people who worked on creating this movie! It's not the best or the most ... but it touched my heart ... why? I would like to understand it ... it's easy and accessible ... it's a movie that makes you feel good after a bad day without any regrets of the time lost in watching it! It's about love and care, about the life we ​​have, but we sometimes want it because of material things ... Look at all the time we have, but we are missing. ... why a fuck do this? We have to live as if it were to die ... to care for every second and to remember: if we do good things, good things come back to us! and it tastes great in New York ... I like this city and the world we live in !!!! Thank you very much for the movie and I'm sorry for my mistakes (English is the second language) ...
