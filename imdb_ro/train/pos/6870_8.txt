From start to finish, I laughed loudly throughout the movie. It's amazing that "The Groove Tube" is probably the grandfather, but the worst of all comic movies. This is how I like to watch TV without being bored to the flipping channels just to suffer from insomnia! For 73 minutes, weird, weird humor never stops! Just think about how all these nonsense laughter can help you enjoy easier life! It's kind, WAY better than Comedy Central or any first-ever event! Do yourself a favor and destroy all these soft movies, romantic comedy blades in the trash! Better, tell the box office manager that you want "The Groove Tube" back on the big screen!
