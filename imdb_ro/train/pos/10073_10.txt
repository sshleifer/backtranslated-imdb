One of the great things about many of the great Chinese movies you can find, if you're lucky, in the video stores, is that they are very accurate accounts of real and real stories. Goodbye, My Concubine, The Emperor and the Assassin and this movie are perfect examples. Producers of the film take a real story and work hard to really create a movie without compromising the deeds for dramatic or commercial convenience - the hallmark of many Hollywood movies and especially Disney movies. In this story we are following the later years of a famous local street performer called the Masked King to master Sichuan Change Art. As he lost his only son many years earlier, he sought to find a male heir to - and continues the rare and dead art in a society that forbids women to do such work. Master Wang is sold a son by a slave trader. Everything is fine as he prepares to jump down his art with joy. But the son finally finds himself a girl. From there, the story becomes very interesting, with a good performance by Master Liang of Opera Sichuan - a regional opera style related to the Peking Opera. Vengeance fans My concubine should look carefully at the portrait of a woman playing the role in Chinese opera. It may help them to understand that the players of these female roles are probably not homosexual or castrated, but people who are so psychologically conditioned that they are not totally aware of their own sexuality.
