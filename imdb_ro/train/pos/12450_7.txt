Hired and tracked this short work (<90 minutes). It's by far the best treatment that Modesty has received on the film - and her creator, Peter O'Donnell, agrees to participate as a "creative consultant." The character, we, who love her, are treated with respect. Spiegel's direction is the best he has done so far, and casting has been very well done. Alexandra Staden is almost physically perfect as a match with Jim Holdaway's original illustrations of Modesty. A terrible discovery by anyone throwing it! Raymond Cruz, as young Rafael Garcia, was also excellent. I hope Tarantino & co. will continue to do more in the series - I'm particularly interested in seeing who they choose to be the incomparable Willie Garvin!
