Good: Engage in cinematic fights, a wonderful presentation, vehicles are actually fun to drive, quite appealing to multiplayer, loyal to the movie and the continuing list. Bad: The main missions are a little short. /> <br /> This game defines what a "good" third person shooter (not necessarily a spy-game) is. Story-bound battle signs continue and will make you want to complete each single mission and unlock all the authentic bonuses the game can offer. The hype of this game has survived, and I personally think that you should buy it and dress up with a few friends and play it. Lots of fun. <br /> <br /> The sound of this game is an accomplishment of the war in several previous loan games, and burning a weapon, it really feels like burning a weapon. It connects to the look that you are a deadly and ruthless spy. Overall, this game makes you excited and happy after you've succeeded, and a multiplayer that can compete with Christmas standards James Bond "Nightfire" gamecube game.
