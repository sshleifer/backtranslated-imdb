There are moments in the movie that are so horrible, the pain of teeth. But knowing that there were only a few weeks left before the Code made harmless and gentle films, Paramount hurried into production before the inconvenience and bending came out of style. Vanity is so terribly anti-feminine that it's delicious. When Kitty Carlisle sings, women are displayed with price tags that would insult a Bronx prostitute. They come out of shells (nudge, nudge, wink, wink) in absolute submissions. The minions of the law, so stupid that they can not find the door, look for their skirts and wander. Men with girls' choir girls are uncomfortable in giant cactuses (could be a source of hallucinogens, maybe?), While listening to "Sweet Marijuana" and seeing the blood falls on a corny breast. Sure, Carl Brisson learned his lines and does not seem to know what he says. But it's worth it that Norma steals the show while no one is watching. Taking a moment from this fragile puff seriously lacks the point of the whole exercise. Follow this with a member of the NOW Carnet and prepare yourself to justify the whole machismo skieza between the blows of the body. Toby Wing, by the way, is clashing on the cake. And Duke Ellington does not do any harm. You have to walk down Memory Lane.
