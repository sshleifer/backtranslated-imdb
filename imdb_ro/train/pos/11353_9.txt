This movie was great. It details the struggle between a committed detective against the ignorance of the corrupt communist regime in Russia in the 1980s. I give this film an important testimony to the fact that she has no doubt about the birth and development of forensic investigations in an isolated community (thanks to the "Regime" community). This is a graphic movie. It presents an insignificant picture of violence and its tragic remnants. Nothing is "covered with candy", with overloaded blood or gore to separate us from the cruel reality of the screen. This film is based on the Russian serial killer Andrei Chikatilo. I'm pretty familiar with the real story to have a very profound appreciation for how real they kept the movie. It's not a comedy, but for those who appreciate dry and dark humor, this movie is a must-see.
