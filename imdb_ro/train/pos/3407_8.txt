Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer offer solid performance in this beautiful but naked movie. The irony is that Dietrich plays a woman with a beautiful but empty life. Truly a superb cinema and sets, and yes, Dietrich's bottomless trunk is also fabulous. Looks great; Boyer looks young and trimmed. The story of a woman looking for meaning and a former life-seeking priest seems rather outdated, but against such unrealistic sets and the sky somehow, considering the two stars, Max Steiner's terrible score and good distribution. The movie runs like 76 minutes and seems to be badly edited, plus some characters appear or disappear. Joseph Schildkraut is funny as the Arabian guide, C. Aubrey Smith is the old priest, Lucile Watson, the upper mother, the Tilly Losch dancer, John Carradine the divine, and Basil Rathbone playing .... well, I'm not sure. He just travels from the desert and ruins everything! As the others have mentioned, John Gilbert was assigned to Dietrich. I can not believe it would have been great. Boris's role, tired all over the world, would have been great for Gilbert. And after the success of Queen Christina (with Garbo), her career might have been back on track. I can not think of any other Dietrich movie for 30 years. She looks great and wears lovely clothes. My favorite is Valentino as a Shiek-like outfit that she wears at the pool. It is definitely worth looking for the lush sets, the color and the two great stars.
