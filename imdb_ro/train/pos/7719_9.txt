If you like Star Wars / Trek, come to see where they got all the ideas and cinematic devices. It's my top 2 favorite films of all time, others-futurist and psychomotor world. The intensity of the root material (Shakespeare's "The Tempest") is not shaded by gimmickry whizbang (a Lucas later). And precisely because it was made in 1956, it does not assume you can see the "rows" with the flying saucer. This was the first movie you could not do. The miracle was done at the "A-film" scale, the economy and tastes at that time were stacked very heavily against it. And the last shot of director Wilcox was "Lassie Come Home". Until I watched him, I assumed that "Fred Wilcox" was a pseudonym for a director who had become or later famous, but at that time he did not want to associate with science fiction, which was strictly a genre "B " back then. This was either a very visionary production or a very complicated "mistake" on the part of the people who fund Hollywood. There are massive massive masses with live, almost microscopic inserts that Lucas has used extensively. There are intelligent machines that go beyond the "stereotypical" user interface; "computers" because they have come to be portrayed much less futuristic in later works. Star Trek's "Transporter" is visible, almost unchanged by Roddenberry, 10 years later. And if the Trek / Wars technocall removes you, FP's scientific references are not exaggerated and all are correct even today. The "ship" set is comprehensive, sparkle of realism, as good as anything you've ever seen and more convincing than anything the Trek did for television or movie. We did not get to spend as much time as I liked. If you've ever wondered how the movies got into such a competent space, watching FP will explain all that. It's definitely not "Wagontrain to the Stars".
