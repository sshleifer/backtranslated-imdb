I had the intention of commemorating the tenth anniversary of Marcello Mastroianni's filming with his many films, which he has on VHS; however, given my Christmas marathon, which took place every year, I had to deal with it! As it happens, he has one of his best performances - and he has been nominated for Oscar (with the film himself being also honored). It was also one of the 14 collaborations with that other widely known star of leaving Italy, Sophia Loren; both, incidentally, play against the guy here - she's like a black housewife and a homosexual! By the way, the title of the film has a double meaning: the leading characters are brought together on the historic day when Hitler came to Italy to meet Mussolini (the event is featured in long archive pictures), but more precisely, it refers to the "short encounter" of stars, in which they share moments of friendship, revelation, and passive, in short - although everyone knows that the return to their normal existence is inevitable, leading to the sudden and sweet end of the film. This is practically two-handed (with all the other characters - with the exception of the apartment block concierge in which the story takes place entirely - including Loren's terrible and patriotic husband, surprisingly played by John Vernon, start and closing sequences); However, the tight set does not discourage director Scola (for recording, this is his 7th movie, which I watched and which I found on VHS) and the cinema Pasqualino De Santis so that the result - the key - is far from embarrassing: the room is allowed to cross the different sections of the large building, respecting the intimate or dispassionate procedures as the situation requires, but always with all the impatience. The narrative, of course, depends entirely on the performance of the two stars to be convincing and both offer (their chemistry on the screen is quite incomparable); it is interesting that, while Loren left the prizes on their home ground, he is a Mastroianni outsider in motion, but unsentimental (the film seems to equate sexual deviation with anti-fascism!), which has generally impressed the international audience !
