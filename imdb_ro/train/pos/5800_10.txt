THIS IS MY FAVORABLE MORE IN THE WORLD !!!!! I was happy when I was 4 years old and still enjoying my 16th birthday! It's an absolute masterpiece! There is no collection of videos without it! I like every second and not only that the movie has some great effects, but it sends a wonderful message to young audiences who may sound, but in reality the movie is really COOL in reality! Although Michael Jackson was in smoked movies now, people still do not see him as an actor. In fact, he's the most talented actor I know! He's so talented! It's incredible! MOONWALKER IS TO WAY !!!!!!
