*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERI *** It is undoubtedly the best Rainer Werner Fassbinder ever made and even with the wonderful screenplay the film is enhanced by the extraordinary performance of Hanna Schygulla. The film begins with Maria (Schygulla) and Hermann Braun (Klaus Lowitsch), who marries the bombs and continues to fall, and Hermann is sent to days of war, and now Mary and her mother and sister have to wander to survive. Maria decides to find a job as a dancer / prostitute in a club dealing with US GIs and meets a black army soldier named Bill (Greg Eagles) and begins to see each other on a constant basis. Maria hears that her husband, Hermann, died in the war, so he gets really serious with Bill. But one day, while familiar with Bill, I see Hermann at the door. He did not die, and when he gets in the room there's a mess, and Maria breaks a bottle over Bill's head and dies. Hermann blames him, and he is sentenced to a long term in prison, so Maria tells him she will succeed in something and get him out. The war is over and Germany has to rebuild and one day on a train, Maria meets Karl Oswald (Ivan Desny), who is a successful businessman in the textile industry and uses his charm to get a seat for work. Maria is determined to do good and climbs the corporate ladder and becomes Karl's mistress. He tells him he will never marry him, but he's in love with her. Hermann leaves prison, but goes to Canada to try to overcome everything that has been done by Maria since she was jailed. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** One day Karl dies and leaves Mary almost in his will, and Maria buys his house. Hermann then returns home to his wife and they are both ready to start marriage, although they have been married for some time. But Maria leaves the gas on the stove and the house explodes with both of them still in it. There are so many interesting things in this movie that one of those films that can be studied and talked about at length. Like in all Fassbinder movies, color use is used in a very interesting way. As the movie begins, the tones are brown and gray to represent Germany torn, but as Maria begins to be successful, it changes into bright colors such as red and white. Reconstruction of Germany, with all the sounds of construction, is used only as a background, and the film focuses on Maria's explosive. Fassbinder wished the reconstruction sounds to remind us of what had happened in Germany at that time. Hanna Schygulla has never been better and her performance is the key to the success of this film. With a smaller actress, it would have been just another interesting film, but Schygulla is so powerful that her performance raises this film to an elite status. Schygulla shows that Mary is very determined and intelligent, but at the same time she uses her beauty and femininity to get what she wants. She is not embarrassed and does not feel guilty about this, and Fassbinder wanted to show her Mary as a woman who basically sells her soul to survive. Schygulla has not been nominated for the Oscar, but has given a great performance that will stand the test of time. Fassbinder himself appears in the film as a merchant, and his own mother, Lilo Pempeit, plays Frau Ehmke. I have heard many things about the end of the movie and it is related to the fact that Mary has intentionally left the gas. Later, in the bathroom, she runs the water over her wrist and seems to be sad. This is just speculation and if you think I'm wrong, please send me an email. I think she was very excited about the fact that Hermann was at home and left her accidentally (Remember he put on the dress for no reason?). Then, when her will was read, at that moment, she found that Hermann and Karl had become friendsless without her knowledge, and I think she felt that everything she had done did nothing. This is the reason for the scene in the bathroom. So when the house explodes accidentally. But I think the reason Fassbinder has such a purpose is to show that whoever sells his soul has no life. Fassbinder was fascinated by survivors, but he was also incredibly passionate. In her opinion, Mary can not have both ways. A fascinating movie.
