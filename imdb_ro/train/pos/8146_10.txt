I can not help but say how much I liked this movie. This movie is one of the least known and one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. The film follows the exploits of a rap group, NWH (Ni # $ rs with hats). It goes from the beginning of the group to the end of the group, after it is tragic. Following the group is documentary producer Nina Blackburn. <br /> <br /> The film is on a small budget, but it does not seem to matter, it is a very well made film, well produced, and the performances of all these actors and actors are excellent. The main force of this film is the writing, there are so many brilliant lines and rap picks on this movie, it's unreal. <br /> <br /> SPOILER <br /> <br /> There are premieres on current rappers such as MC Slammer, Vanilla Sherbert, Ice Cold, Tone Def, Tastey-Taste and Songs (Booty Juice, Grab Your Dick , Etc.) Rusty Condieff made an excellent movie. In the film he plays rapper Ice Cold. The movie does not stop, it's funny from the beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> The movie works so well, because it is becoming more and more unusual, but it strikes that line where it is fun without going too far there. Listening to the three leaders trying to talk a kind of philosophy was one of the best parts of the film, such as Tone Def saying a record producer, "when you take the bus, get there" and the manufacturer responds? depth! "<br /> <br /> The group that presents NWH has a kind of natural chemistry for them. They work so well together and manage to shoot this movie where there is not a week in the movie. so good is how true it is for some of the rap groups of the time this movie is in. Many rap groups have had problems with violence, with censors, and, like with NWA, the band has only become popular when the band started to make a big deal out of the controversial lyrics I love this movie because it's offensive There's something here to offend everyone in a good way The movie has a take off on a large number of people too out of rap, Spike Lee's being, I can not imagine where they came up with this dialogue, the film has a line that will make you roll on the floor. this movie it encountered such limited release. It's a smart, controversial and even challenging movie. This is too much for the mainstream, despite being hilarious and almost flawless in its production. There are not important stars but many familiar faces, including Marc Lawrence, who plays Tone Def. Watch this movie, at least you will surely have an opinion about it.
