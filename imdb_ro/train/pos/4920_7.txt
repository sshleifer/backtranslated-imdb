No, not really, but this is really a very good movie and unfortunately is a forgotten jewel. Black and white matches the movie. The straightforward formula before, a guy had the plague, and the authorities have to track everyone they came into contact with before he died. well directed, and acting is great. Richard Widmark, as a male lead, is good but is completely shaded in the current stakes of Paul Douglas as police captain, Jack Palance (never better than him) and Zero Mostel as a wicked one. Unfortunately, Palance continued to play similar characters in some gangsters or war films.
