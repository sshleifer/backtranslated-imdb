The movie shocked me. Personally, I had the fool most of the time crazy. Well, after having owned the DVD for months, I put it on a sleepless night. although the film fired, the extra material was used for purposes, the seriousness of his passion and his recovery from adding to the game would have been less realistic if he had left no scene. The best thing about film is coherence with the relationship. There were no ex-pop-ups or characters that threatened the relationship. I mean, we usually see that the little girl meets boys with a stunning twist of fate, they meet, something I've seen coming, breaking them up and then going back together in the last five minutes of the movie. but this movie did not follow that mold. I actually experienced the relationship and the flaws, and although the characters had moments of anti-love, they did not have dramatic breaks if they left and mounted every 15 and then reunited in love again. I did not feel that the movie was as predictable as the rest of the romantic movies. The story was unique and sincere towards reality in the way I felt that these people in the movie were the most credible I saw in a modern-day love film. And he did not hurt that all baseball games were real and they were in the real world series, so fate was even a little over there. It's not "my beautiful girlfriend," but it's a lively and honest film. I'll say I like it.
