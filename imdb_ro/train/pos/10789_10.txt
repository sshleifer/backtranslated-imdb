When I was young, my parents got this movie for me. I really liked it, and I looked at it again and again. Even when I was in the third grade, I watched it from time to time. I recently looked at her again, just for nostalgia, and although the show was not intended for my age group (I'm in my late teens), I still found fun and education. This show provides good lessons about imagination and the good of others. Some parts I found quite fun. Also, this show has no bad content so you can leave children alone with this show and do not worry about taking any bad language or something else. I would recommend this.
