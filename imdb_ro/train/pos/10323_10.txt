This is a very fun movie. Some reviews I've read on this forum have been written by people who seem to think the movie was a serious drama effort. WAS NOT WITHOUT HERE ... It is a very pleasant film, made in a common language. All actors are clearly having fun while having fun. Battle sequences are lively, lively and, above all, not free. The so-called "green death", used several times, is not, as I read in a magazine, "terrible". Several commentators were extremely critical of the fight for martial arts between Doc and Seas near the end of the film. Hey, shine ... Again, I remember some and everyone that this is a fun movie. Each phase of this "fight" has been subtitled, which has led to the fun look. The actors did not try to imitate Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan. This is not one of those martial arts movies. Ron Ely looks great in this movie and is the perfect choice to play Doc. Another pleasant touch is the unique way in which the fate of the last "evil man" (Seas) is treated. I promise that if you do not try to take this movie really seriously and just watch it for entertainment value, you will spend 100 minutes in a pleasant way.
