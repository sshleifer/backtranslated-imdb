"Rich in Love" is a slice-of-life movie that takes the spectator on the journeys of a Charleston, a strange family. Very romantic, beautiful shot, well written and acted, "RIL" wash over you like a summer breeze, while his lively whirling gives life to the characters so that at the end of the movie he will feel like an old friend of the family . > <br /> A wonderful, personalized movie made by director "Driving Miss Daisy", "RIL" is a little obscure, which will appeal to mature audiences the most.
