From the back of the Austen films of the 1990s, this is my favorite, more than the "persuasion" that turned me into Austeniana. Before seeing this "Emma," I saw two previous versions, but in an Emma it seemed all wrong, more like Lady Teazle, and in the other seemed half wrong as a possible impostor, while here it seemed correct, and stubborn. In general, I thought that the attitude and the atmosphere of production gave the charm of the novel in a very good way; Indeed, it is one of the sweetest and most cheerful things I've ever seen, rather in the nature of a Christmas treaty. The script is unusually well formatted, and the additions of the adapter, such as the light tree that reveals Harriet to Emma in the church, are all in store. Mark Strong as Knightley is not what I would have expected, but I was very happy: he points out the practical aspect of the character, in contrast to Emma's affections, and his collective outbreak against Frank Churchill is enough funny. Bernard Hepton makes Mr. Woodhouse an almost absurd Carolian figure; Samantha Morton, as Emma's protector, is just as soft and accurate as it should be. As in the "Pride and Prejudice" of the same producers, care must be taken to ensure that the possible character linkages can be considered - uniquely in some cases. For me this production has been and remains a delight.
