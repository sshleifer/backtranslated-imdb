Growing up in New York in the late 1980s / early 90s, I can personally say that this is one of the most important documentaries made to cover this place during this period. Madonna did not even come up with the idea of ​​Voguing, but he got it! Instead of pushing each other violently or in battering cats, voguing allowed people to "fight" within the limits of what they do not touch each other (which would justify automatic disqualification). Seeing these extraordinary talents / well-orchestrated clubs was nothing spectacular and all the big names on the back of this day are here ... Pepper La Beija, Paris Duprée, Xtragavaganza, etc ... all of this has have been commemorated in tracks such as Malcom McLaren's song "Deep in Vogue" ... it does not matter who you are or where you were, because when you went through these gates in this "magical kingdom" you became something bigger than you / you were important and, most importantly, you created your own motion and imagination ... and anyone, anywhere, could become king (or queen) as the case may be. The words and the spirit were as sharp as the movements on the floor. All the tension, enthusiasm and magic of that very urban NYC energy are captured in this film. BRILLIANT!!! RELEASE on DVD to see the world! Thank you!
