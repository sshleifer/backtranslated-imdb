I saw this at the Mill Valley Film Festival. It is hard to believe that this is Mrs. Blom's directorial debut, it is nicely penetrated and interpreted. The different characters could be from a novel by Anne Tyler, that is, they are stretched out with the story behind and the potential futures, there are no false notes, surprising humorous outbursts in the midst of self-provoked anxiety, and very real dilemmas, if not degrading the earth . If you've seen "The Best of Youth," you'll recognize how well the characters are drawn in small moments, even when the story moves sharply. I hope this will be distributed in the US. I live on a fairly sophisticated film market, but we rarely get Swedish movies of any kind.
