This film is about the unlikely friendship between a businessman and a man with Down syndrome. The character's development in this movie is excellent. We can think that Harry is a businessman who neglects his family and that Georges is an innocent man who wants to love and care for "normal" society. The action is excellent, and Cannes's best actor is well worth it. The fantasy scenes in the film highlight the fact that Georges' misery about his abandonment by his family and his desire to be treated as a normal person. The song that plays repeatedly also strengthens this message. The film shows that people with mental disabilities are well-natural. I treated them with discrimination and neglect, as evidenced by the scene in which Georges gives a gift to the waitress in the kitchen). If we come to understand and share the world of these people, both of them with mental disabilities can become very happy. I was so attracted to the film and the emotional experiences of the characters. It's an exciting film for good souls.
