This image for me scores a lot, because it is a very funny and funny spoof Alien Invaders who take over a city and many of its people "folk." The town and players are all decked in the style of the years 1950 and the whole movie has a deliberate sticky feeling and kitsch.One of the scenes are hilarious as well as the birth of an alien creature.All actors perform a full-blooded and serious performance that makes the movie even more fun and the effects specials and strangers are at least seemingly intended for the third rate to add to the fun. These types of movies often deserve a following worship: <br /> <br /> 8/10.
