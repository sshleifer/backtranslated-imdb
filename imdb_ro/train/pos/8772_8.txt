Director Raoul Walsh was like Michael Bay in the 1940s and years before. And I want to say this in a positive way, since there are certainly no bay bears. His films are just high quality entertainment, just like the films of Raoul Walsh in his day. "Gentleman Jim" is a good quality entertainment. Apart from a first-class director, he also has a first-class prize, with Raoul Walsh's leading man, Errol Flynn, in the mainstream. What surprised me was how well the boxing matches were on the screen. They used a very dynamic movie, which also made boxing games exhilarating and interesting to watch, fighting the final championship against John L. Sullivan as a climax. <br /> <br /> The biopic of the 1940s and earlier was, obviously, still very different from biographies made today. Modern biographies often glorify their main subject and show their lives from birth to death and everything, mostly emotional issues, between them. "Old" biopsies were made just like movies that did not rely on actual real-life people, which also means film producers would often use a useful amount of creative freedom with the personality and events of the main character spent in /her life. This film is not just a biography of a boxing legend, it also forms a beautiful portrayal of the period when clandestine illegal battles entered the modern era of boxing. Errol Flynn does a great job portraying the real boxer James J. Corbett, known as Gentleman Jim. Not many people met him, but Flynn did some really good jobs in the 1940s, of which this film is one. He also looks physically in top shape. He also looks quite different from how without his little mark mustache in this movie. The film also has some fine support actors and some fine acting throughout. <br /> <br /> A great movie and entertainment, which also really really really holds true today. <br /> <br /> 8/10
