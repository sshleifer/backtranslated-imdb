This movie is one of my favorites because it makes me think about all the choices I made and how my life would change if my choices were different. It even plays in the "Multiple Universe" theory. The only thing that does not sound true is how Larry Burrows (James Belushi) has so hard to understand what's going on, changed. <br /> <br />
