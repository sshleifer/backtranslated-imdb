I can not believe that this movie is currently rated 6.9. Anyway, this movie was probably one of the most exciting Indian movies I've ever seen. It was really refreshing to see a movie that featured a traditional family movie. As for the story, I thought it was great that it was about Shahid Kapur being set up in a marriage arranged with amrita rao. He is a kind of lucky lucky lucky guy, while Amrita Rao is a traditional Indian girl who is very helpful to her uncle, but the only problem is that her cousin does not seem to receive as much attention as she does, displaces her aunt Amrita with a passion. This disturbs Amrita because she just wants her aunt to love her. It was also very moving to see that, although Amrita's family was not so rich, perhaps only middle-class to inferior, while the Shahids were rather superior, they still treated their family with respect and they did not even put them down hit me nervously. This is because we have actually seen people being very rude to people who are not as good at thinking about their standards, which I feel is very superficial. This film showed that the Shahids were willing to look at Amrita's great values ​​and watched them look at the fact that she was not a wealthy business daughter or something. Everything in this movie deserves a 8/10, I want to make more and more such films.
