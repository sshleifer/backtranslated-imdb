COMBUSTIBILITY OF ORDER. This movie was fine. Goldie Hawn and Chris Sarandon were the best two. Okay, so the typical stranger who (SPOILER AERE) trades with his biker for his clothes was fun. And the boss of this guy was good. But the film belonged to Sarandon and Hawn. These two would have had much more time on the screen together. Chemistry was great. The scene in the bathroom - WOW! Romantic, sweet, delicious. Hawn is a cocktail waitress who saves a foreign man and ends up in the bed in the middle of a plot because of the greed of politicians. Talking about Sarandon would be to give up. SPOILERS This is a fairly atypical and romantic comedy and satisfies somewhat - the political side is far more than romantic. It refers to political issues and abstraction only in romantic areas
