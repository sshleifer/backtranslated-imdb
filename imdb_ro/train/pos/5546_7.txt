Some people say that this is the best movie that PRC has ever given, I'm not too sure of that because I have a good place in my heart for some of their mysteries. I will say that this is probably one of the most unique movies they have made or any other major or minor studio ever released. The land is simple. The ghost of a miserable wanderer turned to the swamp to kill all who licked him, as well as all their fountains. In this mix comes the niece of a ghost victim, the current ferry. She takes over the ferry business as the ghost closes in the man she loves. Wrapped in dense fog and first placed on the unique swamp set, this is a more musical poem than the usual film. the rhythms of dialogue, especially in early scenes, are their poetic cadence. There is also a cadence similar to working with the camera as it moves back and forth over the swamp as if going back and forth on the doorway between life and death, innocence and guilt. The film reminds me of a lesson of opera, oratory or musical object more than a normal horror movie. It's an amazing piece of shooting, which is probably unique in the history of the film. This is not a guild of Lilly. This is a low budget mystery / mystery that tells you a wonderful story that will make you entertain. His story about love and revenge is what matters here, not the poetic film and it draws your attention first (the technical aspects being just the window dressing). If there is any real defect, it is cheap to produce. The fog creates a state of mind, but it also hides the fact that this marsh is entirely dry. Continue back and forth along it is good for a while, but even after 58 minutes you want us to see something else. Do not misunderstand me. I really like the movie. It's a good little movie that I somehow want some lesser poverty. It's worth watching for sure if you can see it.
