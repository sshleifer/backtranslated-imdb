We came across the documentary, Gray Gardens, last Sunday and "injected" without warning. Everyone who entered the room became transfixed on TV and the haunted images of Edith and Edie, who seemed to live their life in a practical room of a dirty beach mansion, eating ice cream and corn on boiled cobs the bedside table) -and the cat urinating on Edith's bed and her incredible words, "I'm thriving on it [the smell]." I did not see the beginning and we asked ourselves what we see and how these aristocratic women managed to get to the position they were in. Spellbinding! you must see !!!!
