I recently started to watch this show and I must say that I really did laugh. You have to appreciate its unrealistic aspects, along with anything else. Some other people have said that this show should have more realistic reactions of the dead, among others. If you accept Ned to bring the dead back to life, you have to accept the other bits of the show. I could not smile after every episode I watched. I really think it's great that there is a show there that can take a very strange subject and even do a great thing to look at. I absolutely love the story, I think it adds a little extra wonder to the whole show. You can not always compare the old programs by a writer with his new ones, you must take everything as your own entity. Sure, give her a chance and enjoy only the ridiculous parts as they are.
