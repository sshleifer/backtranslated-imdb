It was a great romantic comedy! From a historically inaccurate point of view (Einstein had no granddaughters or grandchildren, as was noticed elsewhere in IMDb), but he made a great character. He brought together two very beautiful people played by two of the best actors working. The supporting songs (Lou Jacobi, Joseph Maher, Gene Saks, Stephen Fry, etc.) clicked on the screen and made an extraordinary viewing experience. The fact that he drove a car to move seems to contradict all his pictures and posters of riding a bicycle to get around. And he wore socks in one scene ... it is said that the teacher never wore socks! (Two new recordings for the IMDb goofs section.) Apart from historical inconveniences and inconsistencies, it was a great movie to watch with a large cast. I give her 8!
