I just saw the movie two days ago and I was full of anticipation, being the fact that Paris is my second favorite city in Europe and spent a very romantic 18 months there in the 1980s. I was somewhat disappointed that the majority of this group of vignettes, while doing original and artistic, did not really surprise the "light" and the beauty of the city. I have not seen any of the boulevards with trees ... It was too dark, not only literally but also figuratively. Some of the plots manipulated the viewer seemed to have left him "flat" (the Marais sequence, the hairdresser's sequence to give two examples). The uplifting, good: the Mime sequence, the cemetery, Montmartre (though it left too much for the spectator to understand), the vintage "Cowboy" and Sacre Coeur - seemed to be few and far between, and I would have liked to see an actor so wonderful that Orlando Bloom was in something that would have shown him more originality.
