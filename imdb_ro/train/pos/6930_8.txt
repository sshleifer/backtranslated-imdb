This is quite unusual and uniquely Western, which is made especially original because of its story that revolves around a unique and superior Winchester 1873 rifle and all those who get to put it in one place or another in the movie. > <br /> It's mostly a very exciting film to watch, but not without being a true Western. The film was made in the typical 40s / 50s style of Western genre, so lovers of the genre should not be stopped by their somewhat unusual premise. Because the rifle is actually the main device of the film, it allows the story to follow several characters throughout the movie, which are all connected of course and the story makes a complete circle in the end. Without this, this movie would have been a pretty dirty thing to watch, because the story often jumps from a dangerous occasion to the other, with characters consistently different different involved. Pretty amazing how they managed to put Wyatt Earp on it all. But there is no criticism. I liked that the film and his story were original and how the film seemed to move from one event to another. He gave the film a little sense of adventure and entertainment. It's also a really great movie. I liked the settings of the used film and it seems quite amazing that it was the first director Anthony Mann. Fortunately, he will continue to direct more vestiges later, which would often play James Stewart mainly. It was a pretty bold casting choice to choose James Stewart as the lead. He is one of the most attentive and polite actors who throws him like a tough gun, seems a little strange. But Stewart is surprisingly convincing as a tough guy and shows how versatile and truly capable as an actor he was actually. <br /> <br /> There are also other actors surprised in the film, who are often not connected with this genre. Shelley Winters plays the female role and later known actors Rock Hudson and Tony Curtis appear in some small roles. A real vest, with lots of action and entertainment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
