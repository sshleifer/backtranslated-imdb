A single mother (Diane Keaton) is looking for jobs with minimum wages. When she is fired, she finds she is unable to support her sons (Michael Seater and Colin Roberts), the last of them having asthma. Then she goes to her boyfriend and starts selling drugs. Quite quickly, he becomes addicted to the drugs he sells. Her life collapses, especially when her children, her eldest son, find out the truth and threaten to leave her. Then she struggles to redeem her children, but can she protect her family from the drugs she worked for? <br /> <br /> Wow! This lifetime movie has some of the best actions I've ever seen! Diane Keaton is doing very well, and her character is unleashed, but she was extremely convincing. It's more suitable for drama than for comedy. However, the best interpretation of the film comes from Michael Seater, who plays his oldest son. He is perfect as the responsible son who is still young but tries to be the adult of the family. His acting was particularly good in the scenes he faces with his mother about drugs. Colin Roberts, who plays the little son, also does a great job. A movie worth watching, especially due to the act of Michael Seater and Diane Keaton!
