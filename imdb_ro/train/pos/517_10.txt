Pressburger and Powell's biggest film. David Niven plays the RAF bomber pilot who loses his own death but is given a second chance to live when the sky notices that he is AWOL and sends an angel to investigate. The scene in which young soldiers, men and women, black and white, all killed in action, come to heaven to be treated for eternal life, is unbearable. Watch out for Roger Livesey, a deeply appreciated actor, and Kim Hunter for love interest (later, of course, Zira in the Planet of Monkeys). In fact, Steven Spielberg interpreted the actress who interpreted chief angel (Kathleen Byron) as the elderly private wife of Private Private Ryan Salvation, half a century later, an act that tells volumes for cinematographic literacy.
