Yesterday I watched this movie for the third time. I was advised by a cake a few weeks ago. I have never looked before, nor have I ever noticed it, because it falls (typically) in the "Swedish film" category, and those who rise (like me) with Hollywood productions tend to be skeptical of any foreign movies. Damn what a paradigm shift! The film touches me, because it keeps my hope, that humanity can change in a better way. The Swedish village is just a model for all areas of the world where it lives together - controlled by religion, misunderstanding, lack of courage, predictions, disguised brutality, but also the ability to have fun, to meet, to sing ... a trigger from the outside to break the masks of everyone (who keeps one) and to allow them to feel that we are all human beings with the desire to live our lives. I can never stop seeing stories like this, because it keeps my hope as I described above. The five minutes that feature the story of the Gabriella song, including her performance, are one of the most important moments of my film! Thanks Kay Pollak just for these 5 minutes, which made me happy!
