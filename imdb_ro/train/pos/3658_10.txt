This movie is like an allegory of the Gospel. It has such a direct honesty and innocence that you can not believe it was made after the World War, when Italy was destroyed and devastated and filled with a huge population without housing and impoverishment. It is a monument to the best qualities of the human spirit, as well as the endless creative resources of that earth of inspiration. <br /> <br /> This is a character like Dojoevisky's "idiot", a modern Christ who finds his way into a big city. He is loving kindness and purity, and his deeds change the people he meets, just like the pigeon who works wonderfully. The story is narrated in a natural way and a simple style but impelling with magic that is almost a premonition of Fellini's surrealistic fantasies. It's one of the most inspirational inspiration films ever made.
