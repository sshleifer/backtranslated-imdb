The remarkable film of 1943, with Paul Lukas offering an Oscar calibrated performance as head of his family who brought him back to America from Europe as the Nazi threat deepened. Bette Davis retains her usual reputation here, and for a change she has not been nominated for the best actress for this film or for any 1943 film. Encouraging betrayal around them, Lukas has been successful in dealing with the situation. He knows he has to go back to Europe on a clandestine mission and come back. Davis pulls out all the stops with a tearful drop like Katharine Hepburn, when he has to break away. She respects, she knows that her bigger son must follow him on the way to freedom. A great movie that highlights American positive propaganda against a bad foe.
