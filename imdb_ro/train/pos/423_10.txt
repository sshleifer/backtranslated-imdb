I've read the summary of the plot and it's the worst I've ever read. Do not do justice to this incredible movie. For an example of a good summary, read the listing on "Turner Classic Movies". Anyway, this was one of my favorite movies as a little kid. My sister and I could not wait until April when we could see T.V. It's one of the best horses movies of the day. It is one of those great classics that the whole family can pursue. Romanticism is pure and loved. The story line is interesting and the songs are great. They do not make such movies anymore. Good action and not over the top. Pat Boone and Shirley Jones are the best, along with many other great actors.
