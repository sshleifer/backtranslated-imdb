I love this movie. It's funny, funny, violent, surreal, played in the head of the madman and is certainly not your ordinary comedy. <br /> <br /> If you do not find the funny movie then I think it's not just for your tastes, so it's hard to write a review for. For reference, other comedies that I love are The Big Lebowski, Princess Bride and Zoolander (who only took me a second time around). There are others, but my taste is certainly unusual and I am willing to accept that most people do not have the tendency to enjoy that. I do not apologize for having an unusual sense of humor - at least I have one. The scenes and characters of this movie are well put together, the verbal humor is hilarious, the situations are interesting, the act is very good (as you would expect from the distribution), although the current scenario requirements are not particularly high. The overall package makes fun, fun, fun and violence.
