I remember watching this movie with my friends when I was four years old, but the strange thing is that I did not follow it afterwards. The next day I was babysitting and my cousin did not see all the dogs going to heaven, so I hired both movies and watched them together today and he really loved these movies. So many memories have come back watching this movie once again, and I have to admit I've cried a little. I'm 22 years old and end up with me. All dogs go to the sky is one of the most animated movies and I am shocked by this rating of 5.8, I thought this movie would bring good memories for others. I admit that the animation was a bit typical, but the story is so charming and fun. Charlie is a gambling dog that is killed by another gambling dog, Carface. But when Charlie wants to take revenge, he returns to Earth with a watch that can not stop or the end of his life again. When he and his best friend, Itchy, look for Carface and spy on him, find out that Carface takes all his money, has a little orphaned girl who talks to the animals and find out who's going to win the races. Charlie takes the girl, Ann-Marie, and makes false promises to get the money. But he gets to know that maybe he should put Ann-Marie in front of himself when Carface returns to him with a vengeance. All dogs go to heaven are the perfect movie for the family, it's not Disney, but it's an excellent family movie to watch. Not to mention he's just so cute and exciting. I know it's ridiculous and some people make me crazy, but this movie for me when I was a kid made me think that dogs have souls. How could they not? They are so loving and I think I'll cry again. But anyway, I would recommend this movie to anyone, it's a fun movie to watch
