My sitter was a fan, so I saw many of the bigger episodes as I grew up. I'm not a fan of Scooby Doo so I'm not sure why I left TV when this show was premiered. To my surprise, it seemed pleasant to me. For me Shaggy and Scooby were the only interesting characters * red dodges from the fans of the others *, so I want them to focus only on the two. However, this can make fans of the original shows hate him. I like the acting voice, especially Dr. Phinius Phibes. I loved to listen to him even before I knew he was Jeff Bennett. And Jim Meskimen like Robi calls me as if he could enjoy his job as an actor. I also get a blow from Tech Lovers with their slightly autistic personalities and their wishes to play Dungeons and Dragons or act in Star Wars scenes (they are not called by these names in the show, of course).
