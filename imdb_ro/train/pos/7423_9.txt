I recently watched the '54 version of this movie with Judy and, while I appreciate the story and the music, I discovered that the film did not catch my attention. I expected the remake of '76 to be the same story, except for Barbra's overthrow. I was pleasantly surprised - it was a more realistic and more modern vision of fame, money, love and the price of all. This version is much more real than the one in '54, with better music, better action, a more aggressive plot, and, of course, a deeper love. I do not understand why the previous movie was on the top 100 list of the American Film Institute, while this remake fails to make a mark on the list of critics.
