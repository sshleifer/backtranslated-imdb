If you want your vision of Chaplin to be limited to a loving tramp, and to laugh at your stomach, watch something else. If, however, you like the slapstick comedy, as it was done by one of the best, watch this. The image is that of the tramp who can not make the girl. He makes another couple kissing on a park bench and has an explosion destroying their fun. This is one of the comedies of Chaplin Park, filmed in Mack Sennett Park, with pockets and policemen and couples. These shorts work because the format allows Chaplin to shine while he is woven through warnings. I checked the box because this could be considered a spoiler, although it's not the case if you saw these movies. Everybody ends up in the pond, except for Chaplin. It makes the girl, which in this case was interpreted by Minta Durfee, also Mrs. Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle.
