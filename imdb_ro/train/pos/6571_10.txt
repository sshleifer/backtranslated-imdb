<br /> <br /> The first thing I have to say is that I have Jake Speed. I've seen it at least 10 times. This movie is one of the most entertaining films ever made. The film begins with Margaret (Karen Kopins) trying to find her sister. Her sister was kidnapped in Paris and the family did not hear anything. Together comes Jake Speed ​​(Wayne Crawford), telling her exactly where her sister is and making an offer to find her. Jake Speed ​​is a hero. He does not work for money because he just wants to help and have a good adventure. His partner (Dennis Christopher) follows him and writes his adventures in novels. This movie is a great adventure. He's hilarious, he's full of action, it's great. I think it's a cult movie with a very small cult. Crawford is perfect like Jake Speed ​​and throws some gaskets that you will never forget. Kopins and Christopher are also good as the girl and the opponent respectively. John Hurt, the guy whose stomach exploded in Alien, plays the diabolical, perverted villian that just adds the fun. In many ways, this film is similar to Indiana Jones, in some ways it is similar to James Bond movies. Maybe it should have been called Indiana Bond, but whatever the title, it's a very nice movie.
