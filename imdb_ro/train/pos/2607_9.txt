The end of the season sent mixed messages, I felt feelings of joy and also feelings of being lied and deceived. Roseanne tells all viewers that the 9th season was a lie because her husband, Dan, died. It also recognizes that the family never won the lottery, and what was a lie just as it wanted or wanted to be. I'm still confused when he said that Becky got along with David and Darlene with Mark because Becky and Mark admit they're pregnant. So I think she wants it to be, but it was not. So the end of the season was good, but he sent mixed feelings. I will always be a fan of the show. :)
