It was one of the funniest and greatest sitcoms that hit the national television. It is regrettable that the show is not placed amongst the great sitcoms where it really belongs. The actors did a great job, and the seasons one to six were the show at the top. Although the seven season was not as good compared to the previous six, it was still funny. Season 8 was the real issue. Without Grace Topher or Ashton Kutcher, the show broke down. I do not really say, the other actors were not great if they were one of the two main characters, such as Danny Masterson, Wilder Valderamma Kurtwood Smith, Debra Jo Rupp, Mila Kunis and Laura Prepon (Don Starks and Tom Chong) had the same effect. And the inclusion of Randy (Josh Meyers) did not help because it was not welcomed by the fans of the shows. I think if the show ended one year ago, it would have certainly been lost in history as one of the best in the sitcom. Season 8 was a bit boring, but the final was excellent. I'm going to miss the show, I hope I wake up one day to find out that the show is back as "80's" with the same piece, because I'm gonna lose it.
