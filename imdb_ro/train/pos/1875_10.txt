An amazingly high quality movie. It seems to be based on the real events that, as they say, have the clear ring of truth about it, this film is extremely emotional and deeply moving. An abused and neglected child often becomes poor in adulthood as one of life's failures, either as a drug-addicted gangster or a burden on society. Antwone Fisher, as a young adult in the navy, is troubled. He's about to be a loser. He is advised in therapy by a psychiatrist and that is the relationship that is in the central scene in the game. In flash-back and source therapy and remedies to anger Antwones are revealed. <br /> <b> Outstanding performances of the entire distribution. The story is, in fact, a family tragedy with emotional and physical torment. All actors perform blood-filled with conviction and realism. A message in the movie is the importance of raising children in a decent way. Antwone really deserves success. To live evil as a child, but to rise above him, he shows a magnificent character. And to all those who have suffered such anxiety, but have survived and succeeded: you are all winners. 10 out of 10.
