When you see this movie you have to be careful that it's not a normal movie. There is no real story just characters, a bunch of gangster characters uniting in perfect harmony. Dialogue is great, you can just come back and listen to it. The film is remarkable, so it's hard to find the right way to describe it. That's why the user's comments about this movie are so mixed. <br /> <br /> love the movie and recommend it to all who love a line and things different from 'normal' ones. You can not really put a real toe about this is just a comic world in which gangsters reign. A place of love and danger. A movie you can see more than once.
