Since the musicals have come out of fashion and are incredibly expensive to do without the talent needed to conclude a contract with a studio, I doubt we will have a real story about Enrico Caruso. <br /> <br /> But if everything was in place, it was no accident that no Hollywood studio had attempted this task until Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had put Mario Lanza under contract . No one else could have done it, I doubt it will ever be tried again. And why it should be. I think Enrico Caruso himself would have been pleased with the way his song was portrayed on the screen. For tenor's voice was his life, the reason he was on the ground. <br /> <br /> To say that the freedoms have been taken with his life must be modest. Caruso, like the one who portrayed him, was a man of great appetite, though with much more self-discipline. She had many relationships with several women and had two sons outside marriage that are not in the movie. <br /> <br /> His contribution to the record industry is treated as almost a subsequent idea. He was presented in a recording studio late in his life. In fact, he began recording at the end of the last century and along with Irish tenor John McCormack for RCA Victor made the recording industry what it became. When Caruso and McCormack were at their height, they had to inherit a ticket to see any of them perform live. But many Italian and Irish immigrant families had a phonograph and record or three of these men. That's why both have become the legends they have. What the film has is some beautiful works of art made by Mario Lanza, a taste of what could have become if Caruso's discipline were to work. The Great Caruso won an Oscar for sound recording and received nominations for costumes and designs. <br /> <br /> Mario himself helped popularize the film with a RCA Red Seal song from The Great Caruso. Unfortunately due to our contractual obligations, we were unable to get an album with Ann Blyth, Dorothy Kirsten and Jarmila Novotna. Although Blyth sang in the movie, Lanza was a great success The most beautiful night of the year contributes even more to the popularization of The Great Caruso. If you are looking for a life of Enrico Caruso, that's not the case. If you are looking for a great artist who sings at the height of his career, than not miss the Great Caruso.
