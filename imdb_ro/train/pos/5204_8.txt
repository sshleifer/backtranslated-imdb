I do not look too much at pornography, but I love porn stars. And I like horrible movies. So when I heard about a pornographic gore movie, I was very excited. Of course, that was a few years ago and when I heard about all the troubles of making and finalizing the movie, I never thought I'd see it. But I did and I'm not ashamed to admit I loved it, even with all its defects. First of all, defects. The story is set in Ireland and is called Samhain, but the story he seemed to want to say is about the Sawney Beane clan in Scotland. So why did not you put him there and skip the third grade report about Samhain / Irish immigrants / Halloween? She also breaks her own rules, saying you're safe on the trails, but then cannibal mutants start running amok anywhere. It is never clear how many cannibals we have to deal with. There is a large stone castle that is obviously old, but nobody noticed it before. Horror film recommendations that are conscious are annoying, just like the characters. Heroine has retrospective mount of all her dead friends, including a character they NEVER LOVE. Ending does not make sense. So, what does it work on? Gore! Of course I would love more, but it was refreshing to see such an ugly film that she is not afraid it would be more than a gore movie. Two murders are over the top, and Taylor Hayes has a nice scene. The two wild crimes are even pictures taken on DVD. I've always believed that the gore can overcome a bad story, and Evil Breed has strengthened it.
