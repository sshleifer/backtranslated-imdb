There should be more films about our native Americans. In particular, I think the real use of real Native Americans would be the best thing. I know this Archie Belaney, which was portrayed by Pierce Brosnan, did an excellent job portraying that character because he was an Englishman. But my suggestion at Hollywood is to put more American Indians in roles and never use anyone else. The Sioux nation has been put on the burner for too long. Their poverty is a shame to our country. It is my firm conviction that our country should bring Black Hills back to Sioux. We ask Israel to turn our Arabs, but we make no effort to do the same, we should be ashamed of ourselves. We have to practice what we preach!
