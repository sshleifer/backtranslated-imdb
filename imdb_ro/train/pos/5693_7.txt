The real story of a group of junkies, robbing an honest businessman of drugs, jewelry, weapons and money. Some would say that this is the tragic story of America in the eighties when the high peace of sixty-one of free love collapsed into drugs and AIDS. Honestly, this is just ordinary people without any purpose in life standing around to get high and decide to rob a ruthless man. What is the second part of their main plan? Once they have their stuff ... they will sit and stand up again. Big Plan. Even if you do not know the story, there is no suspense in this movie and no surprises. The fact that Cox tries to make these characters folkloric heroes, with party scenes and prey, is weak and insulting. The story was better with a more direct approach. As it is, this is just a sad story of the little drug dealers who have been killed by the big drug dealers. The bigger story in more ways than one is John Holmes. He is the center of this story anyway. This movie should have been all about him, his life. He was the one in the wondrous area, with the miracles about to disappear. Although not official, Boogie Nights is a better version of Holmes's life. It's not entirely real, but it's much more enjoyable.
