Frankly, when I saw this movie years ago, I immediately wanted to stop it. When I sat there for the next 10 minutes, I realized that the actor who played Navin stole the show. His facial results and comedic behavior make me shake my head for not being in comedies. He has this "Marty Feldman" for him, but MULT, more talent ... without taking anything from Marty. The movie really shocked me about how close it was to the original Jerk, but again it was so much more. I really think that if this movie was first released, and I saw Steve Martin's second film, I would think the second was a cheap rip-off. I know it sounds like a BOLD statement, but it's true. I really like Steve Martin, but his performance is second to the actor The Jerk Too. I wish I could get a copy for my collection. I urge you to see if you can find her.
