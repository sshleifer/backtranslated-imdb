In a series full of brilliant episodes, this is one of my favorites. It's not the deepest episode, there's no big meaning or message. But there is a lot of fun and there are some great performances. But what really makes it clear is that, to my knowledge, it is just the Twilight Zone episode with a * double * snapper termination. The area is fairly famous because it gave a great surprise at the end of a story. But this time, you have a surprise and I think that's it, but there seems to be another surprise waiting. I like so much that it's probably one of the two favorite episodes (the other being a deeper, more message-oriented).
