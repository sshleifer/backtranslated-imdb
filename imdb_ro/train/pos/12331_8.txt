Being someone who lists Night of the Living Dead at number three in the top five favorite films of all time, and at the same time, loving this student movie parody, I feel I have to defend this movie against reviews previously sent. This short but sweet sweet has always been a lot of pleasure in the horror film marathon and science fiction, where the attendees have a love like they still know not to take too much in the zombie films seriously. This movie is a tribute to the original, not an insult. It is meant to be funny and many others who have heard singing and applauding them agree with me that it succeeds. Especially for those of us who have seen NOTLD 50 times. Watch the director as news reporter Jeff Drexel and also if you have the chance to catch the parody of strangers, Loaf.
