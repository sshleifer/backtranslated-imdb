Strange couple is a comic gem. One of the funniest scenarios she has ever had on celluloid - surpassed only by Strangelove, Spinal Tap and Lebowski! Lemmon and Matthau are best friends: Felix obsessive-compulsive and Oscar negligent and irresponsible. Oscar's wife has already left him because he is unable to live because of his irresponsible attitude. Felix's wife leaves him at the beginning of the film and, after an aborted suicide attempt, moves with an Oscar-poker friend. When the fun begins. <br /> <br /> The entire scenario is brilliant and full of unique beams. You are probably already familiar with "F.U." joke, but it still works brilliantly due to Matthau's comic book. My favorite moments are when Lemmon tries to release his sinuses for dinner and when the pigeon sisters are enchanted by a very cute, Matthau and Lemmon entirely from his element. This requires repeated viewing!
