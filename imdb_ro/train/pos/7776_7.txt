Does anyone know what are the two sports cars? I think Robert Stack would have been a Masseratti. Rock Hudson's character told his father that he was in Iraq, is not that right? I had Dorthy Malone in my beating for most of my life, maybe that was the movie that impressed me. Loren Bacall had the courage in this film and probably acted Malone, but Malones's side made a more sensational impact, Oscar for the best supporting role. Was Loren's role a primary role? Old Hadley's character was probably an ordinary image of the magnates of his age, being an ordinary guy who made it big in an emerging industry, the city had forgotten his kids to get their wife to bring them up. In time, being a widow, she realized that they were all she really had and were shattered, seeking attention, so rather than trying to refer to her children, his head off. On an old morality story. But , seriously, what were these sports cars?
