If only the ALL animation was great. This movie is classic because it is powerful, there are two simple aspects: story and character. The characters in this movie are nicely personalized. I felt for all the characters, and the human-animal relationship in the movie works perfectly. The beautiful animation and 3D animation of the computer did not work better in any other movie. This is a great movie for children and adults who want a classic hero's journey. 8 out of 10.
