Too bad that some comments in front of me do not know the facts of this case. It is based on real events, a highly publicized disappearance and murder case that takes place in Wilmington, PA / Philadelphia PA from 1969 to 2000. I have to admit that I was extremely skeptical about how Hollywood would dramatize real history and events was actually quite impressed by how close they were to what was consistently reported to local news stories and Philadelphia Inquirer news all the time. Of course I immediately pointed out that the actress (which I really like in the cold case) who played Fahey does not look like her (Anne Marie was actually more beautiful). I must admit that Mark Harmon has indeed introduced the type of personality that was revealed as Capano and the behavior that Capano presented during this period. The details of the case took place on ... no dramatic effect ... even up to carpet, gun, furniture and cooler. In conclusion, I wanted to add that I met Tom Carper many times in various positions (a good man, despite being a politician) and I'm glad I fired the federal words needed to solve this bad crime . Boys like Capano are real and it was great to finally see him behind the bars.
