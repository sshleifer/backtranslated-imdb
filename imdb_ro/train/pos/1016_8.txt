I would have offered this terrible series of 10 votes if Claudia Black would not have continued in it! Inclusion as a bad Vela brought the series into my estimation. It was a mistake to bring it regularly, at the same time as Ben Browder's inclusion in ADR. Unfortunately, we changed our minds about Jack's loss and we really did not need this. I became a big fan of "Stargate," and when the series was first announced, I had reservations that she could live until the movie, but after watching the first episode that I have to admit I was captured. I have always been looking forward to new episodes with great anticipation
