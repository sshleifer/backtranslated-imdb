I think most people do not seem to have the right idea about the movie, at least that's my opinion. I'm not sure it's a movie about drug abuse; rather it is a movie about the way of thinking of these genius brothers, drugs are side effects, something marginal. Again, it's not a commercial movie that you see every day, and if the author wanted it, it has failed definitively, because most people think it's one of the most drug-related movies. Still, I think something else is the case. As in many films featuring different cultures, the audience usually understands films that portray their own culture, something that has grown and is quite familiar with it. This movie is to show what these "genius" people think and what are the issues they are facing. The reason they behave like this is that they get bored of their mind :) They have to meet people who do mediocre things and accept those things as if they were launching spacecraft daily. They start a hard job and excel in the shortest time. They feel like ... I went to work, I did not do anything, I still did twice as much as the boys around me, when they were all in their projects, what to do now with my free time . And what's even more boring? When you can begin to predict behavior not because you are a psychologist, but because you have seen this pattern in the past. So for them, on the one hand, there is a job without challenges, sometimes quite boring, and another starts to realize people's behavior. It's a recipe for great boredom. And the worst things are usually done to get out of this state. Earlier, they said the biggest problem is that they try to realize life in terms of logic (mathematics describes logic), while life is not really a logical thing, it is actually absolute correct.
