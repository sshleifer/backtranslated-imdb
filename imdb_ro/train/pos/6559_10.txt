Rose rope. "Every rose has thorns." A mix of old and old hip hop blend perfectly together. The clothing styles, the landscape and the plot are all suited to what the director wanted. <br /> <br /> Plot - five years, robbed twenty-seven banks and then disappeared without a trace. Now a small Western city is under siege, and one of the first victims is Rachel's sister. The Rose Gang is ready to walk again. And this time it's personal. Rachel (Michael Calhoun), Chastity (Lil Kim), Maria (Lisaraye), Zang Li (Marie Matiko) and Kim (Stacey Dash) after five years of traveling together. When Rachel's sister is killed, she stops gathering friends again and travels a vengeance. <br /> <br /> A good, muck around the western version. (If you've seen Bad Girls, well, this is a bit better in the female characters). I gave it 10/10 because the characters, the plot and the landscape have done it to me.
