Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews, who were so memorable in "Laura" in 1944, reincarnated for this excellent 1950 noir film. A terrified policeman, Andrews like Mark, can not overcome this fact that his father was a little boy died in an overthrown police while trying to break out of prison. As a result of his bitterness, Mark does not know when to use his hands. (Craig Stevens) Trying to guide gangster Gary Merrill, Mark unintentionally sent the warmth to the innocent cabin, Tom Tully, who is Gene Tierney's father, who was separated from Stevens. This is a well-thought film that deals with the consciousness of a virtually decent human being. The end is not exactly optimistic as Mark will have to face at least, he finally admits what he did.
