Another example of British cinema can be achieved: a simple story, said and acted well. Brenda Blethyn gives a layered and heated show as Grace, recently widowed and financially hard-backed, ably supported by a solid distribution. The "small moving city" card is played on the handle, similar to many television series and movies that have come from the British Isles in recent years (Ballykissangel, Hamish Macbeth and others come to mind). Like the above, this film uses a particularly beautiful rural landscape, in this case the humid and wild coast of Cornwall. Some viewers may find the enormous acceptance of cannabis a bit difficult, others might find it just a little too cute and sure. But it is a pleasant joy, sure.
