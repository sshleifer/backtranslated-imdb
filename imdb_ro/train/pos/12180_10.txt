In my opinion, "A Ridiculous thing" is a hilarious, spiritual, sexy, romantic and very beautiful tab, which boys will also enjoy. I thought Jason Lee and Julia Stiles conceived as an amazing bridegroom and her sexy enemy to be sexy. If you ask me, they lit the screen like a magic. You can also sense their chemistry with each other. Before finishing this, I would like to say that the shows were top, the direction was perfect, the production design was beautiful, the casting was perfect and the costumes were perfectly designed. In conclusion, for anyone who is a fan of Jason Lee or Julia Stiles, I recommend this movie. You are full of laughter and emotion, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, hit a friend and look at it.
