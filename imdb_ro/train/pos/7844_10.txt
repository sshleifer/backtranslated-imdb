I like this show very much, it's like reading a book and every chapter leaves you wanting more. You think about what will happen in the next episode and the struggle to maintain your friendship over the years. After each episode a sweet taste ends in the mouth, knowing that: One - the show was good, you can not wait for the next episode, and you really think about what's going on with your friends over the past twenty years. And two - the fact that the show was put on "hiatus" and we will not see the completion of the show in its entirety. Fox obviously do not know what they did, saying they are losing spectators in category 18 - 49, who obviously do not know what people want to see if they missed a good show like "Reunion". However, I have a question that I would like to raise. If it brought back the show and continued another season, how would it work from each episode to take place within one year, and the story is based on what's going on in the twenties? Your answers are welcome. Bring the Reunion back! Bring the Reunion back!
