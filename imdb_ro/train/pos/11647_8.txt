I can give you four reasons to watch this movie: <br /> <br /> 1. Four of the best filmmakers in the contemporary Mexican cinema. <br /> <br /> 2. Four good stories, linked in a big scheme. <br /> <br /> 3. A surprisingly good castration. <br /> <br /> 4. A bitter reflection about the biggest problems in this country (and more). Alejandro Gamboa opens this film with a good story in a comedy about the authority that practices extortion against ordinary people and who still awaits appreciation of his efforts. Then Antonio Serrano becomes more dramatic in the second piece, with a story heir of Italian neorealism, with an anecdote of the "Peter and the Wolf" type. , which seems more independent of this series even in context, Carlos Carrera tells us the story of a man who is in a wrong place at a wrong time. But after the recent Tlahuac coup and the tradition of this terrible problem in the state of Mexico, this story can not be upgraded. At the end, Fernando Sariñana returns to the dark humor of the "big end," in which he puts most of the characters in the past sequences in one of the best comedy pieces ever shot. Returning to the central scene in one of his previous films "Todo el poder", Sariñana gives the final lesson of the theme. By the way, give us the scene that steals the film with Anna Ciochetti making a short striptease. Once the movie is over, you will have a bit of a feeling that you have seen a good movie (and maybe enjoying it) with a very painful subject. They say that in Mexico people laugh at shame and this is the best example. This film is a testimony of how Mexicans have learned to live in the middle of a state of murder (and may have accepted it) between two fires: Criminals and so-called corrupt authorities. Even this film is a desire to think because almost all good people have been victims of the crime and have not received this innocent. If you had a scratch-free attack, then you're lucky. Meanwhile, do not miss the chance to see this highly recommended movie. And it's a beautiful life in Mexico ...
