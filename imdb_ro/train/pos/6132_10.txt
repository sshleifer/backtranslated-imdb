I'm glad that the users (since this date) who enjoyed this movie are now moving. I do not understand people who did not like this movie - they seemed to expect serious treatment (?!?!?)! Okay, how the hell can you take a killer snowman seriously? Those who made the film knew this was a stupid premise and did not try to deny it. Face-to-face delivery of the scenes really makes FUNNY! Yes, there are times when it looks like the low budget (like that explosion scene), but I think an expensive look would have taken it away from the fun of the movie! So if you like B-movies, and the grueling premise appeal to you, then you will definitely want "Jack Frost".
