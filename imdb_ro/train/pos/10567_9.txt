A miracle. One of the best musicians ever. The three Busby Berkely numbers that are finalizing the movie are spectacular, but what makes this movie so great is the incredibly passionate non-stop and the natural action of Cagney and Blondell. (Keeler is also wonderful even though she was not a great actress). There is a freshness in the movie you do not see today, much less in the 30-year films, although the plot, which involves creating prologues of movies, is quite dated.
