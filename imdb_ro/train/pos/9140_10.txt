I love this movie !!! Purple Rain came out the year I was born and I had the heart since I remember. The prince is so tight in this movie. I went to a special presentation of Purple Rain last night and it was like a concert, I was glad to see some real fans, because this movie is so undervalued, is really one of the greatest movies of all time . Music is untouchable. The film is about "The Kid," played by Prince, his family is dysfunctional, his band is the hottest act in the city and has eyes on Apollonia, an aspiring singer. There is no doubt why purple is my favorite color, I can thank "Kid" for that. So, if you have not seen this, then you have to listen. This is a classic - 4ever!
