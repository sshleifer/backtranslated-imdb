What can be said about Tara Fitzgerald's compelling performance? She is absolutely credible as Mrs. Graham's wounded, hardened, experienced, sharp and powerful, but not immune to Markham's passionate attention. Through all the nasty looks and temperament, with every perverse discernment in his eyes and facial expression, Toby Stephens is a master of his character. He is the force of passion and hope that will restore Helen's wounded spirit. Graves' Huntingdon is a perfect performance of the unrecoverable dishonest. However, despite all the things he has done, there is an incontestable human dignity in his refusal to play the hypocrite at the end; he is at least aware of his own failures and the way they have brought his ruin. Helen's attempt to save her soul - after she left her and took her child at a time when this was not known - is a triumph of hope, hope and faith in the value of every human life and soul, however much by mistake, the person can be. Markham's constancy can then be seen as her reward for her faith and moral morality. Though the ideas about morality so strongly depicted in Tenant seem to be outdated by today's standards, the story is impressed by the integrity, passion and conviction that still have an impact. The tenant is more credible than Wuthering Heights or even Jane Eyre; here is an adaptation that makes the justice of the novel. We highly recommend you to view it!
