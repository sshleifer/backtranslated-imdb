I remember being a kid when I first saw this movie, it was my first horror movie (maybe that's why I remember a few more parts). I do not remember too much about actors, nude scenes or other things, but I remember that a man has a blowing head with a grenade, a man dismembered over a tree and a man ruined by the truck and shot in the head :) (Todd Schaefer, Kenny Johnson and Kevin McParland). I remember the last scene when Jennifer McAllister repelled the killer's stomach to get the keys from the truck. It's a film that gives you a creep and is worth watching. But where do I find it? How can I download it?
