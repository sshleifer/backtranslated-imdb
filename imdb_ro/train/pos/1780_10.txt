My mom and I were going home from a trip to the northeast (mainly in Massachusetts) when we decided to take a little detour to attend a Boston film festival. Now, I do not know much about the movie, so I thought this could be a little educative. The first movie I saw was the ROMEO Division. Now, I do not know about you, but I thought it was great! I'm from Texas and where I come from, I do not see too many movies, so it was a nice surprise. My mother insisted she was too violent, but she said I did not know much about what she was saying, but that was a wonderful picture. I was shocked by the battle sequences that were great. I'm also a big fan when the good boys win, so I was thrilled when the ladies of Romeo killed all the bad guys. It was true glow. I'm not sure when it's released on video, but if you have the chance to check it out. I think you will be pleasantly surprised. A word for wise men, however, is violent and there are many strange words, so you do not want to let your children look. It's more for adults.
