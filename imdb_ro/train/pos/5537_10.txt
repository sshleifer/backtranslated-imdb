Maybe it was not as good as a whole, but the second episode, which was the first I'm saying, was so memorable, I still remember it today. I became a fan of Dick Francis. I would recommend it if you are interested in horse racing and mysteries. Cico's song, Chico Barnes, is more fun for those of us who have never been close to hearing the Bow of London Bells, but the stars are attractive and the shows have been exciting. Sid Halley was one of Francis's most interesting characters, and the show actually minimizes some of the difficulties with his hand. Interestingly, electronic hands of a type used in stories are apparently less functional to users than those invented after World War II.
