How can it be a movie that shows Curtis Mayfield's song bad? He can not! Groove Tube is a series of scatological black sketches that make fun of anything from 2001 until the Olympics. Heights (the Koko cock, light lubrication recipe) go beyond the minimum limits (a too long Deal), but even the lowest ones are funny. The best of them is Ken Shapiro's maniac dance on a manhattan sidewalk (Shapiro, not Nat King Cole singing Just You, Just Me). Definitely dated now, but at that time The Groove Tube was irresistible, bold, rude and hysterical. Ken Shapiro made this minor cult coup, then made the Christmas bomb seven years later, Modern Issues (although I liked it) and then, unfortunately, nothing (can play drums in a jazz group) I remain a positive energy outbreak, a film that, in my 26th anniversary of my initial view, still brings real joy to me!
