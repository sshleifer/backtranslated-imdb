I'm surprised that nobody thought of making a movie like this before. Horror is often the most effective when using an unpleasant real-life theme. And no one (except Steve Martin in The Little Shop of Horrors) likes to go to the dentist. Dental torture has been done before (see The Man Marathan, for example), but this brings terror to the suburbs. The plot spins around a dentist, Dr Alan Feinstone (Corbin Bernsen), who goes down in madness. Now, our dear doctor did not play with a full deck to start, but driven by jealousy and an obsessive-compulsive disorder, he began to create disaster over those around him. Doctors spiraling mental state are almost close to what we see in Michel Douglas's character in "Falling Down," but with a horror. <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Stuart Gordon and Brian Yuzna, a great stream. Also played a cop, Ken Foree is welcome. Now I think this movie would not work without the absolutely fantastic performance of Corbin Bernsen. While I really saw him in LA, I was defeated by his acting. Continuing The Dentist 2 is also worth watching, but slightly under the hair compared to the original. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> TTKK's bottom line - a fun movie with a few scenes that will make you stand,
