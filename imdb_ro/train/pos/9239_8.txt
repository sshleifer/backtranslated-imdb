As I said in my commentary on the first part: These two films are better than most science fiction fans confess. The second movie scenario is not moving as we do not see the civil civilization destroyed, but the consequences, thousands of refugees fleeing in small space boxes protected by a single powerful space ship. But when Battlestar Pegasus appears, the story gets warmer, wearing the battle back on Cylon planets. Okay, he's got a bit of Mad Max, because all he's fighting for is the fuel for their ships to travel to find the Far Earth, but it works for me. Science Fiction Entertainment is thrilling that includes true actors and decent special effects (even if they tend to repeat, say at least :-)). I would have liked a sequel to Starbuck and Apollo on board. Instead, we have a second sequel without characters that showed that the story worked earlier, especially because the characteristic characters were so well chosen ... So the fingers for the 1980 productions but the fingers for the two 1978 films .
