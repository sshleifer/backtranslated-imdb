I went to see Ashura in the 2005 Fantasia Festival Kickoff. Dude, that was a good shot. The director was supposed to be in Montreal for the Canadian premiere, but for health reasons, he's still in Japan ... oh, sir, I hope he's doing better and doing a lot of other movies. is quite simple but somewhat original ... the demons roam in Edo in Japan, and the Swordsmans called "Demon Wardens" kill them and fear the rebirth of Ashuria, the goddess of sleeping demons and supposed to be very loud. /> <br /> Drives us to Izumo ... a kind of elite swordsman called "Demon Slayer" and Jaku's girlfriend, who is the jealous vicious villain ... Does he seem boring? Well, now it's getting thicker ... Izumo took his retirement pension since he killed a young man on the "impression" that he was the demon, he never knew, but he killed her. Thus, Izumo continued with his life and recycled in the Kabuki Theater. On a pleasant night, Izumo sends a girl hiding on a bridge and changing her life and re-starting to kill the demons ... for the good cause, the cause of love ... and the damn ... the guy knows how to handle a sword and shoot a fun massacre. Izumo wears the movie as far as the game goes ... he's the total package ... he knows how to fight (he damn he knows), he's full of intelligence, he's smart and he has that stones. You never have to cry: "NO IZUMO, IT IS A TRAP" The guy already knows he has that sense. He is indeed the perfect hero. As for cinema, the aesthetics is quite interesting. It is by far the film that looks the most like a manga. It is a cream full of special effects and nothing at all costs will prevent this film from showing realistic ... it is quite amazing. A lot of colors an "unreal" photo other than this ... is pretty simple ... but, as I said, the main character bears the movie A must see, a glamorous hand full of charm
