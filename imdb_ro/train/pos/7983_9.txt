It's hard to melt this movie in many ways. Everything works very well here; casting, script, script, and cinema are the first. For the film lover, it is a moving, violent story of human love and redemption. For film critics, there are a lot of sharp techniques and technical merits. There are some tactical blunders and, as discussed in the boards of directors, the end is not realistic if one is rigorously formal with the CIA's training ground. However, I ended up being more moving because, rather than pursuing the pragmatic approach of the CIA agent, Creasy fundamentally appreciates the soul for the Ultimate without taking into account the consequences. Just like Jesus himself, Creasy becomes superhuman through his sacrifice, whether pragmatic or not. In any case, I have appreciated that Creasy renounces ordinary bourgeois morality and leaves the bad guys one by one in the methodical search for righteousness, resulting in redemption for both him and the innocent. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is very worthwhile to watch if you're really attracted to gender. An excellent soundtrack, excellent writing, impeccable casting and solid performance alongside the painting make this film a top 100 (or better) movie.
