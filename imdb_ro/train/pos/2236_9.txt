The thing I remember most about this film is that he was used for air on local KTLA (Ch. 5) during each Christmas season from the mid to late 70s, mainly due to the fact that the true story took place at or near Christmas Eve. It has always been a little disturbing to see the fuck that this girl is passing, being the only survivor of a plane crash in the Peruvian jungle. The graphic scene of this little girl pulling from her infected foot made a pretty big impression for this young spectator. It's not the type of Christmas joy I was used to seeing at that time. Definitely not a Rankin-Bass production.
