Reese Witherspooon first film. I liked. Plot and acting were top. You are emotionally involved with the characters. In my opinion, we must see. After watching this movie, you will see why Reese Witherspoon's career has been so successful. <br /> <br /> The other casting members also do a great job. <br /> <br /> The film runs extremely well. There is no boring moment in the whole picture. The length of Man on the Moon is accurate. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, I think this movie was great. I have seen it many times and enjoyed every view.
