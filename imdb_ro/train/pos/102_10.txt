I first heard about this movie 20 years ago when I was a kid in primary school (!) So I happened to go through the encyclopedia one day in the classroom and under the movie (or cinema, I remember), there were several photos for different movies from mainstream to experimental, and one of them displayed on the page was a moment for OffOn. He really intrigued me, since he was the most on the page (it was an eye-catching film with other elements superimposed on him). About 18 years later, the public library here lives to check out the entire set of 4 DVDs of "Treasures of American Film Archives" released by the National Film Conservation Foundation. So when I read the DVDs for the set, I was quite pleasantly surprised to see that OffOn was on one of the discs. After all these years, I could finally see the movie! After seeing it, it was not a bit like it was (it tends to be a more ecological film, not that it's a bad thing, but I expected it to have a more electronic aesthetics), but it was still an impressive film, IMHO, considering the techniques that Scott Bartlett used to make the film, including the film's own handy temptation and the use of video equipment for some of the movie scenes (shot from a video monitor) Do not get me wrong , the techniques used in this movie were pretty solid for 1972. That's why it's still one of my short / experimental favorite films and a creative inspiration for me ...
