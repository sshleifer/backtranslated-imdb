CAROL's trip is a pleasure to look for so many reasons. Actor Clara Lago is simply amazing for someone so young, and is one of those special actors who can tell a lot about facial expressions. Director Imanol Urbibe presents a tight and controlled film without a break in continuity, thus propelling the plot at a steady pace, with enough suspense to ask who will bring the scene of the nests. The script of Angel Garcia Roldan is a story that says best, which, apparently, if the major purpose of the films, after all. The plot is unpredictable, but the events that it reveals are completely logical. Perhaps the best feature of this film is to tell a story about Spanish civil war as it affects people. It was a major event of the 20th century, but no American knows anything about it. In fact, in 40 years of university education, I summed up about a student for a semester that he heard of him, even less with someone who said something comprehensive about him - and the number of children overwhelmed was merit teachers, to the enormous amount of censorship in American education. So in a way, this movie is a good way to start a study of that event, considering that when a thread is pulled, much of history is revealed. The appreciation of this film is therefore directly related to the amount of knowledge. To see this movie as another age-old film is full movie miss. The left elbow index looks at seven aspects of cinema - actors, production sets, character development, plot, dialogue, film continuity and art - on a scale of 10 for very good, 5 for medium and 1 for help needs. CALENDAR CALENDAR is above average in all cases except for dialogue that is rated as average. The average LEI for this movie is 9.3, raised to 10 when matched to the IMDb scale. I recommend this movie for all ages.
