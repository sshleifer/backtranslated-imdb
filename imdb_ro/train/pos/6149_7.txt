I just bought the restored version of a movie that I remember with a lot of childhood affection and it is certainly done for a curious afternoon entertainment. Bedknobs certainly has more meaning in its complete form, the removed scenes (especially those with McDowall) bind together the events together pretty well. What is a little disturbing is how the scenes have been remade. Clearly, the soundtrack of this record was lost or damaged, so a sparkling sparkle at Disney decided to take the scenes with a new dialogue. Which would have been great, except that half of the distribution was not about to do it (some of the better reasons than others) and everything has a rather low quality. Some of the lip syncs are pretty weak, and David Tomlinson's voice was called by a guy who does not seem like anything like David Tomlinson (I think there's a German clue in him). However, it is good to hear the full versions of all the songs (although "Step in the right direction" is still absent) and the magic moments in this film shine. And I challenge you not to chill when young Paul looks so innocent to Angela Lansbury and coo "but what about my button?"
