Full House is a wonderful sitcom that's about a father, Danny Tanner, whose wife just died in a car accident. Danny asks his brother, Jesse Katsopolis, and his best friend, Joey Gladstone, to raise his three daughters, Donna Jo 'DJ' Tanner, Stephanie Tanner and Michelle Tanner. This is my favorite show ever, and I can watch it all day. And something in the Full House always makes me laugh, and there are also sad parts. There is never a dull moment in the Full House. The main characteristics are played by Bob Saget (Danny Tanner), John Stamos (Jesse Katsopolis), Dave Coulier (Joey Gladstone), Candace Cameron (DJ Tanner), Jodie Sweetin (Stephanie Tanner) and Mary-Kate & Ashley Olsen Michelle Tanner.
