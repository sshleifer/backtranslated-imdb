I hired this movie and watched it 20 times before I took it back to the store. Bill Paxton hired a first-rate talent to make a good thriller with some interesting questions. The story is original and well written. Powers Booth and Paxton offer good performance. The story is narrated in an interesting way with both flashbacks 20 years ago, then spots now, alternating back and forth. This story style makes for a good thriller that can not become boring. Bill Paxton, please do more horror movies, you have the talent for it!
