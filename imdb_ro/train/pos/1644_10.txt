I saw the second half of this movie about a year ago and I was very pleased to finally find the DVD. Recently, I have seen several series of realms on PBS about ranching, etc. None of them came so close to telling the story as the movie does. Based on REAL reality, do not pull pockets, gloomy, happy, tragic and bright, this is a film to be shown to students or anyone interested in the early life of the border. Well actor from Rip Torn and Conchata Ferrell adds a well-done script. The opening credit states that it was made through funds provided through the National Humanist Fund. If this is the kind of product tax that can go, I'd be happy to see more. I recommend him very much and encourage people to tell a friend if you have seen and enjoyed the movie.
