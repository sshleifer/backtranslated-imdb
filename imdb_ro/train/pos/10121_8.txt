While it's not as wild and out as some of Takashi Miike's movies, it's a very good crime drama. <br /> <br /> The basic story is the story of a Japanese policeman with Chinese parents who are trying to take down a Chinese Mafia who comes and comes. The complication of things is that his younger brother acts as a lawyer for the bastard and his band. The film is actually much more complicated than the one with some complications that keep things interesting and distract things from central narrative pushing. This complication and the loss of road about an hour in the film that makes this film less than a great movie (it is very good). It is certainly worth seeing especially if you do not mind any frenetic rhythm. /> <br /> A warning word, violence when it happens is explosive and ugly. There are also semi-graphic images about homosexual sex. If this is not a cup of tea, take caution. 7 or 8 out of 10.
