A contemporary sophisticated fabula about the stress that works to weaken and, finally, the disappointment of marriage ties. The main narrative proposal comes from a homily spoken by a country priest, following the wedding vows of a young cosmopolitan couple in Milan. In it, the future evolution of marriage, which, over time, brings out the stress of modern life is defined. The "narrative" of this story in a story is that, for a marriage to do, both now and in the past, it was necessary for this relationship to be accompanied by family and friends. This film was a blockbuster relative to Italian domestic standards. It's a terrible shame that this movie is not available on either DVD or VHS.
