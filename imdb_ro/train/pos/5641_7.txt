Yes, the plot is predictable; yes, there are some plot holes; yes, it has a quality made for television; and yes, Britney Spears "wrote" the self-promotion book. But forget all this ... this movie is fun. Fun in a school after A special but fun way, though. Virginia Madsen as a mother is doing a good job ... so good I'm going to start watching her movies. He reminded me of Diane Lane for all the good reasons. The rest of the distribution also has a good job. If I were a distribution agent, I'd have been investigating some of these young actors. Production values ​​are above normal TV standards and music was very good ... better than a few big budget movies I've seen. If you have a German noir, this movie is not for you. If you want a safe, fun and undervalued movie, this is a good one. It's one that you can show your daughter for 10 years, but you can also enjoy it.
