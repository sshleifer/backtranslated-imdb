Which Bears Movie 2: A new generation is not a bad movie at all. In fact, I really like it. Yes, I admit that the dialogue is corny and the story is a bit short. But Darkheart, while very dark, is a pretty compelling form that changes the villain, and Hadley Kay did a great job expressing it. Speaking of the voice acting, it was great, nothing wrong with her. The animation is full of color, and some of the visual ones, especially at the beginning, were amazing. The songs and the score are great, especially Growing Up and Forever Young, the latter has always been my favorite personal of the two. The caretakers, who I like, are adorable, and the human children are well done. And the end is a real tearjerker. All in all, fun kiddie fun. 8/10 Bethany Cox
