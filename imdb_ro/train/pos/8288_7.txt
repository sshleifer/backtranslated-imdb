Continuing crime in a small town. In this case, a boy and his policeman reveal a sticky plot involving a Nazi criminal, a philanthropic witch and a family of surgeons and their helpers. Just as in the original, the viewer is treated to a pleasant little mystery, with distinct views and sounds of America before the war. Go see.
