A teenager, embarrassed by dogs, runs away from home. The abandoned Spaniard he finds helps them to change their minds. PARDON MY PUPS is a nice little movie, Shirley's Temple steals all of her scenes as the hero's lively sister.

Often neglected or neglected today, short subjects with one and two drums were useful to studios as important training themes for new or thriving talents both in the front and behind the room. The dynamics of creating a short subject of success was completely different from that of a lengthy film, something like writing a short story rather than a novel. Economics to produce in both budget and program terms and capable of portraying a wide range of materials, short subjects were the perfect completion of studio movies.
