I like this movie. The noir images combined with Spillane's character, without any sense, Mike Hammer works awesome to create a mood and feel rarely in the low budget detective films of the early fifties. Perhaps it is not the "Maltese Falcon", but this film makes a solid contribution to gender. Spillane is often criticized for alleged misogyny etc., but his "ladies" are far over their male counterparts in terms of cunning and intelligence. Old Mike Hammer, as well played by Biff Elliott, is blighted by the beauty of the mysterious psychiatrist he encounters when investigating the death of an army buddy. When penny finally drops his face is a picture. It is good to see that 50 years of censorship did not force filmmakers to omit the famous last line. A good quality classic budget.
