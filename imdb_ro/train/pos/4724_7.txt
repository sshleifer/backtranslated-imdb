Trapped: buried alive takes us to a resort that has just been opened and is soon to close. We start with a guy that blows the angles in order to avoid avalanches. In a way, that does not make sense. anyway, he's about to hit a particularly big one when he notices that the resort is open. Despite his best efforts, the superior authority tells him that the day is over. <br /> <br /> Soon, as everyone expects, an avalanche hit. Look, I will not reveal it all, all I can say is that it was a B movie designed for the family channel (which I just saw, and the fact that it had no commercials proving it's a B movie) anyway, it's a quite decent film, but it is partially unreal. <br /> <br /> The first time people are buried in ice and snow, they are buried. not just dusty. or, what about a CD for a screwdriver? it is not possible. and finally, what I can not quite emphasize, is that an explosion can not stop an avalanche, guaranteed. In addition, it deserves a rental or TV viewing, but does not hold. 7/10. The film is rated PG, but maybe it should have received something stronger. a boy almost loses his leg in an elevator, but his foot is cut around his ankle, a guy is roasted with electricity and diesel, and in the room of gravity the dead people settle around. <br /> <br />
