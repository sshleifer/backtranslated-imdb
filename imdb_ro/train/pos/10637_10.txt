Harem Suare is the best movie I've ever seen in 2000. Bravo Ferzan Ozpetek. Shot shot and portrayed with amazement, Harem Suare is a bold film about interracial romance, which is a taboo at Hollywood. Women of all shapes, sizes and color, populate the movie. Cut out of the outside world, women have fun with each other, telling stories of intrigue, rivalry and jealousy in their ranks.
