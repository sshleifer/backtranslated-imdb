I've watched this episode more often than any other TFTC episode, it's nice. And it's pretty scary, but it's all fun. A woman kills her second husband but faces a problem when a maniac gets out in a Christmas costume Santa Claus decides to pay her and her little girl is visiting at that time. Mary Traynor, who seems to me to remember from SNL or another TV comedy, is the evil wife, and Larry Drake plays the madman in dingy Santa outfit. I forgot that Santa has been played by Drake over the years. Santa is an unstoppable and quite frightening force. Perhaps you can guess how Santa finally arrives in the house. The episode is played for laugh, but it can be quite intense.
