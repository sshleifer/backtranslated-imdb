There are no people like Show People Marion Davies (Peggy Pepper) and William Haines (Billy Boone). My introduction to Mrs. Davies was a "clip" of this film; delightful, in which she saves a scarf to discover different emotions. My introduction to Mr. Haines was watching this movie now; however, it is possible to see it in a less memorable role. Haines makes an incredible impression when Davies joins a commissioner's table - throwing the hat in the ring with some lovely bits at the table. Indeed, Haines and Davies offer comic shows. The story begins with the daughter of Dell Henderson (Colonel Pepper) who leads Davies' daughter in Hollywood, will surely become Tinseltown's newest sensation. Indeed, Davies and Haines already arrived as comedy stars. But, Davies wants to become a real dragon queen. Davies leaves Haines and joins the partnership with Paul Ralli. But audiences prefer Davies to more comic roles; maybe director Vidor offers an art case that imitates life? <br /> <br /> Complete high-end movie location at Hollywood, both on set, and off. Completely large "cameo"; at the table, Davies is between Douglas Fairbanks and William S. Hart. The best "bit" player, however, is Charlie Chaplin, who has enough nerves to ask Davies for her autograph! While the cams are entertaining, these and episodic sequences help show people become less important and more important historical document. <br /> <br /> ******** Show People (11/11/28) King Vidor ~ Marion Davies, William Haines, Dell Henderson
