Dripping with symbolism and filled with wonderful cinema, Extase is much more than the erotic drama we have all come to expect. This is an almost silent movie, with what dialogue exists in German and much German simplified. Perhaps the filmmakers intended the film to reach the largest possible European audience, because anyone with a high school level can easily give up on subtitles. The story is of little importance, however, the film follows a cinematic level, not narrative. The symbols of fecundity and the power of nature overwhelm human characters - there are even scenes in which flowers hide the face of the supposed star Hedy Lamarr - and there are moments here that will remind viewers of the works Dreyer, Vertov and Riefenstahl. If the film has a message to say, I think it is a political one: the bourgeois man is shy and impotent; man of the working class is a happy and productive creature; and the woman is the creator, intended to be unfulfilled until she wore a baby. This mix of Soviet socialist realism and national-socialist dogma does not overwhelm the film by any means - it is a beauty to watch from the beginning to the end - but it places it in a very distinctive artistic age. And, yes, Hedy pulls out his set.
