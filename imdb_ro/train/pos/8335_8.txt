While the brilliant chemistry between Ryan and Robbins is a good reason to see this film, additional casting (including Matthau, Fry, Shalub, Durning and the hilarious trio by Jacobi, Saks and Maher) is an extra addition. Matthau shines like Einstein, Fry is perfect as Ryan's clinical fianc√©e, and Shalub's line of Einstein's gonads is, as noted, one of the most important moments of the movie. The speech that Robbins presents in his first public appearance is pure poetry. Kudos for writers to manipulate this foam with spirit and lightness. I also thought Keene Curtis was wonderful as Eisenhower. This could be considered a chicken movie, but I think everyone will take a shot of it. Eight very strong points.
