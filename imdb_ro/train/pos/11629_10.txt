Red Eye is a thrilling film by Freddy Kreuger's creator, Wes Craven. Wes Craven describes the story of a regular hotel worker, Lisa. After taking part in her grandmother's funeral, she decides to take her red-eyed flight. While waiting, she meets this man named Jack Rippner (how is this fffrreeaakkyy?) And they kind of make friends. Ironically, they both sit side by side on this plane. Then, horror begins. This movie is thrilling for the weak, who do not like thrilling / horror movies, to say that they may be able to touch their pants. This is an excellent example of bone production. Wes Craven did a good job with this movie. She chose the right actors, like Rachel McAdams, a smart, sexy girl who knows what she does and she is cautious when acting in a movie. Cillian Murphy, the fearsome and frightening actor who can cool your bones at his amazing act of being the evil character in this movie, and his face can really widen your eyes. Wes Craven did a great job and I hope he does more movies like this one.
