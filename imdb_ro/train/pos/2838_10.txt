New York I Love You is full of love and power. Not everyone, but it's a beautiful movie. Has Shia LaBeouf (seen in Transformers, Disturbia, Charlies Angels, I Robot, Indiana Jones and many more), Maggie Q, Kevin Bacon, Blake Lively, Natalie Portman and more. With a cast of stars, this movie is undoubtedly brilliant. From many top executives around the world, it fails to impress. Diversity from story to story is creative and unique. It's safe to say that New York I Love You is a popcorn movie and should be watched on a BIG TV! This time, trust the IMDb rating, because it's an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> I look forward to Shanghai I love you in 2010. Watch NY ILY, you will not be disappointed.
