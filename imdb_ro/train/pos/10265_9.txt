Unique film about a confused woman (Lindsay Crouse) who gets involved with a male cone. Joe Mantegna gives an Oscar-like show as the thinnest in the group. Absolutely delightful the first hour, as Mantegna shows to Crouse the "ropes" of his con. The story unfolds a bit later, but it still represents a unique portrait of an innocent who was caught in a dark world. It certainly deserves a shot.
