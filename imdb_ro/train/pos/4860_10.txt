A girl in distress is a delight due to the great songs by Gershwin, Fred Astaire, Joan Fontaine, and a great supporting piece led by Gracie Allen and George Burns. Typically, a promising plot for an Astaire film has it as an American dance star in England, with Burns as a publicist and Allen secretary. They conceive a story about being a hero of love with women who have been victims to her left and right. He enters Fontaine who is held captive in her castle by a dominant aunt and a docile father. Silhouette. <br /> <br /> Great songs include Foggy Day, things look up, a nice job if you can get it and can not be overwhelmed anymore. Fontaine does not sing, but makes a short (and decent) number with Astaire. Surprisingly good in the numerous Astaire dance numbers are Burns and Allen, including an entertaining and fun amusement through a fun park. Also in the cast are Reginald Gardiner, Constance Collier, Montagu Love, Harry Watson as Albert), Ray Noble and my favorite - Jan Duggan as a Madrigal singer. Jan Duggan is in the middle of the swoony trio, which plays Nice Work if you can get it. Her facial expressions are hilarious. She was also a theft in the W.C. Field comedy, The Old Fashioned Way, starring Cleopatra Pepperday. Many abuses have gathered on this film because of the absence of Ginger Rogers, which, as has been noticed elsewhere, would have been hidden. The TCM host notes that Ruby Keeler and Jessie Matthews have been considered. Oops. Two more disasters. Fontaine is good for Alyce, and the dynamics allow the musical numbers to belong to Astaire, with ample comic amusement by Burns and Allen. The fun movie, great songs, good distribution and Jan Duggan in a rare point!
