I would not have known about this film if not for the Oscar nomination for the best animated film. Fortunately, it happened that I was able to watch this animated treasure. The story relates to the child Brendan who was the nephew of the imposing and overprotective abbot of Kells. The main concern of the abbot is to build a wall to protect Kells from attacking Vikings. One day, Aiden, the famous Iona illustrator, sought refuge. Aiden opens Brendan's eyes for the art of illustration and for attracting the outside world. Along the way, Brendan became friends with the white Aisling spirits, trying to recover an old priceless crystal for the meticulous art of the book's illustration. "Kell's Secret" is unlike most animations released these days. It is a kind of throwing back because the illustrations are made in strict geometric lines and project without too much care of realism, just as much as symbolism. The movements of these lines recall the simplistic but fluid animation style used at the beginning of the "Kung Fu Panda" sequence. However, the magnificent use of color is the main source of astonishment for the public. The tomatoes used in the Viking invasion sequence are quite amazed. <br /> <br /> Try to catch this quiet jewel of a movie. It's a welcome comeback from all the senseless bombs of current animated fares, like "Monsters vs. Aliens," and so on. The brilliant Celtic score is effective in evoking the feeling of fantasy that embraces the film. Okay, the story could be a bit superficial and ending a little desiring. I would like to find out more about the book that Brendan and Aiden worked on. But the clear star of this film is clearly its amazing work of stylized art, which is said to be based on the artwork of Kell's real book.
