Was the script more suitable for a 30-minute sitcom? Yes, but they still make it work! I thought the actors did a fantastic job with an otherwise bland script, especially Jack Black and Christopher Walken. Most people on the board seem to really hate this movie. I personally can not see how it could be, but Envy is just one of those movies that you love or hate. Like Napoleon Dynamite and every movie Leslie Neilsen ever did. Or do you think it's one of the worst movies ever made or one of the funniest. Do not avoid this movie because of reviews. Look at her and see if you are one of those you love! If you do, I guarantee you it's worth your money. If you do not like ... well, now you know.
