I just saw this movie last night at the Toronto Film Festival where it was playing under the Madness Madness section. To tell you the truth, the only reason I made this movie was that she shared her name with Radiohead and also because my friend bought the tickets so I did not have a choice: - I was waiting to be something like "laughter silence," but it turned out to be a semi-gore film. Someone already mentioned that none of the characters is pleasant, and that it is absolutely correct. I really did not care less if Potente's character took her inside Creep. I have been rooted for homeless people to be alive with the character of Potente, just getting her desserts. Christopher Smith has certainly done a great job with the visual aspect of the film. However, the story is pretty poor, but again, the whole point of the movie was to scare you and you did it quite efficiently. The score obtained by a band in Bristol, called The Insects, was top. That, more than anything else, really scared me stupidly. The director was a very decent guy and was quite fun during the question and answer session. I really hope she will make more good movies in the future. This is strictly for sex fans, but I would recommend non-fans to try it anyway. It was a fun walk.
