After I saw the terrible, terrible and terrible BATMAN: DEAD END, I knew I had to see this as soon as I heard about it. By tapping the game to see the trailer, I thought I was for another of what seemed like another bad movie creator trying to bring a new depth to an existing character. But he was met with a great trailer for a movie that unfortunately does not exist, as I would love to see a finished film, even if it was only 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> for BATMAN: DEAD END and then some. I look forward to the next short!
