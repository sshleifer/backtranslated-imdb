I have a lot of time for all Columbo movies, but especially it was extremely well written and the solution was very effective at the end. However, my main memory of this is the opening of a scene in the middle of the movie, between Columbo and the killer (I apologize if I did not remember every detail exactly). It is the most striking image of Columbo that we have seen: the vision is from within the darkness of the closet in which the victim was killed and in the outside room that is lit by the light of the day. Columbo stands in a high chair, facing the door (and us), contemplating the closet and almost in the silhouette of the contrast in the light. Nothing sounds. The camera slowly moves away from the room and heads toward him. He is deep in meditation, gently swirling on a cigarette, spinning cigarette smoke that turns slowly upward, as he thinks. Then the dialogue starts. Superb.
