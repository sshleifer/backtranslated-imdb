I saw this movie in 1984, we started watching "This Is Spinal Tap" and after 5 minutes we were ready to fall asleep. So we went instead to see this movie. If you have any theory of conspiracy in your head, you will want to follow it. <br /> <br /> The question you have to ask when watching this movie is: Do you think the government would be able to do this? (In my opinion there is no doubt they could) But I do not want to give too much information that this is a spoiler and I think you should watch the movie for you. <br /> <br /> But just to tell you, we're still talking about this movie 20 years later and trying to explain it to people is not the easiest thing to do in the world.
