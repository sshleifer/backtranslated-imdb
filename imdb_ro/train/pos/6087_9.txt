I saw this movie in the first two weeks of it (I do not remember exactly when.) I thought it was good for a movie by Ben Stiller. This movie is not for a person without a good sense of humor. Like most of Ben Stiller's jokes, you have to think about them. Or as I said you have a sense of humor. Of a few people on this site I saw that people had nothing good to say about it and did not get a very good note But I would have given it bigger This movie, I thought, was very good and should have to get a better rating. Maybe it's not a movie for you. I only give you the opinion of another person.
