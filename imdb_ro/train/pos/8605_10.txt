Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy play in this "modern" musical that demonstrates MacDonald's comic skills. The surreal music of the 1940s seems to have fun with the 40-year-old fashion, just as they were in the current vogue. Costumes and eye sets (yes B & W) adds the surreal, dream-like quality of the entire movie. Some good songs animate the movie, with "Twinkle in Your Eye" a total attraction, including a number of fun jitterbug between MacDonald and Binnie Barnes. Also in the HUGE cast are Edward Everett Horton, Reginal Owen, Mona Maris, Douglas Dumbrille and Anne Jeffreys. Also, to be seen in the large parts of the bits are Esther Dale, Almira Sessions, Grace Hayle, Gertrude Hoffman, Rafaela Ottiano, Odette Myrtile, Cecil Cunningham and many others. Fun and beautiful to see the wonderful MacDonald in her jitterbug / vamp routines. He could do everything.
