The movie transported everyone back to October 20, 1944, where we seemed to be part of the great Philippines "I Shall Return" landing scene? Was it on that bank of Leyte, where General MacArthur conquered his fame? <br /> <br /> Above all, did Gregory Peck triumph in portraying the great general? Is the step, the shoulder set, the intensity? Is that what both men have in common: intensity, total absorption, devotion? With MacArthur was for the military? With Peck was for the challenge to act ?? An Oscar winner for "To Kill a Mockinbird," nominated for the Oscar for "Keys to the Kingdom," "The Yearling," "Gentleman's Agreement," and "Twelve O'Clock High", amnesty for a crusader journalist; from a troubled gunman to an obsessed attorney; from biblical David to Captain Horatio Hornblower? Has he brought all his unique perspective, character, sincerity, warmth and love, and especially his humor? <br /> <br /> There is a scene where "MacArthur" sits on deck with "Philippine President". We can hear the dialogue: "General, I hope the water is not too deep," says "the president," "because my people will learn that I can not swim." Then comes Peck's voice: "And my men will find I can not walk on the water!" As "MacArthur," Peck once again justified his reputation as a giant in the cinema industry? Through him we felt the emotions of MacArthur: we met our anger, happiness and understood the relationship with his whole family.
