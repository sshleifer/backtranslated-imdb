Because of all the negative reviews of this movie, I almost did not see it. However, I was pleasantly surprised that it was a pretty horror movie. The actor was not great - apart from the wonderful Alice Krige - but some of the dialogues ("Just Take Lunch") were funny. Overall, Stephen King's effort above average, 7/10.
