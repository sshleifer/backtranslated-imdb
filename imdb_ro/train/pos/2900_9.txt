It would be an American movie that I would say 7: I saw this before. Being an Argentine film, and I being Argentinian, I would like to give her a 10, because it's the kind of quality I was hoping for - more than I expected - for. The superb quality is amazing, taking into account all the limitations imposed by the Third World ... I can not forget the scene when Díaz forces Silverstein's fiance to confess - you know what I mean if you saw the movie. I think this is the key moment of the movie, it can not be surprising but original. Then the real action begins. Before watching a movie, I always try to collect some previous information. Being one of the most important, satyric, commercial, pressing on "Play" and making a suspension of reality and logic, I would say the best way to enjoy movies like this. It is impossible to talk about the plausibility of the whole plot, yet it is credible in a certain way. As far as I'm concerned, I could not stop laughing about every joke and commentary - "a little sauce ..." put in the mouth of Díaz, the biggest one. I'm tired of seeing "I know that he is a gorgeous actor, but sometimes I feel his roles are unfairly opposed to the rest, Luis Luque's role in this case. I do not like Argentine television so I have not seen it too much from Luque, but it's pretty obvious he's an excellent performer. "His physical role, his eyes, his attitude to content in this movie made me fall in love with his performance, I think his role should be upgraded, just to show how big he can be, I do not know if Szifrón intends to make a follow-up or not, and I know he will not do it if it follows the rule that "the other two sides have never been good," so if I will certainly see it. And I hope that in the future I will keep a con the opportunity to offer Peretti's counterparts the same chances to develop their roles. Great movie, great shows and many laughs!
