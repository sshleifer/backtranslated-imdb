Why is that rating so low? I really do not understand ... Is it because of bad actors? The bad dialogue? Well, who cares about these things in low-budget horror films? Really, the act and the dialogue are not important in these movies. People who hate films only because of bad act and bad dialogue should not be allowed to rate low-budget films. These films should not be taken seriously. Period. Anyway, it's time to talk about the movie, right? Well, I liked it! I bought it because I was expecting a gorefest, but it's not a gorefest and the gore is bad enough (most of the times I'm just the courage of the animal placed on the actors' body and that's blades) but I did not really cares because the movie is hilarious! The characters are hilarious, the act is hilarious (bad action is a good thing in low-budget horror films), the dialogue is hilarious (bad dialogue is a good thing in low-budget horror movies), zombie rapper with huge dick is funny , the demon-flying child is hilarious and can go on but I do not mean too much ... But I have to mention that there is a scene in which a girl masturbates a doll sex like in lol life! Oh, and the zombie rapist falls in love with the sexual doll! The best lines in the movie: Detective Manifiers: * Coughing the Coke * Detective Sloane: What * Beep * Do, Manners? What the hell did you shake? What the hell is that? Detective Manners: There's nothing human, it's ... Ehh ... Cold doctor ... Detective Mania: * Injecting heroin into his arm * Detective Sloane: What are you doing * beep, Maniere? Are you crazy? Detective Manners: The Cold Doctor. Detective Mania: * Repeats a random guy in the face * Detective Sloane: What the hell's going on, Manners? What are you doing? Detective Mania: This maniac was full of demons and then began to crush his head on the rock! He started crushing his head on the rock! I think it's on PCP or something! LOL!
