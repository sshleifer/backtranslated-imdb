I really liked this movie, yes, I know it was pretty loaded, there is no way the Shelby car has managed to stay on the road, as well as the 540i with all that is controlling traction and other gizmos, but apart from the fact that the entire movie was well put together. The Cage was excellent as usual, and the rest of the cast was also good enough, except for Brit Bad Guy, it was a bit too "too", do not you think? Anyway, a great movie, great cars and great action. I assured myself that my car was blocked and alarmed in my remotely commissioned garage that night. :)
