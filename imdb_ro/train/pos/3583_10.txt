This was a great movie, but it had the worst ending I've ever seen! The actors were wonderful and presented a wonderful talent. The whole story was twisted and unexpected, which made what made fun. As good as the movie, the whole movie is judged to the end, which was terrible! Perhaps a continuation could eliminate this bad end.
