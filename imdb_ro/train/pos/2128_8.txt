I just looked at Turner Classic last night for the first time I saw it and I liked it. I like a lot of older movies, especially because of the lack of dirty language and excessive violence, nudity and sex in most of today's films. I also think that much has been done in many (but not all) cases. Jimmy Stewart is a special favorite of mine. I thought this movie was really fun to watch, and I liked it very well. If you feel the same about older movies, I do not think you can be wrong with this. I think "You've got mail" is a remake (even if a bit different and also a very nice movie) in this movie. For a relaxing evening with a movie, do not be ashamed if your children or anyone who comes into your viewing, get it, or catch it on one of the classic movie channels.
