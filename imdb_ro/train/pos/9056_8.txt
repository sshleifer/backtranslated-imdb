So I compromised. It was a pretty charming movie, I liked the art direction (it felt more "real" than most children's films) and the costumes were not too cute. The child's actors were not bad to look (adult performance tends towards cheese). It was great that they showed how an aggrieved child is violating others, as well as children who rise to aggression. I do not know how many adults would like to see this for themselves, but it is a great movie to take a baby to. And since "Barnyard" was apparently attended by 100 children at the same time, I am very pleased that I chose a poor presentation of "worms".
