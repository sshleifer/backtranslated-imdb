I did not research the movie before my first view because it was part of a set of Welles boxes I bought recently. A set of boxing I got first because I wanted to have a man for all seasons and reevaluate and Waterloo. So I put Orson and Rita as a player and I'm treated to class and confusion equally. On the surface, the story seemed simple, the man meets a gorgeous woman and saves her from a couple of criminals, they immediately click and the man gets a job offer on a cruise with his famous wife and lawyer, and then ... .......... well becomes the mystery of the murder of the planned devil and of many shenanigans. Michael O'Hara (Orson Welles) himself does not really know what's going on, he's just as confused as the spectator, and it's great to watch when he's pulled all over by almost everyone in the movie. Obviously, having hearts drawn by a fatal female of such beauty as Elsa Bannister (Rita Hayworth) has her moments, but you only know that things will go in the form of pears. <br /> <br /> So many wonderful things in the movie, it has a Welles visual style throughout it, see a scene in a wonderful aquarium, and the sequences ending in a fun house are majestic on eyes. The narrative at O'Hara moves with joy on its own and we get a slight relief from a court case with Everett Sloane, which greatly ignites the trial. Still, the movie is a weirdness and in fact it's an unpleasant viewing experience, because (as I had to find out after) the studio bosses cut the film for almost an hour and that not only did the viewer frustrate us, it was unfair on Welles' vision. I'm sure an original original cut of this movie would have been praised and venerated by the thick, so it's a very good and exciting film, one that unfortunately only shows greatness, but it remains a thrilling film that I " I'm glad to have my own revision. 8.5 / 10
