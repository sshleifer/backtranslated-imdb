Chameleon's performance by Kurt Russell, coupled with John Carpenter's flawless film, makes this one of the best ever biopic bios ever released. He also claims: the emotional foundation is strong enough that it will never aged; Carpenter has retained for posterity the power and end to life of the unique king of Rock and Roll. (I was a Elvis frontier fan for most of my life, but it was not until I saw this motion blow motion film that I looked BEYOND the image in the man himself. It was quite a revelation.) ELVIS remains one of the top ten films made for television of all time.
