For me A matter of life and death is just that - simply the best movie ever made. From the beginning to the end the class is destroyed. It is stimulating, provocative, the mirror of the post-war world and the relationships between peoples. Cinema is simply amazing, and the effect of monochrome mixing and Technicolor is to accentuate the world's different works without problems. The characters and the development of the plots are almost perfect and the attention paid to details promotes an entirely credible fantasy. No matter how many times I watch the movie - and I've seen it a lot - never touches me. It makes me smile, makes me laugh, makes me think, makes me cry. She is just as bad today as in 1946. If I had been allowed a single film to keep and look again A matter of life and death would be that movie.
