This is really one of the best love movies I've ever seen. Appeared closely to none other than "Before Sunset", which is technically not another film, because it's about the same two people and the same story. This is "love" in the real world. Okay, that's only if most people are as intelligent and eloquent as the movie directors. Reading the other reviews, I like to know how many other people are crazy about dialogue-based dialogue. And that's what he's doing so "Before sunrise" so good. Dialogue is perfect. It's so real, so exciting and funny. It's no surprise that Jesse and Celine fall in love, for you have fallen in love with them at the same time. My favorite scene is in the cafe, where they claim that their best friends sound, and others claim to be the best friends. It's perfect. It brings you back just the moment you fell in love for the first time in your life. I have to say that if you have a choice, do not forget "Before sunrise" before looking "Before Sunset" ". If, like me, you first saw "Sunset," it's hard to shake the feeling of pity and sadness for the two young lovers throughout the show. Again, the biggest romantic film in my books. Wonderful action, excellent script and beautiful locations. Young love, to the best.
