I like when I'm actually doing a sports story. So many in the past have been so hokey was embarrassing to look. Not this one. It's just a really enjoyable movie, a type of old-fashioned story and based on a real life type that did exactly what Dennis Quaid did in this movie. He plays a high school coach who is about to try, late in his athletic life, to become a professional baseball pitcher. Eventually, he achieves his goal of reaching the Leagues, even if it was a very short period of time. All the characters here are good people, like the ones they roots, from Quaid to the high school team players, to his little boy (Angus T. Jones, now somewhat a star on television.) Quaid is credible in playing Jim Morris because, unlike the past actors in sports movies, he knows how to throw a baseball. He looks like a pitcher, a guy who could pull him 90 kilometers an hour. And most of this movie is true, as the real-life pitcher confesses in one of the DVD's. So, if you're looking for a beautiful, inspired movie, you can not be wrong with that.
