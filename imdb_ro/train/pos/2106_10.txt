Would it be more romantic comedies made as immersed as this one? I never thought anything as banal as the simple sale of a music box to let me take my breath with excitement. Margaret Sullavan makes a wonderful sales woman, and she and James Stewart have always brought the best things to each other. This movie is what I think is Frank Morgan's best-selling show, and with "The Wizard of Oz" and "Tortilla Flat" under his belt, that says a lot. The way he finds a Christmas Dinner partner left me joyfully. Director Ernst Lubitsch believed that "Trouble In Paradise" is his favorite, but he must certainly consider it a triumph. With some of the most engaging dialogue the American dialogue in the 1930s has to offer.
