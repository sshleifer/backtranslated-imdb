The story of a "woman from nowhere" is quite simple and well adapted even from an Eastwood Spaghetti Western: A mysterious stranger enters a legless city led by a foot and begins to shoot the place. Even opening credits and music that spaghetti feel: Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone would be proud. Interestingly, the stranger is a beautiful woman (!), Saki (Ryoko Yonekura) on a Harley, and the location is in a city somewhere in Japan. In this action there is a considerable amount of garbage, some of them good, some predictable and some other hockey spots, but it's a lot of fun. Ryoko deals with her weapons with credibility and aplomb, and gives her the bullies. It was not a big challenge for her, because it was a physical challenge, but she managed things very well. She shows her acting skills much more like Otsu in the NHK drama, "Musashi". You would recommend the movie if you are a Ryoko Yonekura fan (whom we adore) and / or "girls with weapons", a fan of the film and opposes repeated viewing. For me, there is something eminently and inexplicably appealing to "girls with weapons" such as "La Femme Nikita" and "The Long Kiss Goodnight." And have a wonderful gala as Ryoko in which she plays and she's just a lot of cherries on the cake.
