this was one of the most exciting movies I've ever seen. I was about 12 years old when I watched them for the first time and whenever it's on TV and my eyes are glued to her. action and plot are amazing. seems so real to reality and touches so many controversial topics. I recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in a good drama.
