The soldier can not have academic action or Lucas special effects, but he certainly does it for me. I'm not going to tell you what it's about, I'm sure you've already read the summary. This is a fantasy action movie / fantasy film condemned. Kurt Russell does not say much, he usually has a strange look or drones on his face, but it suits the character. There are scenes of action and extraordinary fights; some of the scenes are unrealistic, but Hollywood believes the land should escape normal life. I did not see Soldier 2, but this is one of my favorites. I'm fortunate enough to have a wife who shoots typical movies; we both love this movie and we recommend it to anyone who prefers harsh movies or SF movies.
