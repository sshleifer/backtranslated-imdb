"The Shop around the Corner" is one of Ernst Lubitsch's great films. In addition to the talents of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, it is full of an amazing adventure of top actors such as Frank Morgan and Felix Bressart. Those are characters that Hollywood no longer use. In fact, the film itself is the kind of film Hollywood does not do. (Producers of "You've Got Mail" claim that their movie is a remake, but this is nothing more than a lot of self-inflated praise.) Anyway, if you have a affection for romantic comedies in the 1940s, you'll find "The Magazine around the corner "will be just great. Just as well with repeated views. Enjoy!
