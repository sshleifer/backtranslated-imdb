This is a nice movie, even if the premise is bad. It was a pleasure to blame. Meg Ryan seems to be able to take roles in this type of movie (another example is Joe vs. Volcano). This is what makes it a star, in part. Walter Matthau, of course, had this ability, too, and really enrolled in a role, making Einstein funny, in good faith. I suppose you could say that both are good in portraying the characters of love, although enjoyable in different ways (young women fond of sweet curmudgeon).
