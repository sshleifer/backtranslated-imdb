Maybe it's me and my perverted ways or the fact that I tend to have a very sick mind, but I rented this movie at random on a very weird night, and to my great surprise I liked it. <br /> <br /> Yes, I read the synopsis behind the DVD box and read that it was forbidden for 25 years and realized that I was ready for whatever it would offer. I was clearly deceived after seeing ... well ... everything to cut a long short story. I see why it was banned, not just for such explicit sexual scenes, but for beast. <br /> <br /> Of course, as it is based freely on the classic fairy tale of Beauty and the Beast, my personal favorite, tells the story of a girl's sexual awakening in a dream about a duchess pursued by a beast what would have been like you, with an enormous erection and a substantial amount of ejaculation. Of course, the beast gets what she wants and the Duchess decides she likes and continues to trick the woods. <br /> <br /> But that's not all. I'm much more! <br /> <br /> Not only do we have the opportunity to see interspecific sex, but there are ugly horses, the babysitter who collapses and gets dirty with the slave when he does not fill the bed to bring ... satisfaction and the dream girl with masturbation with rose petals. <br /> <br /> Creative and enjoyable, but it took a while for my father to talk to me again after watching him after I slept ... I was 15. The words of counseling for watching of this movie: make sure you are the only one who knows you have and see it with the curtains closed. It may be fun, but I doubt there are other porn movies like this one.
