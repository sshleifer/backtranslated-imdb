This movie is a jewel because it moves with a soft but firm resolution. I warn the audience that although it is billed as a Corporate Spy thriller and that Ms. Liu is there, it moves in a smart, rhythmic fashion. It's not about explosions, car chases or flying bullets. You have to be patient and, instead, write down the details here. It's sedated, because that's the main character. The visitor must see him and think that this story is going on. I will not give spoilers - because that destroys the point of view. The plot is what you read from the other posts: an average white collar guy looking for change and adventure signing for a corporate espionage mission. Go somewhere and register secretly and forward inside the data. <br /> <br /> Get it from there. This film begins in a surreal walk - with a background of corporate disappointment that surrounds essential, essential, suburban paranoia. <br /> <br /> Then it starts to accelerate. <br /> <br /> Action on all sides is superb - and yes, some of the acts are character characters. But they all fit, and they have fun. And the bright rhyme of the piano in the background is just perfect, as the soft, soft and sinister theme: Everything is not right at first. And at the end: Everything is not what it looks like. /> <br /> Enjoy the light and let him look at this ... and raise the sound: This movie wants you to listen.
