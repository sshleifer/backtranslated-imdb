I can not agree with any comments. The first time I saw the film on a TV channel in the UK, it was presented as an indie film and if you take the movie at that angle, I think it's a totally different matter. I could not believe what I was seeing and connected immediately. The plot can be as bad as a JS show (meaning there is no plot), but the act is bad, it's hilarious and it's all in an incredible garbage movie. <br /> <br /> She says so much about America than about a Bully or a Ken Park without the prospect of dramas but gives a look at American society and more specifically on what afternoon viewers in America (and I think there are a lot of them!) are interested. After all, there are neighbors we talk about, do not we? 100% fun!
