This is a very beautiful movie. Color photography is beautiful because it shows the luxury of the Metropolitan Opera in brilliant colors. Other indoor scenes from different houses, etc. are just as bright. As far as music is concerned, what can be said, apart from the fact that Lanza's voice was on the verge of singing so many of the most famous and beloved areas of the world. The wonderful Dorothy Kirsten is also a joy, as her soprano voice blends with Lanza's, in delightful harmony. Of course, Hollywood took his usual freedoms with Caruso's life story. There are few precious things in the story line that relate to real events. For example, the deeds of his death are entirely fabricated and have no connection with the truth. There are some very good websites that tell Caruso's true story and contain more pictures of him. These websites can be located using any good search engine. There are also some books about his life history. But the fictional story line does nothing to mark this beautiful movie. Lanza's, Kirsten's and choir's voices are the real stars of this film. Enjoy, I know I did.
