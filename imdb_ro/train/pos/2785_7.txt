"Bend It Like Beckham" reminds me of the best of the 80 teeny-bopper movies directed by John Hughes. Everything takes place in a world of bubble gum, where everyone is appealing, there are some easily resolved conflicts, which occasionally depart from the happiest procedures, and enormous amounts of plot are summed up by the set ups for bouncy pop songs. Nothing wrong with that, though. "Bend It Like Beckham" is an absolute treatment from the beginning to the end. My wife and I found ourselves fully won by the joy of cornball, even if we enjoyed it and, in the end, as embarrassing as it is to admit, we applauded (and I saw this by the way, in our living room, not in a theater). Watch this movie and enjoy yourself. <br /> <br /> Grade: B +
