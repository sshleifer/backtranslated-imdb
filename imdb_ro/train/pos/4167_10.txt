The devil's dog: Hound of Hell is a very good movie. He has a good acting, including Richard Crenna and R.G. Armstrong. Music is frightening and gives that diabolical evil! I liked the effects on the dog and I think the creature itself looked very cool with his horns, beats like a part on his throat and acted really viscous! have not seen The Devil Dog: Hound of Hell before and are able to find and buy this movie rarely, then they do it because it is a good movie and I do not think you will be disappointed!
