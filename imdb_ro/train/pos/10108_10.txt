An absolute classic! The direction is impeccable, the act is just superb. Words do not fit into this great work. The most definitive film on the Mumbai police. This movie resisted the test of time. Om Puri offers stellar performance, Smita Patil no less. All the actors have done their best, and the movie shows have been thrilling every moment. This movie shakes your whole evil and forces you to rethink many of the issues facing our society. This is the story of a policeman (Om Puri) who begins his career as an honest man, but eventually degenerates into a murderer. Bollywood's first attempt to get behind the scenes and expose the depressing truth about Mumbai policemen. Kudos to Nihalani! <br /> <br /> After this film, a series of Bollywood movies were released that revealed the criminal-politician-police link. Thus, this movie was really a trendsetter. This trend has dominated the Hindi film scene for more than a decade. <br /> <br /> This movie was a moderate hit in the box office. <br /> <br /> A must-see for honest fans of discernment.
