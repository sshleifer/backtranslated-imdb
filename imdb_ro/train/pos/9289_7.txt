In Barbar and in GEISHA, John Wayne plays Townsend Harris, a true sent from the United States, responsible for truly opening Japan to international relations in the late 1850s. Prior to him, Commodore Perry pushed practically into Japan with pistols and forced a treaty to the Japanese in 1853. Harris, who arrived just a little later, worked through the details and helped to ensure compliance - because many of the Japanese had no special inclination to respect the first treaty. All this is true and presented in the film. According to some other sources I have found, the romance between Harris and a Japanese geisha is mostly fiction, and this love story is much of this film (and therefore the title). My first reaction, the first time I saw this movie was a surprise. John Wayne as a diplomat? When he is diplomatic in most movies, he says please and thank you that he pummels people !!!! So seeing him playing a man who is NOT a man of action and is able to play the diplomatic game seemed very strange. In fact, I can not think of too many actors in 1958 that would have been more unusual for this role. By the way, I saw Harris photos, and Wayne has no resemblance to him at all. However, despite the fact that the story took a lot of freedoms with the truth and strange casting, the film is still very much pursued. The cinematic film is beautiful, the film presents some beautiful ideas about Japanese customs and culture, and the act is not bad. All in all, a pleasant and watched film, despite the strange pouring. <br /> <br /> PS - Read through the trivia for this movie. You'll learn more about real-life characters and an alleged fight between Wayne and director John Huston, where Wayne would have shot him down! Based on what I read about Huston and the way he met with the actors, this is an incident I tend to believe. And it is also a beautiful example of "diplomacy" by John Wayne.
