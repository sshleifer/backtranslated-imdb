The world is a terrible place. But this movie is a farce and it's fun. And if you do not like ... you do not understand ... and if it does not ... it does not matter. It depends on you if you want to play. Every actor in this movie has fun. It's just a joke. And that's good enough for me. Gabriel Byrne is invaluable. Byrne and Paul Anka doing MY WAY is, as Vic says, "the best version ever". Okay ... it's not a masterpiece, but it's not bad. I was warned not to see this, but I'm sure I'm glad I did ...
