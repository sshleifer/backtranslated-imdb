I'm not a big fan of martial arts, but the video store was almost empty, and Jet Li was in Lethal Weapon 4 and we released him when we filmed the other films we leased as we rented, a. I loved him absolutely, my teammate and I (22-year-old biochemistry and accounting students) spent half an hour after the film made strange noises of Kung Fu and threw bereme shurikens to each other. I can not explain (well, maybe a little tequila). I have never enjoyed Bruce Lee, a faint fur by hitting a big man, beating him, hitting a bigger movie, etc. Think Jackie Chan with a less comedy and more action.
