This was a very bold movie for his birthday. It could even be described as a soft-core porn for the era is silent. There was talk, but the dialogue was extremely limited, and in German. One did not need it anyway. The young man (19) Hedy Lamarr is caught in a marriage without love with a German observer (stereotype?) And after a short period of time in a marriage that seems to have never been consumed, she returns home to her father. In a famous and amusing scene, she decides to go one morning when her horse is distracted by another. She is then forced to cross a field following her as she leaves her clothes on the horse. An engineer recovers his horse and turns his apparel - after seeing an eye. I sit for a while and, at a zen moment, presenting her with a bee with a bee on the top. Here she thinks back to the honeymoon and the actions of her husband and insects. Knowing this man is different. He returns home and finally seeks our young man and finds the ecstasy to which he was denied. You can use your image here, but the head disappears from sight and we see her angry. Since she never got naked, you can imagine ... Of course, a tribute to women by director Gustav Machat√Ω and a shock for the audience since 1933. The only thing that marks this beautiful film is the excessive blame and a strange ending.
