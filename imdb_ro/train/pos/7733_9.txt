Foley's noir quality in this saturated and intense pulp film is apparently "perfect" fit together. Shot by shot, editing by editing, the movie unfolds around a disturbed boxer discovering his or her own goal (or lack thereof). The other observations around him probably indicate a lack of interest in cellulose, but I personally think it is a superb cinematic piece!
