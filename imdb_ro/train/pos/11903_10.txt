I was lucky enough to catch this film while volunteering at the Maryland Film Festival. I've always been a fan of classical horror films and especially William Castle tricks, so that was certainly a necessity for me. It's the life and work of William Castle, which in my opinion was an undervalued director. True, he made some low-budget horror movies, but he added something to these films: live theatrical tricks you no longer see. For example, he had nurses, if someone had a heart attack on his movies and put vibrators at the bottom of the seats in THE TINGER. This is really a well done documentary and brings this director quite shadowy in the light, and celebrated his contributions to horror cinema. He also painted the Castle as a character larger than life, who was very pleasant and had a smile on his face. Unlike most film documentaries that mostly feature testament to film historians, SPINE TINGLER! shows interviews especially from family members and executives who were influenced by his work, such as John Waters, John Landis and Joe Dante. He has to watch for classic fans of horror and science fiction.
