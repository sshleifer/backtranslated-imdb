I liked this movie as a child when it came out, and to this day I do it. A simple story involving the search for a kidnapped girl and a literal adventurer, straight from linguistics. He has more recognized actors that day. This should not prevent the spectator from making a storm. Wayne Crawford plays the role of Jake Speed's main character. Sure, he might bite from certain elements of Romancing Stone and Indiana Jones. But this movie is done pretty well to keep it away from the cellar. I'm surprised that too many people do not know about it. It was probably shaded by other movies in the theaters of the '86. I then looked at cable television. It may be hard to find since it is not printed on both VHS and DVD. I managed to get a DVD on eBay at less than $ 8! Beautiful movement.
