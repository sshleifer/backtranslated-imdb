John Waters, the most accessible film to date, is one of the best, as he cut off all the philosophies and absolute vulgarity that seem to disturb most of his past work. Sure, nudity and sexual references are still there, at least presented in a manner that can not be considered too wrong or disgusting. Thanks to the extraordinary screening choices, this film has really brought out the siren associated with the modern art and the subjective nature of your modern artist. Funny and somewhat gentle (if this is possible for Waters), this is one of the movies I'll be watching on a rainy day.
