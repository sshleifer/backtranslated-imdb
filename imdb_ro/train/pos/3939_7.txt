According to John Ford's lyrical shooting, the fictitious biopic of Abraham Lincoln's life, his biggest mistakes could have been a woman's obtuse and an ability to dance "in the worst" way. Ford's room has nothing but praise to reveal Mr. Lincoln's early life. But for what is lacking the movie in complexity of characters, it does in beauty and depth of vision. Unusually beautiful compositions of the early film, which could have been a series of superb cadres, Ford has a unique eye to tell a story. The film sings the life of a hopeful young man. Henry Fonda plays Lincoln, contemplative and spontaneously intelligent, in a teu, one of his best roles. The film refers to two young people, brothers, in court, for a murder they both claim to have committed. In a classy mob-style mob, the city decides to get right in its own hands and flatter the pair until honest Abe is headed for fear. He delighted them with humor, telling them not to rob him of his first big case, and being as good as he was with him as the boys' lawyer. What follows is to become the contour for all court yards-crime-drama afterwards, because Abe is proud to interrogate witnesses to the delight and humor of the judge, the jury and the city before stumbling on the missing links. <br /> <br /> The movie takes place as many John Ford movies do: an American spoon, a moderate predictability break, a hint of sarcasm that you are not sure if you put it in the recipe or if Ford he does it himself. Despite the Hollywood sense of the film and a patriotic banter that alludes to Lincoln's upcoming presidency, the film is nice and well built if you can take a string of salt.
