This movie was absolutely brilliant! Every show in this movie is great, especially Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper. It seems that Mr. Gyllenhaal will have a huge cinematic career if there is anything to be done. I thought Joe Johnston was a strange choice as a director, as is usually associated with a big big-budget blockbusters (Jumanji, Honey I Scold Children). He pulls from each scene with an absolute class. My favorite scene was the place where Homer walked down the trees and watched the sky, descending, as all his dreams were, beautiful. Joe Johnston should direct more of these brilliant acting movies, as well as BigBarbuster faire's budget, which is also excellent. KUDOS !! to all those involved in this masterpiece!
