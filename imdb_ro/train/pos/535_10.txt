A matter of life and death, which you can really say would rightly do justice to the genius and beauty of this film. Powell and Pressburger's visual imagination have no limits, each frame is filled with bold, fantastic compositions. Changes between the bold colors of the "real world" and the black and white sky of the sky are ingenious, showing us as vibrant life as possible. The final scene of the court is also fantastic because the judge and the jury descend to the sky to keep the court on Peter Niven's operation. <br /> <br /> All the shows are on the scene (Roger Livesey being a standout) and the romantic energy of the movie is beautiful, there has never been a more romantic film than this one (if I have not been seen). a matter of life and death is about the power of love and how important life is. And Jack Cardiff's movie is a good reason to watch the movie alone, the way he lights up Kim Hunter's face makes it even more beautiful, what brilliant, can do simple things like a table tennis game that looks interesting and sound design is also impeccable how the move of the sound to the vital points was a decision ahead of its time This is a true classic who can restore someone's faith in cinematography, under the appreciation of his original audience and today's audience, but one of my favorites all the time, which is why I give this film 10/10, in a word - Beautiful.
