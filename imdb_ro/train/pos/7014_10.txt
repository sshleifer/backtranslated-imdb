Wow ... I do not know what to say. I just looked at 7 Pounds. No one can make me cry like Will Smith. Man is in tune with the vast array of human emotions. This film was done with skill and beauty. Rare to find such intense humanity at Hollywood today. I'd compare it to "Pay It Before" and "Crash" to the show of light and darkness in such a brutal way. It certainly beats you for a long time and gives you much to think. I have a deep love and passion for movies like this one. It is not usually one for an "end of evil", but rather a truth seeker that includes emotion, raw life and something more than the height that exists in abundance. That's why I do not mind a little pain at the end. It is true for life that there are not always happy endings. Sometimes, not just the happy end you think should be. Many people have been able to live a happy life, although one's love and life have been lost. If you are someone who looks deeper than the rest, you will enjoy this movie!
