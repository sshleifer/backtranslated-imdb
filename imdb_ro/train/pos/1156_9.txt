Years ago I followed a soap on TV. So I was curious about this movie and I was so rewarded that I found it. It's a wonderful paradise of soaps, jealousy, insecurity of ordinary actors, and all sorts of wonderful excesses. But more than anything - a stunning cast and incredible scenario. How did he manage to make all of these top actors play in such a stupid film? And how did this little film make writers write perfect lines? I've never heard anyone talk about this movie or even admit his hearing, but it's great and I recommend seeing it. Sometimes I'll throw him while cleaning the house, then I sit down on the couch, looking at me, laughing and enjoying everything he did. Many congratulations to all who have done it.
