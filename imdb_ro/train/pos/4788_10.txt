This is one of the biggest movies I've ever seen: I shone inside the whole movie. Music and cinema kept the spell when a little happened on the screen. The slow pace was set by how to travel (a lawnmower with a great trailer) and was maintained by the background colors and sounds and slow lives of the other characters. actually happened; Alvin Straight died in 1996 at the age of 76. everything was completely real, as if the actors had actually turned into characters. Sissy Spacek gave an amazing performance as a daughter with some disadvantage, who suffered a lot but falsified before, always wanting to do the right thing. Richard Farnsworth was thrown out perfectly and he became beautiful Alvin Straight, an elderly but stubborn but loving old man who goes through Iowa to visit his alien brother, Lyle, who suffered a stroke. Alvin learned a lot of wisdom during his life and seemed to bring the best results from the people he met along the way. The film highlights the importance of this man's family and, hopefully, of all of us. I can not wait to see again and again. Directed by David Lynch, these films prove his directorial talent. Farnsworth was nominated for Best Actress Oscar; at 79, he was the oldest ever candidate for this prize.
