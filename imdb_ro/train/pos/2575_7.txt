I hired this movie from Netflix for two reasons - I had the thought of what I thought it would be a sci-fi-asco movie and because it's the first Superman movie. There is no need to say that after about 15 minutes I found myself very busy and very pleasantly surprised. An experimental spring of oil penetrated about six miles into the ground and is closed by the sponsor. Lois and Clark look to get shells but are disappointed that the deepest mud will not work anymore. A day later, strange events at well make a better story for Superman than Clark Kent. It seems that the Mole radioactive men have invaded 6 miles deep at home near the core of the earth. Supermodels and Mole men are a simplistic, but well-made social reality. Launched in 1951 with a leading actor who served in World War II, the morale of the story seems to be that Americans are as capable of becoming fascists as anybody else. To lead this point in the usual way Superman, Reeves even accuses the crowd of lynch who hunt Mole Men to be "Nazis" at some point. Even in the 1950s, the science underlying this film was nonexistent. Six kilometers of drilling through the continental crust would not have penetrated even the upper mantle, not to mention the "empty center of the earth" - which, in any case, does not exist. Remember - remember that this movie is based on a golden age comic book. The film is a bit disturbing. Although Molemen is interesting, a bit creepy and beautiful portrayed, there are several Corman-esquire scenes that spend too much redundant time showing us their odd behavior. The scenario is intelligent and economical. By today's standards, costume is faint to be fair, but for its time, the special effects of this film and costume was good enough. Also, cinema is very good, and acting is much better than one might expect. I was particularly impressed by Reeves, Jeff Corey and Walter Reed.
