This was a very pleasant film. A humorous but joyful look at the family, and its obligations. The story of a man coming home from his life in the city, in his father's bathhouse, in a small Chinese village. There he learns to appreciate, to appreciate even the things he has left at home to escape. The movie is as visually beautiful and is emotionally beautiful.
