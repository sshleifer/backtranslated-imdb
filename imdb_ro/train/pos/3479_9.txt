This show began with great mystery episodes. I think everyone is in the first 15 or 16 episodes. After that, the show began to play short episodes with Shaggy, Scooby doo and Scrappy doo. I think Hanna Barbera Productions had to change 20 episodes in short episodes. Some voice actors have become unavailable. After 15 or 16 episodes, Frank Welker (who played Fred) became unavailable. I think Velma's voice is changing after the first 12 episodes, because the first vocal actress who played Velma was not available. The network ordered Hanna Barbera to make more shorts with Shaggy, Scooby doo and Scrappy doo because the ratings were high. So they had to make more shorts. I would have liked to be mysteries like 15 episodes. However, it is a good show.
