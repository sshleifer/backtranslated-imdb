Although this film has put Davis on the map because of its particularly intense performance as illustrator / prostitute Mildred Rogers, this movie is strangely unsatisfactory for me as a whole. The actor is really good in every respect. What I can not understand for my life is how and why Phillip, a sensitive and well-thoughtful young man, would constantly abuse this tramp constantly toward him: I find his naive tolerance quite ridiculously unbelievable in some respects. Yeah, I know he's a clever intellectual, with an inclined leg. But Davis is such a vicious witch that no one who cultivates will tolerate his attitude or actions and will not make him credible. Davis is amazing in her role: yes, she can cross the board in her history from time to time, but it's a living creative portrait, in any way you look at it. It was a shame he did not play with a gangster. Her character would have been completely credible like a tramp in a small life!
