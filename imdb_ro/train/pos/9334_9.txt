The Sensuous Nurse (1975) was an Italian sex comedy, starring for Bond girl, Ursula Andress. The man was hot in this movie. She was stacked and built like a brick house @ @%. Ursula smokes hot in this movie. I have never seen a nurse's costume that she completed before. <br /> <br /> Andress plays the role of a nurse who is committed to taking care of a rich old man. Even one in the house seems to be kicking boots. One evening, the nurse decides to take the nephew's temperature and give something necessary T.L.C. for her old customer. The old man takes him to his nurse, and he gets angry with the rest of the family. What kind of job does the family have to do? Will the geezer fall for the carmaker? How can he deal with the octogenarian and the rest of the family? To find out that you need to find a copy of SENSITIVE NURSE! Italian, but wrongly called in English. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
