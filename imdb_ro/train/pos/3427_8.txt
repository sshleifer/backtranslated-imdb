This film illustrates the worst part of the surviving war, the memories. For many soldiers, men and women, returning home can be the beginning of real problems. I remember my father and his brothers returning from the Second World War. For one of my uncles the war has never ended. He survived the invasion of Day D, something like the first 20 minutes of rescuing private Ryan. For him, memories not only left him, but tortured him. He became an alcoholic, like many of my cousins, his sons. Jump over 60 years and put soldiers in a different war in another country, the result is the same. When I saw this at KC FilmFest, it was remembered that there was something about a war that never changed. Ideal men and women are not spared the emotional anguish of what happened in Iraq, and especially if you are against the war, you will come out with more compassion for the soldiers who are trying to do what they believed or were called right. <br /> <br /> The Vietnam War War Tagline line, the Platoon says it all. "The first victim of the war is innocence."
