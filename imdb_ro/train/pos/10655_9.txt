It seems to be a perfect day for swimming. An ordinary family wants to get an advantage and a trip to the beach. Unfortunately, it happens that the father is trapped under a dike, and neither his wife nor his son can help him out of this - while the flow rises. The woman (Barbara Stanwyck) takes the car and looks for help. John Sturges' short film (69 minutes) is strong because of unanswered questions. Stanwyck finds a guy who could help, but there's a price he has to pay for it. There is a double question of the film. How much do you go to help the man you love and, on the other hand, by watching Stanwyck's behavior towards a stranger, does he really love his husband? As a short story, this film leaves questions to the viewer that he can answer.
