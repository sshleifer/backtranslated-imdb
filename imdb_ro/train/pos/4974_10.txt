This was a delightful presentation. Hemo (blood), as a Greek god, has been so well played by animation with vanity, arrogance, superiority of snobs and innocent wonder. The quote (or scene) that I remember alive is that when Hemo tires of "all these sanitary facilities ... you never taught my secrets" and threaten to run out, the scientist responds in one the word "Thalassa" is the salt water that terrifies the fiction writer, but molializes Hemo and finds itself so well in the chemical aspects of the blood. <br /> <br /> A splendid combination of entertainment and information makes this classic, so fresh and appealing, today as the day it was launched. Stimulating interest and imagination is fundamental to teach children to love learning.
