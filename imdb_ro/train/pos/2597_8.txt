Ulysses as film should in no way be compared to the novel, because there are two completely different entities. However, as it is said, the film still manages to maintain many of the elements that made the book work, but since it is a visual environment, it is more difficult to pull out of the flow of consciousness. I think this is the best movie he could have done with the material ... and this is from someone who routinely about films that are not like their literary counterparts. I recommend the book, but the movie is still fun.
