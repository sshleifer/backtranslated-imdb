On the day of the great studio system, the boldest decisions were made. Old American James Stewart who appears as a Hungarian in the shop around the corner. If I had filmed the film, Kralik's part would have been perfect for Charles Boyer. His focus, mixed with all the other European accents, would have been nothing. Stewart had the same problem in Mortal Storm and Margaret Sullavan. Margaret Sullavan was the most frequent lady on the screen, she made four movies with her. But it is only if none of them dies. Sullavan and her husband, Leland Heyward, met Stewart that day when he was a player fighting in New York. In fact, Sullavan's husband was Stewart's good friend, Henry Fonda, at the time. I think only Clark Gable was able to carry an American into a cast of non-Americans in Mutiny on Bounty. Stewart in The Mortal Storm was German, but all the other players were American, so nothing came out. <br /> <br /> But if you can accept Stewart, you will see a wonderful movie from Ernest Lubitsch. The land is pretty simple, a man and a woman working in a shop in Budapest do not meet in person. But it seems to be in correspondence with some anonymous admirers who turn out to be each other. Also, employer Frank Morgan suspects Stewart wrongly to hurt his wife. <br /> <br /> Although the leadership is good and Frank Morgan moves away from his usual self, the two best-performing players are Felix Bressart and Joseph Schildkraut. Bressart has my favorite moments in the movie when he takes off after Morgan starts asking people for opinions. It is very clear. And Joseph Schildkraut, who is always good, is great as a small worm that constantly kisses up to Frank Morgan. I really hate people like this, I know too many Schildkraut in real life who are in office politics 24 hours a day. Sad to pay for a good deal of time.
