After a triangle love story in Har Dil Jo Pyaar Karega, these 3 stars were chosen again in this controversial movie. The film would have been considered hit if there was no controversy over the Bharat Shah production values. Here duo director Abbas-Mustan has made a very different and unique job compared to their previous entrepreneurs and directors. They are considered to be thriller producers in Bollywood. But in this CCPC they have demonstrated that they can deal equally to make a romantic family drama. There is almost no single scene when Preity was raped by Salman's colleague in her apartment, Salman hit him. The film has almost all the standards and ingredients, such as song, story, casting, shows, etc. which are required to make a hit movie. But, of course, for Salman fans, it was a surprise gift on his part. Why? Because for so long he has played a role in having a scene to show his body open and to dance around to him around. His role as a young, wealthy businessman who has a senseless and normal attitude is really impressive. After all Madhubala, a prostitute role played by Preity is amazing. Later, when she thinks about her life, she deserves the right attention. Her facial expressions and body language become more attractive and focuses mainly on her. Her former role as a pregnant woman in Kya Kehna was not as uncomfortable as she is here. Of course, this can be called an improvement. Then Priya, an innocent and helpless wife of Raj, who only depends on him for a better result. It has no strong influence on the story, because the main ingredients are in the hands of Preita. Finally, the main point of the story, which is rare and unique in itself. In the real world of this age, it is not absolutely impossible for such a step to happen in search of a surrogate mother. Maybe many happen in this great world where they are kept secret. And so the CCCC writer has discovered a hidden truth that takes place in other everyday life. But still there is a doubt.
