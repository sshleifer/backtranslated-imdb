Diane and I saw this fabulous film today in Fremantle, and we both agreed that the pastime movies were head and shoulders above the others. I say this because I was excited about the short five to ten minute segments of the film and the fact that this movie had a theme around which each piece was composed and of course the theme was love in its many forms. > <br /> Apparently, the film took place in the various Parisian arrondissements, offering a great taste to each segment. Being only several times in Paris, I did not have enough knowledge to easily recognize the locations, but I'm sure that Europeans, especially the French, would easily recognize the city's location. In any case, the viewer is immediately drawn into each story because of their production excellence, so these locations the city fades accordingly. The movie moves quickly and the viewer is allowed to absorb a script while the new one is on the screen. The stories themselves are not graphic as Hollywood nonsense, they are subtle and thoughtful, provocative and gentle, as in most of their lives, without the media spell that embraces so much of the beauty of life under the closest pile of garbage just to sell, sell. Come with somebody who cares and allow this little magic movie to be bathing like a spa treatment, and when you get your idea is that you will feel renewed.
