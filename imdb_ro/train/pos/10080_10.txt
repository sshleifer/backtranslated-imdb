The rapid economic development in the 1990s in China, there is a renaissance of traditional Chinese culture, partly due to the rise of nationalism accompanied by increased wealth and more importantly, because the spiritual sense of belonging after the collapse of the old socialist ideology in the era of post-cultural revolution. However, the rebirth of traditional Chinese culture, namely, Confucianism, was not without disaster, because the Chinese have adopted the whole tradition without eliminating the bad side, and the discrimination against girls demonstrated in this film is an excellent example. Moreover, not only the part that should be thrown, the good part to be inherited, such as the traditional work, was inherited, and its technique, such as face change, was ignored in rebirth and facing disappearance. The director used this film to criticize the issue of renewing the tradition by contemporary China. This is the deeper meaning behind the film.
