I really do not understand why people get so upset and cough this movie! Remember the good people, this is an SNL movie, not something that should be unpredictable and original in plot or direction! The Ladies Man is a hilarious film, though sometimes stupid, with a stray cast and as usual with WONDERFUL performances by Will Ferrel and Tim Meadows. Yes, some jokes are stupid, and yes, the characters are unbelievable, but her comedy! I really do not understand how someone could not laugh a lot during this hilarious movie. Anyway, all I've asked is that people take that as it is - a SNL comedy, silly and irrelevant. Nothing that will not win prizes, but, nevertheless, some modern golden comedy. "10-4 Apricot!"
