The double exhibition was an extraordinary surprise. It contains remarkable acting (especially Callan subconscious), a fine cinema and an interesting story. In other words, it is one of the best horror efforts to get out of the 1980s. Callan plays a fashion photographer who feels dreams of killing his models at a time when he is reunited with his volatile psychological brother which happens to miss an arm and a leg). When the models of Callan dream of killing become dead, the photographer begins to bend his health ... but it's more than the image he sees. This movie never received praise is worth it. Most critics and filming bury him with a horde of filming movies released at the same time, but they are above most of that bad batch. It is intelligent and unique, which is not something that can be said comfortably about most of these films, but is also passionate about handicraft and interpretation. The double exhibition is a jewel of this kind.
