Putting aside the "stuff" of the UFO. This was the best documentary I've ever seen. The factual reports of Neil and Buzz ... have to see. Interviews and reporting are a revelation because most of the information was stamped confidential in 1969 and released only in 2006. No documentary document so far has details or precision for such a short 47 minutes ... FACTS will throw you in the air and you will be left with the risks taken to be the first month ... Neil and Buzz are probably the greatest hero of our time. Do you ever see a man save his own life? Do not bet. Neil saves his life when only millions separate him from death. Amazing to watch. It is a transvestity, people did not know all the details associated with landing on the moon and the courage these men had when faced with a certain death, from a defective computer ... 10 stars!
