There's a lot of fools going out of Hollywood lately. A friend sent me movies from time to time, as a surprise, it's great. can not stop watching, it's a drama, but with a strange twist. Imagine if Romeo, like in Shakepeare, had a super power. It is sad and poetic at the same time. Hollywood should take note of the new Russian cinema, tell stories that are not about big explosions and cgi. It takes a simple basic premise and tells a story without a show. This is much like an Asian movie with a dark turn of the Russians. Granted that it is not perfect, but nothing is ever. You know what power is, but it is never explained or totally accomplished to the end. It becomes secondary to the emotion of the story. I do not want to see a remake, it's too cool as such, the Hollywood system would, as usual, be puzzled. The action is top all around. Targeting and working with the camera are far above most of the shit that's there. Kudos to all those involved and I will turn a lot of people into this independent epoch. A +++++ <br /> <br /> If you find it, watch it.
