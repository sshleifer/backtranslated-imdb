Nominated at the surprise of this year's best animated Oscar. It's an Irish film on the heart, but it was co-produced by Belgium and Brazil, with supposedly animators working in all three countries. The product is one of the most beautiful and unique movies in recent memory. The character design is a reminiscence of the French Persepolis animated film, a few years ago, with very simple characters with thick and black outlines. This movie is not black and white. Oh no. What makes this great movie is its use of color, just some of the most scandalous and stunning use of the colors I've ever seen. The general design of the images is also more geometric, with characters that are mainly rectangles or oval. Much of the movie can be spent playing the circle - an important aspect of visual design is a circle at the center of the image. All these geometric patterns have a purpose - the story is about a boy who learns to be an artist working on enlightened manuscripts (Kells' book is an illuminated Bible, the art of the film is based on the drawings in it). The story of the movie is not very deep, but it's a fairly good story of fantasy. Brendan is a little boy in Kells, a city surrounded by enormous walls, built by his uncle to keep the Vikings. A newcomer to Kells, Brother Aiden, inspired Brendan to take over the illustration. He also inspires him to do things like Kells' departure and the exploration of the nearby forest, where a nymph lives. Bruno Coulais offers a fantastic score, almost as good as the one he made for Coraline, which I consider the best this year.
