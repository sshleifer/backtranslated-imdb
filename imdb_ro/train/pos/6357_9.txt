I found this very fun movie for young children, which is actually more adapted to adults with lots of jokes and humor that only they would understand. Some things are inappropriate for children, but only a few. Othewise, "The Grinch" (Jim Carrey) creates so many jokes you can not keep up with, ranging from sex to culture to insider-hollywood racial. The movie is very colorful and looks great on DVD. The girl here, "Cindy Lou Who" (Taylor Momsen) is really nice, and the costumes and hairstyle of the little people here are fun to see. Anthony Hopkins' voice is also pleasing with his story, this still raises the film. His rhymes are fun to hear. I saw this in the theater, although it was "fair," but on DVD, it was much better. I've seen it three times and improved every time.
