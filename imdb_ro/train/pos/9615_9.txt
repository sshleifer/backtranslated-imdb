This is a great movie! Most of us have seen Jurassic Park, where Chaos theory is summed up, telling about the wings of a butterfly, causing a tornado across the planet. Well, Bug is about it (or at least something, do not worry it's not a spoiler). I'm not definitely a religious guy and I do not believe in pre-destined stuff, fate, etc, but this movie definitely asks if the coincidence really exists ... more, the act and the camera are excellent, another proves it is still possible to make a good movie without a zillion dollars
