Women have never been so appealing and pathetic as in Salazar Piedras. Although the editor's cut here and there could help the film, it is interesting and enjoyable, with an intense footprint of Pedro Almodovar's latest films. 5 different women are confronted with their male partners and families. Starting with several different stories he has to fulfill while the plot continues, Salazar portrays his female characters in the same neurotic and borderline familiar to Almodovar. A lady with a high society from Kleptomania, with a scary shoe to a smaller shoe, a burlesque lady who took care of her daughter with disabilities, a drug addicted dancer, obsessed with her ex-boyfriend and a driver taxi that took care of the children disturbed by her husband in Madrid in well-designed scenes. Using some of Almodovar's most famous actresses, the director succeeds in his first film to deepen all the characters who share the film and to create a genuine sympathy with each of them. Women control the plot line and men are forced to stay between them in the end ... Surprisingly good for a first film and worth the time to any standard. It is noteworthy that Salazar hesitated in some direction for actresses, but an impressive act is presented anyway on screen, especially by Monica Cervera, who played in his former short film. Almodovar fans and liked everyone.
