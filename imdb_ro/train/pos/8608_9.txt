This was a great movie, with a good cast, all hitting all the bottles. And when Dianne Keaton is at the best moments, well, he does not feel better than that. But Tom Everett Scott, always underestimated, was even better. It should be a star. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is with one aspect of the script. None of the characters ever admitted that the dead daughter was not always a good person. She was not even her mother, interpreted by Keaton. At one point, she violates a promise she had made to a character not to disclose that he was sleeping around. One of the other commentators said the film had a "political agenda." This is an amazing thing to say. There was no politics in this movie.
