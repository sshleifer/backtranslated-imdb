There are so many things in Aro Tolbukhin. En la mente del asesino (Inside the killer's mind), that it's very hard to talk about it without giving any warning. Let's just say that this movie is like an exercise in the cinema, but really very well done. It is made with super 8 photos, black and white, 35 millimeters, color, interviews, flashbacks. Aro Tolbukhin is like a documentary film or vice versa, the strangest aspect that reveals the doubt that he lets you ask, did it really exist? The film follows the later life of a Hungarian sailor who arrived in Guatemala, worked on a religious mission and then killed some people. An act for which he was seized and the sentenced death sentence. The film begins because some French documentaries have been interested in this character so that they interview him before his death. Nowadays, some more people have been involved and have thoroughly researched the character. The one we're witnessing for the movie. For the main part of history, we are guided by a semi-slow phase to go to look at Aro's mind, mainly to decode why he did what he did. However, it is important that film producers never give us a two-way view; they left the judgment for us all, and even as we could understand his actions, we never clearly justified them. So the first half is based on the recollection of information; later, things turn into Aro's childhood, giving the film such incredible new strength (even hard was never weak or boring). I do not want to say - and I do not want to - to ruin anything; so the only thing you have to say is that if you get this movie close to you, believe me, the journey to see it is more than dignified.
