I liked this show when it was broadcast on TV and was crushed when I found someone else somewhere decided that it was not worth continuing! For years I've been hanging on my copies of this show, the ones I've recorded, or somebody that a band has done to me. That is so far. The powers that ultimately decide to launch this beautiful series on DVD and eventually I could put my hands on the complete set. Which brings me to this side; part about the fact that this show is about. American Gothic is about bad good verses, basically a fight between Lucas Buck (which is Buck, with a B). She is a bad sheriff of a small town in South Carolina who runs things as he wants things to run and stops at nothing to make his way. I felt that the show was greatly written and directed and had a lot of life left to live. I really looked when it was canceled, but it seems to me that I go when I finally find something worth watching on TV. Gary Cole did a great job as Sheriff Lucas Buck, he only has the right amount of bad charm to get him out. The other actors have done a super job, so I think you could say, even casting was a hit with me.
