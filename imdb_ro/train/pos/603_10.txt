The music of Albeniz penetrates this movie. From time to time, it plays with original instrumentation instruments (for example, piano, but never a complete orchestra), but is often resumed with various contemporary ensembles (eg with guitar) and treatments (eg piano jazz). Occasionally, music is the only theme of the movie: most of the time music is put on different dances, often flamenco, but not always. Would I guess there are 12? 14 scenes that are not united by a plot. Not all scenes will reach the heights for an individual viewer. In my case, half came to the top, although the rest was very good. Those who worked for me moved me to aesthetic delight; Indeed, the final scene has allowed me to drink with joy. And in a very magical way brings you deep into the Spanish culture. If you do not like subtitling, do not worry. The film is virtually speechless, although each scene is titled Albeniz. Seeing this very beautiful film, I'm compelled to complain that virtually none of the movies in Saura is available on DVD in the US. I'm thinking here mainly of his version of flamenco "Carmen," a spectacular opera that is available in Europe, but not here (European DVDs will not play on American DVDs). This is a scandal.
