Very emotional. He can not leave you neutral. Yeah, it's a love story between two boys aged 18. But it's just the body of this movie. And it was eliminated. You just feel what happened to these guys. Feel the soul of the movie. Of course, some actions, some sexes, but this is not pornography, too many feelings. It was just a "summer story", and became, from love to hate, almost to death, the most important time in their lives. I liked you, too, whatever your feelings are.
