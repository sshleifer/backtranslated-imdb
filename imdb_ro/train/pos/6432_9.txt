Thanks to a clever script and a steady hand from Writer / Director Kevin Meyer, "Perfect Alibi" is a fun and thriller thriller of fun. The film starts methodically and builds steam, as clues begin to reveal that nothing seems what it looks like. Teri Garr and Hector Elizondo are awesome as they equip to reveal the mystery, reminding me of Nick and Nora Charles from "Thin Man" movies. Kathleen Quinlan is excellent as Alex McArthur's tormented wife and character roles played by veteran actors Charles Martin Smith, Bruce McGill, Anne Ramsey and Estelle Harris are well done and offer plenty of easy moments at the right time. There is even a rectangle of Rex Linn. In all, I felt I read a good book of fire.
