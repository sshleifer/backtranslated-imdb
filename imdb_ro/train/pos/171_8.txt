I do not agree with anyone who could give up this movie as "fun". Located immediately after being carefree, 20 years in the early days of the Great Depression, Dance, Fools, Dance is in his center a serious warning story with a clear message about the best way to bear these hard times . However, this fast paced and compact film is far from being a frightening morality story. In the 1930s, Hollywood had a talent to destroy an entertaining atmosphere * and * pleased the audience after another, all without losing a movie frame. Dance, Fools, Dance - one of * four * movies that Harry Beaumont did in 1931 - is only 80 minutes long, yet his characters are well developed, the story does not seem to rush and, despite its many twists and turns , is never left behind. With the sole exception of Lester Vail as an angry love interest Bob Townsend, the distribution of support is heavily uniform. Of note are William Bakewell, Crawford's brother, Cliff Edwards (best known as Jiminy Cricket), reporter Bert Scranton and Clark Gable in an early role as gangster Jake Luva. is Joan Crawford's movie, and she shines absolutely in her. When it was only 27 years old, this less-known version of Crawford would probably be unrecognizable to the most familiar with her later work. However, here is proof that long before taking an Oscar for Mildred Pierce, Crawford was a star in the true sense of the word, a great actress with charisma to wear a self-image. <br /> <> Score: Eight out of TEN
