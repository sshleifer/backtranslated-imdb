So the musical songs were badly written and generally poorly played (though Walken and Marner, especially Walken, sounded pretty good). So they broke the fourth wall at the end by being emperor and his nobles singing about the "battle" with the field and praising Puss in Boots' efforts when they should not even have known about it. /> <br /> Who cares? It's Christopher Freakin 'Walken, you make a movie based on a fairy tale and sing and dance. His acting style fits well with the role of Puss, which seems to bring his master into deeper and deeper problems, but he actually has a plan that he thought about seven or eight moves in advance. And if you've ever seen Walken in any of his bad roles, you know Ogre dirty the HARD powder at the end when Walken caught him in his trap. A fun and must-see movie for anyone who enjoys the unique style of Christopher Walken.
