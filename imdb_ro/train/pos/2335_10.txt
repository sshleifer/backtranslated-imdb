That's what t.v. It should be. And the Pushing beads follow these expectations. A beautifully crafted and well-designed show, Pushing Daisies is one of the few first-time shows that has integrity, is good for the whole family and sparks your imagination. It's not about common action, sex, money or killing any other show on t.v. It's a show that makes you think and laugh, but although the basic plot may seem impossible, the concepts are real to all of us. You want something you can not have, hoping for someone to look for us, to run away from your past and look for a family, even in the most unlikely places. I realized that ABC has virtually canceled this wonderful show at this time and will most likely replace it with a show beyond the point of integrity. I suppose everything's back to the money ... it's too bad that there are no other ABC shows to make you feel good after you look.
