After I did not see the last two in the Bourne movie trilogy, I was a bit reluctant to see The Bourne Ultimatum. However, it was a very thrilling experience and I did not have the problem of not understanding what is happening because of the lack of seeing the first two films. Every part of the story was easy to understand and I fell in love with The Bourne Ultimatum before reaching the interval! I do not think I've ever seen a movie so beautiful and captivating, especially an action movie. Since I've usually figured out action movies and thriller, it was such a wonderful news. Ultimatum is one of the most delightful movies, it draws your attention from the first second to the last minute before the credit is launched. Matt Damon was simply fantastic as Jason Bourne. I've heard a lot about his big shows in Bourne 1 + 2, and now, this fabulous actor has one more addition to his list. I look forward to seeing more of her films in the future. The waterfalls were handled with style - each was made brilliant and I was just shocked by the impressiveness of this film. Very good.
