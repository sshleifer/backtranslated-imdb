William Powell, unpleasant. It's a joy to watch on the screen as it moves through careless situations in the world. He always seems to be at the top of the game and does not care for anyone who doubts him. Crime are projects, barely human beings. I have noticed that this is a problem of the best. Apart from a casual casual widow, victims fulfill the function of being the reason why the movie exists. No more. There are enough twists and turns to keep things interesting along the way, and Powell is a master in this. There are a lot of political inaccuracies, especially as it concerns Asian interpreters. It's a little hard to get. The distribution is great, and Curtiz's direction is a consistent asset.
