Another childhood episode that, as an adult, I look back with another perspective. This was one of my favorite childhood episodes, one that brought me true adoration to this show. However, watching this episode after 20 years, I would say it is certainly one of the easiest, played for laughter and fun, instead of dramaturgical and well-constructed story lines in previous episodes in this first season. Perhaps this episode was also written for a small R & R fan! As Mr. Spock said, the story is not logical, but there are some funny lines, like Spock's last final, when they ask Captain McCoy and others if they liked R & R and respond in the affirmative, raises an eyebrow and says "Fascinating ..." only in the way Mr. Spock could do that. An interesting story line, of course, the idea of ​​a fun park is actually amusing (instead of the fake and often annoying Disneyland, for example), the possibility of really having desires. Indeed, a wonderful idea, but not so well executed. And coming from Theodore Sturgeon, another great writer of short SF stories that he used in the first season, he wonders how tortured Sturgeon did. Now it's a little trivia I learned on this very site: In 1987, James Gunn established Theodore Sturgeon Award for Best Science Fiction Short Story. And I will quote the rest of this site: In 1968, Sturgeon wrote "The Joy Machine," a third script for the TV series Star Trek (Amok Time the other), which was never shot. The main reason why it was not used in series is that it contained sequences of expensive special effects that would be too much for their budget. However, the script was adapted into a book by Sci-Fi writer James Gunn (Star Trek # 80, the original series) and published by Pocket Books in 1996. I would like to sum up this episode is still very enjoyable, especially if you do not think too much about it. Laugh and enjoy it and the next episode can come back to the serious things to protect the universe.
