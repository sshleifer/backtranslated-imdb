A nice postcard in New York. The thing I liked most was to be able to follow this with my entire family and not wait for a joke of humor. She never did. And the teens liked me. My son for Natasha Henstridge and my daughter for Michael Vartan. My wife and I commented that we could not remember the last time we could sit with the kids and ALL like you. This movie has told a story that felt comfortable, but not old or done. The end came with a turn that we also liked. If you are not just a cynical person and you are allowed to let a story unfold, then it is for you. Like a guy, it takes a lot to keep my interest when it comes to romantic movies and that's what she did. I recommend it and I need more of these movies to watch.
