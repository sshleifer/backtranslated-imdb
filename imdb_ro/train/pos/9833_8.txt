A terrorist attempts to steal a highly secret biological weapon and, in an attempt to escape, is infected when the case involving the dead agent is compromised. Soldiers are able to recover the case, but the terrorist is heading for a hotel where he tries to hide. They eventually reach out to hide and "clean" the hotel and its occupants. Unfortunately, they have their body incinerated and if you've seen Return of the Living Dead, you know what's going on. Zombie 3 has been a widespread of critics and zombie fans alike, as a complete misery of a movie. Although this is a fair assessment, it is not devoid of high points. For one thing, he has many bloody deaths to keep the dogs gore happy. There are a lot of zombies that seem to come out of all possible parts. They are in the water, in deer houses, hiding in the trees and, for some reason, they like to hide under a bunch of dead brushes, just to come out to attack as the heroes try to escape. There is even a flying zombie head hiding inside a refrigerator. You have to see it to believe, because only the scene makes Zombi 3 necessary to view the IMO. It may have some terrible editing and a very questionable action, especially from the doctor who must be one of the worst actors I've seen, but Zombie 3 is still a very fun movie. Sometimes it's nice to sit back and watch a movie that requires nothing more than your time and an open mind. Zombi 3 matches the bill and then some. It's even more enjoyable if you open a few beers and watch them with some like-minded friends. I'm giving her a 8/10, just because of the pleasant pleasure.
