This is a great movie for all ages. It's the story of three animals how they have to find their way home. There is a bit of overturning at the end and mainly throughout the movie. You never know what will happen next. This movie makes you cry and makes you laugh. You just do not know what will happen next. Trek home is beautiful with all the wonderful wild scenes. Manufacturers have also spent a lot of money on this film and they are also showing. The animals in this movie were well trained and are great actors / actresses themselves. Everything about this movie is great! 10 out of 10 all the way! Hire it or buy it today I can guarantee you will love the whole family!
