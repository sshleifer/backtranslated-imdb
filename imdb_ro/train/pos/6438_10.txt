"Let's be Himmelen" ... as above, so below ... that very special point where the Divine and the Man meet. ADORE this movie! Jewelry. YES amazing grace! I was so deeply moved by her very human quality. I laughed and wept through an entire register, more octaves of emotion. Mikael Nyqvist is BRILLIANT as Daniel, a passionate first, charismatic and powerful performance. Its inner light and exceptional talent shine in every scene, every interaction, in every encounter. I was completely fascinated, enchanted and caught the story, which is our collective story, the story of life itself. The film has also included many archetypes, the moon, the injured child, the magic child, the artist, the teacher, the priest, the aggressor, the abuser, the victim, the bully, the divine mad - ALL the real and real characters of life - love and compassion. <br /> <br /> It's a real betrayal to see such a provocative thought, but very fun and fun. You do not have to forget the heavenly choir of angels and the wonderful beautiful sound. <br /> <br /> THANK YOU MORE - This Swedish film will surely capture the world around the world. SCLIPITOR!
