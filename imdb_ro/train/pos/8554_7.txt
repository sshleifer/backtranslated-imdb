Wow, this was another good cut of the original American plaques, not as good as the camp camp, but certainly better than the bare mercy. Dwight and Erik are leading the comedy in this, but in fact I preferred dialogue in this direction with bare mercy. The script was much better written and the comedy went easier, however, most of the comedy came from sex, but that's good, because that's why we're watching these movies anyway? <br /> <br /> The Rock Hat also had a very good cameo, given the intense effort it gave in the naked mercy, its soulful scene was great and I laughed at my ass when I saw him. /> <br /> The film was a clear improvement in my opinion compared to the naked mile if you enjoyed a previous American movie, you should enjoy the beta house if you do not see all the Americans spin-offs of pie a loss of money.
