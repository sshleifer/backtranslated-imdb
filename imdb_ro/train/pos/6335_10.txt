Well, I come from Bulgaria where it is almost impossible to have a tornado but my imagination tells me to be "very, very afraid!" This guy (Devon Sawa) did a good job with this movie! I do not know how old she was but did not behave like a child (well done) Now about the tornado - it was not very realistic, but it scares you If you want to have fun in front of the TV - this is the movie!
