I liked Dedee Pfeiffer (is it written correctly?) In Cybil. I have not seen her for a while, and I forgot how much I missed it. I thought he did a good job in this. The support was pretty good. In some ways, the daughter actually looked like a young Nicole Kidman. The kidnapper was pretty creepy, and the story generally had some good twists. The young boyfriend was a boy. I thought the husband had something to do with security. I just filmed Lifetime Movie for Christmas and I love these movies. Keep my interest and I will track it again when they resume it. Can anyone else recommend similar movies in this regard? You can post to the forum or send me a private email if you want. Thank you in advance. Aboutagirly.
