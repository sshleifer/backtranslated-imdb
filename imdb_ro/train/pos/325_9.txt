This is an extraordinary movie - compared to the sometimes worrying seriousness of the contemporary political footage. A film that can easily combine sex, gender relations, politics and art is a rarity these days. While the mad optimism of the 1960s can not be regained, I think we can learn at least one lesson in the energy and charm of the film. I do not know what those who tagged the movie "boring" are watching - it's so busy that it never leaves the same movie for more than 15 minutes at a time.
