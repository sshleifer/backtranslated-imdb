I saw this film at the Amsterdam Documentary International Film Festival and had the privilege of meeting both directors and Tobias Schneebaum, all of whom are lively New Yorkers. The title of the Amsterdam film was keeping the river at your side, making the sensational appearance of cannibalism somewhat less prominent. Equally important was the loving and gay relationship with Tobias Schneebaum with members of the groups whom he studied as an anthropologist. Its 80-year meeting and inevitable layoffs have been very moving. I can only recommend this movie to anyone looking for a moving story that's only pedestrian.
