Jafar Panahi's comedy drama "Offside" features some women trying to enter a sports arena in Tehran, of which women are banned. The official reason: many mistaken languages, and football players show their feet. But, of course, it is indeed a case of sexism. So most of the film consists of a slight comic relief, while women try to ask men about the reasons why women are banned from the stadium, and a woman even comes up with her own scheme for defy men. As I understand, all Jafar Panahi's films (including those) are forbidden in Iran. The real tragedy is that the 1953 CIA overthrow of the Prime Minister and the subsequent support of brutal chess gave Ayatollah Khomeini an excuse to use his narrow interpretation of the Qur'an to establish a chauvinist society and that George W. Bush's current policy toward Iran gives Mahmoud Ahmadinejad an excuse to act the cowboy and to censor. Above all, this is a clear look at people who come up with ways to challenge the system. It's not a great movie, but it's worth seeing. Since all of Jafar Panahi's films are forbidden, I wonder how he can even do them.
