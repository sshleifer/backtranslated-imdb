This show is great. It has some of the best letters I've ever seen. He has a brilliant lead by translator Dvid, who has also directed another smart television series called BOY MEETS WORLD. This show has none of the greatest. Like TREI, ROSEANNE, and the famous COSBY SHOW, this will be on TV for a long time. From perfectly crafted jokes to wonderful shows, you only dreamed this is a great show for people who lived in the seventies and for those who did not. This show appeals to young people and young people to the heart. A perfect show.
