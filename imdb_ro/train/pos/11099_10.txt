Chase created a real phenomenon with the Sopranos. Dishonest performances, rock-rock writings and tremendous music make up what has become probably the best show ever. All the cast is strong, but Falco and Gandolfini have earned every inch of those Emmy. Anyone who doubts this need only hesitates a few episodes; especially from the first seasons. James Gandolfini is absolutely fierce, absolutely frightening, and yet you find yourself loving him - fascinated by him. Many people we talked about about Sopranos (who have not seen them yet) will say, "I'm not a fan of mafia movies / shows." Regardless. Run - do not walk - and take it. The same people usually love "E.R." but I bet they do not care about hospitals ... It's not about context.
