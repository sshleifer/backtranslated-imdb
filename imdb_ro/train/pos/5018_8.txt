if you are like me, then you will love this great advent of adolescent film. i think it is there with mischief / love card / high school USA / cry / calender girl / crybaby / all the great movies set in the 50s & early 60s and has a wonderful soundtrack not as many songs as in some of these types of movies, but still great.it is so very funny sometimes and has a great interest.all cast young people are great.i want there were more much of these wonderful movies.My favorite of all times is back to the future when Marty McGuys got back to 1955 well in these wonderful movies are in 50s fab (early 60s), there are some movies of this type better than this, but not many.
