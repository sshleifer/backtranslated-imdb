Okay, at first it looks like "Shrek" - lonely that is constantly followed by the comic relief. Then he evolves into something really convincing, as the glove is set. And the result is a pleasant film that has moments in which I agree that it's a little too dramatic for kids to see (Manny's past, for example). The premise has obviously been working a long time so that it can be accomplished in making a set of movies with almost countless sets (only ice caps and rocks) and three characters. It's a good thing to know that I'm doing something emotionally out of it. As I said, it can sometimes be disturbing, so the children are being warned. The real lack is the animation. This has not been as blown as the toy or shrek story films, and looks. People are unrealistic and I have seen earlier examples of CGI. But do not let this record stain: as a solo effort, "Ice Age" is commendable. And many fans will gather, I do not doubt. Oh, yeah, moments with that little mouse are priceless and the theft of shows.
