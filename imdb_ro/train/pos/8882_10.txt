John Singleton's best film before a successful film, such as the Shaft remake, is a movie that makes the thoughts, with great action and gorgeous balance between the stories of the three main characters, each with problems identifying young people . most enjoyed is that it also covers the self-esteem issue among black young people, a problem mostly ignored by the media and other films that focus more on social-economic issues and racism by whites. This film shows that blacks can be equally ignorant and racist. The great thing about this movie is that it deals with so many subjects, without being superficial. It's not just about racism, but about how hard it can be to adopt in a new world (college), rape data, discovery of sexuality and isolation. Omar Epps, Michael Rapaport and Kristy Swanson perform well, and support distribution is just as exciting as Jennifer Connelly as leech (yay) and Ice Cube and Busta Rhymes as well as colleagues who are causing small riots. <br /> <br /> The only negative is the cartoon of a professor by Laurence Fishburne ("Ment?"). Certainly, many teachers are impatient. But I'm not so flat. Skinheads are also a bit of a cartoon, but I think they are so much in real life. Generally, an undervalued movie, if you liked American X, you'll love it. <br /> <br /> 8.5 out of 10
