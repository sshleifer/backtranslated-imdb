I resisted seeing this film and I understand why it was not a great success in the theater. "October Sky" feels and looks so familiar. It's all. All the plot and the emotions of the plot have been explored before in other movies - and maybe even better. But despite the familiarity and resilience of all Hollywood formulas, this movie is winning and enjoyable at every step. <br /> <br /> Sputnik is the inspiration for this journey of heart, mind and soul. Like Steven Sondheim's musical characters, MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG, hanging on the roof of the apartment, hoping to launch their new generation ("What do you say, you call it a miracle"), Sputnik has a similar effect on young boy rockets from this true story. While the inhabitants of the 1950s coal city reject the event, Homer Hickham sees Sputnik as his lifetime ticket to me. <br /> <br /> The direction of mastery and casting make Homer's journey and his fresh and new friends. The subpopulations on Homer's troubled young teacher are particularly affected. A remarkable retention is presented in the description of their delicate relationship. Also remarkable is the supplication of the father / son who anchors the film. He played perfectly everywhere. Even Homer's mom receives a moment without clich√© or intrusion. Her ultimatum to her husband is so dignified and warm. "Myrtle Beach" says it all. <br /> <br /> A big video chain that I despise has a sign next to this movie that says you will like this movie or that you will refund your money. For once, I agree with them. You will never look at the sky in October, again the same. <br /> <br />
