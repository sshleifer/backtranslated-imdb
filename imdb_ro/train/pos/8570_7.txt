I noticed immediately that this film really did not rely on Dodie Smith's novel. In any case, it was a good idea that Pongo's son and Perdita had their own puppies now. The delight of Dalmatians was, of course, a small Snowball that was completely immaculate until the end of the film. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I did not know what to think when Cruella de Vil seemed to have changed completely. In fact, I often thought of the possibility that she might become a friend, but now that she turned so quickly into "herself" and once again announced it was Cruella, I almost started to be worried about Chloe's Dalmatians . > <br /> In fact, the scene where the bitches watched Lady and Tramp while Chloe and Kevin had dinner were much better than I expected. I also grabbed the parrot that sang like a dog and it was incredible that the dogs learned so many tricks for this movie. Of course I was pleased that at the end, the Dalmatians were saved again, but I would love to know what would happen to Cruella after she lost all of her property. And what could house dogs do with so much money? Finally, it was quite moving that Snowball had spots at the end of the movie.
