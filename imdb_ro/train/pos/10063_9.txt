Filming is nice and the environment is very realistic. I liked to boldly reopen the conception of the many difficult moral and social morals in the 1930s Chinese-continental rural area, as well as fundamental human questions - I felt that I could get a true sense of the times, recreated even in photos splendid traditional theaters of China and purist representations of street life. It sounds like the experience. The interdict role played by Buddhism is probably the most true-in-shape - both in its aspect and in the philosophical, probably the most effective one we have seen in the Chinese film. Casting is great. Images are memorable. The action is strong enough. Thematically puffed but yet rich enough to compliment the vehicle of his expression.
