Never seems to write a review of IMDb unless I am extremely surprised at how good or how bad a movie is. This movie falls into the first category. Every year, I try to see all the nominations for the best Oscar foreign film, even those I know I will not want. "As it is in heaven" seems to fit the bill. The story seems weak and sentimental and slow ... For my tastes, which are going to original, dark and bold foreign cinemas (Michael Haneke, Francois Ozon, A lot of modern Japanese / Korean cinemas) "As It Is In Heaven" does not sound very interesting ... He was not released in the US, so I sat down to see a VCD I found in Singapore, preparing to "get off the list." After a boring beginning, "As It Is In Heaven" becomes that rare movie where you really inspire what's happening on the screen. Weaknesses: The characters in the film are pure "stock" characters - The Wounded Dream, Bully City, The Wife of Love, The Loose Woman Desired of Love, The Repressed Minister ... Fortunately, they are mostly a good bunch, as well as being good written and well-acted. Ingela Olsson, as wife of Minister Inger, would have been nominated for an Oscar if her interpretation was in English. Strong points: music is beautiful, and Gabriella's main play is really dramatic and memorable. And watch for the 87-year-old actress who plays Olga's role as a dancer, as well as younger ladies! I will not discuss the end, but I will say it makes sense. There are a lot of emotional things that happen in the last hour of the movie and you're not sure why it's happening. Though nothing is explained in words, everything makes sense because the movies come to a suitable crescendo. **** from *****. Probably the most powerful Swedish film I've ever seen.
