The "classic war of the worlds" by Timothy Hines is a very entertaining film that makes obvious efforts and lengths to faithfully recreate H. G. Wells's classic book. Mister. Hines manages to do this. Me and those who watched my movie with me, appreciated that it was not the standard, predictable Hollywood tariff that comes out every year, the Spielberg version of Tom Cruise, which had only the slightest resemblance to the book. Obviously, everyone is looking for different things in a movie. Those who understand amateur "critics" just want to criticize everything they can. Others rate a movie on more important bases, such as fun, which is why most people never agree with "critics." We enjoyed the effort that Mr. Hines had made to be faithful in H.G.'s classic novel. Wells and I found it very fun. This made it easy to ignore what "critics" perceive to be its shortcomings.
