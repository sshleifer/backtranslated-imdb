Although Kris Kristofferson is good in this role, who would not want to see Elvis Pressly? With drug addiction and the fall from supreme fame could have scared Elvis's agent out of the movie, it was a mistake. It would have been a perfect movie for Elvis. Even if the soundtrack is not at all terrible, Paul Williams and Barbra Streisand make a decent job in creating an original soundtrack for the song / musical period. Somewhat a love story, it is more a drama about the fall of grace and the gift of redemption. Like most tragedies, the hero of the story has died. Also, Gary Busey is again perfect in a not so perfect role.
