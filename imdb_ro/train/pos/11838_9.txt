This is one of the quietest, relaxing and beautiful animated movies I've ever seen. With beautiful music in the movie, sounds and music can make you feel as if you were in the movie! This movie is not great for children but also for adults. He teaches you lessons, such as never forgetting who you are, doing everything you master your mind, and courage and boldness. This movie can make you cry at times, which is always a pleasant touch in movies. This movie is funny, sad, cute and keeps you on the edge of the chair! Some movies really give you a fuzzy feeling after seeing them and the movie "Spirit" is definitely one of them! With my 9/10 star vote for animation, music and a wonderful idea for a movie, it gave me a lot of Spirit!
