"Spaced Invaders" is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I do not understand why this movie did not receive better critics, it is fun, harmless and sweet. I saw the first time I was 11 years old and I really fell in love ... 2 days later I got VHS :-P So far, I showed it to many friends and I liked it all but nobody he did not know before the movie. I think this is the problem, almost nobody knows, so almost nobody can love it ... This movie has never had a real chance, it's sad, "SI" really has the potential of a comedy like "Monsters Inc . "Or" Space Balls. "Ok, enough dissatisfaction - What I really wanted to say is that if you want to laugh at your head, look at it, even if you do not get angry, it's worth looking! Prepare to laugh!
