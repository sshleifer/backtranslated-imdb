OH WOW. I saw this film on the Irish international film Fleadh in Manhattan on March 12, 2000. Both stars attended and were available for questions afterwards. WHAT IS A GORGE FILM? Although he settled in Ireland on the background of Catholic / Protestant antagonism, the story could have happened anywhere between any two groups of people who hate each other. The horror of how quickly people can be taken when given the chance to free their hatred and anger has been beautifully woven, with a humorous, fun-filled love story. If this is not taken in the US, it would be really unhappy. As for the stars and support players ... FIRST RATE. They call Orla Brady Irish Meryl Streep, I heard. I think she's better than Meryl Streep. He should call Meryl, Orla Brady, American! And the constant and strong portrayal of Liam Cunningham of a simple and private man aspired to a political war was brilliant. See this movie.
