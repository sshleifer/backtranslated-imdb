This is one of the few comedies I can watch again and again and still laugh aloud. In other places, I have read complaints about racism and sexism from politically sanctimonious and fair looks. There is no here, unless you define sexism as a woman as a housewife and racism as a family with a colorful maid. The lines are hilarious and all the leadership has never been better. Melvin Douglas is particularly brilliant. If you've ever thought of, or tried to build a new house, you will be relieved to know that no matter how frightening the process, no matter how much a lamb is among the wolves, you may feel, you are not alone!
