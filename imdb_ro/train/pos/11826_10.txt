I did not attend the midnight show of a movie before I left "Dick Tracy". I still have the "T-shirt" I had to wear to be admitted to the show somewhere around here, and like that shirt, "Dick Tracy" has stayed with me ever since. If you saw the movie, sharp images, enlightened primary colors, and powerful characters were undoubtedly engraved in the brain. It's a wonder to look at. As a director / star / co-writer / producer, Beatty knows what works in a movie and shows him here, taking a familiar American icon and re-educating it for a whole new era. Still set in the 1930s, "Tracy" has a timeless quality like all the good movies. I lost track of how many times I watched "Tracy" and still catch something new every time I do. The others are all the best, starting with Pacino's Big Boy Caprice recalling that he can make comedy with the best of them), even Mahoney's Breathless Mahoney is a goodbye to the fact that in the right environment she can act (GASP! ). <br /> <br /> But there are still touched themes as the need of the family, preserving themselves, good for the evil, even explored Macao-themes. Strange for a comic strip, but hey, it works. Overall, "Dick Tracy" is a classic for himself. Compared to other films of this decade, he makes a strong statement. It is a good, powerful film that does not depend on blood, violence, profanity or nudity to make its point of view. <br /> <br /> There is a lesson to be learned here. <br /> <br /> Ten stars. Great Scott!
