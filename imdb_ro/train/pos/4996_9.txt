I have seen many HK actions, and this is right at the top of the genre. The action scenes are as exciting and kinetic as anything you've ever seen in any action movie. Kung fu is spectacular, pyrotechnic with eye-popping, heart stunt work. Editing is perfect, boosting tension and complimenting the fluid room. This film is directed by old pro Corey Yuen, whose CV is filled with some of the best works of the genre, including the Jet Li Legend of Fong Sai-Yuk. If there is something lacking in this film, it is the presence of a three-dimensional character, although Martin, the male leader, is closest to him. This movie is full of archetypes, rather than characters - the sexy killer, the hoof and the villain, his weird girlfriend, the wandering villains. That being said, Shannon Lee has a terrible presence on the screen; It's great with fights, stunts, and weapons. When it's on the screen, it's hard to get your eyes off her. It is so good. Why is not this woman an important star?
