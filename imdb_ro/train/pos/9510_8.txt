In the winter of 1931, it is assumed that Tyler Hoechlin, 12, (Michael Sullivan Jr.), wonders what his maid father Tom Hanks (Michael "Mike" Sullivan) is doing. Young Hoechlin follows Mr. Hanks to "work" one night and confesses to destroying rival gangsters. This leads - in a very different way - to Paul Newman (as John Rooney), hiring Jude Law (as Harlen Maguire) to discover Hoechlin and Hanks. Hanks thinks they will be safe with a relative, which is embarrassed when considering the characters' line of work. Looking neatly like Paul Peterson ("The Donna Reed Show"), Hoechlin does a great job for director Sam Mendes; and the work with this piece makes the lucky actor in 2002. But the most striking thing about "Road to Perdition" is the amazing cinematography of Conrad L. Hall, who earned a deserved career for the "Academy Award" for the late photographer . Mr Hall's activity is truly superlative. This helps to offset the overall impression of a measured internship, drawn both to narrative and vision. The deflected end is suddenly uplifting (the unrelated dog is an example of the above mentioned internship). Road to Perdition (7/12/02) Sam Mendes ~ Tom Hanks, Tyler Hoechlin, Paul Newman, Jude Law
