We found this challenging film and its ambiguity in a fast-paced world where we are manipulated to love the "good guy" and hate the "bad guy." Scott Cohen, a very beautiful television actor, does a great job of describing the black sheep of the lost family / child who aspires to win the love and respect of his father, as well as that of his brother-in-law widow with whom he has history. Judd Hirsch plays against his grandfather's usual image as a father who has triangulated his sons and is now left with the one he has always rejected. When I saw this at the Tribeca Film Festival, I was wonderfully amazed how the sawdust was used to describe a family tradition, as the director explains. This is a suitable successor to the classic "People". I just realized that Judd Hirsch was in this too!
