This whole piece about adults who returned to the formal summer camp of their youth was a very quiet and exiting participant at cinemas in the autumn of 1993. I would say it was a shame but then again some of the best AER movies that enjoy a wide variety of songs that do not enjoy too much hype or praise. Diane LAne, Kevin Pollack, Elizabeth Perkins, Vincent Spano, Julie Warner, Bill Paxton, Kimberly Williams, Matt Craven and Alan Arkin) are the group of actors who embrace these roles as people who have grown up with good, bad and fun memories of in the past. This film covers the most glamorous gambling of emotions, and the film never beats the spectator to feel what the characters feel, preferring to allow the spectator to enter into memories on their own. Since I am a filmmaker who is embellished in blunt, brutal manipulation in films, this is something I appreciate from writer / director Mike Binder. This movie is a cheap rent, a good rent and even good a good sitting in a theater scene. You might get over this on TV and I would definitely suggest a look.
