Hurray! A space movie that is not taken seriously and everyone can come together for an exciting journey, which is a space camp. The film starts slowly, the usual mix of idiots and big butterflies mix together in a troublesome soup. But when it goes gets hard - hard to get themselves sorted and it's not an unbelievable change in characters because you can think there is some responsibility in their young mind. The only flaw in the movie is that Kate Capshaw is extremely annoying as the instructor "I'm right and you're wrong." I would recommend this as a pleasant night in the movie and a vote.
