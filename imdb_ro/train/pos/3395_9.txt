This is a fantastic SF movie, which is very strange in the way men and women see the same movie. I talked to many about the movie and almost every guy loved it and said it was brilliant - while most women thought it was just disgusting and stupid! This is the only movie I know about having a polarized vision based on gender. Perhaps many women have only a lower tolerance for disgusting or depressing plots - but whatever the cause, we have always found this fascinating difference. The film begins with a murder and a subsequent investigation led by Charlton Heston. This is set in the near future, and the head of the huge international corporation Soylent has been assassinated. As the movie unfolds, you quickly realize that it is a terrible and very unfair American society. The wealthy live in gorgeous suites for sure and all the pleasures they can buy money (including "the furniture" - a euphemism for paid mistress that comes with the apartment). At the same time, the masses are poor, unemployed and in many cases live in abandoned cars or in apartment suites. Overcrowding and smog have had a severe impact, and the future seems really terrible! <br /> <br /> Why the rich man died and the terrible truth that he could not truly live NO should talk about - could ruin the movie for you. However, the film has an action-packed plot and is very interesting to watch. In addition, he presents Edward G. Robinson in his final screen performances as Heston. Although not for those slightly depressed or squeamish, this is a fantastic science fiction movie that is allegorical and profound.
