Has it ever been a more charming movie than this one? One of the reasons why everything works so well is that the group of actors seems to interact and have an effect on each other's life. The center is the "romanticism" of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, who work together and can not meet face to face but who connect anonymously completely as friends. But there are also characters who support and, unlike many romantic comedies (including "You've received the mail", the recent update of "Shop"), are not just whipped to support the two customers and their needs. Everybody becomes a complicated part of Ernst Lubitsch's wealth of charm. One of the most impressive scenes in the history of the film takes place when Frank Morgan, almost tragically, is humorously, humiliatingly seeking someone to take the Christmas dinner. I need to see! **** of ****
