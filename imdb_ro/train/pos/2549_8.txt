Ronald Coleman, wonderfully urban, is presented here as some of his other films. He is literally in every scene and this comic film remains fresh because of it, not in spite of it. He is beautiful, smart and very smart here because he remains a step ahead of his wandering and wonderful wife - perfectly played by Anna Lee. The film is based on a French piece and brings all the best qualities of that phrase. Most of the supporting parts are well known, at least by the way, if not by name ... and are absolutely perfect for this very funny movie. Fantastic Mr. Coleman is a combination of Sean Connery and Clark Gable, one step ahead of the other characters. His many talents can be further appreciated in the classic "Lost Horizon", which each film director has to see.
