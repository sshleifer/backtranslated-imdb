I cherish every frame of this wonderful movie. They are ordinary people, people we all know, who suffer little in their lives and have luggage that can be worn around them. Like us all. Robert DeNiro, Ed Harris and Kathy Baker inspire their lives in their portraits and are excellent, but Harris is really upsetting and therefore very real. I'll swear it's really a trucker who's drinking, so he's not gonna have to feel anything. Baker, as his sister put on, also has some delicate moments - when DeNiro gives his flowers in a single scene, it seems she has never been given flowers and probably was not. It is very worthwhile.
