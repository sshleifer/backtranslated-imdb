very few chess films have been made over the last few years, but this is more than just a chess movie a story about the need to be loved and about the need to win it, John Toturro plays a psychic man provoked, nothing matters to He accepts 64 squares and 32 pieces, the game validates him as a person when he loses a game he loses the only thing that makes sense to him and John Torturro expresses it in a beautiful manner even the love of a woman was enough to save him from his sad existence. It makes you wonder if there are other Luzon out there who obsess over the game, I'm sure I am, if you are a chess enthusiast will not hurt to follow him. It is a smart work piece duly set and executed well, it achieves its goals, unfortunately I doubt if it will continue.
