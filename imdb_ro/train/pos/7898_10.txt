This movie received terrible reviews, but because it was off-beat and because critics do not usually "get" offbeat movies, I thought I would try. Unfortunately, these were largely in this case. The movie has only a strange feeling too, that it is most of the putting. What kind of feeling is impossible to describe, but it is not a good one. To continue to confuse things, the script is an unwavering thing that is only vaguely interesting. The very talented Thurman walks through this mess, which only creates an impact. Hurt and Bracco are in vain trying to add something to the movie with enthusiastic performance, but there is nothing in the script. It might have been less embarrassing for them if they had only chosen to join and carry with Thurman. One thing that "honest" film critics did not mention is that the movie is actually quite funny. Whether it's moments of precise satire or odd strange moments, such as when the hunting girls in question aim to hurt their ranch with the smell of their ass ... unwanted. chortles touched all along, while I would not recommend this movie, there is entertainment to be had and even watching Cowgirls Get Blues deserves for something different.
