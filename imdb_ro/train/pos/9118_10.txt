I saw this film through a special examination of Owen Alik Shahadah's work. It's so exciting where this guy came from. Now he is probably the main independent African director in the world. And I'm not talking about black film makers talking about someone who has roots in culture. The idea if anything proves diversity and the range of African themes with its 500-year-old film is an African issue. But the idea does not match the mold. Showing artistic diversity. The film is a distribution from Africa, but the subject is a human subject that most of us can refer to. I like the gentle comedy very much. And the Kora of Tunde Jegede is just amazing, it's really a jewel of art.
