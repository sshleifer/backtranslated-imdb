I can not believe people are looking for a plot in this movie. This is Laur and Hardy. Lighten already. These two were a revolt. Their comic genre is just as funny today as 70 years ago. No great word in the mouth and managed to keep the audience in seams. Their comedy was not sophisticated by any stretching. If a pillow can not make you laugh, there's no reason to look at the things these guys have done. It was a simpler time, and people laughed at things that were fun without a plot. I think it takes a simple mind to enjoy these things, so I qualify myself. Two human comedy teams do not count, we're too sophisticated ... Are not we lucky?
