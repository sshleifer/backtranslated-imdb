I just finished watching this movie, which bothered me a lot. There have also been in South Africa twice, around the time this movie is set. It's certainly hard to hit, and opening scenes tend to "set the scene." Slow but constant rhythm growth does not allow a break and there are certainly some moments of light. He will never be able to see Nigel Hawthorne again. He came as a very twisted individual and I woke up desperately every time he appeared. I totally agree with Steve-thomp's articulated and well thought-out comments.
