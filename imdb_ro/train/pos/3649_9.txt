I have seen a lot of TV movies during my time as a student, most of the normal time lost by American television. However, it was well done and represented graphically and had a very beautiful turn at the end. After seeing Richard Dean Anderson in MacGyver and Stargate, I was surprised by his excellent performance, rather than the wide range of A-B expressions he normally offers. It was a delightful surprise to see Daphne Zuniga after a long time since The Fly II. Also nice to see Robert Guillaumme in a leading role again. I can not say I took Jane Leeves seriously after Benny Hill's days, but managed to do well in her role. All in all a highly recommended movie.
