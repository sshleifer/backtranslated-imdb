On the surface, "Written on the Wind" is a telenoveelita, mirrored, about the sexual dysfunctions of a Texas oil family. But beneath him is a profound social commentary about the life of the 1950s. Director Douglas Sirk scores again with another university. Robert Stack falls in love with Lauren Bacall. The problem is that Stack's best friend, Rock Hudson, loves her too. When Stack finds it sterile and Bacall is pregnant, the fireworks fly. Dorothy Malone earned an Oscar for her portrait of the biggest nympho in Texas, which is avoided by Hudson. Good evening epic drama.
