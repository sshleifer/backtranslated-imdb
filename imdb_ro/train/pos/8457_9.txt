Gundam Wing for me is going to be a good anime. A slow movement (especially in the middle of the series), but quite enjoyable. Now before someone jumps on my back and tells me a "thorn", I'll admit that I've been watching all the original Gundam, Gundam 0080 and 0083, Team 08, and the Gundam SEED Team. I will admit that there have been some problems with the story and some characters may seem to be "rip-off" (ie Zechs Marquise at the original Gundam's Char), but this is an alternative universal show based on the original series, like SEED. If you want to see this series, make sure you first look at the original Gundam and then you know that you are watching an AU series.
