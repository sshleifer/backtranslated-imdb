Gentleman Jim is another legend printing case, with Errol Flynn playing legendary boxer as a shameless, but charismatic social climber in a rollicking entertainment that stops barely for breathing. It's just as futile in looking for the historical accuracy here is in Flynn's commission of the Light Brigade - this is pure hokum, with all it stands out, shot on a surprisingly generous scale and considering a real sense of energy in the direction of the living Raoul Walsh . Flynn is still at the height of his powers (you have not guessed he suffered a mild heart attack during production), with Alexis Smith a beautiful romantic sparring partner and perpetual acolith Alan Hale along for a good deal of this time as Flynn's father (Jack Carson takes Sidekick duties this time). Indeed, even the pirate gallon from Flynn's previous films makes a somehow out-of-place cameos in a Dockside match! The 103 minutes just the breeze.
