Every time I have tears in my eyes when I watch a movie there are few. And there is only one time when I really cried and then I saw the movie. This movie has a few clicks, but I do not care. I cry even when I write this, and it's been a while since I saw it. It is perfectly acted and all production values ​​are good, but what really matters is the simple and wonderful message. We all know it in our hearts, but it is not always easy to remember that the only thing that really matters in life is LOVE in all its forms. Only when we like to be truly alive. I know how much it sounds like, and I promise I'm not usually like that. I'm pretty cynical. This movie has brought in me feelings of greater pain and happiness in me than any other film and it will probably always be the first film I recommend to others to see it.
