Yes, the archetype of a simple but inspirational film. The last end when all the crowd in the stadium rises and people raise their hands gives me a cold whenever I see it. That's just brilliant. Joseph is wonderful as the lonely and sad child, who has so far been disappointed by anyone and anything in his life. The way he interacts with Danny Glover and tries to make him believe in magic and the angel is fun and charming. A very beautiful family movie, with a feat - a happy ending. But, hey, it does not matter, the movie retains its basic quality through good themes and inspirational themes.
