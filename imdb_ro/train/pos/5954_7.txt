I feel there a combination of confusion and different degrees of personal taste in the reactions to this movie. Yes, there are vampire stereotypes. Yes, there are scientific stereotypes here. Even the martial arts stereotypes. All good and good, and certainly not all perfectly accomplished. However, I feel a crucial point about this film being overlooked ... the cultural significance of its location. The movie is set in Pensacola, Florida, and does not try to avoid saying that. This is a bold move in today's movie world and a rare treatment for fans of indy movies. And indeed, maybe it is not the last one. Pensacola is world renowned as a maritime city, a city of aviation, a city of timber and sometimes even a heat for political controversy. It is rarely seen as a growing city town. But that's changing now. Several film companies come to shoot. And more Native Pensacolists discover the power of cinema for themselves. This film is part of an ascending trend of indigenous films based on Pensacola, and they are still on their way. Pensacola makes a great noise in the global cinema community, and by and by, the world takes more attention. Look and listen, world. The Pensacolians are coming. Like a virus.
