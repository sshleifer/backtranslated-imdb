I have read many committees when it was in the theater and all was bad ... I think you have to be a certain type of person to enjoy these movies. If you are not a person who has enjoyed Waltons or Little House ... U will not understand or enjoy these movies ... Now about Loves Abiding Joy ... I knew he was bad news at the beginning of the movie .... I would like to have shown more than an end instead of letting you believe. This movie has a lot to do with Jeff .... it's 6 years later, so you know he'll be interested in Girls. I mean, I enjoyed all four movies so far. ... He was not crazy about the books ... You can not wait until the next movie. The way Clark talks will get you every time. I'd love to see Jan Jones make an appearance ... Maybe a family reunion or something like that.
