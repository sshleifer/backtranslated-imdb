I always had the philosophy that every human being has different tastes, I have discovered this movie as wonderful and I think every college student could agree with me. However, it is not a "movie with a plot", about the real boys and about some "problems" they are facing. I found the hilarious movie (especially the songs that jokes played on each other). Simply put, if you are in the same "wavelength" as these people, you will find this amazing movie. I do not think they will win Golden Globes or Oscars, or that the people in this movie will become future Hollywood stars, but a kind of "classical cult" among young people who can relate to their experience. For me, the most remarkable is Hans: the Scandinavian, who, according to him, "is not a looker," but receives all (or some) of the chickens. "Little-people" also play an important role in the film, especially when they are drunk. If I go on, I could offer a spoiler and I do not want to do that, go and get the movie and you will not regret it. I give it 8/10
