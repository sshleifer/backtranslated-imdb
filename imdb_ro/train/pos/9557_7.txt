I like this anime! I'm laughing at my head with all the jokes and violence (most of Akane Ranma's reluctant "fiancee") is so poor, but Ranma deserves it, but she tries everything she can to make ... embarrassing changes. The main character Ranma goes to China to train only to fall into the damn spring of Jusenkkyo and turns into a girl when sprinkled with cold water. Since then there is pure chaos one after another. Among the stand-out options are Kuno and Kodachi's disturbed brother and duo, the sexy shampoo, the perverse Happosai, which causes problems for our hero / heroine. However, Ranma's emancipatory father, Genma, is accused of being the one who has condemned misery most of the time. If someone wants an anime that's funny, that's one. He is cute and better with the Japanese oak.
