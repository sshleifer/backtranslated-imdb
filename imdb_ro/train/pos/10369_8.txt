"A murder in the dark" is a cinematic, haunted and incredibly challenging piece of play. The true story of Lindy Chamberland, who, in 1980, saw a horrible vision, seeing her three-month-old baby brutally taken from his family's tent while on the Austrailian field. Azaria (the baby) has never been seen before, and the result of her horrible disappearance has caused a real frenzy of life all over the world. Meryl Streep makes Lindy's role right, as he always does. But the only thing that helps "A murder in the dark" never collapses, it's the brilliant direction. A truly inspirational and accurate perspective on this shock case, tears are brought to the eye. The concept is nothing but terrifying, and then you are haunted, but also inspired.
