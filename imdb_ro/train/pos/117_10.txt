Lars von Trier Europe is a worthy echo of the third man, about an American who comes to Europe after the Second World War and is embroiled in a dangerous mystery. Jean-Marc Barr plays Leopold Kessler, a German-American who refused to join the US Army during the war, arriving in Frankfurt as soon as the war ended to work with his uncle as a Zentropa sleeping car master . What he does not know is that the war is secretly conducted secretly with an underground terrorist group called The Werewolves targeting the American allies. Leopold strongly opposes any party but is attracted and seduced by Katharina Hartmann (Barbara Sukowa), the fatal daughter of the railway company's owner. Her father was a Nazi sympathizer, but was pardoned by US colonel Harris (Eddie Considine) for helping to resume the German transport system. The Colonel recruits or forces Leopold to be a spy (without giving him a chance to think of him) to see if the witches could attack the trains. Soon, Leopold is stuck in an adventure by being involved in both sides of the conflict in a mysterious and noir-ish movie in which everyone is still not what it seems. It's amazing to watch the naive Leopold altogether (his lover, the terrorists, the colonel, the annoying passengers, his unhappy uncle, even the railway company officials who come to examine his work ethic) before he finally boils and with Humor and Violence Control. The film is unpredictable without end. The movie was shot with style, always taking place at night in winter, with a lot of snow falling. His black and white shoot with color shots that appear at random. Also, wallpapers displaying images that counteract front images. Add the hypnotic narrative of Max von Sydow, and Europe becomes a dream place outside of this world. This is now my favorite personal film.
