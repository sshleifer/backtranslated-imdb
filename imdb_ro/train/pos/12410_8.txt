This is an excellent example of what can be done on a low-budget movie. The actor is excellent considering the scenario and the whole atmosphere of the film is very preoccupying. The gore is well made and used easily (attention to the excellent death of the barbed wire) and the action is punch when used. It is true that in the scenario there are sometimes urgent lines, but compared to other films of the same budget (or higher!), It's hard to notice. This is generally recommended. Believe me, it's better than it seems! 8/10
