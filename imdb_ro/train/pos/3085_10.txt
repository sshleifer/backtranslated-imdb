I watched the on-the-aired online episodes and I was so sad that the show will not come back. It had the best distribution of mature and talented actors and amazing chemistry. It seemed that all actors were personal friends in real life. By the end of the show, she began to get involved, sexy and extremely vigilant. Of course, some of the story lines are not realistic, so what ... Characters are all pleasing and rooted for them. The show reminded me of a cross between two favors: "Sex and the City" and "Felicity". Great kudos for all distribution. Notice to ABC executors: Nielsen ratings do not show you real results. The show audience will record the bulk. I was very disappointed by the major networks that flooded us with reality-show or teenage TV shows. Why get a mature, thoughtful, well-behaved material, must we go to HBO or FX? I can only thank the network for putting the rest of the episodes online. The new media stream will gain more and more popularity among viewers.
