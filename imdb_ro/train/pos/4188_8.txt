Samuel Fuller is an interesting director, mainly because he has had very inconsistent politics in his films. While "Shock Corridor" and "Kiss Naked" represented America's hypocrisy and greed, and "The Big One One" was an effective portrait of the horrors of the war, Merrill's Marauders painted the war as hell and Pickup on South Street "it is about the dangers of communist spies. All his films make a very fun view and, although he was often praised as a film producer, Fuller was as good as any of the studio's main entrepreneurs. "Pickup on South Street" is no exception, and despite the dated themes, the shooting style is remarkable before its time. It is also a very fast film, fast paced, and sometimes brutal film. Richard Widmark is a great anti-hero, and Jean Peters is pretty sexy as a girl working for her communist spy boyfriend. The theft of the show is Thlema Ritter, however, in an absolutely delightful performance like a police stool. The Unglars that Fuller uses are great, making sequences of action even more exciting and brutal (this is very violent for his time). The room moves continuously, just as Tarantino and his school would do forty years later. "Pickup on South Street" is a great thriller of noir in rhythm of action. "Shock Corridor" is my favorite film, Fuller, but this is a very close second. (8/10)
