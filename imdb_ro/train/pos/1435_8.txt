I appreciate movies like this: smart and well-crafted, fun, absorbent, well-focused and well-targeted. No one - even Pacino - chews the landscape *, trying to stand out; one of the most effective moments of the movie (Aielo shooting at the beloved ramp) is cooling down precisely because of its constraint. Not as good as QUIZ SHOW, CITY HALL is a similar cloth: hiring the mind as well as eye, ear and heart. Why such entertainment flames at the box office are supposed by someone. You know, Pacino chews him up in a certain scene, precisely because it's necessary. The big scene, too.
