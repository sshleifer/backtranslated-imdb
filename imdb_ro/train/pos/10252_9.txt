After watching Guinea Pig, they have two minds (besides "Am I really a psychopath to see this?"): "Is it a tobacco?" The answer is no; although it's the closest thing to a snuff film I've ever seen. And then: "Where the hell did they find the girl?" Because she is tortured for 45 minutes without any reason (in fact, there is nothing else in this movie!): Hand clothes, legs, tools, worm infestation, ... and much more the final scene (I'm still not sure how they did that). Because it's part of the "Japanese underground scene," it's obvious that it did not get too much money. So, what were her motivations? I saw it in Japanese without subtitles, but it's not a problem (there are no real dialogues, boys insult it only in a few scenarios). I have not seen the whole series yet, but the first "Guinea Pig" is not known to be the best. Still, I rated 8, because if the purpose was to make people believe this, it's pretty good (ask Charlie Sheen, the actor). But I think they could go further, what they did in the next. Another movie I hide from my parents. <br /> <br /> 8/10
