It's been a couple of years since I saw this, but remember and want to see it again. This has become a kind of "therapy" for me, with my own personal experience. A thirty-five-year-old man complains about a high school baseball game in which he "missed the ball" and his team lost. He thinks this 20 years later, "if I hit only that ball" and how his life would be better for that. Then he has the chance to find out ... and becomes a little more than negotiated. Remind me so much when I was in high school, I tried twice for our drill / dance team and failed. This team was closest to a sorority in my school. If you were on it, you were "all that". I have not tried until the last two years of HS, and after the second time I took it very hard. I hit and stabbed my bad foot just before the trials and wearing socks to cover the bruise, and that made me fail. That was in 1987. Over the years, even now, sometimes, I think "If I had not hit my foot, I would never have worn those stupid heels." Now I'm not sitting and thinking that my life would be better or even different if I did, but seeing this movie made me realize that we never really know how things can be different changing a thing small back in the past. Who knows, it could have changed the course of events to the point where I would not have met my son's father. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has that time in the past that he wants to change. Be careful what you wish for!!!
