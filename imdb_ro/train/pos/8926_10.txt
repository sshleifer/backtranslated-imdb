I do not think anybody near Terrence Malick and maybe Tran Anh Hung makes the cinema cleaner than Claire Denis. That being said, I do not like this movie, the newest movie, as much as her 2001 masterpiece "Trouble Every Day" (although it comes very close), which is one of my favorite films. It's just because the narrative is possibly a little too elliptical for its own sake. Do not misunderstand me, the fact that this film barely has a plot is really one of the best things about it, but I think Denis took it a step further than it had to go and, consequently, the film is flirting with some incomprehensibility and some key points of plot should have been somehow clarified (as if the main character goes to South Korea to transfer heart transplant instead of showing it at once without an explanation about the place where he is or why he is there). Also some of the other characters seemed unnecessary and as if it were just an excuse for Denis to use the actors he loves once more (Beatrice Dalle's character, in particular, is a little distracting because you still expect it had a certain meaning). Still, the movie is incredibly absorbed and cinema is beyond striking. It is certainly a masterpiece in its own way. At least as good as Denis "best-acclaimed" Beau travail "if not better Claire Denis must be my favorite French director at this moment, better than Leos Carax, and I must also admit that the South Korean sequence really does better than the movie itself (and I, unlike some, are also a great fan of the film).
