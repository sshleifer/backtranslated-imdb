Over-average film and acting partially spoiled by the completely predictable story line. Even music is chosen so the words fit the action every time. A smell of camp "Pleasantville" is stuck around this movie. As a period piece, it's more accurate than not. Describing the tragedy of the company's cities and the lack of upward mobility is difficult but moving. Chris Cooper turns into a first class performance like Howard's father.
