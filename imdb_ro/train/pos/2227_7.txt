It will receive reviews across the map as it does not fit comfortably with any mold. It's horrible ... but not a splatterfest. It's part of both Suspension and Horror - but without Hollywood's usual screaming and jerky camera. <br /> <br /> I feel the movie is back-up and weak without any special effects because I think you should listen and look at the faces of the characters. Look at the fact that Brendan is a graduate of the Buffy Universe. It's a red herring. He acts here. The field is a misinterpretation of the tone of this story. Adrienne Barbeau gives a solid performance to rock, so she has to think the script has something to say. We all know the excuses that the actors do not care for and just wait for the director to create "Cut" and get their salaries. This is not the case here. Forgive him for the fact that bodies start to fall almost mondo-funny. I do not think the intention was humorous - but keep you balanced. <br /> <br /> Think less of a horror movie and more of a horror game on a scene that lowers the white house. Then you can see that it is paranoia, fear and spiral madness, located in an isolated place in the USA. And it's controversial. Time travel, mind control, secret experiments, and Nazis that can NOT be dead. . . I say I rent it and try it if you are in a state of mind for something less cerebral. That would be a good choice for a Midnight Saturday to sit down.
