I saw the VCR and I found it fascinating. I do not know anything about this true story, I thought, "Oh, no, P.Brosnan as an American Indian (" Indian red in the movie), what a bad choice "until I discovered the truth about Gray Owl. The film does a good job of demonstrating the dignity of these peoples and of undermining the racist myths about them. And Annie Galipeau, WOW, what beauty and very convincing as an Indian woman (I think she is French-Canadian, she returns to their too familiar speech). Despite the detached style of Brosnan, he finally comes convincingly as a passionate, dedicated man. The plot is a bit weak in demonstrating its transformation from the trapper to the conservatory of animals. Good film, highly recommended.
