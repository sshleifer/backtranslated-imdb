I do not understand the low rating of 5.7 on this movie. It's a delight for those who love a powerful plot of suspense and the dark atmosphere. The tone reminds Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, to the local (Savannah). The actress is strong and I was amazed at the authenticity of Kenneth Branagh's southern accent. Famke Jansen is great, Robert Duval is effective in a small part, and Embeth Davitz is BOMB. The scene of complete nudity and nudity of her as well. The land is quite standard but actually executed.
