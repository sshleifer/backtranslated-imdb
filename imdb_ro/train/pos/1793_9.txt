I saw this movie on Sunday afternoon. I loved this movie absolutely. I liked everything from the foolish moments of mothers and daughters to scenes where Mamie Gummer (Lila) is crying because of her poor decision to marry a man for her parents and not because she is really in love. I liked these moments because they were so real. At first I was really scared, because I hope it will not end like Bobby, which was a big cast, but a badly written, real-world movie. But in the middle of the movie I felt completely different. You will laugh and cry, but eventually you will want to see the Evening once again. Believe me, when I say,
