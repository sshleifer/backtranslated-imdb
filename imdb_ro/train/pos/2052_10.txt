I do not have much to add to my summary, this movie is ranked there with Top Gun as one of the funniest movies ever made while not trying to be. I do not think it should be taken seriously when viewed as very enjoyable. I do not think he's bringing Christopher Walken's reputation, whether his reputation was halfway back then anyway. It took Pulp Fiction to awaken him from his sleep. As for Michael Ironside, he was in some of the funniest while not trying to be serious movies. Total Recovery, Top Gun. What I think is amazing is the budget of this movie. Scenes and actors, explosions, etc. are quite amazing, so obviously someone liked it a lot and was willing to risk a lot of money. Who was he or she, I love them because I love this movie! <br /> <br /> If someone reads this, they are looking for information about McBain (and I seriously doubt it will be too much) I just know it's a hilarious movie and should be seen with a smile on your face!
