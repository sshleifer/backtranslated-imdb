When I saw this movie again, it seemed infinitely superior to me this time than when I saw it. The act is amazingly wonderful. Characters are very clearly drawn. Brad Pitt is simply gorgeous as the loser son who is revolting. The other actors and actresses are as good in all respects. Robert Redford creates a wonderful timepiece from the 1920s speculation. The landscape is incredibly beautiful among the mountains and western Montana courses. Generally, this is one of the best movies made in the 1990s. <br /> <br /> You have to see this movie! <br /> <br />
