This is an extremely well-done film. The actor, script and room work are all first class. Music is good, although it is earlier in the movie, when things are still quite cheerful. There is no superstar in cast, though more faces will be familiar. The whole castor has a great job with the script. But it's hard to look, because there is no end to a situation like this. It is now up to you to blame the British to establish the other Hindus and Muslims and then to crucify them in two countries. There are some merits in this regard, but it is true that no one has forced the Hindus and Muslims in the region to wander each other, as they did during the division. It seems much more likely that the British have simply seen the tensions between religions and were smart enough to exploit them for their own purposes. The result is that there is a lot of cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and it is very unpleasant to remember and see on the screen. But it is never painted as a black and white case. There is the rest and nobility on both sides and also the hope of changing the younger generation. There is a sort of ransom, finally, when Puro has to make a hard choice between a man who has destroyed his life but has really loved her and her family who gave up her, then come later to look for her. But at this point, she has no option that will not be a great pain for her. This film bears the message that both Muslims and Hindus have serious mistakes and also that both can be worthy and carefree people. The reality of partition makes this realization even more terrible, because there can be no real reconciliation between the boundaries between India and Pakistan. In this sense, it is similar to "Mr. & Mrs. Iyer". Finally, we were glad to see the movie, although the resolution was inconvenient. If Britain and the US could treat their own stories of racism with this kind of sincerity, it would certainly be better.
