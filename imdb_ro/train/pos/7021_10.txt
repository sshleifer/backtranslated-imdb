I had the pleasure of attending a visit to The Pacific and Eddy last weekend at the International Film Festival in Santa Barbara. This movie caught my attention a little earlier when I came across an article about him in the Jalouse magazine. It seemed interesting at that time, but nothing too interesting. Anyway, I saw her in the festival schedule and decided to check it out. All I can say is that I was speechless when the final credits began to roll. This is one of the most beautiful and refreshing movies I've seen in a while. Photography, the direction of art, acting, and especially the direction, were unparalleled and impeccable. Nothing is "clarified" for you in this movie and actually makes you think. Something that most of today's films do exactly the opposite. Dialogue is carefully made and although this scenario is not a wall to wall, character words are deliberate and meaningful. It's definitely one of those movies that deserves a second view and the more you see the more things you notice. It's a very layered and intelligent film. He's not sure when or where he's playing again, but you have to see a movie enthusiast.
