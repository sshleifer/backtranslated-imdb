Well, I saw "everyone laughed" when it came out in Europe around 1982 and kept a vague but dear souvenir of it. I just saw her again on the tape, almost twenty years after ... Bogdanovici has a real sense of heart in his characters and a pleasant sympathy, which is not at all easy. Excellent comedians and actors, good lines everywhere and for everyone and fairly good editing. I laughed and I smiled all the time. As we sometimes do, sometimes. Go and get it.
