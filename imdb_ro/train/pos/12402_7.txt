**Warning! Spoilers Ahead! <br /> <br /> This short is a part of two that explains the short part of the "Matrix" in which Morpheus explains how the matrix arrived. Because we already know the story, the plot itself is not a surprise; and short is not as entertaining as informative. But it is presented as a file in the historical archives. The visuals are better than the average, and the colors in general, cold, help to the purpose of short. A number of problems. Violence in the story is a little useful and, combined with the occasional dose of political correctness (UN scenarios), falls from the straight narration of the short ones. In addition, you must be seen with Part Two to be complete. The Animatrix concept is brilliant and, despite some issues, this short yet fulfills its purpose. It would not be appropriate in the original movie in style, content or flow. This is the perfect method to reveal history. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: Good Information. It could have been a little better, but a solid 7 out of 10.
