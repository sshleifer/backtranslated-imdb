In this film, JUST was executed as production code, Jean Harlow is Eadie, and Patsy Kelly is "Kitty". The Missouri girl starts with the girls who board a train, and Eadie makes a promise of earning money while looking for a millionaire husband, remaining whole - some in the process. He does not need much time to meet Frank Cousins, (Lewis Stone, he was the good doctor at Grand Hotel, and Judge Hardy in "Andy Hardy"), but it's not all that looks like. to have Harlow's love: "A girl could not accept an expensive gift like a gentleman if she was not engaged." Later, someone says, "You know we've never been alone together," and Eadie answers "Yes, and we will not be!" Lionel Barrymore is T.R. Paige, the other rich, the tallest, who comes to save her when it comes to Eadie. At one point, Paige says, "You have to scratch me out of the list - I'm not a ladies man." I wonder what that line would have been just a few years before Hayes's code came to town. What does he say? Carol Tevis seems to be the "Baby Talker," as it is written in credits from IMDb. Apparently it was only in the showbiz from 1931 to 1939, with "Munchkin" in the Wizard of Oz being the last part he played. Fun, clean the girls looking for men from all over the country. Looking for Nat Pendleton as a lifeguard who was a 1920 Olympic gold medalist, he became a film star (he was in many of Dr. Kildares and appeared in Harlow's four films.) Wrong identity, the young Franchot Tone, love stories, even Jean Harlow in a swimsuit in Palm Beach, although outdoor downtown scenes seem to be a background.
