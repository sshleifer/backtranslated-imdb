The romantic delicate romantic comedy, intertwined thinly, and the actors who break lines with each other with a precise comedy program, a beautiful girl. When Cher's fianc√© did not ask him to help him make peace with his farther brother, no one could see the consequences that followed. Operational symbolism, Catholic church confessions, love balls and snow falling ... "Moonstruck" is timeless and smooth. It takes about 15 minutes for the rhythm of the image to be hit (there is an early sequence with his grandfather and his dogs from the cemetery that is a bit rough and a scene with Cosmo and with the old man at the gate that seems obtuse) but the mosaic of the plot is interconnected with a skillful skill, and the bold tone of the film and the spirit of coconut are both infectious. *** 1/2 from ****
