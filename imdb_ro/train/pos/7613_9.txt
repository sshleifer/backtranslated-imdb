The first episode I saw from Lost made me think, I thought about what people were crashing down and were watched by a giant monster. But it is not so, it is much more than that, because it is not even a monster and no episode you see about Lost, everything improves every time. a deserted island with an underground bunker and, in particular, the connection between the people who crossed the paths of each other before they collapsed. That's the real secret. This series of rules and I can not wait to know what really happens there I hope they will not air the last 2 episodes in theaters, this series deserves a 9 out of 10
