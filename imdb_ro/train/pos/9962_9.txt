I was a little scared to see this movie because of its rates. But living in Italy, titles like this have never met and I like the step so much that I decided to try it. And how surprised I was! The story is different from any other dance film I have seen lately, in a more profound sense than "winning". It is touch, well written and well-directed. Raya is such a powerful character, I love that she never doubts herself, she is so mature and focused, but also her talent TALENT (and the talent that Rutina Wesley has, my jaw has come down in The final dance scene). The way she follows her dream and refuses to let anything stop her is, frankly, inspired. Also, the fact that she is not super hot (Jessica Alba, Briana Evigan, Jenna Dewan, Zoe Seldana ...) makes it very appealing and real. Seriously, why is this movie so low? You can understand between the first 5 minutes that it is a good work. Very good indeed. I really cried at the end of the movie. And dance routines are just sick.
