I just came back from the Montreal premiere of Zero Zero ... and I'm surprised to be damned to find a negative comment on the movie. Basically, the blame refers to the fact that Coccio makes a light and exaggerated social message ... well, sir-I-a-reviewer, is an easy and over-critic critic of socially charged films. <br /> <br /> Not that I want to expose my life here, but come from a small town with a similar school like these boys. Reject and ignore the menu. The thing is ... I understand how small children can be condemned to make such horror. High schools have become battlefields of compliance. It's a real ugly sight. You have to fight to be like the others. It is hard to explain that many people do not realize that high schools become cemeteries of human intelligence. Meanwhile, parents close their eyes and smile about how their life in their comfortable suburbs is perfect. The real motive of the film does not refer to what drives them. It's about this calm suburb like death, and everyone closes their eyes and tries to create the atmosphere of a perfect city. Cal expressed it well. It's a wake-up call. Drama is everywhere and can take any form. In this case, small dramas (like Andre, being dubbed because they wear a J.C Penny shirt) turn into the worst nightmare of an entire city. Andre & Cal took the most extreme way of expressing their pain. The need for non-compliance in an era where you need more than ever to be like others to be accepted. I especially like the latest scenes where some boys burn the crosses of Andre & Cal, with the pain they reported, Cal & Andre communicating the rage of the blind to their community, their refusal to think about the causes of deeds. <br /> <br /> It might seem aggressive like a movie, but Coccio meditates more than whining or enunciating. What is Andre & Cal is a reality ... and a scary one that could reach other children. Ben Coccio makes a very disturbing movie.
