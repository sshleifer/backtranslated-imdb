Nolly's comfortable way to release empty comments, often with expletives, to describe things about which is better informed than most is quite refreshing. There is another character in the movie who is constantly trying to verbalize complicated problems using more language than necessary. This guy should not have received a treasure. Cut to Noll and you know you're looking for a treat! The way in which the surfing pioneers are portrayed is very evocative for a "lost age". Undoubtedly, no one knows how these guys lived, much less they have looked after issues like medical care. The use of old movie clips was made at retail.
