Bell, Book and Candle was one of the great phenomena of pop culture in the mid-twentieth century, very similar to the phenomena we see today (in the 1970s - more than ten years later - there were endless references to this movie). This made Novak a huge star, put a wonderful article in Jack Lemon's resume, threw a new light on Jimmy Stewart, and gave Lancaster and Gingold new ways to explore in the career (both continued to play the witches and other "" together with the movie "Married a Witch" (which helped transform Lake Veronica into an icon), Bell, Book and Candle inspired the great movie and the fascination of TV with all the witch things that started with Bewitched and have continued through Practical Magic, the Worst Witch and Harry Potter. "What we rarely notice is that the movie is also a pretty interesting film for the Xmas movie, but the story takes place over Christmas and, despite the fact that is superficial about witchcraft, it actually embodies a Christmas spirit (dedication, love, family, self-sacrifice, etc.). I will always watch this movie (they have seen -this many times since I first watched in the early 90s), especially if it is displayed around or right after the feast. It has style, substance, excellent distribution and terrible production value. And as Adam's Rib, occasionally expressing ideas that were quite radical for his time, I am radical even now (in both films, feminine character is innocent and powerful), and so always seems before the times.
