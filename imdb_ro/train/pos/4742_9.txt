This film contains more actions before opening credits than in Hollywood films of this genre. This movie is produced by Tsui Hark and the stars Jet Li. This team has brought you many Hong Kong cinematographic productions, including the One Upon A Time series in China. The action was quick and angry because of the amazing wire works. I only saw the threads in two pictures. Aside from action, the story itself was strong and not just used as stuffing. To find other action movies to rival, you need to look for a Hong Kong cinema outlet in your area. I really deserve to check and usually never disappoint.
