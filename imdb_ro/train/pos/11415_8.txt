This is a great movie to see with your girlfriend. My boyfriend and I both love dancing and I ran into this movie at the video store. We had to understand it. With no violence and a heating story, it's a great movie to relax and enjoy the night. I would recommend this movie to any family or just a bunch of girls looking for a cute movie.
