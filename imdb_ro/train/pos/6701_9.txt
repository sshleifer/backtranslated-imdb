I really enjoyed the first 2 seasons. because a lot of good characters disappeared later. like most shows are pretty slow at first, then be better in later seasons, but this is the absolute inverse. Jenny from the first season and 2nd Season winner were Sabrina's friends, I really did not care about the others, Jenny and Valarie were his best friends. I think for some reason the producers wanted us to dislike the friends of her college for some reason, they were so cruel to Sabrina. but my favorite season 1 season is cat showdown, and my favorite season 2 episode is witchcraft, which is the funniest episode. I also thought it was funny how Libby was popular, but she was always jealous of Sabrina and never seemed to have a real boyfriend, but she always wanted to be with Harvey. I just wanted them to have done better. I also liked how during the first two seasons during the opening credits Sabrina would say a few words while wearing a costume, as in the pilot episode where it is in the witch's suit, I liked how she said " so do not "me she tried to change to something else is what I think, but this is a very cool show. it's kind of like the andy griffith show in a way, because it's good at first, but once the color became fary and gone, it was better. but I still want to look at him, but the only reason I look at the seasons later is because of the sabrine. what I wanted to say about the opening sequence is: the opening titles of Seasons 1-3 show Sabrina in front of a mirror that features more costumes and different costumes as the names of casting members quickly turn on the bottom of the screen. At the end, Sabrina would say a kind of paper that referred to the outfit that she was wearing, then vanished. Season opening season four includes bubble characters. opening credits from Seasons 5-7 present Sabrina in various locations around Boston
