**Warning! (Yes, I realize it's hard to ruin a historical documentary, but I reveal some of the backstory and methods.) This is an exceptional documentary not only because of remarkable filming but also because of the story behind her. Because the naudet did not want to tell the story of September 11, but rather that a new firefighter, men's emotions and the viewer's connection are more real and stronger than would be in a standard retrospective. <br /> <br /> In a shooting sense, "9/11" is a manual. If events were a real scenario, they would be great as the characters are set, then throw a curve to react to. This is all the more amazing given the pain and excitement of the gross recordings that directors had to awaken to share the story together. <br /> <br /> The first part of the film offers a glimpse of life inside a fire station; Specifically, how a beginner assimilates into a veteran team. Only this part is good enough and if the documentary was left to follow, it would probably have been solid. The brethren seem to realistically present the process of becoming a NYC firefighter. <br /> <br /> Then, of course, all hell is breaking up. The chaos that followed the WTC attacks is vividly seen, as various characters we have come to know are being pushed into terrifying situations. Seeing not just attacks, but first-hand reactions is a very moving picture of extreme human emotions. <br /> <br /> The next, in which firefighters are discovered to be lost and find, is the human drama at the top. Life and death hang on the balance. Unlike many movies, the viewer not only does not know who will live and die, but really cares. <br /> <br /> The only negative thing I have to say about this is that the Robert DeNiro blitzes (which they like) were uninformative, useless and did not promote the story at all. They have probably been added just to attract more viewers. The Bottom Line: The Best Documentary I've ever seen. Nonpareilous presentations of emotion and raw human drama. 9.5 out of 10.
