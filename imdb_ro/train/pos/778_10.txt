I'm not an acting actor or other details about the film, but this movie hit me deep. I do not think I'll ever forget. One scene (I think someone who saw the movie will know who I'm talking about) is imprinted on my brain. I also watched the similar Lilja 4-ever movie (as referred to by a previous commentator). It was also very moving, but not so righteous and brutal. If you are sensitive to everything, or it will bring you tears in your eyes, but Anjos Do Sol (Angels of the Sun) can stay with you forever. This is very depressing, but I think, no, I hope the film manages to attract more attention. <br /> <br /> More people have to see this movie !!!!!!
