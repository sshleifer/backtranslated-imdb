This was a great introduction to Marion Davies's talent and beauty. She is not only gorgeous but also hilarious in this film. (I think Lucille Ball might have shaped her later career in Davies style, which could be called "beauty zany.") Vidor's direction is easy, but surely the story is a chestnut of course, but the actor is a wonderful contemporary, and the star viewer for fans of the silent era with many cameos adds the fun of the whole. It combines the elements of slapstick with adult dramas and a good old love story. For all movie fans who have a knee reaction to watching silent movies, stay on it and change your attitude. <br /> <br />
