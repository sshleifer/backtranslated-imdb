This game is above everything else so far. I had the honor of playing on PS2, so the graphics were really good. The voice was superior to the standard. The difficulty level is correct. Wesker must be the best characters in the RE series in my opinion. The story astonished me and took many different doubts that I did not expect. The only evaluation that this game deserves is wonderful.
