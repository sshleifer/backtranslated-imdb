To say that this film is simply a demonization of Catholics, and a distortion of history is untrue. It's not what this movie is. What is this movie is a commentary on Church abuses (although this could replace any powerful body), the ways in which this abuse affects people and families, and how so many people choose to simply allow and frequently participate in abuse, without thinking alone. The fact that the Catholic Church is in jeopardy is simply because of the nature of the true story on which the film is based. To mark this as propaganda against Catholics seems to lack the truth about what the Catholic Church has done sometimes; its history is often not great and it is something that filming as this culminating point and which must be highlighted. Yes, we should comment on abuses committed by other organizations, but this is not the case for this film. It's an amazing film that brought me to tears and it's worth looking - if we do not do that, you're studying the past, we have to repeat it "
