I've been watching King Lion several times that all my friends put it on. Having a childish sister, you know what it is like. So far I have memorized both the plot and the lines. After King Lion 2 came out, I was as good as let me see ... the second was significantly weaker ... then I saw an announcement for king lion 1 and 1/2 ... I was like ok there we go again. After I saw 1 1/2 I was like wow. All my expectations (for repetitiveness) have been broken. A truly wonderful and original plot allows you to stick together all the time. I have noticed that the cartoons have been filled with so many comic moments that ROFlmao will apply here 100%. I certainly recommend seeing the cartoon.
