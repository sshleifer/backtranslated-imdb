Gédéon and Jules Naudet wanted to shoot a documentary about the New York firefighters. What they got was the only film in the International Trade Center on September 11th. After working with James Hanlon's company, Jules went with the captain to inspect and repair a gas leak, while Gédéon stayed at the firefighter in case something interesting happened. A plane flying down the city distracted Jules and turned the room a few seconds before the plane collapsed in Tower 1. Jules asked the captain to follow him in the Towers. The first thing he saw was two people who lit up, something he refused to shoot. He stayed on the ground for the next few hours, filming the reactions of the firefighters and other people who were there. The Naudet brothers took great care not to make the film too violent, grizzly and gorilla. But the language of the firefighters is a little rough, and CBS has shown a lot of balls that broadcast it uncensored. The Naudet brothers' mixed pictures filmed with one-on-one interviews so that firefighters can explain their thoughts and emotions at certain moments of the crisis. <br /> <br /> Unlike a similar title feature film, most of the money coming from DVD sales goes to 9/11-related charities. Very well done, emotional, in motion and completely lacking in political propaganda, is the best documentary of the kind of second.
