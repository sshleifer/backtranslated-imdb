Hard to comment, how do you say it's bad? Well, it's not, but it's just as difficult to say that's good. What it is, is convincing viewing, it's as close as you get to total devastation without being there. These are the photos of the tsunami approaching the Thailand coast brought to life, you know you want to go back, but you have to look. The Naudet brothers deal with the comment very well, even in the most tragic circumstances, something that happens in another country, neither panders nor insults. The facts are on cellulose and it takes a little for the spectator to understand or understand what's going on. You can not change history and you should not want, this movie is like a proof of humanity in the darkest hour.
