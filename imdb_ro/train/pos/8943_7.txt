Bewitched TV series of 1960 owes the idea of ​​this movie. This is the movie that Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak did when they were distributed in Vertigo by Alfred Hitchcock. This is not as obsessive as this one, but Novak is just as exciting. This was Jack Lemmons' fifth film and is good in support of Ernie Kovacs. The movie has many good things about it. Hermine Gingold is very good in this movie, almost as good in supporting as he was in The Music Man. The distribution is very solid. This movie has a late 50s story in New York City and a cat that is as deceptive as any feline in any movie. It's good to forget that it's a love story with everyone's excitement, and it's too small for magic. It's not Vertigo, but I think that because she was following that movie, the audience did not do as well as it's worth it - I'm glad William Asher saw it so the series of 1960s was created. I'm not happy with what Will Ferrell did on the big screen, this movie is much better than that.
