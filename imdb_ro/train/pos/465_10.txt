Marlene Gorris has established himself as one of the great directors of the world. This sensitive, visually beautiful film is based on a story by Vladimir Nabokov and captures the dark ironic irony of the writer. John Turturro gives what I consider the best performance (usually I'm not his fan); and Emily Watson is also brilliant. It's worth seeing.
