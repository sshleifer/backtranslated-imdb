Pinjar by Mr. dwivedi is a great movie. It's definitely the heaviest and the best since 2003. They are very good at it. Dwivedi knows what he can get from MAST Urmila. she is like u have not seen before. a true excellent performance. along with her is a good actor Manoj Bajpai, who showed Bollywood what is with Bhiku Mhatre. The film is about a girl (Urmila) who lives in pre-partition Pakistan. she is from a family in Punjabi who lives in a small town. she was kidnapped by a Muslim type as part of a good fight with the Punjabi family. and then follows a series of twists and turns as the marriage arranged by the mistletoe is due in a few days. this movie is really a very good movie. the story is solid with an amazing scenario. all shows such as lillete dubey, isha koppikar (u wont believ but she can also act alongside dan dancin on Khallas), kulbhushan kharbanda and many others. those sets with Pakistani pre-partition, costumes, cinema, sound, background score reach positive points. from the beginning to the end of the u'r chair with the next question? this movie is not jus justifiable, but it deserves to be a part of the movie collection. the final scene is the end of the movie. I would suggest to all the No-Kabhi-Khushi-Kabhi-gum-and-No-Dil-To-Pagal-Hai crowds to watch this amazing film. My Rating: 10/10.
