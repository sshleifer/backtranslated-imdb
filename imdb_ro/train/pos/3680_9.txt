Paris, je t'aime (2006) is a movie made up of 18 segments. You can do the math number - 18 segments in 120 minutes means each director has seven minutes to tell the story. The film is based on the premise that you can really tell a story in that short time. The premise works. Almost all segments are powerful, complete and satisfying. Each presents another aspect of the Parisian experience and almost every director draws remarkable performances from a cast of great actors and close to the sea. In this movie there were so many strong portraits that it's hard to pick one or two favorites. Probably the most memorable for me was Juliette Binoche as a frightening mother in the "Place des Victoires" segment, Gena Rowlands as an aging beauty in "Quartier Latin", Catalina Sandino Moreno as a maid in the Loin du 16ème segment and Margo Martindale as a bearer of correspondence from Colorado, who learned to speak French so that he could visit Paris (the "14ème Arrondissement"). Special mention must be given to Gulliver Hecq, perhaps the worst boy who will ever harass an American tourist in a subway station in Paris (the "Tuileries" segment). an extraordinary movie. My wife and I decided to rent it in a few months so we could catch some of the subtle points we've lost. However, Paris is photographed so nicely that we suggest trying to see it on a large screen. In any case, do not miss!
