Even if it was a box office mess, it's my favorite movie. Offers a strong family message. She has a lot of violence and she has a song with a bunch of bikini girls. Compared with other Bollywood films, the action scenes in this movie are more realistic. It's an incredible combination of Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. If you want to see the Indian nose, Amitabh interprets it in this movie. Do not read reviews by critics, they are just ignorant. This movie has a good mix of comedy, romance, drama and especially action. So if you want to see a more realistic action than Main Hoon Na (still good movie), this is the movie.
