When I saw this animation for the first time (I was 15), I was really impressed! It has a totally different style from Japanese animation and I like it more. All the impression of the movie is more sinister and darker ... The colors are not ... colored. Characters do not talk too much, there is no long and boring discussion about this and about that (as in Ghost in the Shell). With his darker images of strange beasts and feelings of magic, it seems that one of those Scandinavian old tales of violence and dreadful creatures, enchanted forests and deep caves, inhabited by dragons, monks, orcs ... and a mysterious hero to stop the evil ...
