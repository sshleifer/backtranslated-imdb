Another for the Babes & Bullets. The story is more edgy than any other musical I've seen: the cannons hid the missing legs of the females and place each one in the other in a way that comes close to a smart comment than we could expect for the locals. More effective than contemporary "drama". It's hard to identify with a woman who keeps a cannon in his trousers - luggage. Quite remarkable if you consider the context. Despite the fact that the cannon accounts for 90% of the surprises, this film chronicles how greed replaces all the other considerations in the life of a group of yakuzas pursuing a woman who keeps her foot in a hidden rocket launcher here there are no groups of shower scenes or belts.) The Lantern launched from the heroine thin air towards the end of the original Tomie (2000), the hidden projectile behind the protagonists, apparently nowhere in Dead or Alive (1999) or the Sunny Gets Blue flame lightning scene (1992) all testify about a Cantinflas-esquire close to the third world in contemporary Japanese cinema that I can not explain, but I can not complain. You will not see good-quality movies of this Hollywood essence, except for the missing ones and the cheap carpets that they pump for a cheap emotion, it's ridiculous. This is a true film, and while it is great in its entirety, the end is a brilliant, if not unmistakable, image of Sergio Leon, which involves cannons where the legs should be and is certainly fit !
