This movie is the best horror film, bar-none. I love Stanley's escaping women in lac. I've been a fan of Judd Nelson's work for many years and he let me go. It's a mixture of horror, drama and romance, not so much comedy. His bad but charming appearance captured me even then and there. This aspect in his eyes, I will never forget. There's something about him, I can not describe it.
