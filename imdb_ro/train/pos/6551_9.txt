I came to Nancy Drew waiting for the worst ... because of the bad reviews. I thought: Even if I do not read the books, it does not look like Nancy Drew that I heard about. But I was wrong. Sure, it was not a carbon copy of the books, but when you make a movie out of something, you need to change it to become big screen entertainment. The story was pleasant and thrilling, with lots of real scams and I thought Emma Roberts was really credible in her way of playing this classic character. There were some funny moments and, on the contrary, a lot of statements, at no time in this movie did Nancy come as a ditz. She was intelligent, conservative, polite and authentic. One thing that this movie did good was to balance the whole thing with a mix of moments of comedy, romance, suspense and heart. I liked this movie. What a blow, what a blow! And if you are wise and decide to trust me and see this, be prepared for strange moments because I was as if we were scared! Go to see or be a bum-boom and let other people decide what you think about this movie for you ... a mistake that I almost did. I like it, I want to have this movie! I like Emma Roberts now. It's like a mini-Bree Van De Kamp from DH. Love her, love her.
