Great documentary about the lives of firefighters in NY during the worst terrorist attack of all time. This is the only reason why this should be a collection element. What shocked me was not just the attacks, but the "fat-rich diet" the physical appearance of some of these firefighters. I think a lot of doctors would agree with me that in the physical form they were in, some of these firefighters would NOT have reached the 79th floor carrying more than 60 pounds of gear. After I said I now have a bigger respect for the firefighters and I realize that becoming a firefighter is a job that changes life. The French have a history of making great documentary and this is a great documentary .....
