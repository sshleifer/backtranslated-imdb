This movie is fantastic because it explores storytelling and fantasy in the way it would make a child for adults. The idea that a child's drawings become a place he can physically visit and influence is wonderful. At the same time, you could attract all psychologists about her and tell her that she really is exploring her subconscious, as we all do in our dreams when we sleep. The foot that makes my Goose Baskets is when her father is in the paper house and follows her. The only thing I can not say is that it was sold as a horror movie ... it really is not. If you want to see something British with a lot of story that keeps you guessing without the usual cheap emotions most movies have to use, then watch Paperhouse.
