I saw this movie on the Hallmark channel and thought it was wonderful, especially because it was based on a real man. Pierce Brosnan was very good as the lonely English man who took over the half-Gray Owl person. The photo was beautiful. This movie made me do more research in this character, Archie Belaney known simply as Owl Gray. I want to read how much I can about it. At that moment I did not meet Richard Attenborough by guiding him. But I'm not surprised. I like all movies if they act or direct it. I gave her the highest rating. However, I would have liked to have seen more in the film WHY he took this person, because he showed only the two aunts who raised him and his room in their home. wrong with this movie if you are like me and you enjoy a beautiful story without hearing an unpleasant language and special effects made every few minutes.
