This is the best movie I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> Maybe because I live a few miles from the village where the story took place, and I know how things are going on in this area in Sweden. The movie tells the truth, believe me! He criticizes and honors Dalarna's lifestyle, and the producer wants the people watching the movie to be more open and to care more for their closest friends and relatives. But if you live in another small village anywhere in Sweden (or in another country), you will probably recognize much in this movie as well. Thank you Maria Blom!
