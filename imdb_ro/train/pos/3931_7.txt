A biographical, somewhat fictional portrayal of Abraham Lincoln's first year, by director John Ford, focusing primarily on a lawsuit in which the young lawyer protects two brothers accused of murder. The film provides an interesting portrayal of this important American figure and the film is well done, but it seems somewhat incomplete without any of the great moments of its presidency or even with its debates with Stephen Douglas. The obvious intention was to portray Lincoln as a young man by developing the attributes that would have transformed him into the great man he would become. But the result for me was that, while admiring the portrayal, it was not as satisfying as I think it could have been with a wider field. In the role of Abraham Lincoln, we have Henry Fonda who actually shows a quiet force. Fonda's show includes some ganglions and other affections that are quite effective in presenting a Lincoln portrait, especially when combined with an effective makeup and costume that is sometimes a bit noticeable. it's solid and surprisingly does not include the fact that many of Ford's regular distributions (sometimes called "shares"), but we have Ward Bond one of Hollywood's most prolific actors. Bond has appeared in several AFI Top 100 films than any other actor, both the original list and the revised list. He also appeared in the 11 Best Picture nominations. The film has a scene that seems to have inspired a similarly similar scene in "Killing a Mockingbird" where it would have done even better than she is here, even though that scene is one of the most effective in this movie.
