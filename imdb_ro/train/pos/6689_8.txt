As a comic book reader who still sees me as a total child from the heart, I admit that I may have been a bit biased towards this film. I mean, there was a good superhero movie out there for some time (NOTE: Batman Forever was not a good superhero movie). I really wanted this movie to be good, and unlike most of my recent movie tours (read Blair Witch Project) I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Mystery Men was definitely not a big effect, the tension - the action hit, it was a comedy. And on this basis, it was a success. He had everyone in the little theater laughing, and he received applause and laughs right through the final stage. Stiller and Garofolo are hilarious together, as always, and Azaria just adds the touch to the right to tame. William H. Macy plays a great right man, while Kel Mitchell and fed-up Paul Rubens are just added to keep kiddies happy. <br /> <br /> Although the sets are bizarre (and sometimes seems ripples from both Batman and Blade Runner) and some of the jokes are obvious, it's still fun. There are a few lines that will catch even the most agitated viewers and will bring tears from our belly. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie. Although not a classic all-time, it's twice as fun as the latest Austin Powers retreated. The writing is good and the distribution is GREAT. If you are worried, plan on the matinee and pay less, but you will be pleasantly surprised anyway. I mean, who does not have roots for the losers from time to time?
