This movie makes a strong comment on the Italian people at that time. Using mirrors to enhance character revelations is great and I can not mention the beauty and magnificence of Sophia Loren and Mastroianni. I love both of them. Their way of interacting is so beautiful and natural that you can wonder whether or not the room is there. The husband, in his short role, is also excellent portrayed as the Italian fascist who orders his wife and children, but in his own way a loving father. The scenes from Hitler to Piazza Venezia with all the Italians are incredible and really place the film historically. I liked the movie and I also agree that it is funny that it is not more famous.
