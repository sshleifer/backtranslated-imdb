Take Me: A funny game on THE LION KING, which presents itself as a sequel. Surprisingly funny. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, "Lion King 1 1/2" is actually another fun, direct-to-video mode that deserves a theatrical treatment. I do not see why Disney released this video directly and launched theaters such as Chicken Little and Return to Neverland. These movies are better seen in video stores (in the "new versions" area) rather than seeing their theatrical posters outside the theaters. This is just a spoof of the first film (though the events of Simba's Pride have not yet taken place), Timon (expressed by Nathan Lane) and Pumbaa's point of view (expressed by Ernie Sabella). We've come to see them have fun with the first movie events. The original voices of the first film, such as Matthew Broderick, Woopie Goldberg, Cheeche Martin and Robert Guillaume, return to their roles in the first film, while Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller offer a fun comedy relief as Timon's mom and uncle. /> <br /> So it does not have fun with this sound. Maybe not now, but go look at you. The fact that he is not so serious in his plot makes it more enjoyable. It's kind of like MST3000 with Timon and Pumbaa. <br /> <br /> Evaluating the video: *** 1/2 of 5.
