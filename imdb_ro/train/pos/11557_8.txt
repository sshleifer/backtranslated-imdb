You often laugh at the sad, sometimes sad, story of two divorced men - Lemmon, a neat neurotic housewife and Matthau a sportsman - who decide to live together to cut spending. <br /> <br /> Very photographed and directed. The scenario is very sparse - that is, there are always more than one hand on almost every line. The very funny scene involves two British sisters (Evans and Shelley) who seem amused by what somebody says, but when Lemmon takes the pictures of the children and yes, the ex-wife has the faces crying with him before Matthau can look with the drinks promised! Very fun.
