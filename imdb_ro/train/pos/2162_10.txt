I was so surprised to see this movie so undervalued ... I understand why some of you do not like this movie. Its rhythm is slow, a feature of Japanese movies. However, if you are absorbed in the movie like me, you will find this is not a problem at all. I have to say that this is the best comedy I've ever seen. "Do we want Dansa?" is often considered a masterpiece of Japanese comedies. It's very different from Hollywood, for example. Austin Powers or Scary Movies, where a gag is guaranteed in minutes. Rather, it's a movie that makes you feel good. I like the movie because it makes me feel "real". The plot is simple but pleasant. I was so excited to see that Sugiyama (the main role) found the meaning of life in dance. Before watching the movie, I was slightly depressed because of heavy schooling. I felt lost. However, this film made me think of the living side of life. I thought I was in Sugiyama's same boat; if he could find himself in his hobby, why could not he? He reminded me of "exploring my own future" and of discovering the happiness of my everyday life. It is important to note that actors are not professional dancers. While some of you can find dance scenes not as perfect as you expect, I really like it because it makes me feel that the characters are really "alive", learning to dance as the movie continues. <br /> <br /> In fact, this movie is encouraging and encouraging. Like a comedy, he does his job perfectly. It certainly deserves 10 stars. And yes, Aoki is funny :-D
