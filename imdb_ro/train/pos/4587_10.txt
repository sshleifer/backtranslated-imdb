Although John Woo's Hard Boiled is my favorite movie number 1. But I have to say that the police story is my favorite movie no. 2. I say this because the waterfalls, fights and action, my favorite part of the movie, is when Jackie Chan jumps off the rails, at the top of the mall escalator, grabbing at a pole surrounded by the Chrismas lights and slipped into a pillar through a skylight, and eventually landed on his back on the marble floor. Ouch! Buy it at amazon.com for 14:98. (Or something in $ 14.) VHS new home video line. any questions or comments, please feel free to respond. (I'm only 14, but I know where you can find any movie ever made.) If you're looking for a movie everywhere and you can not find it, please answer me. Thanks and good night!
