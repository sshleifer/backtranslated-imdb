Critically, people say that Antz is better. Antz is a good movie, but I liked Bug's Life a little bit more. I do not remember a Pixar animation, other than the two Toy Story movies, that I laugh so much. The animation is pure, the story is original and does not preach. Voice votes are what makes this movie. Dave Foley is a serious ant who wakes up a lot. Hopper is a superb characterization of always the wonderful Kevin Spacey, as is Haydn Panettiere as Dot. There is also British support from Dennis Leary, David Hyde Pierce and Madeline Kahn, and I could continue. The script is fantastic, so funny and sometimes even thrilling. He misses Antz's social messages, but what we have is rock-solid entertainment. 9/10. Bethany Cox
