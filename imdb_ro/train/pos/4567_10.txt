My left foot is a remarkably epic film that explains the life and times of Christy Brown, who had cerebral palsy, severe disability and only left foot, but he was defiant, he managed to become an artist and a writer against all odds. the film many times and every time I see it, I find it as brilliant every time. I wonder how this amazing film did not win an Oscer for the best picture, it's a bunch of academy awards. Jim Shirdan is for me one of the greatest directors in the world. The script, the music and everything else are excellent in this movie. As the movie continues, you almost feel in the brown household, as everything happens. Ray MacAnally and Brenda Fricker are stunning as the parents of Cristie and Fiona Shaw are as brilliant as Dr. Eileen Cole, who helps Christy in his defiance struggle. The Irish cinematographic industry has remarked the name in front of the left foot. My left foot was the beginning of a wonderful time in the Irish movie. so powerful and brilliant films such as the field, the crying game in the name of the father and Michael Collins followed the left foot. These Irish films have been considered so much in the world and have been nominated for multiple Oscars and have won some for the Irish film. My left foot is a remarkable movie. Daniel le-lewis plays Christy Brown so well and so brilliant, and the same goes for Hugh Conner, who plays Christy Young. these two shows are two of the best shows so far, especially the Daniel Day-Lewis show, which I consider as tall as Antony Hopkins in silence of lambs. Daniel day-lewis has turned out to be a great actor in his career. This is an excellent masterpiece in the movie, see it!
