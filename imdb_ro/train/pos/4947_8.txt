We can only hope that there are many times when someone as strong as Morgan Freeman can take the time to help someone in need of help. Everything falls in love with loving people. As Will Rogers said, "I've never met a man I did not like." Of course, if you meet Paz Vega, what does he dislike? Her smile can melt diamonds. It's so fantastic I can see everything. The same is true of Freeman. it's just magic on the screen. <br /> <br /> The two gave us a movie that was funny from start to finish. From the Mexican supermarket to Lorraine & Bobby to Packy. It was delicate, charming and simply funny. You need to check this out.
