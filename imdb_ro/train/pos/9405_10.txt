While Hollywood became stagnant some years after World War II, England developed a very prolific film industry. In "The White Man", inventor Sidney Stratton (Alec Guinness) creates a suit that never gets dirty. Unfortunately, this means that some other businesses are now likely to get out of business! How can Sidney do this and maintain his dignity? This is an example of one of the great movies in which Alec Guinness played before becoming Obi Wan Kenobi. It's a good look at the absurd whole of the business world. If you plan to start any kind of business, we recommend watching this movie.
