Gunga Din (1939) relies on the poem by Rudyard Kipling. The film is directed by George Stevens. It is established in India during the nineteenth century, in which three British soldiers have to stop a bad guru and his killer cult. Gunga Din is a wonderful comedy adventure war with plenty of thrilling moments. The three leading people are brilliant. Grant Cary is Sgt.Archibald Cutter, Victor McLaglen is Sgt.'Mac 'MacChesney and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (the legendary son you know who) Sgt.Thomas Ballantine.Let do not forget the other good players including Sam Jaffe playing Gunga Din -a wonderful way. Joan Fontaine is beautiful and talented Emaline Stebbins. It's really fun to watch the difficulties of Tommy's and Emmy's wedding plans. Gunga Din is a terrible crowd of fun. It can be fun, it can be exciting. It may be all that is needed for a good movie.
