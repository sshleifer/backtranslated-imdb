A great movie, pretty laughs and action for any audience. Because the last person who posted on this movie took it on herself to name Woody Allen incestuous and not to comment on the movie, here I am. /> <br /> The film follows an improbable duo, Johansson and Allen, while following an advice from the ghost of a recently deceased British reporter. Their search leads them to the killer's house and eventually to a somewhat tragic ending. But do not let your password fool you, the movie is really hilarious and the action is gorgeous. It seems that while directors reach a certain age, really good things are done. Clint Eastwood, Allen and Pollack all seem to do some of the most imaginative works of their respective career. Also, from watching the movie in a pact theater, you can say that people truly love Woody Allen and are ready for him to make a comeback. The second one she followed on the screen lit up. There is only something about a man and he really shines in Scoop. <br /> <br /> Check it out, worth the trip.
