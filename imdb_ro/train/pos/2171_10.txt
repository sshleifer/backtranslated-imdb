A real classic, ten out of ten! Every actor is perfect, the script is a haunting succession of tense scenes. Scenes in the car and scenes in the mountains are breathtaking. I wonder if this movie is already on DVD because it has to be seen in the Widescreen version. He saw the movie in the late fifties, maybe three or four times, and since then I have never forgotten it. I remember it was one of Warner's first features, such as cinemas, a process called Warnerscope, which gave a very clean cinema. Shelley Winters and Jack Palance deserve an Oscar for their performance. The only thing I could criticize was not someone directed, like Nicholas Ray, to increase his rhythm and tension.
