Together with "Brothers & Sisters," "Six Degrees" was one of the most desirable dramas in the autumn of 2006. It marks the world, but really enjoyed the work of Campbell Scott) and Hope Davis (the recent widow of the journalist killed in Iraq). Apart from the action, the writing was fresh and the actor was superb. The show was also shot in NYC, the real city, not Warner Bros. or another studio of his, adding a secondary layer or realism. <br /> <br /> I think people are more interested in the last "Survivor" and other garbage of reality. Too bad he did not resist.
