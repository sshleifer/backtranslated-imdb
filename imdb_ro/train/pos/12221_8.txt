This is a nice work. Very sexy and quite interesting plot to keep my interest all the time. Its main disadvantage is that it seems to have been done for TV: full screen, and although there were several sexual scenes, there was absolutely no nudity (but the boy came almost!). Strange also because Netflix shows that it was rated R. But still, very titillating, and wish Alicia Silverstone has made several movies like this one. A Netflix reviewer said he was part of a series, but I could not find out what series he is. I would like to find out, however, that this movie was AU BUN. <br /> <br /> Walt D in LV. 8/23/2005
