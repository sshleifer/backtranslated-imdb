One should be very jaded, indeed, not be brought into this jewel of a movie (and I have seen hundreds of Hindi and Bollywood movies as well). Actors, beautiful settings, locations and surroundings, deep emotions represented, sweet songs (especially the singing voice of Udit Narayan, my favorite) - everything was great. The human (imperfect) element was also woven to create a drama and lead the plot as well as allow an unimaginable resolution. Alok Nath is such a terrific actor, so open with the emotions of the characters he portrays, that he almost steals the show from the young youth. I recommend this film to all those who love true romance - those that go beyond shallow beauty to true love - as one of the best movies there, Hindi or otherwise!
