In Arlington Heights, IL we never had a canteen in any of the elementary schools (1961), so I went to my bike at school for lunch and I have always seen this game. Truly, I was 11 years old, but I thought it was the best thing! I would draw hidden pictures on my board and see if my family or friends could find it. I also remember winning some great cars (Pontiac or Oldsmobile) if the competitor got the last game hidden from the picture. I even had the home version! I wonder why this game lasted so short. I liked the music and the hidden pictures - the only one I could get was lemon hidden as part of a bridge over the garden garden. Very good memories are Camouflage related.
