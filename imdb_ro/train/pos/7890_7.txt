Freddy's Dead: Final Nightmare (1991) was the last film in which Freddy Krueger is a solo act (not as an entity or co-star). Years of killing had an impact on Springwood. It has reached the point where the small town has become a virtual ghost town. Parents who killed Freddy Krueger so many years ago have all paid the final price. Only the madmen live in the city and the survivors are scattered all over. But that does not stop Freddy from seeking his final revenge. No matter how he tries to stop him, he always comes back for more. But this time he discovers something more about his old life. Can children stop Freddy at last? What is this secret that is buried in Freddy's twisted mind? to find out that you have to watch Freddy's Dead. the end was originally filmed in 3-D. A good way to end the franchise. Freddy finds out something about himself and his perverted life and he gets to go into a bang! Lisa Zane, Yaphet Kotto and Freddy Krueger play in this final installment. Rosanne, Tom Arnold and Johnny Depp make special appearances. A lot better than the last, but it's full of some dated jokes. If you like the series then you do not want to miss this. <br /> <br /> I have to recommend this movie to Freddy fans.
