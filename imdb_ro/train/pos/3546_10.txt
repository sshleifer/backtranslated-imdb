One of the best music ever made, this is an example where the producers and the director were not afraid to choose the actors for their talent, rather than what people expected. Lighting and set are unique, giving it a very interesting effect (it has a special name I can not think of). Dialogue is also unique in that no contractions are used. The film is well-suited, beautiful and interesting from start to finish. A real joy is MUSIC. Such a series of first-rate melodies from the beginning to the end that are perfectly accomplished and orchestrated. Also, the music is very original and very memorable, and I think it is superior to many musicians from the thirties and sixties. It surely has more original and more beautiful songs than most musicals, which could have only two or three. It's not bad for a director without experience in this type of movie. Another quality is that it is fresh every time you see it.
