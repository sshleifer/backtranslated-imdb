Her husband finds and hits the guy who led to the unexpected death of the actor - which leads to a murder trial and even more unexpected: a life sentence for prison. The next thing you know is that she enrolled in a Burlesque show traveling in the hope that one day she will arrive on Broadway and make enough money to release her husband - while her baby is sleeping in a trunk! has a pretty interesting plot, maybe a bit too fun, but very melodramatic (with tons of melodramatic music to make sure you get it) - all * much * improved by strong emotional performance given by Kay Francis - makes this movie . Also helping here is well-done to act by Minna Gombell in her role as an "almost forty" older lady who works burlesque and is fond of Kay. It is worth seeing, especially for fans of Kay Francis.
