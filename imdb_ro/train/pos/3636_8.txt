This is a good movie, about a person's dreams and about traveling or pushing to accomplish them. It's a beautiful and inspiring movie. Why some people have to try to find fault with every movie that comes out, especially the good ones. Dennis Quaid offers solid performance in this true story of Jim Morris, a high school baseball science professor and coach, who is pushed by his team to make a new shot at a professional baseball career. With excellent distribution, including Brian Cox, as an old officer who left so many achievements of his son without his support. It was good to see him as anything but a bastard in a movie. If I have a complaint with this movie, it's this: Never let Royce Applegate sign the national anthem again. <br /> <br /> Really, this movie belongs to that few baseball movies, such as "Field of Dreams" and "The Natural". Evaluates two fingers up and a big "well done".
