The story of farmers who love peace and people fighting for land, water, law and order, and respect and subjugation of the last interests of their cattle and their hired weapons have been worked better in previous films (Shane) and probably later well. There are some good action scenes, and the general aspect of the story, excluding a disappointing end, is well executed. Law, order, and religion have established roots in the city, but the old order of bovines, cowboys, and gunmen is still around. The conflict of the two happens in an ambush scene where the guests are heading into a trap. Granger, a former gunman, plays the guy who is avoided by those who need his experience with a gun.
