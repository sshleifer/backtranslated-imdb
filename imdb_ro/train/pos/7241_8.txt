Paul Lukas played a Russian intellectual who made his life as a waiter in Grand Slam, directed by William Dieterle (1933). It's a surprisingly funny satire of celebrity building. The waiter and girl of the Russian restaurant, played by Loretta Young, become America's lovers as bridge partners who do not fight. With the help of McCann, the publicist and phantom writer ("Frank McHugh"), they are walking ads for the "Stanislavsky system", a "bidding" system, no matter what it feels <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> Also, I suspect that the choice of the Stanislavsky character was also a slam to another type of system), a fiery quack, played very well by Ferdinand Gottschalk, is broadcasting on radio in America as a rewarding fight for Roscoe Karns (another big comic actor in disturbing 1930s). Bridge players are right in one square, although the audience is above them, unlike in boxing "rings." The wide variety of American types prefigures Preston Sturges' comedies, though for most celebrity production, "Grand Slam," most memories are two better films of the same era (pre-code) with Lee Tracy, who play a fast-paced role: "True Half Naked" and "Bombshell", but "Grand Slam" has its moments, especially for anyone who played a bridge with serious points. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young was already a horse of clothes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> Farrell, who plays McHugh's girlfriend.
