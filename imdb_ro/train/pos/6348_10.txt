Jim Carrey is as good as usual, and even if there are some "Jim Carrey moments," it's certainly not a "Jim Carrey" movie. It is mostly aimed at children and I was able to enjoy it like this. He was promoted to Israel as another Jim Carrey movie, so those who expected a strange comedy top were disappointed. The movie has beautiful moments and works well as a movie for kids. I can not say I loved this movie, but again I'm not the target audience!
