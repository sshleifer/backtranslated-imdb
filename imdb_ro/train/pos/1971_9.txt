I have no idea what people are complaining about. I saw this movie yesterday and I really liked it. Stone has again given a great character. It was as good as the first basic instinct. She still has smart but painful answers. Although Sharon may be 48 years old ... looks amazing! I do not care if it's as fake as a Barbie. Looks good and that's it. The basic instinct 2 gives you everything you want from the first. Sex, violence and a wonderful end that will let you think and talk about it for hours! Half of those who comment on this movie have not even seen it. So do not listen to them.
