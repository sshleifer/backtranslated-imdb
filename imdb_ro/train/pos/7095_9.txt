The amazing appreciation of Chris Marker's movie LA JETEE is full of surprises that doubt your mind, yet still touches your heart thanks to the superb tower. Gilliam's flair for fantasmagoric works, with David and Janet Peoples screenplay to play as much as poor James Cole (Willis, like Steve McQueen - better than McQueen, even!), Travels condemned from the future who, literally, does not know whether he is coming or going as a team of scientists continues to send him back to the erroneous eras while trying to prevent a 1995 plague that is dead for humans but innocuous for animals. Oscar nominee Willis, Brad Pitt, and Madeline Stowe, as a well-meaning psychiatrist, give some of the best performances of their career. Even Paul Buckmaster's tango score is haunted. This is not a miss!
