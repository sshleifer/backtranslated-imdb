For the Columbo fans, like me, this is the episode episode that made a case for why Columbo was so popular and how good it really was. Ruth Gordon has a day to sing (as always) to the role of intelligent crime writer Abigail Mitchell. Apparently, Abigail calls her nephew to sign some papers that made her the heir. She never managed to lose her niece's death and is convinced that her innocent husband dead (Charles Frank) has done the dirty work. To say more would be inconceivable. Mariette Hartley has a cunning role as Abigail's personal assistant. This episode of Columbo is in a class of its own. It's a really well made television movie. I strongly recommend it.
