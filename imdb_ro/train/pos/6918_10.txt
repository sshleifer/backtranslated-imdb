A very pleasant film featuring characters that do bad things and leave emotions like anger and a desire for revenge. The distribution is very good, there is a lot of action, and Stewart gets the fan and the revenge (with a twist) in the end. I have seen this movie several times and always watch when it's on AMC or cable. Highly recommended ...
