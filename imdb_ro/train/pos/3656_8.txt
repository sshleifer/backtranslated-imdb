If you have trouble suspending unbelief, then this is not for you. Consider: a woman already in the middle age finds a newborn in a cabbage patch and raises her like her. Think about this; she makes no attempt to locate the mother who might be a confused teenager in need of medical treatment, and apparently no one in the Italian Social Services equivalent attempts to put the child in "care" (there is no social services? You know it's a fantasy). Before he knows that the young Toto is ten years old and his adoptive mother dies leaving him at the orphanage where a man HAPPY, who loves everyone, comes from. In nothing flat, he not only gave up the suitcase of the man who stole him, but he organized homeless locals in the bona fide inhabitants of Shantytown, and for an encore he led them in a struggle against capitalism as a businessman buy the land on which Shantytown is, when oil is found there. This wishes to be swallowed, without the subsequent miracles beginning with his dead mother (the old man who raised him rather than the biological one) and giving him a pigeon that doubles like a magic wand, allowing him to give modest voices and finishes in which the hobos fly to a better place probably located somewhere above the rainbow. On the other hand, the film is so charming here and it's easy to surrender. Balancing a small masterpiece.
