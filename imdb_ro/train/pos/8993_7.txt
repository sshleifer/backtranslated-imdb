Rock n 'roll is a dirty business and DiG! demonstrates this with kindness. A serious and perhaps ambitious ambitious project, the director is able to straighten together seven years of tumultuous pursuits around two heavy rock groups. With this, the abundance of quality materials ensures the film's ability to capture the audience. If you've ever been interested in any field of the music industry, this movie will undoubtedly be a careful watch. the music in the film, although suffering the minimum of cutting and gluing, deserves the price of admission itself. the morning after I saw DiG! I went directly to the record store to get a massacre album Brian Jonestown (I was already initiated at the sounds of Dandy Warhols). Originally defined by exploring rock music, the film succeeds to other deep levels. Dig! is a sincere and sufficiently objective perspective on the destructive and volatile nature of the creative process and the people who are trying to beat those forces.
