* May contain spoilers * * May contain spoilers * In the era of Shrek (the movie) and Pixar (studio), this is a much more traditional animation film. He put together some characters that would not normally be seen together (not to mention trying to save a human child and bring him back to his father). They begin as enemies and end up with their best friend. If it sounds like a Disney movie, it is (made only by Fox 20th Century). The movie trailer was one of the best I've ever seen, but the movie does not stand waiting for the trailer to set. The problem is that filmmakers have not decided who the target audience of the film is. Yes, there are some film jokes that only adults will understand, but the film is mainly intended for children. Parents will enjoy that for 90 minutes. the attention of their children focuses on something other than them. The backgrounds are excellent and the voice is good, but there is nothing more a beautiful movie. Children will love this movie, adults will only want this.
