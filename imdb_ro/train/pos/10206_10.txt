In my years of attending film festivals, I have seen many small films like this, which have never reached the cinema distribution, and end up in the $ 3 WalMart boxes. I just found the DVD with Yank Tanks, a very good doc, but how sad it is to make it a rock rest. I liked this movie, the desire I saw at the cinema in is everything. I would have preferred New Yorker Films to have the title translated directly. It's good for Americans to stretch a little. If the title of the movie helps the US audience to explore the chaos by chance, the better. Cinema imitate life and visa versus. I also realized that it distracts that subtitles put prices in dollars. Come on! Euro is not difficult to decipher, making gringo audience math. Seeing a movie, especially a Paris hit, the spectator should not have a spoiled effect being remembered: I am an American watching a movie and they are translating the euro into dollars for me. <br /> <br /> We look forward to seeing more of these actors and more from the writer and director.
