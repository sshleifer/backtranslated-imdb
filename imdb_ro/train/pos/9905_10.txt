I've lost the number of reviews I've written on Slaughter High. I have read a lot of bad and I will say right now that it's a fantastic movie. Simon Scuddamore made his fame in a short time for his well-known suicide, and even though this was his only film, he did what made the movie so great. At first, I did not know anything about Simon until I read a review of his suicide. Then I found out because of the current site at www.IMDb.com was born in 1957 in Dayton, Ohio. Simon may have played the most pathetic character known to man, but his real life itself had certainly the forces and weaknesses. Did a good job, who can not agree? I always wondered how he felt naked in the movie. It must have been quite embarrassing to say the least. I saw the first movie when I was 12 years old in the sixth grade. I agree with some clues that the girl would not bathe after someone was killed and that high schools DO NOT have baths! I think 36-year-old Caroline Munro was the only other star to have a good acting talent, and unfortunately for Simon's death he did not make any future films. The reason for his suicide is a mystery and hopefully will be discovered in the near future. By doing math on his web page, he tells you he's 29 years old when he made Slaughter High. She looked like a teenager. I gave this film two fingers up, the best horror movie made. Probably because of their horrible action, the others have not made fame in the movie business. -Jacob Young
