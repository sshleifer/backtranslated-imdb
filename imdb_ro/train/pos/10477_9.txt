Walking the link between comedy and drama is one of the most difficult acts in cinema. How to laugh at the misery of others and not start feeling bad when it lasts too long? Well, this little gem surprise of a movie will bring great laughs, beautiful landscapes and pretty good buzz as well. I especially like the concept that a trick of history has made legal alcohol since white Europeans also enjoyed illegal marijuana because the "other breeds" used it ... they are undoubtedly true and expose a racist part to the laws marijuana, all over the world. An extraordinary commentary "DVD Extra" ... two of them, in fact, ... running through the movie with both the actors and the writers again. I saw things I was not sure I had in the first film, but I realized how easy it is to lose a lot of the subtle comedy from the first date. What bad luck! Do not miss! 9/10 stars
