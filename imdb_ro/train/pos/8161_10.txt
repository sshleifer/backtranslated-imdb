When I saw the dentist, I thought he was very cool. But this movie is not for everyone, especially for those who do not like the gorilla scene because the dentist has many violent scenes. That's why it's rated R18. It's a Beverly Hills dentist, dr. Alan Feinstone, who finds his wife, Brooke, cheating on him with the pool. It is best to go to your dentist before following this. But if you do not like going to the dentist, then it is better not to look at it, because it is possible to stop for life. the dentist has the best bloody revenge I've ever seen. Who has ever seen a movie that has a dentist (Spoiler) pulls his teeth teeth of deception and cuts his tongue without anesthesia? Very wonderful, but not for everyone.
