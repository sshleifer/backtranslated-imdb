Considered by almost all critics to be the best of Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan's films, I have no argument with this, though there are a few more, I thought as fun. One thing: it's the longest of the series I've seen 105 minutes. I only saw six of them but that was longer than I used to, and with the end of the action I thought everything was a bit too long. However, it is a good mix of action, suspense and romance. The only missing things are the color and stereo sound. The primary special effects do not bother me, because that was all they had back in the 1930s. Among some, this film is best known for one thing: skin! "Jane" never bore anything brilliant after this film, as Hays's Code was set up until the next Tarzan movie was made. Her costume showed what a great figure Maureen O'Sullivan possesses. The underwater underwater scene, however, was not it - of a length. The woman underwater had no good figure, no matter who she was. There is a lot of action here. By the end, it was not too much. The end went on for 15 minutes and it was so intense that it was almost too much to look at. Still, this movie offers everything - except "Boy" (their adopted son) - "I want to see in a movie from Tarzan, even O'Sullivan making Tarzan scream a dozen times. the pair of "lungs," that was not a problem.
