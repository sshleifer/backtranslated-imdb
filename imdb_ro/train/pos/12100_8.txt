The DVD for "Danaza Macabra" (Blood Castle) is very strange. This is due to the fact that certain parts of the film are in French with subtitles, and the rest is doubled in English by French. Sometimes the characters have been exchanged between the two in the middle of a scene! When I tried to make the movie subtitled subtitled or just doubled, it made no difference! Strange, but still pursued. The story is based on a Poe story, although I do not remember which one. In fact, Poe's character appears at the beginning and end of the movie - though he did not look much like him. A rich man makes a bet with a guy on luck that he can not stay all night at home. It seems like an easy bet to win - even if the house is very scary. However, it can not be so easy, because the rich guy says that all those who have previously taken the bet have died - but this crazy STILL wants to bet! While in the house, she meets Barbara Steele and she looks crazy for her. Later, however, he learns that he died more than a decade earlier! How can this be ?! I could tell you more about the plot, but I do not want to ruin my support. See it for the rest of the story. This movie gets very big notes to create a ghastly atmosphere. House, cinema and black and white music work together to make a scary film. As for the plot, it's interesting - especially because there are many twists and turns - so many who ask who it is and who is not among the proverbs until the end of the film. <br /> <br /> The only negative thing is that I was sorry for the poor snake that was killed futilely. Crazy how it could sound, I felt sorry for her and did not seem necessary. Parents may also want to know that there is a bit of nudity at the end. A striking, beautiful woman appears topless, but it is not absolutely necessary for the plot.
