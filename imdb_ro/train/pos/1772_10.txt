what relief to learn I do not imagine this program! The taxane summary is great. I remember very well that I saw that he was a healer, and I do not particularly look at the family, that he must have been 10/11 at the time I watched him. I think for a girl who has become a part of the attraction was the very blond hair of lead and its sad state permanently. The theme was played on a flute I remember - though I do not remember how it went. I think the intro showed him playing - or maybe he played a flute in the program and especially when it was sad? Maybe I'm destined to never know how it ended or see the clip or hear the song, but at least I know now that it's not just me.
