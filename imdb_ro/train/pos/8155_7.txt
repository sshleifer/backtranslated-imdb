I'm too old to know (or care) exactly what is the difference between rap and hip-hop. And being Canadian, I probably never saw MTV, but I'm not sure. But I thought this movie was very funny when I saw it, a lighted satire. Hip-hop culture is so vast nowadays that it's difficult not to continue to hear about it. (If we could say the same thing about riddle music.) I took the most jokes (at least I think I did). Of course, it comes from Spinal Tap, but there are a lot of targets that could resist a Tap treatment. Just no Testers, I'm sacred.
