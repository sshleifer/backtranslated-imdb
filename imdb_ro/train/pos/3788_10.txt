This movie is great. It's real and down to the heart, but at the same time completely crazy. The characters are easy to fall in love because they have so many different minds, but each of us might refer at least to. In Canada, we do not have a lot of movies in Eastern Europe, and for the few I've seen, Loners is one of the best. It's very fun and magical. If you want to see something new and refreshing, visit Loners.
