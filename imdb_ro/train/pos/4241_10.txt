I liked this movie! Characters were people you could feel. The young man in the service still in love with the girl he had left behind. Tom Drake is always perfect in romantic leadership as well as Donna Reed as the love of his life. The appearance she gives, as if she was starving for her sight, as well as her hesitation and confusion, and her feelings for him were played very well. The rest of the strange characters in the store were perfect, trying to bring them together. The most moving scene, however, was the young couple at his grandfather's house. I laughed at the sides, we wept in some, and I was very happy to see this movie. In fact, I've reviewed it about 5 times. A definition must look for total romantics.
