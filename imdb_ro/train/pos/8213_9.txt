Anyone witnessing our justice system - or its lack - will find this movie really satisfactory. There were not too many shades of gray in terms of characters or plot. Virtually every character in this movie represented what is the best and worst about our society. The popularity of this film is probably due to the fact that most of us, at one point or another, have been forced to handle dear ones, along with the bureaucrats who praised people who lived with lemons, who empowered them on behalf of "fairness". <br /> <br /> Overboard performance was convincing. I sympathized with the victim of rape - at the same time, I found it pleasing to see her wiping out the dull, vague arrogance on the faces of the former assailants. In particular, I found the dam one of the most ugly characters in all the movies I've seen, so it was nice to see that her ex-victim shut her mouth forever. The lead violinist and psychopath were equally ugly, so it just mattered with the fact that Harry Dirty himself ended up in a powerful grotesque way. This was the only sequel to Harry's dirty spade, which first scored.
