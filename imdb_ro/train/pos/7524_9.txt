For a movie that looks like sex and skin, it has no right to be as strange as it is. The story of Betty Page, a beautiful Christian girl in the South who is the mother would not let them meet until she got married, who moved to New York and became her most successful age, is led by a performance remarkable from Gretchen Moll. Her page can not reconcile the images she takes (no one is allowed to touch, it is fun and respectful) pornography and the alleged negative effects that her images have on the world around her. The page was a source of inspiration for every burlesque artist because not only because he had a figure for which he died but because he invested every image with an innocent sense of fun that was in the same sexy and simple time. Rather like this movie, in fact. Filming in both black and white and technically glorious, it's a great way to spend a few hours.
