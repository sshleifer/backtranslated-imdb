Che: The first part was a fascinating experiment that did not just tell a very interesting story, but also tried to do something different with the "biographic film" genre.Che: The second part is the culmination of this experiment <br /> <br /> This film offers all the same attributes of the first, from extraordinary performances (especially from Benicio del Toro) and the brilliant direction of Steven Soderbergh's film, without forgetting its intention to break with conventional biopic rules. I admire Soderbergh's experiments ... they always try to do something different and unusual, and they are successful many times. <br /> <br /> The ultimate message this movie is perfect, and includes everything we have been told about. Che Guervara's life not only found Che. the second part is that some parts felt a little irrelevant, I give Che: the second part very enthusiastic recommendation, because, as a first, is a bold and fascinating iment expert who provokes the spectator and let us think.
