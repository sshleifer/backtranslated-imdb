I saw the movie before reading Michelle Magorian and I liked both of them. The film, more than the book, made me come close to tears on several occasions. This film touches the deepest points of the human soul and never lets go. I encourage as many people as possible to pursue this masterpiece as soon as possible and as soon as possible. I give him ten stars.
