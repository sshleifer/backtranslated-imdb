I just saw this movie for the second time on TV. It's wonderful, warm, sentimental, very romantic. I rarely saw actors more able to reveal their love and love to each other - Ryan O'Neal, Ryan O'Neal, Robert Downey, Jr. and especially Mary Stuart Masterson simply overcome themselves. Masterson probably has the hardest part and is just adorable. <br /> <br /> The film is at the top of both romantic movies, such as While Sleeping, when Harry meets Sally, Sleepless in Seattle, and the Big Gimmick movies such as Big, Back to the Future , Peggy Sue got married. I do not like to say this because this distribution was superb and I would never change any of them - but I think it did not work as well as the films mentioned above, because the box office appeal of the distribution was not as big as Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks, Michael J. Fox and Kathleen Turner at the time of the film. Not gorgeous - for example, characters' lines are not particularly memorable. However, it is executed to perfection. <br /> <br /> The romantic songs are truly palpable, the "feeling" of falling people is accurately communicated, the eternity of love and sweeping, the feeling of loss and the desire to regain that connection, are so emotionally delivered. Again and again, you will move. In fact, a comparable film is Made in Heaven - the same romantic desire. See this - it's great.
