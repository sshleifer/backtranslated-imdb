Some movies simply should not be remodeled. This is one of them. In itself, it's not a bad movie. But he fails to capture the flavor and terror of the 1963 film with the same title. Liam Neeson was excellent, as always, and most of the casting is up, except for Owen Wilson, who just did not bring Luke's sense of character. But the major blame with this variant is that it has shuffled away from Shirley Jackson's story in his attempt to be grandiose and has lost part of the thrill of the previous film in a compromise for special snap action. Again, I will say that in itself is not a bad movie. But you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more.
