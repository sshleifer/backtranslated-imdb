A brilliant chess player takes part in a tournament and falls in love with a woman he meets there. In itself, this would be a pretty bad angle on a story. So there are many. There is the fact that the chess player is also completely alienated in the world due to his brilliance in the game and the fact that there is a history that haunts the player. This film goes back and forth from the romantic frivolity to the tension of the tournament to the historical events that created the chess player and works very nicely. It's easy to grow attached to the two main characters and easy to believe that they could hit him together, as they do in this movie. The added effect of the tournament is also very good and creates a nice tension set. I have no idea about the power of chess players because I do not play alone, but it looks good and credible. Generally, most of the movie falls very easily. It is also forgotten again very easily. So it's nice to see, but no more than that. 7 out of 10 chess players trapped between a peak and a hard place
