Now either you like Mr. Carrey's humor or not. Me, Myself and Irene had a crowd so massive and, on the other hand, cheering in the wells of good crashes. Bruce Almighty is a bit more mass, but you have been warned. If you are not sure, watch the trailer. I saw the trailer three times and still laugh at the same gangs when I saw the movie. If you do not find the view of a dog puts the seat down after using funny closet, I do not bother with the movie. <br /> <br /> Carrey, a reporter stuck in a ditch covering "lighter news", bears God when all his life seems to go to the pot. God takes the challenge and asks Carrey if he can do better. Carrey gets into the cradle of having all the powers of God to make his girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston) 's bigger breasts, getting himself promoted, and responds to the prayers of all orders with a single computer stroke. <br /> <br /> This is not a pretentious or even memorable movie, but it is very well done within it is very limited intention, it provides almost continuous laughs for Carrey fans, and even any religious cheesiness is likely to be harmless to all but the brightest god-squadders and anti-God-squadders at a more careful level, the film tempts us to speculate about Carrey's own career. - stuck in the typecasting of his "comedy," he did not largely make an impression as a serious actor, even after winning two Golden Globes. the most accomplished role of his "right" man on the Moon, it is less well known that the comedy of romps - or the Truman Show (which the Academy heaped three nominations while bypassing Carrey).
