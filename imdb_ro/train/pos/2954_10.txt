This film, however, critically appreciated, of course, has not yet been released in the US on DVD as another great - Christine Lahti "Housekeeping" in the same year. But if you can support Region 4 DVDs (Australian), this little masterpiece should be in your collection. There are still some VHS copies available on the internet. Davis is also complemented by a wonderful story, as well as memorable performances from her, especially Claudia Carvan and the great young man Jan Adele. Amazingly, or perhaps not, this movie and its stars were unrecognizable at Academy time, as Housekeeping did, but treat yourself with both - you'll be glad you did!
