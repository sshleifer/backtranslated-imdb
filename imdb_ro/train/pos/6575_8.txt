"Arms and the Man" is one of Shaw's funniest pieces if it's handled correctly, and this production does a pretty good job. Helena Bonham-Carter, a pre-film protagonist, is Raina, the daughter of a military family who has the fiancé of a fiancé (Patrick Ryecart) and who shelters an enemy soldier (Pip Torrens) during an attack on the city. Colorful and energetic, this production takes place at a good pace, and if Bonham-Carter and Patsy Kensit, as a maid, leave a bit of the other distributors, the ground. Kika Markham and Dinsdale Landen as parents are delightful and the whole piece is generally a happy one. Highly recommended.
