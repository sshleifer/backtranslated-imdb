When I was a little girl (and my father owned a video store), that was one of my favorite movies. I have not heard of it since then, nor do I remember anything about it, being forgotten by other Don Bluth movies, probably better. I managed to track her a few weeks ago and I was pleasantly surprised again. Located in New Orleans in the 1930s, the animation is delightful and the songs are memorable. There are a few goos in continuity if you look pretty hard, but generally do not overturn the story, which lets you smile (and maybe even a little sharp eye, if you are an animal lover). Characters are credible (maybe too little adult for younger youths). Two paws up, and for those of you who have not seen it in a while, it certainly deserves reassurance.
