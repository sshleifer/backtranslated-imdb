Let me out by mistake first, James Hanlon is absolutely terrible, trying to discover his description of what happened with training and beginners events today. Indeed, it is in high contrast to other fire without aspirations to act, which are natural in their delivery. That said it was an amazing film, which is impossible to look without tears in my eyes. I'm an English guy in London but I love New York and I've visited many times before and after September 11th. It is a second home for me and I can not feel devastated by the loss of life but the destruction of a part of such a wonderful city. This is the real deal with the firefighters with everything that crashes around them. I'm so glad there is material to show people how it was. It's a shame that they did not use any record of people jumping from buildings, because friends who were there told me that it is a part so important in their memory should be included to show future generations how terrible it was indeed. Conspiracy theorists can go to hell, by the way.
