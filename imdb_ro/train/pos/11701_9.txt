This is a great movie for all generations of X'ers. What other American world since 1972 has been compared to the 21st century psychotic. You can understand what passed America in 1972 was like watching this movie. I have discovered that clothing and car styles have brought me pleasant memories of a much better country than I have now. Think ... at that time there were only 4 or 5 TV stations to choose from. There was no AIDS, Muslim terrorists, Road Rage, 911, Avian Influenza, Sniper, etc. The war in Vietnam is over. It's another 7 years before Star Wars get out. The personal computer and the internet would still be 29 years old. When the first film came out, the producers had to sell the film because no other film company wanted it. So he began to visit small Protestant churches across the country that were featured on film projectors (It was a few days before VCRS, of course). The pastor of a church who would be interested in showing him a thief in the NI for his congregation would get a copy of the movie. Then he prepared an evening to show her in the church meeting area or in the lunch room. Members of the congregation would invite friends and family members "unsaved" and would be a social event of the week. <br /> <br /> If you can overcome the limited production values ​​of the movie and just watch it for nostalgic value, then I think you will enjoy more movie. Of course I speak like a genre. <br /> <br /> If I had a time machine, I would go back in 1972 and say goodbye to the 21st century hole we have now.
