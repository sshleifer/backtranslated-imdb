This film has re-written the history of the film in any way. Nobody cares what anyone thinks about this movie, because it overcomes criticism. Any defect in the movie is easily overcome by the amazing things the movie has. It's a very beautiful movie, and I doubt that many of us will see something similar again. I have seen it several times than I like to count on, and I still get transfixed every time with a feeling that is hard to describe. One for ages.
