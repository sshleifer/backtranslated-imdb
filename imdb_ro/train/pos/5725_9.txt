This is what I wrote earlier to some friends: The Holy Grace, The Grudge is, honestly to God, one of the most frightening movies I have ever seen! I get used to being very soft at my old age, or Sam Raimi and Ghost Pictures have done a KICK A ** job! (I can not wait for Boogeyman!) I was really scared sitting in the dark theater and I wanted to have someone, anyone beside me (except the protagonist in Grudge, I.) I swear there were many scenes that did not were expected! I felt bad, but I did not care about my nerves! I was at the edge of the whole movie, from the opening credits, and the music was fantastically frightening. I'm still thinking about that sound, but I do not like it! Actually, I looked a few times out loud and shouted "oh" to one scene! Oh yes, I even covered my eyes several times! The Word of the Wise: I thought some scenes were a little psychotic. DH DH hated Event Horizon and I thought whoever wrote it was sick and psychic, but I do not remember the movie so I can not compare it. I can not say that I liked this movie b / c I was terrified, but it was very good and scary. The final scene, too ... what! To be a 32-year-old mother, I think I can have nightmares in this movie, especially because of the sound. Please come out of your head;) In short, it's not a blood shot like I grew up (Jason, Freddy). This is a scary film most of the time. Perfect for Halloween. Two big trailers for this movie were Boogeyman and Ring 2!
