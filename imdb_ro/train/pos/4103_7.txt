The characters in this movie fall into two categories: smart and silly. Simple enough. Jiri Machacek (Standa) plays an unfortunate, cute guy who is arrested for a crime he has not committed. When he tries to reimburse financially from his former boss, the former boss, the situation gets under control. While Standa is really (but brave) stupid, his friend Ondrej is an absolutely gentle idiot, and manages to say and do something wrong every time. Without Ondrej, Standa might have the chance to go through life with a modest degree of success. With Ondrej, life will never be boring, but it will certainly not be without headaches! Ivan Trojan plays Zdenek, a kind of evil genius who degenerates into a tyrant illusory on Hitler-esquire. Zdeněk and his aggressors try to kill Standa to keep Zabenek's secrets safe. I am very impressed by the high quality and the imagination of Czech films. For a relatively small country, the Czech Republic has certainly produced more than just some of the superb entertainment. The best Czech films I've seen are: 1) The Pole and 2) Tmavomodrý Svet (Dark Blue World). If you see these two movies, you've seen the best Czech cinema.
