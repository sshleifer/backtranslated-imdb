If you are a kind of person looking for a realistic movie or a strong and credible plot, then this movie is NOT for you. You will not hate them. However, for those who like sweet comedies, easy to screw, then you will enjoy watching this little movie. Tony Randall works for the IRS and investigates a very nice farmer who has not realized he has to file a tax return. As hard as he tries to convince them of the seriousness of his visit, everyone in the family is delighted to have a company. She dresses him and treats him as a family, and he plans to bring his daughter, Debbie Reynolds. It's true about everything that exists. But the movie gets big marks for a fun scenario and decent action. A very beautiful curiosity from the late 1950s.
