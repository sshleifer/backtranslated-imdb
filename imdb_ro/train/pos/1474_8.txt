I saw this movie at the Toronto International Film Festival. It's not as bad as it sounds, this is a three-part documentary (each episode is 50 minutes), with Slovenian philosopher / psychoanalyst Slavoj Zizek. Zizek takes us on a journey through many classic movies exploring themes of sexuality, fantasy, morality, and mortality. She was directed by Sophie Fiennes, of the multi-talented Fiennes clan (she is the sister of actors Ralph and Joseph). I liked it quite a bit, though I think it will be even more enjoyable on DVD, because there is such a piece of ideas that needs to be digested. Freudian and Lacanian analysis may be rather cumbersome and seeing that the whole series has become a bit disoriented by the end of two and a half hours. It has not helped me as an inappropriate coffee and the possession of a bladder leads me to a discomfort for the last hour or so. The only real problem with this is that Zizek chose films that were quite obvious with Freudian themes. He spends a lot of time on Hitchcock's and David Lynch's films, not exactly masters of subtlety. I would have liked to see him trying to support his theories with a wider range of films, although that really tells me I want to see the four and five and six. Zizek is very funny and a part of the humor was watching him presenting what a lecture meant as he enrolled in the real scenes of some of the films he was discussing. For example, we see him in a motorboat on his way to Bodega Bay (from Hitchcock's The Birds) or on the basement of the Bates Motel (from Psycho). Which does not mean that its theories are not provocative. Even when I woke up with him, they certainly made me think a little deeper on the movies. Which is exactly what it is trying to accomplish.
