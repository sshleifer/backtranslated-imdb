Three villains simply give their deserts after they lose their lives in greed, drugs, ego and bad attitudes. Interesting and well done; this style of film always makes me wonder where the reality and imagination are taking over. Even though these people were sinking the earth, I still felt sorry for them. They never had too much chance.
