I met seven minutes in the sky at Linda Feferman when I was 14 and I worked at a video store and loved it. I recently watched the movie and realized it was a lost treasure. The film sees Jennifer Connelly almost twenty years before winning an Oscar for the Beautiful Mind, like Natalie Becker. Byron Thames plays the best friend in the world, Jeff Moran. The film is certainly a milder, sweeter and gentler version of Pretty in Pink's and Some Kind of Wonderful in the 1980s, which is exactly why it's so good. It's honest, not forced as these movies, and parents will enjoy watching this movie with the kids there. When Natalie's father goes home on a business trip, Jeff convinces her that she should move because home life sucks. With the support of Natalie's friend, Polly, played very well by Maddie Corman, she leaves it. But this movie does not have to put children in situations and see what they can escape. The three leaders are so natural, and the script, surprisingly so honest, that what is best in their performances is breaking the heart. These characters really care about each other. It's a great movie to show kids who reach pre-adolescent adolescence. <br /> <br />
