This movie is fun and suitable for any age. It's definitely a family fun. Distribution does a good job in Midwest, Big Bean, Illinois. Where we have to assume that nothing is ever happening because the decade's (pre-invasion) decay is the new (and only) outpost of the Interstate. The location is addressing as boring and totally unlikely for Martian invasion of the earth. But these Martians are totally in vain, despite being well equipped with an arsenal of frightening and deadly weapons ... including a set of Martian eradication! Martians lose their lines and put the right accents to make our viewers and locals help them ... leave the earth. J. J. Anderson, who plays very young Halloween carnivorous duck, has only wonderful lines. Watch this movie for fun and fun; provocative thoughts are not. But it is subtle and pleasant.
