Do not expect a description of the "truth". However, the accounts of these wars veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan require careful consideration. <br /> <br /> The biggest force of the film is that it vividly depicts the words and wounds of war of these veterans and their postwar wars to rebuild a certain degree of normality and functionality in their lives. My major critique of the film is double: it is unilateral and supports anti-war activism, but it has nothing to correct the serious shortcomings of military and veteran business programs to help those who " but as a veteran, I know that the horrible outcome of the war is real, and these young men and women articulate it very well.This veterans accurately describe the pains and physical pains and psychics that most veterans experience and that ordinary people have to understand because the horrors of all wars are so traumatic and disturbing.
