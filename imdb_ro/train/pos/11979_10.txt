I'm trying to look at her every day most of the time and even though I have watched it for the past 4 years, I have not seen any episode. The show is about Danny Tanner, who is the guy who does not sports news. His wife is killed by a drunken car accident and asks Jesse, a motorcycle Elvis maniac and has a hairy obsession. Joey, an adult child who makes comedy and has cartoons all the time to take care of the three girls, Donna Joe, is called DJ, Stephinie who is the second oldest and Michelle, the youngest. /> Everyone lives under one roof, with no one to help. Later in the show, Jesse gets a girlfriend and later is married to her and has twins, Nicki and Alex. (this is going to happen in the new seasons) This show is great, if you like Zack and Cody's life, that's Raven, Boy Meets world and Designing Woman, you'll love this. (Beginning to improve in the ending seasons) Look at her, you will love it!
