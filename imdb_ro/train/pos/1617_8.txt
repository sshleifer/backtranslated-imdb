"Moonstruck" is a love story. There is no love story, there are at least three, but all have to do with the same family. The Loretta family. Loretta (Cher) is about to marry Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello). He does not love him, but he is sweet and good. When she goes to visit her mother in Italy, Loretta meets Johnny's brother Ronny (Nicolas Cage). He and Johnny have not talked to each other in five years, and Loretta wants to invite him to the wedding. Of course they fall instantly on each other. How this story develops and the love stories of Loretta's parents, uncles and aunts are something you just have to see for yourself. Every seen is a pleasure to look with Cher as the bright star in the midst of all. He won and really deserved the Oscar of that year. Cage is pretty good and also capricious, and Olympia Dukakis as the mother of Loretta and Vincent Gardenia as her father are wonderful. This movie is funny, charming and therefore very enjoyable.
