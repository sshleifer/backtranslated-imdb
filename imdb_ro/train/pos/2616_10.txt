Lion King 1 1/2 is a very nice story to go with the lion king. It basically follows the original story of the lion king, but with a few twists. In the movie, the images are explained by a different point of view of the characters. This story is still an original plot. As for the sequel, Disney is not so great to do the most valuable. This, the third part of the King of the Lion (Prida's Simba is the second.) It actually has an original idea while still involving the fun of the first. Timon and Pumbaa travel along the quest for the ideal place to live. After they searched extensively and widely, they find the place "Hakuna Matata". Then I meet a little lion named Simba and go through many things my parents are going through today. I think this is a great movie and I'm happy to add it to my collection.
