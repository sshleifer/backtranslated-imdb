The wonderful James Stewart, the Vera Miles vehicle. Which makes this historic film that deals with the FBI so good is the family element that is involved in a 35-year career as described by Stewart in the film. The film features a history of the great investigative agency. It refers to the plane bombs of the planes, the killing of the Oklahoma Indians for real estate gains, the fight against organized crime, the Nazis and the Communists in that order. The human element is never far behind, as Stewart plays Vera Miles. They raise 3 kids because Miles's heart goes out every time Stewart goes on mission. Look for a short but memorable interpretation of Murray Hamilton. Later, he appeared as Mr. Robinson in 1967 "The Graduate". The film has nothing but a praise for J. Edgar Hoover. He certainly brought the FBI to the hair. True, this could be seen as a right-wing propaganda, especially with Stewart's Republican visions, but it is well-done, historically informative, and the family's view so well illustrated.
