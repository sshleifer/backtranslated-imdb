I showed this in the 6th grade 17 years ago and the students liked it. And I loved it. The story of the terms and the interaction with their environment is amazing. The distribution of creatures is profound and everyone plays their parts well. The battle between the two cold-blooded titans is a truly classic movie. Alan Root did an incredible job of the room and should have won the Best Documentary Oscar. The copy I have is not narrated by Orson Welles (Derek Jacobi) and is not called "Mystery Clay Castles", just "Clay Castles". This makes me think it must have been done with Welles added for star power and an Oscar push. I was lucky enough to find this VHS just recently and is now the favorite movie for my children. They brought it to the latest family meeting instead of a Disney movie. If you find this movie, you are really lucky.
