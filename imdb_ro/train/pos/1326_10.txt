I saw this movie at a college film festival in the 70s - we wait FOREVER for this movie to appear on the video (eventually it is out). It was made in Brazil, so I assumed that this was not the case for the video. I checked the video stores in the last 15 years waiting for this remarkable movie to appear! He's one of my favorites all the time - but be warned, it's weird, like Werner Herzog weird - his oddity comes from his super realism. The film relies on a true incident back a few centuries ago, in pre-colonial times, when Europeans first met the Amazon tribes. A white man is wrong with a wild cannibal tribe as their enemy, so he intends to kill him. Before sending it, they are part of their tribe (their habit). The whole movie is like looking at a National Geographic documentary while he becomes an accepted member of their tribe. That's it. The cosmic planet? An insight into the variety of human life? Surely. Oh yes ... be warned ... this movie has a defined nudity - this is not a hollywood shlock about wild noblemen ... this movie says it was (re-read above: National Geographic, super-realism) < br /> <br />
