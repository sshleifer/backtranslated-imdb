Matthau and Lemmon are the best in this case - all the others in the movie are also wonderful. The dialogue is excellent and very, very full of witchcraft - and the scene in which Lemmon's character tries to free his sinuses in a restaurant has rolled me down on the floor every time I see him. Anyone who realizes that it will not be so great should not go back from the original. I recommend this wonderful movie to everyone - I really like it. And the fact that Jack Lemmon plays his character so straight, with tragic accents adds only to the hilarity in my opinion. These two good guys have made a number of movies together, but this is the best - no doubt.
