I have to say, from the beginning, when I looked at Stargate's film, nothing or something like a SF movie with a lot of POTENTIAL was rejected, although the movie was not as amazing as other films SF movies such as Star wars or aliens, which if u are a fanatic scientist u will admit that one of these two titles is amazing, even if they are not so hard of scifi fans like humans, I do not remember of a line from any of these films, I'm not a big fan of wearing T shirt shirts, actually if you've seen me look like a regular person for you, ah get a little out of the point here, well my point is the fact that you do not have to be a hard core fan to enjoy this great series that unfortunately ended after 10 stunning seasons without a drop in its quality as it came to an end in 2006. <br /> <br /> Although I did not like the movie, I often expected it much of the first season of 1997 and let me tell you, the special effects were just one of the iliable things about the series, the chemistry between the characters gave me the soul, the special affections, were just as good if not even better than most science fighters taking place today. I have to admit that I would never have gone to Scifi if it was not for stargate and my father, who really put me in science when I was 6 years old and I'm glad he did, did not see brilliant performances like SG1, which now, in my opinion, sets the benchmark for almost all science fiction series and films, essentially if a new series of scifi is not better or as good as SG1, is not worth watching. in principle, this is the best science show so far, and if you do not look at it then you have no idea what you lack!
