Master cinéaste Alain Resnais likes to work with those actors who are part of his family. In this film we also see the members of Resnais' family, such as Pierre Arditi, Sabine Azema, André Dussolier and Fanny Ardant, would be their death, their love and their global implications on our everyday life. The formal nature of the relationship shared by these people is obvious even as friends, they address each other using a formal form. In 1984, by making L'amour à mort, Resnais dealt with time, memory and space to discover the mysteries of a fundamental question of human existence: Is love stronger than death? 16 years ago, in 1968, Resnais made a similar movie, Je t'aime Je t'aime, about love and memories. The message of this film is loud and clear: true and profound love can even put science at shame, lovers of death regain their lost lives, letting doctors take care of their reputation. L'amour à mort is like a game that is not at all teaching. It's a movie where the musical score is in perfect tandem with its images. the reasons why this movie can be easily understood.
