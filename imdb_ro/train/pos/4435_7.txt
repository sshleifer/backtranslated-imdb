This is a small crime scene, which is very much dressed during 65 minutes of running. He has all the right ingredients - a mysterious corpse, a tired middle-aged cop, Corrigan (Walter Kinsella) and Tobin's opponent (John Miles), a killer killer in front and even the love for Tobin in the form of a Mary botanist mother (Patricia Wright ) that helps to solve the crime. There is also an extraordinary shooting end that takes place in a stone cutting yard. Beware of a terrible bad luck near the start of this movie where Lt. Corrigan refers to the dead woman as "Tattooed Tilly" BEFORE the forensic doctor reveals that she has a tattoo (confused, right?). Also, later, when Tobin follows the killer behind the back yards, it is suddenly shown that he is going in the wrong direction - no wonder he did not catch him!
