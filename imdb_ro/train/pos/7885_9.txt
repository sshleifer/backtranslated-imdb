First of all, I must start this comment saying I am a huge fan of Nightmare on Elm Street. I think that's the biggest horror series ever. For me, Freddy is the boogeyman! Of course, Freddy's dead man, who tried to be the last chapter ever since, is a strange movie. It does not have the same atmosphere as previous films. Freddy has a lot of time on the screen. Some believe it makes it less scary, which I agree. And that is, in my opinion, the exact point. This movie exists so we can get to know Freddy a little better, who he is, who he was, how the man who hunts our dreams has become. For some people, it's a bad thing, it's better if we never know, because it's more frightening to know why evil is bad. Obviously, those people do not like Rob Zombie's Halloween remake. To really enjoy this, you have to see things differently. This is not a strange guy hiding in the lip of your dreams, waiting to scare you. This was the first, and it was great. With the passage of years, Freddy has killed more and more people and no one has ever been able to escape him. Now is the time to learn about the nature of this evil, the psychological aspects of Freddy's terror. Besides the story of Freddy's past, I also liked the atmosphere of the movie. There are no children in Springwood, just mad adults. Nightmare scenes are all wonderful. The soundtrack is great, especially the launch song called "I'm Awake Now," played by Goo Goo Dolls. In my opinion, Final Nightmare is a horror masterpiece and I can not believe it is so underestimated. Maybe it's misunderstood or I have different tastes! Anyway, all Freddy fans should look at it. It has a lot of frightening moments, as well as funny moments and many cameos! Be ready for something different and you may not be disappointed.
