Not to confuse Resse Witherspoon with the same name, this is a stylized look at Hong Kong triad gangs. Election call because a new leader or "president" is chosen by ancient traditions every two years. Two candidates favor the position and, through ego, bribe and past results, the race is very tense. Boldly done to show you an expansive distribution, without confusing the story with breathing and turning before revealing itself in all its brutal glory. The Asian godfather is not like this, but it's a delightful thriller in a gangster genre that will leave you on the edge of your chair and win the violence. Subtitled volume 1 I think it's safe to say there will be other rates as we go deeper into the troubled world of triads and all their deceptive and useless business affairs. Anyway, this is a good start and if there is no sequel to a great movie in itself.
