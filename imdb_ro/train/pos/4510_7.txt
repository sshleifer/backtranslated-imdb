Insisting that Martin Luther King's inspired spirit is not only in American civil liberties, but in the hearts and minds of people everywhere, the Danish helmer Niels Arden Oplev transplants this faith into an average school in 1969 in Denmark. More specifically, he is heading to the crusade of a boy named Frits (Janus Dissing Rathke) against Abendsen (Bent Mejding), abusively and rigidly abusive. Adapted from a true story, the performances are performed with some aplomb and a refreshing command of its various characters involves it. A battle of ideologies between a 13-year-old disciplinarian and a dignified dignitary leads to inherent humor, but strange changes in disorientation of mood, despite the fact that it keeps cynically in the same direction as the "Society of Dead Poets" more than a "Matilda" . She travels a familiar way, but a continuous and precise service for her young protagonist, including a personalized subplot that shoots Frits as a young boy becoming a young man, manages to raise the film into a fledgling family movie with his nose right money.
