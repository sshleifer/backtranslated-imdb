There are movies and there are movies. Movies are more often than cinematographic "candy", while movies are true works of art. Fraulein Doktor is certainly well placed in the second. Like most viewers, I was extremely impressed by the battle scenes, but the central character's portrayal movement is what I consider the most serious movie quality. Having done her best to serve her country as a true daughter of Germany, always in the mood of addiction to morphine, Fraulein dies very sadly by the German commander, despite all his efforts. The scene in which the doctor is being sent to the back seat of a Mercedes Benz auto order, alone, deserted and wept, is probably one of the saddest and yet bodily representations of a spy's life. Only the emotional pain presented by Richard Burton in the Spy that came from Cold is approaching. Fraulein Doktor is a much deeper film than can be done on a singular view. I just want their producers to be willing to release it on DVD, so those who have never experienced it, and those who have seen it can again (maybe again and again) enjoy this exceptional movie.
