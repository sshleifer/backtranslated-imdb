I laughed a lot while watching this. It's a funny little thing with a fun musical act and a lot of noise. Characters are simple, but their simplicity adds to the stylization of humor. The dialogue is fun and often unexpected, and from the first line to the last, everything seems to be wonderful. He is Max, who apparently led a horrible life. And Edward, who is not sure what life he wants to lead. My favorite character was Tom, Edward's crazy boss. Tom has a short, but memorable role. Highly recommended for anyone who likes stupid humor. And you can find it online now, which is a bonus! I'm a fan of all Jason's cartoons, and I can not wait to see what's coming up with the next one.
