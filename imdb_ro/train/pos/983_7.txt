I think this film has a lot to recommend, especially a particularly sinister performance by David Morse and more than acceptable performance by those who deserve always watching Mr. Foxx. Although there are lots of holes in the plot and the motivation is very, very difficult to follow in some cases, it generally makes for a nice time in front of the tube.
