The best Cheech & Chong movie so far! Of all Cheech and Chong this is the safest best ever. I think I've seen them at least twelve times, and I've loved them all. But this is best the best. Compared to the others, it covers a lot of themes and gives you lots of good laughs. Some of the texts are still part of our language today, after 25 years. I hope one day they can do another because they are still great comedians. I heard I was writing a new script, so who knows ... I think these guys are the only ones who managed to make decent films in this genre. I wonder if John Ashcroft ever watched one of them ...
