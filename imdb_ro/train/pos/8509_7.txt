I do not like reading reviews that say something like, "Do not waste your time, this movie smells on ice." He does the reviewer for me yet, he may have naive charm. If you love the Whistler series, it will be watched. If you like 40 noir films, it will be watched. This film is not as good, in my opinion, as any of the previous series that played the role of Richard Dix as a protagonist. It is much slower, and the plot is tricked. You've seen the same narrative device used in many other movies, and usually better. But the action is good, as well as the illumination and the dialogue. It's just energy-free and you'll probably figure out exactly what's going on and how everything will eventually come out no more than a quarter of the way through. The Whistler series is semi-noir, and character, mood, illumination, camera movement and angles are more important than the story itself. But this movie is not noir. It's too hard, and Hollywood is innocent for that. Neither the characters of Richard Dix, nor those of any of his ladies in previous films, should have been good. You never knew until the end. But, however, I will recommend it for at least one viewing. I looked at it at least twice and got a reasonable piece of joy from both times.
