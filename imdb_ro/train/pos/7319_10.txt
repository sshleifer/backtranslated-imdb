Halloween is the story of a boy who was misunderstood as a child. He gets his big sister problems, which he kills at the beginning of the movie. This is just the beginning of things that come from Michael Myers. Donald Pleasance plays the doctor who studies Myers for years. He knows something is different from him, something mysteriously evil. This evil will not be restrained and can not be stopped. After escaping from an institution, Myers follows his younger sister. If she kills her, it is possible to put an end to the misunderstanding of this incomprehensible boy. But he seems to have trouble completing his sister as other people resist. He manages to get them while he's still looking for one girl he needs. There have been many of these horror films involving teenagers made in pieces by a masked or frightening killer. But that's all started, somehow. If you think about it, most of the horror movies we all remember are those that have Freddy Kruger or Jason casting around naked half girls. Well, if it was not for Halloween, those characters would not have haunted our dream when we were kids. Halloween's director John Carpenter escaped much of the horror films of the 1950s and combined everything he knew into a movie that scared the crowd out of the box in the 1970s. These films have solidified him as a director to watch and also jump from the start of Jamie Lee Curtis's career, who plays a girl watched by the masked killer. This movie may seem clich√© today, but at that moment there was not much there. She was copied and taken out of her, but Halloween will always be the terrible adolescent movie. He still gives you the cold by listening to Carpenter's thrilling music, while we see another victim being watched by that shadow of Michael Myers.
