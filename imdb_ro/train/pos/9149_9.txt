I have not seen Richard Thomas to play a bad guy. I was not sure I would like that. And I was not sure he could get him out. But that amazed me. He sent me trembling in my column and made to look more closely street people. The movie is fascinating and fast-paced. Bruce Davison is convincing, but all can play really is a nice guy. The real talent here is Thomas. The end was a little awkward, but maybe that's how the real people would fight ... If you're a fan of Thomas, you MUST see him here, best being bad!
