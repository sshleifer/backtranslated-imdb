I watched the "Ice Age" in the cinema and I liked the movie. Despite the fact that the "Ice Age" has many scientific defects and errors, such as people, swords, dinosaurs and mammoths living at the same time, and even where the story goes (shows North America but has some features in Iceland for example) we can even have fun (unless you are very severe!) The planet enters an ICE age and many animals emigrate to the south where it is warmer. Sid is a bad laziness that is left behind by his own family, who can no longer bear it. He sees Manfred, or as Manny calls him, a moody mammoth who does not care about extinction or immigration and heads north. Concerned about being easily captured, Sid decides to follow Manfred, and in the middle of their journey, they have found a human mother with her child. Mom dies, but Manfred and Sid decide to take it and return it to the people. Diego, one of the swords, decides to follow them and help them make a shortcut to the human camp. What Manfred and Sid do not know is that Diego is from a sword clan that hates people and wants to kill the baby and claim to have betrayed both of them to become the sword's food. What will happen will depend on Diego's behavior and consciousness ... "A Era do Gelo" - Brazil
