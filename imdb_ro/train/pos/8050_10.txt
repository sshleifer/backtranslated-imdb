The most agile type of fat in martial arts does it again. An early Sammo movie that mimics hero of his character, Bruce Lee, Sammo is amazing as Lee in his actions and struggles. The way he enters Bruce's style and then back to his own, more familiar, kung fu is a joy to look and shows how accomplished and adaptable he is to his art. Throw in a bit of humor of slapstick so loved by this type of movie and this movie that has everything - comedy (some unintentional as the black type fake), action and some incredible fighting scenes. <br /> <br /> An excellent beer and a movie of friends that deserve an hour and a half of someone's time.
