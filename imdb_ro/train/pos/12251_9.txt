It took me a while to watch this version, unfortunately I do not seem to be able to rent it in the video store, but only in the other version, but I fell in love with it. I've always been on the border with the other Emma. Gwenneth and Toni Collette, because they are not British, have to focus naturally, and for me it does not seem natural. It seems to be put on. I'm sorry, but I do not think Toni and Gwenneth did a great job there. I could not warm up to any of the characters, but this version is more warmth of the heart and more the type of person I imagined Emma to be. It's surely the version I'm going to come back from now on. I was disappointed that Mr Knightley was not looking better, but he was convincing. I like Jane Fairfax better (played by Olivia Williams). I never warmed it in the movie, but it's better portrayed in this version. Come to think about it (besides Mr. Knightley), all the characters are better played, and far less above the top. Unfortunately, both came out at the same time, and the Paltrow version became more popular. Sin ... I also love the new scene at the end. Well done to Kate Beckingsale! So if you're a fan of Jane Austen, do not forget to watch this.
