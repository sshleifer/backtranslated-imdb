The Human Tornado is a 70-year-old Blaxploitation movie starring the night comedy star, comedian Rudy Ray Moore, probably in his boldest role so far. The film tells the story of Dolemite, an evil madman on earth who is on the wrong side of a white racist sheriff sleeping with his wife. Dolemite barely escapes and travels in sunny California to visit an old friend, a night club owner (and Mrs. Dolemite) called Regina Bee. However, it seems that a rival night club owner with Mob links tries to make the muscles in her rocket, so Dolemite takes things in his own hands. Rudy Ray Moore presents many diverse talents in this movie, including powerful dramatic skills, a master of Kung Fu, an impressive singing voice (he offers two of the songs on the soundtrack), a moving, compassionate part with charisma ladies general convincing and the firm sense of comic programming. This movie has everything, a profound plot, an angry action, a laughing-minute comedy, beautiful women in distress, an end of stutter ... what can you ask for in a movie? Flee, do not go to your local TV store and rent the Tornado human today. And make sure you share it with your family.
