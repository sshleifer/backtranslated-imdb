If you saw this movie, you were in Puerto Rico. I have lived all my life in Puerto Rico and I must shamefully admit that we (PR) are now living a real chaos, drugs being the main reason for the shooting and killing that we have almost every day. These people will shoot anyone, anytime and anywhere, and many innocent lives are lost because of that. We no longer feel safe and, in addition, the so-called "justice" is no longer moved by truth and justice, but by money, influence and power. "Ladrones y Mentirosos" is based on real and deplorable facts and portrays the three main issues of Puerto Rico: drug-related crimes, money and power that manipulate our courts, and innocent people and children are corrupted and even die through this situation. Ricardo and Poli's wife, with their true plot and their winning direction (**), were brave enough to present all this as bad as it is: Puerto Rico is a beautiful and friendly country, living a nightmare that does not seem to be done !!! ** Recently they won the Copper Wing Award for Best Director at the 2006 World Cinema Film Festival at the Phoenix Film Festival.
