This is superb - it works great, sets, clothes, music - but above all the story itself. I am amazed that there are no more comments about this movie - certainly one of the best 1980s. It's also a great movie to see in tandem with the great "Harvest Random" that has the same opening crisis <br / > <br /> - a middle-aged, unknown English officer is in a hospital at the end of the war, suffering from shock and full amnesia without any idea of ​​his name, origin or wherever he is part - proves to be a very wealthy man - when he recovers, he does not remember the years before the war, but there resembles the likeness of the movies. We warmly thank all those who have participated in the film - especially actors Ian Holm, Alan Bates, Ann Margret (an extraordinary and surprising choice for casting), Glenda Jackson, Julie Christie. It remains with you forever.
