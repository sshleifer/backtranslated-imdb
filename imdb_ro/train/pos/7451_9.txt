Here is a whole family that will enjoy ... even those who find themselves too good for fairy tales. Shelley Duvall has dealt with this unique, imaginative story on almost every popular childhood fairy tale. The Scriptures offer new overturnings over the old old fables that I grew up and have a handful of stars in each episode. "Cinderella" is no exception to Duvall's standard and, in my opinion, is one of the top five in the series, highlighted by Jennifer Beals (remember her from "Flashdance" - and she's still in Hollywood making a movie here and there) the main role, Jean Stapleton, as a fairy-tale fairy with a Southern accent and Eva Arden as the embodiment of the sinful sinful mother. Edie McClurg ("Ferris Bueller's Day Off") and Jane Alden make a hilarious duo as stepists. Matthew Broderick is a prince Henry. You will all come back for it!
