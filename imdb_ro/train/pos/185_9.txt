I finally bought and added a copy of "Show People" to my collection. I can not comment more than what the previous viewers and the characters, the plot and the overall quality of this film have said, without repeating my own words. Seeing the comeo, the extraordinary appearances of many silent stars M-G-M deserve the viewing itself. I really like the scene where Marion Davies plays and meets herself playing the main character of the movie, Patricia Pepoire. Make sure you read her lips because there is no title indicating what she says when she sees Marion Davies, but it's something like "I do not think I like it!" Pop corn, pop band and ready to return more than three quarters of a century in the history of the film. Enjoy!
