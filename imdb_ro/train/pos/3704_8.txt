Generally, it is difficult to evaluate these cut & paste movies. Some of the segments may be good enough, while others reduce the overall product rating. In this case, for example, the scene of all the girls in the doctor's office was quite interesting ... one of the best in the viewer's (limited) viewing history. Then it's Asia's ... the lady is always fun. And the story that binds the whole together was an interesting concept. The swap scene that closes the offer is not bad either. From a technical point of view, production figures are quite high. Recommended.
