A wonderful surprise of Spanish cinema. I did not think that Jordi Molla could be such a director, after all, I really do not care much about his choice in the movies. However, this movie was absolutely fantastic and is not predictable at all ... something that I am glad! He did not enjoy a good press, and I do not even think he will ever be launched on the American market. We will have to thank our DVD or VHS if that's what ... I do not want to say too much about the story because I do not want to spoil it for you but basically the movie is about a homeless drink who gets the new messiah just for kicks and get some money out of him (like many of sooooooooooo) before he knows he's immersed in a life he did not rely on.
