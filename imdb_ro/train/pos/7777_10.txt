Rich, alcoholic Robert Stack falls in love with Secretary Lauren Bacall. He marries her and is so happy to stop drinking. However, Bacall is secretly loved by Stacks' best friend, Rock Hudson. Stacks's nymphomaniac sister, Dorothy Malone, lust after Rock. Throw in a few complications and the movie gets out of control (in a good way). Very glossy film in beautiful Technicolor with fashion and tingling that jump over the jaw (see Bacall's hotel room at first). Everyone looks perfect and dresses in beautiful, formless clothes. Basically, this is a soap opera with production grade A. The story itself is a lot of fun and some of the dialogue from the beginning is hilarious at the top. The action of Hudson, Stack and Bacall is not so good, but seeing them so young and full of charm is great ... especially Stack ... when my knees smiled weakened! Dorothy Malone, on the other hand, is fantastic - she earned the best actress as a secondary role for her role. She's sexy, violent, vicious and sympathetic ... totally convincing. <br /> <br /> Fun, shiny garbage. Do not miss!
