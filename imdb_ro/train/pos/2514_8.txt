I voted 8 for this movie because of minor childhood defects. Besides, this movie is one of my favorites! It's fun to say at least. The scenes are ridiculous, and I think Gackt (who wrote the book) takes a little too much of the "Matrix obsession" in it. Apparently their enemies are sitting there ... waiting to be shot. However, this film touches and makes me always cry. She has a lot of humor in it, so it makes me laugh. Gackt is a great actor I have to say ... it shows so much excitement. This was the first time Hyde acted and he did well. His role is right. Wang Lee Hom is absolutely awesome. All distribution is what I would say perfect for this movie. Do not miss! SHOULD YOU SUCCESS!
