I think most of those who have posted comments on this movie do not understand how to watch a movie and / or have a little sense of elegance. First, to evaluate a movie, you need to understand the extent to which everything in the movie works together. Modern sensibilities require a great drama. No, I do not want to say great character and plot settings, but they seem to require emotional trajectories that are very tragic or very comical. This is a subtle film. Her beauty lies in its subtlety (not to be confused with simplicity). Neither the story nor the characters are simple in this movie. It's a beautiful film that makes the most of the combination of sensuality, politics, human weakness, venality ... that you call. The world they are in is alien and will not be understood today ... a world where, if you have it, you must do it now and LUMI, even if you think you have it. Many people today do not understand that Victorian society was not truly victorious, as people understand this term today. This movie helps record the record.
