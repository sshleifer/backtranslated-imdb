A Bugs Bunny cartoon of previous years has Bugs as an interpreter in a window displayed at a local store. After the day is over, the manager comes to tell him he'll be transferring soon. Bugs are happy to force them to realize that the new job is in taxidermy ... and that taxidermy has to do with animal stuffing. Animals like a certain rabbit. This causes a battle of intelligence between the raccoon rabbit and its former employer. I realized that this short was delightful and certainly one of the best in the early 1940s.
