The film belongs to Inventor - Underdog. Jake Gyllenhaal, Laura Dern and Chris Cooper bring a small story with a series of standard elements. Well-filmed, well-edited, with plenty of well-performing secondary roles. Some have said this movie is a classic American hokey. This is even more. I agree with those who say "The film celebrates the emotion of the young inspired". <br /> <br /> The film is a pleasant reminder that achievement can be born from ordinary roots. <br /> <br />
