Of the three remakes of W. Somerset Maughan's novel, this is the best, and not least because what John Cromwell brought to the film. The film is worth watching because of the performance of Bette Davis, who, in the role of Mildred Rogers, showed the film industry that it was a star. Eventually, her battles with Jack Warner and his studio were red-marbled. The film is dominated by Mildred from the beginning. We realize from the beginning that Mildred does not care about Philip and will never do it. He does not hide his contempt for this type of soul who falls in love with the wrong woman. He will be humiliated again by Mildred, and again, because he does not bones about what he really is. Poor Philip Carey, besides being disabled, is a weak man. When he tries to cling to Mildred, he rejects it. When Mildred returns to him, when he is fragile and defeated, he stands up to this opportunity, overcoming his dependence on this terrible woman who has stolen her will and the male. Bette Davis gives a fantastic portrayal of Mildred. This was one of the best roles and ran with her. Her dislike of Philip's guy is clear from the beginning of their relationship. When she tells her that she washes her mouth after kissing her, she is one of the most powerful moments in the movie. Leslie Howard pointed out Philip and made him look even weaker than he. Frances Dee, Reginald Denny, Alan Hale and Reginald Owen, are seen in minor roles. This is the Bette Davis show and do not forget it!
