If you are looking for a sonor-boom-special effects monster, click on the BACK button on your browser. Deathtrap was written by Ira Levin (Sliver, Stepford Wives, Rosemary's Baby). It's a stage piece adapted for the screen. 95% of the film takes place in the superb house of playwright Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine). He is the author of a successful Broadway show, but his last effort has failed - horrible. An aspiring screenwriter, Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve), who attended a Sydney writing workshop, sent him a copy of the song he wrote. Sydney tells his wife, Myra (Dyan Cannon), the song is fabulous - a sure hit. But is he good enough to die? Time will tell you. <br /> <br /> Intelligent dialogue and numerous twists and turns from the plot keep this fun movie from start to finish. All distribution seems to have a good time. It's a reminiscence of another funny mystery Michael Caine: Sleuth. It's worth watching. <br /> <br />
