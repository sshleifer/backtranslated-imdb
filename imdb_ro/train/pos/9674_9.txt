I did not give this movie a perfect score to be honest compared to the great classics like "Citizen Kane" and "Seven Samaurai". However, this movie is so wonderful, it is a shame that the score is so weak for the IMDb general voter. However, the IMDb voter heads to geeky, and Paulie does not qualify for it. The only criticism I might suggest is that Hallie Kate Eisenberg did not portray the perfect stuttering child. I'm sorry, but I'm asking a six-year-old to make Dustin Hoffman, while Rainman demands the impossible movie. Going through that minor complaint, the movie has the best of most movies: road-trip buddy, con-games, hero as a friendly-animal party (birds?), Disney humor for young and old, etc. Tony Shaloub plays her role as a pair of comfortable jeans. It's normal for him, it seems. ("I'm Russian ... I love long stories.) I do not like mangoes, but it almost makes me want to go out and buy one. Watch the movie and that will make sense." /> Buddy Hackett and Cheech Marin make appearances in the film, roles that are pretty good for what we all know about them. I always found Jay Mohr to be a bit slim, and his role on the screen fits him too The only surprise for me it was that Jay was also Paulie's voice, eventually, even that works well, put together Parrot and anti-Parrot as a team and create a magic.> If you're trying to find a movie for you and children who are neither insulting nor boring for anybody, "Paulie" is a perfect candidate, but I admit that a happy moment cites my review of "Paulie." He was on a journey during a great heat wave. condition of the car died, half of the rest the uggs have remained cool (as our hotel did) and I said, "Let's watch a movie where the air is running" So I did. So, for 100 minutes, we were cool, amused, and I gave a warm-up experience. When I recently saw the VCR under less emotional conditions, I realized how well this movie was made. It's a movie you do not regret to watch.
