This film is a true and historical film. It is very useful for those searching the LDS church because it is 100% true. It's an excellent movie and I recommend it. It is very real, exciting and motivational. There are some who think it's not real, but it is. It is the restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Prophet Joseph Smith, who restored it. He has such events in his life as the illness he had when he was a little boy, the court of Emma Smith, Emma, ​​his wife, the birth, and so on. But, most importantly, reveals the restoration of the church.
