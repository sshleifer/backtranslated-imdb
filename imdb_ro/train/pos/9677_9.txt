This film appears on the surface to be a run of the film of mill kids that parents can watch with regret with their more entertaining children. The film seems and is mostly aimed at children, but it does not stop at this level. I watched this movie first as a small child and I thought it was fun, fun and charming and I did not see it again for a few years. I looked at her again at the age of 18 and found her almost as funny but equally enthusiastic and fun. This movie is highly underestimated and contains many real-life messages. This movie is an inspirational search story that is made for children but epic in itself. I recommend this movie to anyone of any age.
