This is a very good Spanish film, but I am worried that many of them will feel lost because many around the world have no idea what the Spanish Civil War was about or when it struggled. Being a history teacher, we had a big advantage, but I could easily see how the film could be confused until you find all the pieces. I doubt if there is a big concern in Spain where this film was made, but for other publications it might be a little confused until later in the film. The film begins with Carol, 12, and her mother returns to her mother's hometown. The years have passed and you will gather that I come to Spain in New York City. Despite the weirdness, Carol speaks Spanish quite well and much of the film is about how he adapts. As to why she and her mother are lonely, I will now pay for those who do not take into consideration that Carol's father is fighting in the war on the part of the Republicans (who eventually lost in this very bloody conflict ). The movie gets remarkable notes for the great work of the camera and music. Rhythm slow and coveted is not bad if you are someone who can accept movies this way. I have seen some other Spanish films about this war and this compares pretty well with them - not better or worse - just a decent slice of life film about those left behind, as well as a beautiful coming of age . /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The nationalists were led by Franco and were helped by Portugal and the fascist states of Germany and Italy.
