This is a pretty good movie ... yes, some parts are blades and extremely convenient, and the film does not really justify the big cast (AB, SD, Tanuja). However, the actor who impressed me here was Kay Kay Menon (not to be confused with KK singer). In the scene where Amitabh's character meets for the first time, I thought that a man who can only look at AB, keep a look, not say a word and stay strong, is certainly a good actor. In fact, he proved to be worthy again in Sarkar, alongside AB for the second time. This guy should get more roles, he's brilliant. If you have read any of the other reviews here on IMDb, you already know the plot and agree that Akshaye Khanna's entry to Pakistan was too easy. And the little angle of love he shared with "what he was" was completely useless. But he is a pretty good actor (as seen in DCH), Sunjay Dutt is cool to always look. and AB ... what can I say. I do not know if I am his biggest fan in the world, but I know they can certainly compete on the spot. An interesting watch, considering it to be Bollywood, though a bit inspired by the old Hollywood like the "Great Escape" and "The Kwai Bridge".
