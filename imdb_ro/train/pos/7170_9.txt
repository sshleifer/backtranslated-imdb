HOLES is not Disney's usual thing - it's very, very fun, even for adults who usually get lost in the "family fun" studio conceived by the group that Uncle Walt's studio plays as live action. Perhaps the secret of the success of this film lies in its belief in the original book, which is slightly darker than that of your average child. The action begins when Stanley Yelnats is sent to a boys' prison camp where all inmates are forced to drill holes under the sun of the desert as a form of rebellion. But as the story progresses, Stanley's story becomes interconnected with that of a legendary treasure, and this adventure becomes ten times more fun than any Disney movie about a prison camp of all boys entitled to be. Jon Voight is particularly ugly and colorful, and Sigourney Weaver is beautiful, as always.
