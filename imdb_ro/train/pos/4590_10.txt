Perhaps the film itself is not one of Jackie Chan's best movies, but I think everyone will agree with me that the mall fight was one of the best scenes of fighting ever made. There were also some memorable stunts that were so impressive that they made this movie a classic action. This movie has influenced many other action movies, and I think filmmakers now should learn from this film (as if they could remix that chase scene, with modern technologies, they could do it and better). There were some funny scenes that made this movie even when Jackie did not fight. Althou thinks he could put more scenes in this movie.
