I was very surprised by this movie. Getting into the sneak preview without knowing anything about the movie, except for the one I saw, I thought it would be a fool. I was expecting the bad sex jokes and furting and a pathetic character who will eventually put up because that's how the movies work. Instead, I received a smart, surprisingly original film about a decent guy who just did not have sex. Yes, the movie is full of sexual jokes and vulgarity and occasionally hey-look-a-niplu, but it's done a lot in the spirit of Bad Santa, rather than the Sorority Boys. All the characters are people you probably know in real life, friends who can be redeemed, who just try to catch a brother and live their lives. I thought this movie would have been total stupidity and I was very surprised. Yes, it's pretty big (for example, it's a 40-year-old virgin movie!) But it's very smart to do. Eventually, you really do manage this guy to be put, which tells a lot about the movie, because frankly did you really pity if Ashton Kutcher found his car or not?
