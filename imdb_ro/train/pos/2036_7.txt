- Little boss! When I looked at the votes for "Creep" today, I was surprised that so many IMDb-rated users this movie "1". I wonder: what is expected of such a movie? Are there so many people watching a movie without knowing anything about it? "Creep" is a HORROR movie and is pretty good! This automatically means: it has an absurd story full of holes, scandalous dangers and simple characters. So why complain? Just take some popcorn and coke, you feel comfortable in your chair and then ... ... you enjoy being scared of death! The first 60 minutes when there is hardly anything but Kate and a lonely metro station scare incredibly. There is suspense and fear in every corner of the screen and you will give some tricks just because of the sudden sound of a neon lamp blinking behind you. (In my opinion, the sound editor did the best work in this movie.) When Kate encounters the pursuer, the quality of the movie decreases, but it still does not become a bad movie. The second part of the movie is not scary at all, but the gore effects are well done and the story is pretty well developed. (... as long as you remember that it's a horror movie you're watching, not Discovery Channel!) So if you want to make a very, very scary hour. Watch only the first hour of the movie "Creep" and then leave the cinema or TV. You know the rest of the story, do not you? The bad guy will die, and Kate will be the only survivor. But even if you watch this movie to the end, you will not be disappointed. If you want to push anxiety to the next level, do what I did after watching this movie: leave the cinema in the dark evening, go to the next subway station and take the last train home ...
