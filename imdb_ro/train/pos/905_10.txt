We lost confidence in Sooraj R. Barjatya after Main Movie Prem Ki Deewani hoon, then a year ago, I saw the promotion for Vivah that looked good. But I did not want to lose my money, looking at cinema. When the movie came out for the first time on DVD, I hired and followed and liked the movie and took my words for Sooraj. I just finished watching yesterday and now I thought I had to review this movie. Sooraj R. BarjatyaIt was right this time, okay, I was not a big fan of Hum App Ke Hai Kaun. But I always loved Manie Pyar kiya after Mania Pyar kiya for me I think Vivah is Barjatyas' best work. I almost never cry in a movie, but this movie made me feel like crying. If you've ever loved before, then there will be many moments that will touch you in this movie, the movie is too sweet and will make you fall in love with it, see a much underestimated movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> It is done today, a lot of people do not believe in this arrange marriage, but I do. The journey between engagement and wedding, which will always be special, and this film shows it clearly. When Prem meets Poonam for the first time, they show how it is and is reality, and my parents say that they have so married and showed it in a way that is so real that people like Prem and Poonam in this movie is the way most marriages happen. It was very sweet, you feel nervous and still excited, the play "Do Ajnabe" looks very good. Coming back to the story, yes, it's a journey that you soon get stuck between Prem and Poonam (Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao) and families there. A twist appears in this movie, which is very good, the last 30 minutes you'll all touch for the tissue box. What makes this movie so amazing is the chemistry between Prem and Poonam, how falling each other is too sweet. Simple and Simple Girl when I meet first time during and after "Do Anjane Ajnabe" It's very sweet to watch, she does not say anything and Prem does everything she says to be honest with her about her past and girl He loved smoking too. Then lead to all of them having a family trip and then when they really fall for each other. It makes you want to just look at the couple and look at all the sweet moments they have. Another factor is that Poonam chichi is really bad for her and you are sorry for Poonam because she was treated badly and makes you want to see her happy and when she finally finds happiness, you feel happy about her and the movie makes you in love with Poonam more than Prem. When he finds happiness through Prem, you want to stay happy and also hope that nothing happens because the character is presented as a simple sweet girl. What brings me to the shows and Amrita Roa as Poonam is amazing in the movie, the best work until you fall in love with this innocent character and you will hurt her to find happiness. Shahid Kapoor as Prem is also amazing, he is Poonam's support in the movie, is her film's happiness, together they share amazing chemistry and I have never seen a lovable couple from SRK and Kajol. If Ishq Vishk has not touched you telling how cute they are together, surely that will do. "Mujhe Haq hai" the song and before that is an amazing chemistry he shows. The scenes that touched me were when Prem took Poonam into his room and showed her where he stood and opened it and they had a moment between them, too sweet. Again, if you've ever been in love with someone in whom these scenes can connect in defiance. The film is just the sweetest thing you'll ever see. Direction is on the scene, for me a good movie is basically something that can pull me and stop thinking that for what hours what is seen here is false and there is a room that stores them. For me, this movie fired me and for the three hours I really felt connected to the movie. The songs you will really want only when you see the movie because these are songs placed in the situation after seeing the movie we played the non-stop songs! The music is amazing, the story is simply stunning and what can I ask for? What can I say at last, we rarely have a movie that makes us feel good, this movie after you've seen it make you feel good and make you want to be a better person. Is it actually the sweetest journey ever, basically showing you traveling between engagement and marriage, and many people say it is the most bitter part of your life? Well, this movie actually shows how you can actually tell people this? Why people say the trip is so amazing! Watch this movie and find out why the trip is amazing!
