I have read so many comments that I also shared the memory of this film and I wanted to see it again, but I did not know the name of the movie. Fortunately, because of searching and finding the title on this site, I read the remarks left here and I realized that this was the movie I remembered. Then I made a search and found the movie and I was so excited to be able to watch the movie 40 years later. Because of this site and your comments, you helped me and I would like to thank you all. I want to share how I managed to find this movie for all those looking for a copy. It was on the VHS version of Wonderful World of Disney, "Call it Courage," which contained 2 movies, the second being "The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle". It touched me as much as 40 years ago and now I own my own copy. I think it's only available on VHS. I found it on ebay and I saw some kids out there. Enjoy it, I know we did it! It is a wonderful story about the love of a boy and the eagle that he took care of. When the time came to sacrifice the eagle, the boy left the eagle free because he could not let them be killed. After the boy had to leave the tribe for punishment after the eagle's release, the eagle saved the boy's life and, more than that, taught him how to survive. The building that the boy and the eagle divided into the wilderness moved so much and the shootings were truly remarkable. What a great thing this was. I've never seen anything come close to this movie!
