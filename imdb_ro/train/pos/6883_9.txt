On rare occasions comes a film that has the power to expand the mind, warm the heart and touch the soul. "LOU" is such a movie. I received "LOU" from my wife, who received it from a neighbor who is in film business. He followed her a second time with me. We were both excited. It would be the first time again. "LOU" is a magical piece meant to send you back when all your dramas started to take place. It does this while it is tirelessly fun. Bret Carr acts and goes down as a director, does not let you look away from the screen. He is a character that disfigures a bunny of bugs, like quitting innocence, but warmly worn with such subtle sincerity that you forget to watch a movie. When the epiphany hit during the brilliant peak, I saw my wife in tears for the second time. As a life coach, we have facilitated individual growth and transformation, and this film is a must see for life coaches and anyone looking for their personal growth and transformation. It's a brilliant, creative masterpiece with the power to change lives!
