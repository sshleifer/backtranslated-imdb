I just saw Murdar at VANITIES again launching the universal Pre-Code set and I was amazed at how much I liked the end of the vehicle. Most other commentators covered the story, a mystery of murder in a musical, but I wanted to add some extra notes. Brisson and Carlisle are relatively gentle, compared to most minor players, and none seem to have the right voice for what they are playing (Carlisle being a ready-made singer, Brisson a little stray on some of the small notes). Grand Victor McLaglen and Jack Oakie play well with each other, with an excellent sync feeling that holds the ball between the musical numbers. Yes, Lucille Ball and Ann Sheridan are Vanities girls, but do not forget the splendid jazz singer Ernestine Anderson in "Ebony Rhapsody". Gail Patrick makes one of his first appearances, sounding a little like Eve Arden; Patrick will continue to become the executive producer of Perry Mason TV. Then is Jessie Ralph as the mistress of the closet - you will notice her at David COPPERFIELD (like Aunt Peggoty) and BANK DICK. Music is great - Brisson introduces the "Cocktails for Two" standard in two different scenes; "Sweet Marijuana," with peyote girls, who were only embedded in the background (the blood that dripped on the white hide of a horn was awesome); "Ebony Rhapsody," with the Duke Ellington Orchestra and a bunch of beautiful dancers, both black and white, and mixing it. And I think this is one of the only early musicals to present such a mix - and the costumes leave nothing to imagination.
