it is there. We're not talking about that much, except we're dealing with a rare topic in beast-like movies. I can see why this movie has been forbidden so much, the topics discussed in the film are still a small taboo for the majority of the world, saying film eroticism is well worth it and matches the film's mood. It's a good film that behaves well and serves a purpose ... to shock the spectator and cross the borders we often do not see in the movies. I came across the movie on the net that I thought I was gonna check it out. I liked the movie because it is believed to provoke somewhat erotic at the same time. Something you rarely see in movies today.
