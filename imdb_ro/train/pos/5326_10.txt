"The Beatles' Birth," as an American television film, released in the autumn of 1979, was actually the best film that tells the story of the four Liverpool boys who revolutionized the music industry and the world. As he said from the point of view of former Beatle Pete Best. The performances across the cast are excellent, but Stephen Mackenna's performances are John Lennon and Rod Culbertson as Paul McCartney. The film was produced by a legend of the Rock and Roll era, Mr. Dick Clark. Who, a year earlier in 1978, produced another TV movie, which was the test of time with "Kurt Rusell" in the lead role of another musical legend; "ELVIS". The film was directed by an unknown director named John Carpenter, who continued to film other successful films such as Halloween, Escape From New York, and The Thing. The same can be said for the director "Beatles Birth", Richard Marquand. He continued to direct other theater blockbusters such as "Star Wars Return of the Jedi", "Eye of the Ace" and "Jagged Edge" among many. The only other film that tells the story about Fab Four that I know is Back Beat, which had a theatrical show in 1994. However, critics did not care about her or the public because she did not have a long lifetime in the theater. The birth of the Beatles is a very charming and simplistic film that gives you the essence of the legendary beginnings and the struggles and difficulties they have encountered and ends there when they arrive in NYC and appear in the Ed Sullivan show in 1964. movie.
