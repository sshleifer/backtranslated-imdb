The director behind this movie was fantastic for a comedy. Many of the scenes seem to be from a comic book and much darker (visual - not wise) than what I expected. It may not be the funniest movie ever made, especially if you are in very brutal sex jokes, because this has very few (compared to others like Something About Mary or American Pie). As you recite it, more jokes stand out and become more fun. If you've ever read a comic book or watched a comic strip (Batman, X-Men, etc.) and liked it, you'll probably enjoy subtle humor that continues during the movie. If you did not like it, you might like the respectful ridicule that this movie has for them. If you liked this movie, the dvd has some extra cool. (8/10)
