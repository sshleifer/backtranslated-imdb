Even though this movie came out a year before I was born, it's one of my favorite comedies. She sees Redd Foxx as a father trying to understand the homosexuality of his son. Like most parents, he does not know anything about what it means to be homosexual, and he has all these stereotypical notions about what homosexuals are. His son, Norman, is now grown and lives alone. When his father, Ben, finds his son homosexual, he pays his son a visit in the hope that he will change him. The title comes from one of the funniest lines in the movie - when Ben arrives in Norman's apartments, he turns into a female prostitute and thinks he is his dear son ("Norman ... Are you so?"). The movie made me laugh from start to finish. Redd Foxx is great. Although a lot of content is stereotyped, we found nothing offensive about how the material was handled and even has a good ending. Highly recommended.
