This is a good example of a movie that, despite the low rating, is more than worth watching. The story is interesting and it does not last long until the chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin draws your attention. The act is first class and the characters are well represented. Sometimes it feels like the director can not decide between romantic drama and comedy. Ben Chiller's speech about the law-abiding English and the shy porn star S.M. Hidden magazines in the bedroom create a lot of moments for laughing! Just like the look in Nicole Kidman's eyes when giving John the first taste of intimacy for a long time ... At other times, actors and especially Nicole Kidman give this comedy a dramatic experience.
