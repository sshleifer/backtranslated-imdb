There are not many reviews, so I thought I would add one. <br /> <br /> DO NOT GO TO OTHER REVISTA! This was an excellent movie. RKS is one of the few Indian directors who can actually put together a very good film together. AB and Akshay gave yet another example of great acting, just like bhoomika, which was a bit unexpected but wonderful to look at. I was surprised that there was not much hype surrounding the release. Or filming / other nominations awards, considering how good the movie was. <br /> <br /> Better then, Khakee thought and thought that Khakkee was also a good movie. It's a pretty long movie, but it's definitely worth it while watching it, it certainly looks long. I can not wait for the next RKS movie and the next AB, the Akshay movie they always seem to do fine together ... waqt. <br /> <br /> Bhoomika acted very well in the film and should do well if it continues in the same way in the future.
