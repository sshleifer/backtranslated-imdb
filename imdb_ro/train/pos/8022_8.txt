Jim Henson's muppets have been my favorite childhood. This movie makes me feel like a child again. Okay, Muppets are back with Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog and their friends. The premise is that they are trying to get to Broadway in a musical show elsewhere than in New York City. You will see camouflages by New York Mayor Ed Koch. However, the movie turns 25 this year, and I hope today's kids will learn to appreciate the gentleness of the Muppets Gang. The problem with the show is that Kermit disappears and the band has to find him in New York City. It's worth watching for kids and even sentimental adults like me.
