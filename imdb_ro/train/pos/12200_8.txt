At the time the The Lady of Shanghai was made, Orson Welles's marriage and Rita Hayworth's marriage collapsed. The film was as much effort as Welles to reappear the old flames, to make a classic noir. Not well received at that time, The Lady of Shanghai has become increasingly critically acclaimed as the years go by. Gotten better with age, let's say. Welles is Irish sailor Michael O'Hara, who, one night, saves beautiful Rita Hayworth from three mugs in Central Park. The spark is flying, but then it rises, it turns out that the lady is married to the criminalized, but brilliant criminal lawyer Everett Sloane. However, Sloane apparently enjoys Welles and pledges to board his yacht. So far, this movie has started ringing much like the Gilda. If Orson had seen Gilda and did not think about this moment with his male member, he would have wanted to go back to the Lower Manhattan sailor's hiring room. Instead, he gets involved in a wonderful web or plot and finds himself surrounded by two crimes, and Sloane is his eminent counselor. Welles, for whatever reason, decided that his wife would be blonde in this film. It seems that Harry Cohn hit the roof as Rita was internationally known for copper red hair. This would have stung him on stage as he joined the legion of the studio bosses who saw Welles' vision of the independent film that threatened their power. Glenn Anders plays Sloane's partner, Grisby, dude, he wraps a corpse. The other cadaver to be here is Ted DeCorsia, a private nurse who nurses from below, trying to do business for himself. It's a good noir thriller, showing Rita to the best of charm, even if she was blonde here. The final shot in the mirror room is nicely staged, but I would not recommend seeing it if it's on a controlled substance.
