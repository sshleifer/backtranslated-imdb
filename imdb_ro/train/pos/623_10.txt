There are not many films that gave me a feeling that Stardust did everything throughout the movie. As the magical story story of The Princess Bride, Stardust is definitely the most fantastic fantastic show of the 2000s and the '90s. Exciting, hilarious and equipped with great pictures and unforgettable characters, especially Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert DeNiro, cause anyone to see this movie without a smile. From the first ten minutes of the movie you know very well how it will end, but it is the journey and not the destination that encourages the viewer from beginning to end. Ten stars and not one decimal. Less.
