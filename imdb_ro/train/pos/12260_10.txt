This is an excellent start to Mickey Rooney's film career. His talents here show that a long career is ahead of him. The Chase of Cars and Trucks is interesting for the 1937 era. This beginning of the Andy Hardy series is an American treasure in my book. Byington Spring Performance is great as usual. Please, Mr. Rooney or the film rights owners, have a chance and get this product on DVD. I think he would be a winner.
