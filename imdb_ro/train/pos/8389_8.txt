This is the best of 43 films made by Rainer Werner Fassbinder; his most successful at least. He was one of the main rulers of New Germany after the Second World War. Hanna Schygulla was magnificent like the cold, calculating Maria Bruan, who had lost her husband to the war, found him after taking a US soldier as a boyfriend, lost him again after going to jail for her, and found him on it at the end. Marriage a day and a half before disappearing was longer than the time spent together at the end. This is life. Things come and go and you do everything you can. You can quit or adjust your thinking to survive. Even though Maria has adjusted her mind and did what she had to do, she never ceased to love Hermann, which makes the end such a tragedy.
