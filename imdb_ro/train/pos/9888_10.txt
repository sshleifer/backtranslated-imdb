Although this wonderful work of art uses part of the cinematic vocabulary of surrealism, it really is nothing like that. It is a political and cultural allegory of Mexico's post-Columbian odyssey, which will attest even a glimpse at Mexican history. <br /> <br /> Unlike "Like water for chocolate," Erendira expects the viewer to meet at least half, so his deal lasts a little. (A good starting point is to see the character of the grandmother as Spain: proud, aloof, sad and, above all, weighed with history.) The final actions of the heroine are obscure as the "outcome" of history ) is always obscure, because we are too close to her for honest evaluation. The refusal to bind beautiful free heads is the only real choice available to the director, given the film's ambitions. "Erendira" is gorgeous. A great screen experience would be ideal if you can catch it at a local art house or a university exam. But if not, VHS is better than not seeing at all.
