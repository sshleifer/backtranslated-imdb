The romanticism of the film, which is its main theme, is presented well and beautiful. However, surrounding the love story is too lyrical, graphic and unrealistic. Even worse, the psychology of the main character is strange and incomprehensible, just like the end of the movie. Do not hesitate to watch this movie if you are interested, but do not expect too much.
