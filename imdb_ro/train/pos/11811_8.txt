Dick Tracy was originally a comic book created in 1931 by Chester Gould. He is a courthouse detective who follows a team of villains, ranging from all kinds of original visual characters such as Flattop to The Blank at Big Boy Caprice. (These villains became so popular in the 1940s that Warner Bros. created their own Tracy-style character in cartoons like Daffy Duck). Tracy's comic strips were known for the use of the gun and cutting-edge technological advances, especially the hand-held transmitter), which gained a fair share of on-screen time on this great movie. The music was made wonderful by Danny Elfman, and the original songs from Madonna were interesting, but they were not the culmination of their career. It's weird because, as you watch the movie and see the tense moments, the movie feels as much as Batman because of the memorable sound of Elfman in his plays. I like the tough child, Pacino behaves like Big Capricorn boy (and his chin!), Madonna deals with bastards, and cinematography and direction were impeccable. This film was made professionally and contains many great actors who have been known for long before this film (Warren Beatty, Al Pacino, William Forsythe, Dustin Hoffman, Kathy Bates, Mandy Patinkin, Catherine O'Hara, Dick Van Dyke ). The film was directed by Beatty himself, which was exciting. It's almost like Beatty was seen as Tracy in a lifetime or something because it really matches the play. I had to give this film 8/10 for everything she brought to the cinema that was overlooked (for whatever reason). There were tons of misunderstandings about the evaluation of this film on IMDb and I still do not understand why. The characters were completely original and vibrant as well as set style, wardrobe, lighting and everything in this movie. Go buy today. You will not be sorry.
