When ever a movie is produced or directed by Mel Ferrer, you can bet your life any of his pictures will be seen from generation to generation. Only with Claudette Colbert (Ellen R. Ewing), "The Egg & I", "47 that appears and plays in the movie will make even more a classic movie." In this film, Ellen Ewing marries and then faces all and the mystery is very much involved, and Robert Ryan (David McLean), "Battle of the Bulge," 65, comes to Ellen's help, and sometimes you ask me if David is up and up. As you view this image, you are right at the moment you begin to understand who the real person is and suddenly, start to change your mind about how the movie ends. Great action by Claudette Colbert and Robert Ryan, who played a completely different role from the one he usually portrays on the screen. I forgot to mention that Mel Ferrer was married with a big movie star, Audrey Hepburn. Great classic movie with great classic actors!
