It's a rare occasion when I want to see a movie again. "Amati Girls" is such a movie. In old time cinemas I would have stayed for more shows. Was this autobiographical story for writer / director? It has the aura of reality. Everyone at star cast presents their characters credibly and sensitively. Who would not want Mercedes Ruehl to be a bigger sister? I loved her work at "For Roseanna". With most movies, one suspends faith because we know it's actors, producers, directors, sound technicians, and so on. suspends this belief in "Girls Amati". He feels a part of this family! How I wanted to come to Dolores's defense when her family choked her emotional life. And he wanted to cheer on Lee Grant as he criticized Cloris Leachman's hair color. Full humor is not the humor of belly laughter, but it has a good quality that satisfies much more than pratfalls and so. The love that is portrayed in this cinema family must be simulated and cherished. <br /> <br /> It is not a coincidence that the family name, Amati, translated from Italian means "loved ones".
