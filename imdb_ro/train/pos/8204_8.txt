Sudden Impact was generally better than The Enforcer in my opinion. It was built to be a great movie, but then I saw the bastard and was disappointed. Sudden Impact was different from previous tranches. The intrigue has come in a different direction in this movie because Dirty Harry does not have a police approach this time. We also do not see bastards until later, which means less time for them, which is best for us all. Clint Eastwood once again steals the show as Dirty Harry,. Pat Hingle was pleased as Chief Jannings, Harry's new boss. Bradford Dillman seemed to change his name to Captain Briggs, anyway, it was not different. Michael Currie is decent as Lt. Donnelly, Harry's upsetting superior. I personally enjoyed Kevyn Major Howard as Hawkins, the young punk who has a vendetta against Harry. Albert Popwell was great as Harry's friend Harry. Audrey J. Neenan was good as Ray Parkins, a famous lesbian around the city. Jack Thibeau was well expressed as Kruger, a perverse. Now for the bad side. Sandra Locke, Eastwood's long-time lover, was terrible, like Jennifer Spencer, Harry's love interest. And Paul Drake was just horrible like Mick. The film would have been much better if not for better writing and action in some parts.
