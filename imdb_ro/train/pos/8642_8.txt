A surprisingly effective thriller, this. <br /> <br /> David Duchovny and Michelle Ensign Ro Forbes are a successful, professional couple, he is a writer, she is a photographer. Forbes is desperate to move to California, and in a compromise act, Mulder agrees with this move, provided that, along the way, visit sites of historical interest about famous serial killers. His idea: he writes the words, takes pictures, the final result being a book selling the best selling books that will put them to life. To help finance the trip, they decide to share and advertise. As their misfortune would have, Brad Pitt sees the announcement and, shortly after they have killed the owner, he and his girlfriend, Juliette Lewis, meet with the young writer and start their crossings. Inevitably, the movement provokes. Pitt is remarkable as a true coolness that inspires Early Grayce and is sustained by Lewis as he plays the usual character of the white trash that seems to be the default setting. Duchovny and Forbes are also doing a double convincing act, and as the spiral events are out of control, you as a viewer are choked in their situation and feel the agitated tension. Intelligent, sinister and beautifully shot, this deserves recognition beyond its present status. A Top Movie.
