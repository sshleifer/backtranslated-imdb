This is hard to follow - as a previous commentator says. This is amazing in view of the terrible movies that emerged right after World War II - especially the "release" of Dachau. It is clear that, since the middle of the war, I knew exactly what was happening to the Jews. The sequence that shows a "transport" is alive, almost as if it were based on a real repertoire of news (the Nazis liked to record its atrocities). Knox as Nazis is brilliant. He makes a career of a Nazi career. This chart is particularly important when it is in contrast to the reactions of other Germans, at first laughing at Hitler, then distrustful and ultimately helpless. This contrast, however, allows us to believe in the "conversion" of a young Nazi officer into an anti-Nazi position. This happened as a testimony to a few attempts against Hitler, especially the Staffenberg plot that took place with the release of this film. A powerful film that effectively uses flashbacks, accurately predicting the Nuremburg routes and others that would appear with the end of the war.
