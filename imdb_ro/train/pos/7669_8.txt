Doctor Mordrid is one of those rare movies that is completely under radar, but it's worth it. It reminds me of the old series of the 30s and 40s. That's why I would love to watch watching movies ... but judging by the rest of Full Moon production there simply were not enough tits to meet the typical audience. Unfortunately, due to a superfluous sacrifice scene, there are two too many for a family audience - which is unfortunate, because without it it could have been a magic-style in the style of Harry Potter that the kids would have eaten. Both Jeffrey Combs and Yvette Nipar are great - I did not know for sure if Mrs. Nipar had missed a A-list movie on this movie, she was very credible. Not really! Anyway - it's a shame they did not have the money to release Dr. Strange, because I think it could have been a total phenomenon of children.
