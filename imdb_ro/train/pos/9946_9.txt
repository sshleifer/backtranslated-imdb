Dream Quest was a surprisingly good movie. There have been some goats, but this can be expected in a movie like this that was done in such a short time. I did not feel any impulse to advance during the movie and it seemed quite fun to me. It's kind of stupid sometimes, but I generally recommend it. Perhaps they had consumed all the sparkle in the nearby shops, and some of the costume designs were pretty good.
