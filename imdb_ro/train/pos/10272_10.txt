Ask yourself where he got the gun? Remember what was learned about the brand mentality when the cone ends? The weapon had goals and was offered from the very beginning. When the patient returns to the end, she is SUPPOSED to see him go in convertible red and take her to the division of the band up to 80,000. <br /> <br /> The patient has been in the cone since the beginning. <br /> <br /> Mantegna does not die at last - the gun has gaps. <br /> <br /> There are enough spoilers for you there? That's why people give him high ratings. It is extremely original due to the hidden end and the way most of the audience is.
