His choice of films, the "conceit" principle of production (which puts him in the sets or simulacra the films they comment on) and his delivery are brilliant! But if you want Freud, be aware of the fact that you get Zizek's Lacan version, which should not be confused with Lacan himself. As usual, Zizek offers complex ideas with taste and convincing. The friction is he is also quite merciless and thus there may be more in his gusto than in real content. Cinematic, it's a jewel. From a psychological point of view, it will have people of all beliefs (Freudians, Lacanians and Jungians) scratching their heads, but reaching the popcorn the same way. Zizek is a phenomenon and a pop icon for himself.
