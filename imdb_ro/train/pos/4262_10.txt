He saw how many times I could before I left the scene. A delightful and fun movie with some of my most favorite stars. I just want to find it again! I certainly would buy / see if I could. Please, someone, bring it back. Fred MacMurray was perfect in his role as a patriot during the Second World War, and his ladies, Joan Leslie, and especially Jun Haver, were beautiful and charming. It was a musical but also romantic, fun and intelligent. This was my favorite movie that took place in June Haver, although I always liked it. Her dazzling smile lit the screen, and her beauty and talent were an asset to any movie. The support granted granted credits for their individual roles. A well-balanced, light-hearted film; We just want to have more!
