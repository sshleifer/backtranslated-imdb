You can survive surviving Christmas. I thought the television version was a little edited. I like Ben Afleck. He plays Drew Johnson, an adult without a family, who is willing to pay strangers completely. Valcos plays James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara as parents and Christina Applegate as Lisa Valco, daughter. Drew feels alone around holidays because he does not have his own family, so he rents a family in the suburbs of Chicago for a quarter of a million dollars. Bill Macy, who reminds me best for the role of Maude Arthur's husband, is committed to playing Duda, grandfather. When the whole situation collapses, the truth can be painful. The Valcos family is breaking up from Drew's situation. Drew's lovely girlfriend and her parents are making a surprising visit. You can not buy what you want! The act and the writing are mediocre, but the first scenario takes it to the final stage.
