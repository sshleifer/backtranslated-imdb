Deaf Writer Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) is assaulted by her husbands who are spirits. When he suggests that he needs an assistant, he seems to be the final insult, but when the first applicant is the former con (Paul Vincent Cassel), she uses the chance to change her life. Carla covers his mistakes, and he, anxious to go straight, helps them revenge on her colleagues. <br /> <br /> When Paul asks Carla to return to her favor, she wakes up in the criminal underworld, led by the merciless Marchand shark (Olivier Gourmet). Recognizing her reading ability as a weapon, no one negotiated for, the two decided to do justice. <br /> <br /> Jacques Audiard's third feature, Read My Lips, is a defying play, moving from dark social comedy to visceral full-throttle thriller.
