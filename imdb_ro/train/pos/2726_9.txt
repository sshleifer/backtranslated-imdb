This movie is there with the classic of all time. Music, photos and actors are excellent. The Black and White movie gives it a much better look and complements the perfect music, such as Psycho. Surprisingly, how few people have commented on this movie. I think it's a hard-to-find film. I gave the film a movie 9. See the movie and you will know what I'm talking about.
