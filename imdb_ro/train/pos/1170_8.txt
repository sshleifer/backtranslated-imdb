Night of the Livingless is a funny spoof of the 1978 movie (and the remake of 2004) of Dawn Of The Dead. Only this time ... with the homeless episode. The episode has homeless people coming to South Park and people can not figure out why. They live homeless as zombies wanting change, and some of their parents get to the roof of a supermarket as in the movie. So now it's up to the boys to find out where they came from and how to get rid of them. This is a pretty funny episode, with some good moments as the guys singing their own version of the 2pac / Dr.Dre "California Love" play. good episode. <br /> <br /> 8/10
