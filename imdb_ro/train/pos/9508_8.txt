In a poor Mexican village, colonel (Fernando Luj√°n) lives with his astonishing wife Lola (Marisa Paredes) in an old house. Lola is still saddened by the death of their son Augustine some time ago. The Colonel was expecting a fighter's pension in a war against the Catholic Church for nearly twenty-seven years. However, for political reasons, the current government wants to forget this old struggle. Without having any possession or money, but a game of great value, they struggle to survive with the expectation of a letter of confirmation from the government, recognizing the law and paying the late retirement. This slow and moving film reflects the social and financial situation of most of the oldest retired people in third world countries. In Brazil, most pensioners have to survive by about $ 80 a month. Colonel's duties in the story were made to pay for a cemetery to his son, otherwise he would be buried as a native. Outstanding performance of distribution, in a very sad story, which is reality in poor countries. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): (`Do not escreve ao Coronel ') (Do not write to Colonel) <br /> <br />
