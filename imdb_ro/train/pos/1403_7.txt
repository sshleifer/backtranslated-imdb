Paul Verhoeven (genius and movie master) strikes with less than perfect but still fun in a "dirty, old dude guy," Hollow Man. The first two acts are so good that Slasher's final act is disappointing. However, I make a recommendation for this film because it's about the special effects of MIND FLOWING (probably the best so far) and about two dandy performances of the drivers. Verhoeven's moral questions are, of course, provocative, and although the film has stopped many, this film is quite soft for the core of the old Verhoeven. Two major flaws: Josh Brolin (aka walking man) and the whole lift business. If there was an access staircase, why were they trapped in the lab? <br /> <br /> A fun horror movie for a Saturday night.
