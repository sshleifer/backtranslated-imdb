MINOR SPOILER <br /> <br /> Little Stephen King Shock. It's not perfect, no stretching of imagination - even if Dale Midkiff's and Denise Crosby's crisp performances are better, there are elements of a mystical story that should fight them. Micmac's old burial ground, Rachel's sister, senior, and Jacob-Marley-a Victor Pascow never gathered in a coherent way, and the movie feels confused and useless. But the few horror movies are really perfect and what they may lack in other areas they act in wanting to shock. "Pet Sematary" may actually be one of the most brutal horror films in recent memory, with his zombie killer child and Zelda's insensitive portrayal. It's politically incorrect, it's tasteless, it's free - and yet it makes us somewhat revolting, horrible "safer" movies can never. Add to one of Fred Gwynne's best performances and Mary Lambert's spiritual direction and you have a rewarding, frightening movie - even with the end of hokey. Highly recommended for fans of gender. 7.5 out of 10.
