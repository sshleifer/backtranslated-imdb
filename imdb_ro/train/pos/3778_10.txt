The first film had a little ambition, so nothing is missing on the screen. It was a bad version of "Back to the Future" with zero charm. Once Bill & Ted has accepted like sticks, jokes can be carved to audience so long before they break. This is a surprise. This is your warning about a spoiler ... <br /> <br /> By today's standards, it's more fun. This has been avoided in liberation, sadly thinking that more talent is involved than the first time. We get the Face / Off photographer, Fugitive editor, a production designer at the beginning of Burton's work and the sound designer of "Matrix". The writers have behaved for their deepest first exit with something profound. Since this was avoided by fans and the public, the director probably decided that the style was too big. It's not, it suits the material. Like "Death Becomes Her" and "Catch-22," this dares to be smart, but we like our "simple" movies, so we do not buy it. Probably since this has dared to be different, it is the reason why 12 producers have had to take it out. What's so good? - You do not like to refer to Keanu; from Airhead to the Messiah. See also Arnold Schwarzenegger. - Joss hates his creations as much as he hates their counterparts, he does his own hatred. Evil B & T and "good robot utensils" have the same vocabulary as the original: younger children and the depreciation of the tongue. - The reason of "duality." Nowhere else is obvious except in photo styles, many large and low angles. They even use Roy Brocksmith from "Total Recall" to highlight the point. <br /> <br /> - The reasons for the election. I do not know where this genre started (maybe "Ghostbusters"), but it's pretty well used here. It even reduces to the 7 games against death - the Battleship and the Club. <br /> <br /> - Self-referencing filter, even present in the game against Death (Clue). He's smarter than Tarantino or Brooks. Notice at the end the Premier's catch: "Bill and Ted: The Movie." Ironically, both Death and Nomolos were villains in the sequels "Die Hard" and "Lethal Weapon." I still have some small nits, but nothing compared to the original. Music and film are different environments, so there is no point in why many scenarios turn around the first - especially on the adolescent market. Carlin is a great comedian, but he's lost in these movies. Also, for all dare this effort shows, even cracking jokes of homosexuals, they can not kill a cat? So despite looking like a Nickelodeon production, this is incredibly exciting. From this movie I received Beavis and Butt-Head. "We are in Heaven and we've just hurt three people." <br /> <br /> Final Analysis = = Medium Material
