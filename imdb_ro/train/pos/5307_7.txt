"Pecker" is a young photographer, unknown in Baltimore, who becomes a big star in public, in the media and in the local art scene, with his pictures showing the dirty reality of everyday life, just like dirty underwear or human excrement. It is a typical subject for independent comedies based on John Waters in Baltimore to show the strange faces of the American way of living between political fashion and conservative correlations, exploring the background of the middle society in his hometown. Edward Furlong from "Terminator 2" plays Pecker, supported by Christina Ricchi, photographer Cindy Sherman, legendary Patricia Hearst and long-time actress Water, Mink Stole. Although the rhythm of the plot sometimes becomes a big flaw and can not compete with the quick and angry jokes of Water's glamorous "Serial Mother," she still has some good laughs in it and unforgettable scenes like a drug girl who has become Vegetarian through the picking of peas in a vegetable dish ... "Pecker" is a tremendous comedy about the arrogance of the art scene, the media hip, middle class sexual aggression, and strange ways to become a pop star without realizing it. Recommended!
