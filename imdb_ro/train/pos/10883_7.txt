This is surprisingly above average slasher, that is pleasing and well done, with some decent gore! All the characters are decent, and the story is quite fun, and Molly Ringwald played the annoying bitch very well. I bought this at a $ 1 pawn shop and was surprisingly worth it, and the special effects were good enough for the budget, plus I liked the mask that the killer wore even though she was in - I sort of creep. The end was really cool because I liked how they beat the killer, and the end, while predictable, was very funny, plus all the characters except the Ringwald being surprisingly enjoyable! It's done in a decent and written way, and I thought it was quite creative and original at times, plus some of the death scenes being very impressive. This killer did not go around, and I loved her, and Slasher fans (like me) should really enjoy this movie, plus the opening was really bad with her movie shooting! This is a surprising over average sound that is pleasant and well done, with a decent gore, and say it's worth the clock! Direction is good. Kimble Rendall is doing fine! work here with solid camera work, using a gruesome setting, good angles and keeping the movie at a fast pace. Action is solid! Molly Ringwald played the bitch very well and I had troubles that seemed bad to her, after all she was supposed to be the heroine, she turned out to be better at the end, but not long, I'm surprised she decided to make this movie, though done a great job! Frank Roberts is fantastic as a killer, he is threatening, creepy and had a hell of a mask, and this guy did not go around, he was fantastic! Kylie Minogue plays very well in her little role. Jessica Napier is nice and does not match the other heroine. The rest of the camp is fine. It's generally well worth the watch! *** of 5
