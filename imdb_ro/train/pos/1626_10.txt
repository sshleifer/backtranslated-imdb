This movie is actually FUNNY! If you want to rest your brain for an hour, then continue and watch it. It's called blonde and blonde, so do not expect deep and meaningful jokes. What this movie and enjoy all the stereotypes we have about two blondes. It's just a funny movie to look at a meeting or a company of friends (especially if you're not too sober.) Pamela and Denise are still a few chickens. It is a mistake to consider this film a piece of art. Okay, this movie is about BLONDE! It should be light, fun and superficial. One more thing, I do not think girls will appreciate and want this movie, but it will definitely be.
