This mystery of murder with musical numbers has a long atmosphere and character, but quite short of suspense and plausibility. Based on a play by the Broadway show, Earl Carroll and others, it combines a whispering plot with a backstage atmosphere (a homicide investigation takes place on the opening night at a theater where a music magazine). <br /> <br /> The distribution is impressive and varied: Victor McLaglen, as a policeman who leads the investigation and never fails to look idiot at any showgirl that is going to be visible; Jack Oakie (Jack Lemmon before Jack or Jack Jack Lemmon, Jack Oakie after the war?) As a harassed director who has to coordinate the performance of the scenes and the chaos behind the scenes; Jessie Ralph, who is always familiar, as a wardrobe mistress with deep and dark secrets; Dorothy Stickney, who has an amazingly near-end monologue, like a mad trembling madman in love with male lead; Carl Brisson, the Danish star, as the male leader who avenged the classic "Cocktails for Two" not once but twice; Kitty Carlisle, officially offering "Where Do They Come And Where They Go" and other Johnston-Coslow songs; the glorious Gertrude Michael, who broke up with us too soon, as a lively spirit showgirl whose love for Brisson is denied; usually ridiculous Toby Wing, which at least here is the center of a laugh-making joke of running. When the plot complications come out of hand, there is always an interesting interpreter or a musical number of fun and thunder to distract the attention of the viewer. The most famous success of the film is the "Marahuana," led by Michaels, but apart from its controversial history, it is indeed one of the smallest music offerings. All of the pieces here are organized as if they could really fit in a standard pro-theater theater space, unlike the Busby Berkeley cinematic configuration.
