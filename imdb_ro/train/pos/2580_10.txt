say the domino principle is an enormously underrated movie. anyone who has spent time investigating the contemporary history of conspiracies: jfk, rfk, mlk, g.wallace, and in fact many others can not conclude that the dominant domino author knows exactly what he was talking about. Tucker might be Harvey Oswald or james earl ray or sirhan sirhan or arthur bremer maybe john hinkley or timothy mcveigh.to mention some conspiracy scenario involving spies, big business and political assassinations is not really a fiction but a threatening part of our complicated existential history. Help us, but the domino principle is more than fantastic. If this causes a small loss of sleep, perhaps it should not speak to me, investigate for yourself.
