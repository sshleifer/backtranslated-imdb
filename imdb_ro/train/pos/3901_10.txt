This video has been shaken! Eddie is one of the funniest comics I've ever seen. It not only has class, but also some of the funniest observations about history and culture that I have ever seen. Eddie is the most original and smartest comic I've ever seen in a very long time. Tell all the other stand-ups to get off the stage and leave this "executive" reign!
