Outside the blocks let me just say that I am a huge zombie fan, so do not make statements as above slightly. Second, let me say this is an Italian zombie movie, and Fulci directed only 15 minutes before giving it to Bruno (Rats, Night of Terror), Mattei. This is no Dawn of the Dead people. That said this is easily one of the most fun zombie movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The scenario is awfully horrible. Just check out the two scientists trying to find an antidote ("Let's try putting these two molecules together"). <br /> <br /> Zombies come in all varieties. From hell to heirs, to manicure models, to birds! <br /> <br /> Gore is abundant. The legs are bitten, the arms are amputated, the stomachs open. <br /> <br /> The rhythm is fast, flies from one zombie attack to another. <br /> <br /> Then the head is in the refrigerator. Head in the refrigerator! One of the greatest moments of horror since Ash got your hand possessed in Evil Dead 2. You should already know if you are the type of person who will want this type of movie. Get some colleagues and a beer and you'll be having a fun night. Did I mention my head in the refrigerator?!?!?
