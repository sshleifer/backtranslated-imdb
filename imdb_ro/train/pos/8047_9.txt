This movie happened to me accidentally and I enjoyed it very much. Timothy Busfield's character has no ransom qualities, and at some point Busfield and Meloni kill the women as they pass through ... Melon's parade is different from Busfield's. Janel Maloney is terrible ... He looks very much like Tea Leone, but the major difference here is that Janel CAN ACT. Some very beautiful things in this movie and it deserves your attention when it's on the cable.
