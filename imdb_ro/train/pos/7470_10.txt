I went to see Vanilla Sky with a huge, huge, huge ... Tom Cruise's fan, my extremely cynical brother and my girlfriend ... what can I say ... I was completely amazed by the movie and especially the performance of TC, I thought it was a very moving film and it was not what I expected. I read the reviews and decided not to see it, I am so pleased that I was "forced" to see it. The odd thing is that I can not say why, all I can say is that I realized it totally involved and could not think about it the next day. Regarding what I felt about the movie, all I can say is that it's not STORYLINE (fantasy, psychodrama, anything) about the people and the events shaping their lives, and the little events like entering a car can change everything ...... In what critics wrote, perhaps the original was a second amazing film for Alejandro Amen√°bar, but this was a completely different interpretation of the subject and, in any case, a narcissistic remake in favor of Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz. I can not even think of writing two trite sentences, glib to describe the movie, go and see! <br /> <br /> Yes, I know it's not a balanced review, but that's something. It's not kind of a movie.
