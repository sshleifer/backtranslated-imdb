Pinjar is one of the few movies that really leave a mark and makes you think hard. Set in Partition India, this film presents the true reality of the India partition. Urmila gets full notes for her beautiful and profoundly emotional portrayal of a woman suffering with no one to go. Her freedom, her personal identity, and her family's respect have been taken over a land dispute overnight. Manoj Bajpai is simply brilliant as her abusive kidnapper. There are some moments in the movie in which someone is brought to tears. The point film is deeply traumatic. Some of the partition scenes are cooling the spine, yet Urmila's resilience and survival are remarkable. From a woman robbed of her freedom to the woman who gave freedom to women in similar situations. An outstanding movie that should be given credit for smart characters and stories.
