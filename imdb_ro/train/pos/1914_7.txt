Eight simple rules started out as a very fun series. I love John Ritter and his character, Paul Hennessey, and the relationship he had with his children was the best part of the show. I always preferred Kerry to Bridget, Bridget was made before, Kerry is quite unique and I can relate to her in many ways, although I'm not sure I like the direction her character entered the subsequent series. The early episodes were fun, the simple teenage plots of Paul's discipline and How many children, however they think the show lost his spark when John Ritter died. We admired the cast and crew because we wanted to continue the series, but when it died, I felt the program did. For me, the whole idea of ​​the show was based on the guide to the eight simple rules of my teenage daughter meeting, written by a true man with teenage daughters, and the relevance and angle of the show changed without Hennessey's father. Bridget seemed to become more annoying, Rory was the same, and Cate always gave the lessons to the life of the chickens, which before seemed more funny when everything was left to Paul. I think grandfather is funny (especially when looking at the Great Escape), but I feel that C.J is not necessary for the show. He's funny in the parts, but I felt that the story lines at the time of his arrival were very similar to other American comedies. Over all the newest I'm not just bad excitement and not everyone else finds it irritating that Cate works at school and C.J and Granddad are always there? I would always recommend this show to your friends because it was very strong at first and it is worth looking at Paul and Kerry, but later on they were about average at best.
