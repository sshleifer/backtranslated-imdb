I've ever seen this movie once, almost ten years ago. I bought the DVD two days ago and after watching it I think it's even better than I remember being. Paperhouse is far more than horror. It had such an amazing level of excitement and a great characterization that passes through it. I thought Charlotte Burke was really great here. She thinks she did nothing else, because she was an excellent actress. Her emotional representation in the film was perfect, with only the right amount of subtlety to convey the message, especially at the end when she realized that although Marc had died she knew she would be fine. <br /> <br /> Some scenes made me jump (which is a rarity for me in modern horror movies), especially the scene in the bathtub, the scene where Anna's father watched with strange radio in the background and with their feet on their feet they parted and collapsed into dust. Overall, an excellent and very moving movie.
