I just watched the movie, I was afraid I'd disappoint myself. I was quite surprised at the end. The American franchise plate is still in my favorite franchise movies of all time. yes it will not be true if I say that I enjoyed it as a mush that I liked the original ones. beta house along with the last two plates definitely lost something that the first two had.it pies will not become a classic as the first two already done. but what the hell - it's still funny, with many good moments and I think it should be the first movie to choose if you want to have fun and relax after a hard day at work or at school. beta house is worth 6/10, but I gave it 7/10 just to be another slice of PIE.
