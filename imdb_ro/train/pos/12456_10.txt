This movie is definitely one of my favorite films. Interaction between respectable characters and powerful moral characters is an ode to the cavalry and the honor code of the robbers and the policeman. It deals with themes such as duty, guilt, word, manipulation and trust, as did the few movies and, unfortunately, none that I can remember from the death of the "police" in the late seventies. The sequence is delicious, to the essentials, without living anything, and which causes the spectator to behave in a correct and wrong masterpiece without an accessory that attracts spectacular eyes and scenes often required in smaller copies of the genre, to keep the audience awake. There are no such scenes or are not required. The argument is sandy to the spectator; An important asset in a genre that often makes suspense through the deception of the public. No, do not miss Marble ... A note of congratulations on music is in order A movie to watch and enjoy every minute, not just to see.
