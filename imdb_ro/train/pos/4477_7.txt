This has a lot to do - Sinatra, Styne, Cahn, Pamela Britten - and a smaller amount of slag - Iturbi, Grayson - plus a little bit of noise - Kelly. This was Sinatra's first real movie, where the producer spent a dollar and saw it on screen (previously he appeared in two low-budgets, Higher and Higher and Step Lively), but if it were based only on the Sinatra pipelines and deep alongside Grayson and the Iturbi piano landscapes he would have left behind, would have stayed with a much closer film and a better scene for Sinatra. As he does it hard in all his songs from the two duets with Kelly - We like to go, I begged her - to her own solos, What makes the sunset, The charm of you and me falls too lightly . Despite this step, Lively remains the best Sinatra music in the forties on one tenth of the budget.
