Tom had a longing to make the movie for a long time and did it. it's like watching a dirty and worn-out notebook filled with very little ideas that he has filled and wearing for about 10 years. without the transformation of character tuning, no Hollywood ingredients just life and a bit of magic. balancing, in speed, in comedy versus drama is perfectly weighed. this film takes you on a journey that ended before you realize how beautiful it was. the music is wonderful and your eyes will be just as satisfying. the fact that this movie has nothing, just a sequence of sketches of people that are mainly linked to a party of one of the characters, makes it very pleasant and surprisingly fun, it is brilliant because it is empty. between the lines that happen. to see or not to see, is that it?
