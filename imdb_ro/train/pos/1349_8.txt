RKO had a reputation for making pieces of American kitchen from home. Anne Shirley (as Dawn O'Day) had been in movies since she was a young child. Until 1933, she was in the language - playing Ann Dvorak as a child in "Three on a Match" (1932) and a "flower" in both "This Side of Heaven" and "The Key" in 1934. George Nicholls Jnr remembered Anne's work from an earlier film and that's why she got this part. She also adopted Anne Shirley as a stage name. The memorable stories are there - Mrs. Shallot in an unclear boat, the stolen brooch, the "red hair" incident. Anne was so focused on the role of orphan orphan. She suffered with her heart in her intensity, with the desire to please her and with her bold temper. HE Heggie was great, because Matthew Cuthbert and Helen Westley's understanding was good for Marilla. Tom Brown was an excellent Gilbert Blythe. Gertrude Messinger, who was also in the movies as a young child, was good as Diana Barry. Sara Haden showed she could play someone other than Aunt Millie in the Andy Hardy series, was Mrs. Barry.
