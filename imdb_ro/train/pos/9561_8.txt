"Ranma Â½" is my favorite anime by Rumiko Takahashi. The woman really knows how to entertain us with a good story that is not just a comedy but also an action anime. The main character of the story is Ranma Saotome, a teenage boy who is also an expert in martial arts Ranma is employed at Akane because of an arrangement of both fathers who are wonderful friends and trained together in many years. Tendo's sister: Kasumi is the oldest and is very sweet and Nabiki is the middle and loves to earn money no matter what. Ranma and Akane fight all the time, especially because they both have a bad temper and when they discover that Ranma becomes a girl when it is scattered with cold water, and her father becomes a panda, many characters and situations are starting to happen. He also discovers the reason for the transformation: while fighting, Ranma and his father fell into a cursed river, but not only they were fated ... ... If you looked at "Ranma 1/2" and you I would recommend "Inuyasha" and "Maison Ikkoku," two other good creations from Rumiko's hands.
