About thirty years ago, author Numa Sadoul published a Belgian comic book interview Georges Remi (better known as Herge, the creator of Tintin). This film attracts Sadoul today, while recalling the interview while listening to the tapes (Herge died in 1983) and you see some old photographs and pictures of man himself. Some parts of the interview were not published in the book at the request of Herge, and now we know that they are dealing with his separation from his wife after having had an affair with one of his collaborators (who, after years, would become the second wife). One interesting thing that the film does not solve is the change of the Tintin books from the early and imperialist books (Tintin in the Congo, Tintin in the Soviets) to the rather anti-imperialist books just a few years later (The Blue Lotus). On the whole, I came out of this movie knowing more about Herge and seeing it as a bit more disagreeable than when I came to the theater.
