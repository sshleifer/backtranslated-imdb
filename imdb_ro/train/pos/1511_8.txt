Nonsense Inspector Hollaway (a solid turn of John Bennett) investigates the disappearance of a famous theater and discovers the history of the evil past of a ghastly old house. The first and most trivial story, "The Method for Crime" - the successful author Charles Hillyer (nicely played by Denholm Elliott) is haunted by the images of the killer devil he writes about him in his latest book. Although this special outing is too obvious and predictable to be something special, it is still being built into a genuine attempt of an authentic surprise. The second film, Ceara, the lonely Philip Grayson (Peter Cushing) and his equal friend, Neville Rogers (the splendid Joss Ackland) become infatuated with the stunning wax statue of a beautiful but lethal killer. The third and most chilling guilt, Sweets to the Sweet - John Reid (a typical Christopher Lee in a rare semi-sympathetic role) employs Ann Norton (Nyree Dawn Porter) to take care of his seemingly sweet little girl harmless Jane (a remarkably scary and unpleasant performance by adorable Chloe Franks). This frightening episode is considered to be an exciting stimulus due to the exceptional act of talented children actress, Franks, who projects a really disturbing feeling of serene evil hiding under a deceptively sweet and innocent angelic ant. The fourth and funniest thread, "The Manta," the horror film star, Paul Henderson (who was inspired by Jon Pertwee's jungle), buys a mysterious cloak that makes him turn into a vampire every time a gate. This article makes silly fun and still benefits from the extraordinary presence of bored Ingrid Pitt caregiver as the envious Carla vampire. Director Peter Duffell, who works from a horrific and horrific scenario of horror writer Robert Bloch, keeps a charming rhythm and makes a task soho to create the right atmosphere. Kudos is also in order for Ray Parslow's crisp cinematic and shake score of Michael Dress. Highly recommended for fans of the omnibus tariff.
