This movie literally has every cliche for each action movie and all works to its advantage. The Right From Lethal Weapon Gary Busey wisecracks, shoots and giggles through this movie with such reckless abandon can not help but amuse and entertain. There are tanks, helicopters, machine guns, grenades and ice cream vans, and if there are not enough reasons to watch this movie, then how about the best ... Danny Trejo. And if you do not know who Danny Trejo is, then you probably do not like this movie.
