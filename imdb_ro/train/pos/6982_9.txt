Looks good. The basic background is that mankind is at a crossroads. There are a number of moral dilemmas they face. Mankind has made a number of technological breakthroughs, but is humanity mature enough to handle its new toys? There is moral decadence in a virtual world. There are religious fanatics who are willing to kill to attract attention. I predict (based on the BSG background) that there will be a problem with the Cylons and slavery. In addition, there are all the other issues that we have brought to our people. This show is not BSG - at least not to the extent that mankind has been fleeing from a ruthless problem that has ultimately been to make their own. There's not a lot of special shoot-em-up or space-like effects - at least not in the first episodes we've seen so far. What they have to do are very good stories, characters and themes. It also has good performances from actors. They can create a culture similar to that of modern society, but at the same time alien to be completely credible. As BSG, this show is about humanity - strengths, weaknesses, potential and defects. It may seem a little strange that a human society in another set of worlds has ties, ancient cars and chickens. But those things are all the more to create a semi-familiar background than anything else. Anyone stuck on these details is really missing. Whether you are from a mafia-style culture or a rich and rich culture, humans and human nature are not so different 150,000 years ago in a high technology past than what we see today in the world. I wonder if the writers are trying to tell us something.
