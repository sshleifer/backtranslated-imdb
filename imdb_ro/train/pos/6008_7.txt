When I first saw the film in the early 1970s, I was amazed at this film. From a visual point of view it was amazing, and the campus events in Europe and the US made you refer to what Antonioni was trying to say so well in the last 15 minutes of the film: throwing "tyrannical" institutions into mind, and the big business interests. The repeated explosion of the beautiful house in the middle of a desert, the main female character who enjoys a natural stream of cold water, paints a plane in psychedelic models (even a few years ago British Airways). images that have been copied by advertisers around the world for decades. Even Pink Floyd raised his fans after the movie was released. You see this movie about 30 years later and start wondering why the same movie has lost its appeal. Anti-establishment films today have more substance - facts, documentation, fine performances and excellent scenarios. Antonioni seems to be overcome; a wrong genius. Even watching Antonioni's "Blow Up" today gives you the similar feeling that he is a passe. "Zabriski Point" must be assessed for what it was when it was released. It was a great movie if you saw it on a Panavision wide screen, unlike the screens of scary TVs. The greatness of the visual and physiological film (Mick Jagger, Kieth Richards, Pink Floyd, and others) remains. The pair of lead were not big actors, but they were nice and natural. One of them (Mark Frechette) died in prison in the US, expanding the reality of the nonconformist values ​​he personified in the film. Antonioni today seems not to be "synchronized". But watch carefully and appreciate the mutating sounds of ordinary actors - Rod Taylor, G.D. Spradling, the ladies at the pool, the airbags. True sounds, in contrast, are from nonconformists. Antonioni was relevant 30 years ago, but his understanding of the environment can not be questioned today either. He knew what he was doing.
