I saw the description of the film on TCM and I let it go because I like both Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, so I was surprised that I liked the film and it seemed absolutely exceptional. Of course, it's seriously dated, but it's worthwhile looking like subtle humor in the perspective of life and lifestyle almost forty years ago. The only problem is trying to find it on DVD so I can follow it more often. I was also quite taken with Smith and Ustinov's performances as directors as well as by Karl Malden, Bob Newhart and the cameo appearances by Robert Morley and Cesar Romero.
