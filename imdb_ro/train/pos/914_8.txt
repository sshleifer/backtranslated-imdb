Vivah is by no means classic. However, in hardcore action days, special effects of breaking and complex plots (none of which Bollywood has yet failed), rather refreshing to see a film as simple as Vivah. The story, as we all know, is a journey from the first couple's meeting to their wedding after a few moments and moments of testing. Nothing more, nothing less. Music is not even in the same league as MPK or HAHK, but it does not even bother you. Two songs have been remarkable for me - Mujhe Haq Hai & Do Anjaane. While Milan abhi aadha & Hamaari shaadi were humiliating. Shahid honestly meets and has a lot of potential. Good to see him playing something other than the "sweet guy" he normally does. Amrita is very sweet and she plays the role of a dowdy little town girl to perfection. Alok Nath, Anupam Kher & Seema Biswas are extraordinary supporters, and other distributors have a reasonable job. Suraj's direction is simple but effective. The failure of the film is the slow pace that could be the patience of many young spectators. But in all, a good, honest and decent film.
