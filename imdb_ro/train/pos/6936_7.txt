Winchester 73 obtains credit from many critics for having returned back after the Second World War. Director Anthony Mann needs to get a lot of confidence for his excellent direction. Jimmy Stewart does a great job, but I think Stephen McNalley and John McIntire steal the film by portraying two bad guys involved in a high stakes poker game with Winchester 73. This is a good script with several stories which are happening at the same time. Look for the first appearance of Rock Hudson as Young Tull. We thank God that in a few years we will start to let the Indians play in Western films. The film is black and white and was shot in Tucson Arizona. I would not put Winchester 73 in the Stagecoach, High Noon or Shane category, but it becomes a recommendation above me. <br /> <br />
