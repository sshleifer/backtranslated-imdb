I can not agree more with the comments of Nomad 7 and I A HVR. A perfect movie Sunday morning. Humor is subtle (just the opposite of "slapstick," as a bad commentator has noted). But what always stops me from astonishing me is how often I feel I always want to come back to this film. I originally copied this movie on VHS about 12 years ago when it was featured on one of these weekend free previews (HBO can?). I've never heard of her. I do not know why it was not sold so well. ?? When the DVDs were released in the mass, it was one of the first movies I've replaced. A great combination of expression and writing. Besides, the back drops of the mountain wilderness do not hurt things (beautiful). Probably not the type of comedy for everyone, but what is it? If Adam Sandler, you're out of the alley, you probably will not be a cup of tea. This film needs all the attention. Humor is mostly in dialogue. I think my next view will probably be about the 12th. But I still know that when it comes to scenes like the one in which the police car bonnet begins to blush, I will lose it (Ed O'Neill's face is PRICE!). Recommended 110%.
