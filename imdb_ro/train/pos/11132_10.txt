Jon Voight plays a man named Joe. Joe is shaken by a haunting childhood. He has a strong fear and hatred of religion because of his traumatic baptism. He gives up his job as a dishwasher and goes to become a wizard of rich people. He meets an evil called Ratso (Dustin Hoffman) and the two for a relationship. They go out and work together to help each other. They become thieves. The two grow remarkably close, and soon they can not live one another. However, it is very important that Ratso not tell Joe and could destroy any hope of surviving the city together. This is one of the greatest movies ever made. It is a heartbreaking and heartbreaking portrait of too lonely people who have nothing to lose but each other. Their story is devastating, but it is ultimately important for people to see. It's one of those movies where the characters are almost the same as the seemingly crazy people you find sometimes on the street. The difference is that this film is from their perspective. Their lives are shown to us and it is devastating to see that the pedestrians in this film treat them as dirty, especially if we were one of those people. However, the film does not try to make you guilty. Instead, it shows you the rough part of the lifestyle of agitation. It's not a pleasant and easy lifestyle, as many Hollywood movies portray, such as LEMN MONEY and PRETTY WOMAN. The lifestyle of a rugby man is a dirty, rocky and ugly life, and it is sad that people have degraded as Joe's character in this movie. What frightened me most about this movie was that it came out in 1969 and was the perfect test of time. Today's audiences will still find a great deal in this movie and will love and appreciate it as much as critics and audiences everywhere in 1969. The film was rated X, but what I can see about this movie is that sexuality is portrayed in a much more honest, realistic and efficient way. Anyone who has sex before, will know how humorous, weird and frightening can be, and this film does not move away from any of these things. Sex in this movie may not be as graphic as it was thought to be. The films that have been rated X, such as MIDNIGHT COWBOY, ORANGE CLOCKWORK, GREETINGS, THE LAST TANGO AT PARIT and FRITZ THE CAT, seem very impressive compared to the shocking things people can escape today. The sex scenes from MIDNIGHT COWBOY will look pretty strong, but they're certainly not sexy. They are not graphical, but they are realistic, and that should keep people in mind when they see this movie. The language used in the film, especially the word "beech", is used effectively and is not free. Violence is very shocking to look even today, but again it is necessary for the story to describe the world of a hustler. I am very happy to see that Midnight Cowboy is not dated and still as affected as in 1969, if not more. I can not recommend this classical enough and I hope it will continue to find an audience because it really is a very special and unforgettable experience that will not be forgotten soon. <br /> <br /> <br /> -Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are bitter and amazing to watch. They have not played such roles before or since then and are completely different from the usual roles. You will forget who plays them in minutes! <br /> <br /> - Beautiful score <br /> <br /> -Not, not at all dated or campy as many movies of that decade arrive as today <br /> <br /> -Fantastic and fast editing <br /> <br /> <br /> Cons: <br /> <br /> -for mature audiences only <br /> <br /> - The opening scenes are well-done, but they could be just a bit stronger.
