I really miss the production of beautiful old-fashioned movies. If Ismail Merchant and James Ivory were commissioned to produce such a film, it could have been about it, except for the lack of an international distribution of drawers. This is one of those movies you watch alone on a dark evening with a pizza and some popcorn, and you do not even bother to make dishes until morning because you just want to hide under cover. Bravo of director Herbert Wise, Susan Hill writers and Nigel Kneale, top design by Jon Bunker, Art Direction by John Ralph and an excellent distribution to make me tremble and feel so isolated, even if I live in a life- one of the most populated cities in the world at the beginning of the 21st century. I gave her a "9" of "10" because, along with the production and budget constraints of television, they really did a great show.
