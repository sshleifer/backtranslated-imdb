Steve Carell plays the role of a person you can relate to Dan in real life, a movie I did not like, but he liked it. Not that the movie laughs funny but it has a big heart. We all like Steve Carell, this is not what the fans of the Office would expect to see from him, but you know what, I liked this movie. Carell plays Dan Burns, a widow's father who does not like daughters too. A weekend, he and his daughters travel down to see their family. As she goes there she goes to a bookstore and falls for a woman. When he returns home, he discovers that his brother Mitch (played by Dane Cook) meets this woman (played by Juliette Binoche). Dan in real life, sometimes I found a little unbelievable. The Burns family is really the kind of people doing exercises together and playing together table games and doing a bunch of other family things? I very much doubt that. I do not know a family like that. Does he stop me from giving him a big finger? Not. <br /> <br /> Dan in real life: *** / ****
