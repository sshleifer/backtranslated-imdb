I really enjoyed this movie. I thought the film script was realistic and relevant for any period in American history. There is always that woman who does what she needs to do to climb the classroom. I feel that Lilly's character was portrayed correctly and could not be done better. What I liked most was when she realized what love was. Throughout the movie, all the men who fell for her were in love with her, they had given it all, and they lost their career for her. Until he'd met Cortland, he did not understand why these men gave up all for happiness. The way her life had ended was far from what she expected to be possible. I would recommend this movie to anyone in a mature audience, so you can understand the content and sub-set the meaning of the movie and the plot.
