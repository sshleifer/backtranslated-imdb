This movie is not a cat and mouse fight as mentioned in the other commentary. It's about a cat that has consumed 8 of the 9 lives and now lives in the fear of losing the last. The cat is offended and scared of death all the time, hence the name of a "framed cat". Some previous lives of Fraidy Cat haunt him as ghosts that come from the different epochs of time and are constantly trying to kill him, but he fears most of the new life that is represented as a cloud in the form of a number 9 and spit light the screws. very old now, but it would still be fun for the kids if you took a copy. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie almost every day as a child: o)
