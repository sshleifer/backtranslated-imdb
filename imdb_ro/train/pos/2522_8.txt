I have to admit that at first I did not expect anything good. I only expected a frightening film that promoted Gackt's and Hyde's image, but I'm glad to say he has a lot more to offer. Yes, the act is not so great, but it does not suck either, the tower is well disciplined and gives them enough power to their characters. The effects are devoid of consistency, but the action scenarios are satisfactory. What really embraced me was the essence of the story, although the fantastic elements combine, and a raw reality is also displayed. The development of characters, their doubts and their feelings really got to me and I think that's the key to this film. It makes you think and transmit all your anger well. She meets any expectations for a good drama. I certainly recommend it to everyone.
