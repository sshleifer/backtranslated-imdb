I just saw a movie release of this movie and I was pleasantly surprised. It's not often that I can see all my favorite actors in a single movie at a time. I really liked my pocket scene and it was good to see Rachael Bilson and Hayden back together. I think their chemistry on the camera is a direct result of their time together with the camera. My favorite scene was far away (so surprising) Bret Ratner's play ... Without giving too much, I'm just saying there's a surprise that lets you hang up ... The old couple was really good together and you really were had the impression that they had spent a life together. <br /> <br /> Both Chris Cooper and Ethan Hawke segments packed a surprise that looks realistic and similar to the experiences we had in the big apple. Along the whole movie is a great place to take a date ... especially if you already like the city itself. I can not wait for the next one in Cities of Love.
