In 1978 a phenomenon began. The release of John Carpenter's "Halloween" made people wait around the block to witness the evil that is Michael Meyers. Critics have loved her, the world has loved her, been imitated, and descended as one of the greatest movies in cinematic history. 15 years after a crime, four female friends) are babysitting (and having it with their friends) on Halloween night. After escaping from a hospital the night before, Michael Myers returns to his hometown to pursue these people. He kills three of them in silence and subtlety. Does not speak. He's going slowly. He hides .... Only one of his friends escapes after being rescued by Doctor Loomis (Michael's follower and doctor) There is a reason why Halloween works so well. Simplicity. We do not know where Michael is, we do not know why he kills and scares us. These are the only reasons we fear. John Carpenter wrote the film and directed. It builds an unbearable tension throughout the story and frightens to such an extent that sometimes we can not forget. And the climax is really surprising. Like horror, this is essential. It's terrible and well acting. It's also mysterious. Michael is a force, not a man. A force that can not be denied. The sequels focus too much on Michael and his "history." This film focuses on the fear of the unknown. Maybe that's why this is a masterpiece.
