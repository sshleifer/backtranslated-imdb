One of the best Three Stooges pants ever. A house full of scary bad guys and "The Goon" make him the best men of Alert Detective Agency. Shemp is top-rated in the famous scene in the dark. Emil Sitka offers excellent support in his role, Mr. Goodrich, targeting a murder plot. Before ending, "LOOP little trust" of Shemp is used to great effect. This gem 16 minutes moving about as fast as any of his shoes Stooge and packed twice on the wall. Highly recommended.
