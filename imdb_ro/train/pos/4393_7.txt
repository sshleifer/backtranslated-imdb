Ang Lee clearly likes to relax in a movie, take action, characters, and sit on hooves as they appear. Covering the accidental end of the American Civil War through the casual actions of a young militia, unformed in mind or man, this is an ideal approach. The film turns out to be about the formation of personalities, maturity and relationships. Lee also portrays the beautiful south-facing panorama as a silent character, resisting the quarrels as a tough parent. James Schamus's script is probably the standard bearer of this film; almost behind it are a series of well-known performances that admire it. Only Jeffrey Wright's name could take this movie for me. It is brilliant here, but in a slow burning role: instead, we are treated to very good performances (if not the revelation) of a vast, adherently recognized ensemble. A noble, optimistic film. One has to watch if you do not realize Cold Mountain harder, sweeter or claiming, for example. 7/10
