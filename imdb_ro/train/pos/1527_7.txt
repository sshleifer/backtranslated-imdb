Savaged when he came out, this movie looks beautiful now and sounds great. An ingenious, genius action feast from Gielgud, Kenneth Haigh, Harry Andrews and especially by Anton Walbrook, and a central interpretation of the beautiful and incredibly young Jean Seberg. Preminger is not jumping around and showing - his slow length encourages you to listen and reflect, and Graham Greene's script condenses Shaw without sacrificing complexity. The song has the appearance of a movie made for television and is certainly tied to the studio, but none of the worse for that. Too many contemporary films on "historical" themes can not resist blows. What would Mel Gibson do from Maid? Many shots to greet her, probably on the shelf, then roll on the BBQ as the flames start. The premier does nothing of all this. Burning is mainly caused by a guilty reaction. There are some poor performances, but not enough to cause serious damage. I caught this movie on TV and did not expect to watch him, but I was caught. In our age of religious fundamentalism and sacrifice, Joan's story has an unexpected resonance.
