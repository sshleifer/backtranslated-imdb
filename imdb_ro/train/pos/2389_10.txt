I work with children from 0? 6 years and all love Doodlebopii. Doodlebopies are energetic, vibrant and appealing. Once they started singing, "We are Doodlebops We are Doodlebops We are Doodlebops Oh yeah Come to join the fun because we laugh and sing all day" It's almost impossible not to join Doodlebops bring to the viewer's attention a world of color and fun Every show is an adventure, Doodlebopies do not try to change the world with predictive messages all I do is have fun while sorting out the challenges of everyday life the little kid can refer to Doodlebops is a refreshing, high-performance alternative to programs regular television for children.
