Time is the future and for many who are not aware of it, that day is now. In this final film for legendary actor, Edward G. Robinson, "Solent Green" becomes a classic landmark. Many filmmakers and ecologists believe this is our last history. The film is taken from the novel titled "Take Place, Make Place", but which title is changed to "Solent Green". The story relates to the Earth, as it evolves in the future, the environmental problems of the world becoming totally different from the Catastrophic. The natural resources of the planet have been exhausted, and basic foods have been reduced to simple staples. They come in a variety of colors, such as Solent Yellow, Solent Red and now "Solent Green". However, there are those who know the "true" ingredient in Solent Green and frown at their own guilt and fear divine revenge. The first is a food director named William R. Simonson (Joseph Cotton). Upon his death, a dedicated police detective, named Robert Thorn (Charleston Heston), seeks the truth behind his apparent suicide. Though corruption goes to the top, it begins with Simonsons bodyguard, Tad Fielding (Chuck Connors) and Donnovan security chief (Roy Jenson), who target Thorn for a waste facility. Thorn's boss, Lt. Hatcher (Brock Peters), believes his suspicions but warns those "Higher and Hot" who want closed, but Thorn will not risk "Job" for an easy way out. What Thorn discovers marks him for death, but, like the movie, he is waiting for a final warning. ****
