Hey guys, I'm actually in this movie! I did not even know it was on this site until I looked a few years ago and I was so surprised! I played Pete, the main character's character. It was an extraordinary experience and I loved every minute of it. While the movies needed me to be in two places simultaneously, so I used my twin sister as a double body! The finger that pushes the radio button in the car is not hers. I'm still acting and doing some TV, but not so much. Oh, and if you want proof, my name is the first one at the top of the review. Review: I thought the movie was fine, but if I was not in it, it would not be one of my favorites. I thought the acting was very good, but the story was just like that.
