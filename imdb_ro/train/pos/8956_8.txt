I watched this movie after I watched Practical Magic, and the older movie was far superior. I liked how enlightenment, makeup and costumes changed as Gillian changed into a story. Jimmy Stewart's manners did not do much for me in this movie, but I assume they served to highlight Gillian's character reserve. I was also hit by the manners of Nicky and Gillian - it was as if the director wanted him to look effeminate and Gillian to look masculine. Nicky's gestures, when he showed Redlich, my powers hit me especially. I never thought the warlocks were effeminate, so it was an interesting way to contrast those characters.
