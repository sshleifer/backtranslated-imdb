I watched this movie in joy. This is probably one of the best movies of all time. It has a timeless value, you can get so much of it is amazing. There are parts that move, are fun and even wonderful. All aspects are spot, portrayal of the story is perfect, every detail is authentic 100%, even small Irish subtleties have been covered. <br /> <br /> The use of small and tall photographs gives two wonderful views of Cristy (attention to that). Daniel Day-Lewis's performance is incredible. I've never seen an actor doing this ever. It's really amazing. And it's so great to look, to run so well, it's probably the closest thing you can get to the real-life experience. I like. If you have not seen it, you should see it. You have no doubt, there is something for everyone.
