Man, some of you have to cool down. This film was artistic genius. Instead of looking for reason or message to justify it in your reality, why do not you understand it to be a fictional work? A story. Entertainment for God's sake (not intended for the game). It seems to me that too many of the people here are trying to be critics of the film - and they do not do well. I'm so impressed by Bill Paxton's film and work in the direction that I will contact him personally to tell him. You know, if you do not try to analyze the chance to make a story, you can enjoy the movie. I and all my friends did!
