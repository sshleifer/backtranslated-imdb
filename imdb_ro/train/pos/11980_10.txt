Full House was and still is a great show. It is a good show for people of all ages and is also a good family show. There are not such shows. Children are very cute and even if they are a little brown, it is still good, especially for anyone who watched her when they were children. I'd love to see the interviewed interview now. Anyone who wants to see distribution interviews, such as a subject with special DVD features, should go to the Petition site and sign a petition called Full House Reunion on DVD, petition for this, in the hope that the distribution would like to do it. Yay for Full House!
