This is the best movie I've ever seen. I saw the film on Dutch television sometime in 1988 (?). That month, a Yugoslav film was presented every Saturday night. Next week was another great movie (involving a train, rather than a bus), the name I do not remember. If you know, please let me know! Anyway, how can I get this movie again? ???? A DVD of this movie, where? Please tell me at vannoord@let.rug.nl <br /> <br /> Next week was another great movie (involving a train, rather than a bus), the name I do not remember .
