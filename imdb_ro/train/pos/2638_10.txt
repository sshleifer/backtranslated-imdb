One of the best movies for all ages. You will never be able to look at LION KING again without thinking about the extra history that this movie adds. Nearly 40 years, I watched this with my wife and two sons after work tonight and I did not laugh and I liked a movie so long over a long time. Take time and watch this with the kids. It reminds you how Disney was when you were young.
