This is one of Dev Anand's films, which offered great movies to the Hindi film industry, such as the Jewel Thief and the guide. The story is short (if you ask what the story is), the plot is simple - a brother searches for the lost sister. The sister joined the hippies who smoke from the pot and sang Hare Rama Hare Krishna. However, the film presents some of the significant events that the world has experienced in hippie culture in the 1970s, their obedience to drugs, freedom, debt relief, family, and the adoption of anything new, such as Eastern religion which was new to whites). They have been handled perfectly. Zeenat gave his best and Dev, as usual, was remarkable. Songs are the most used (unlike being abused for the sake of songs) in this movie. They were not spoiled. A perfect example is "Dekho o deewano ... Ram ka naam badnam na karo". Every word in the song is very philosophical and meaningful. The end is tragic, but it is not the essence of the movie. In general, Devji, who believes in making different films, was successful in showing what he wanted to show here. You have to experience the hippie culture and beautiful Nepal from the 70s.
