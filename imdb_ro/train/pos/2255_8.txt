It's not a bad martial arts movie. The battle scene was good. Michel Qissi did a good job directing his first film without Van Damme. The story worked out the wrong language and too much blood. Screenwriter Jeanette Francesca has a good line with the story that works. It would be great to see something else from her in the same genre. She likes art and has prominent strong women. IT is definitely worth watching. I recommend the film to all lovers of drama and martial arts.
