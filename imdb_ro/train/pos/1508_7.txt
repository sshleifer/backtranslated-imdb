This movie is good for what it is, and modest; I would not have watched twice: I'm a complete Cushing Peter and that's why I watched it. The best advantage of this film is: BREVITY and EFFICIENCY. Compared to other similar movies, DO NOT pull his legs forever because each of the four (plus one) segments lasts under 30 minutes, the last being under 10. Unusual good vibrations. In the first segment, the writer of horror who suffers from the writer's block moves into the old retreat, seeking inspiration. He finds it too much when he begins to imagine a fictional madman. Similar behavior with PREMATURE BURIAL. Good use of twisting the point: is the writer getting mentally ill ... or (as looks end) wife trophy wants her lover to play along with husband's phobias to drive him crazy and secured his estates .. .yet will survive Bimbo the scheme to enjoy the fruit of her ingenious plan? <br /> <br /> In the second segment of two long lost friends gather in the same old, secluded house but I can not seem to help to visit a bizarre horror museum with the wax statue of long love lost from youth who had separated them once. The Gothic Gorgeous Artist Teaches the portrayed woman is a deceased armed criminal ax ... or was she? <br /> <br /> The third segment was less interesting for me. <br /> <br /> The fourth one shows a horror film actor - who thinks he is the best of all - immersed in the depths of low-budget C films. Seeking a costume to give more credibility to the fictional vampire, he gets the real deal. This segment also lacks the strength of the first two. <br /> <br /> Action is correct, with 2 initial segments contributing most of it. Good film, taken with a grain of salt. He's not the best Cushing or Lee ... but he's worth watching.
