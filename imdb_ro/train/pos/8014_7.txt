But if you like muppets I defy you to dislike this. Basically, the same regurgitant plot (this time New York, not LA) has a lot of fun cameo and muppet hi-jinx. A lot of muppets leave the movie quite early because it focuses around Kermy and Miss Piggy. It has happened to me to be very happy. Have fun watching your kids.
