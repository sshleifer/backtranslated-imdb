I read that this has not happened well, that the story is not solid, that Volckman feels it has failed in a way. I disagree. First, it is well executed. Volckman does well not only to try a new technique, but to have an accent that we should think: would immortality reduce the value of life? Big question ... I've seen it hard to build a feeling, and it does not compromise. This has to be applauded. I'm sure it was an exciting exercise to build characters in such a form. I have seen artists reduce a form to the minimum to build the intensity of a moment. We identify this movie with this. In addition, it is much more interesting than Richard Linklater's rotating definition, and Volckman's story has more significance than Linklater's subsequent stories about a scattered life on drugs. Old news. Everyone knows it, but nobody does anything about it. Renaissance has more to offer, something new to think. And there are more stories there with lots of holes in them that do much better. Well done, Volckman. Very nice thing.
