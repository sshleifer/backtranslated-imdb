Many of the users' comments I've seen on IMDB for this movie are not really right. First of all, let me just say that this film should not be taken seriously. It should be a fun but stupid film that does not need to think but to enjoy it. If you watch this movie with the intention of seeing a masterpiece in either film or humor, then you will be very disappointed. However, if you want to watch a capricious movie with some talented actors / actresses and some good capture phrases, then you will enjoy.
