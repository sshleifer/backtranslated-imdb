It's nice to see Suraj Barjatya back to what's best with him. A story woven around a marriage. It feels nice to have a movie in which there is no scene you do not follow with your family. Although the story is simple and does not contain new elements, you still enjoy the film because of the presentation, performance and, in fact, all the treatments. Hats Off to Suraj .. The film is about the fact that commitment leads to love. Representing changes in thinking, behaving once you are engaged is excellent. The director has definitely made a lot of thought and the actors have made it to perfection. Although the movie is slow, do not bother, because you are so much involved in the story you just want to keep looking at the joy of this newly hired couple. Like a typical RajShree, it has many sentimental scenes that are very likely to make the spectator explode in tears (especially ladies). But when you leave the cinema you are very pleased and feel that the ticket deserves :-).
