Jon Voight is brilliant at midnight Cowboy, but Hoffman's performance, although he recalls his last return to Rainman, is a kind of performance that makes me watch movies. As a portrayal of a New York character, only Daniel Day Lewis' portrait of Bill Butcher in Gangs of New York comes to mind as being comparable, and Day does not give him the character the emotional depth Hoffman gives to Ratso. <br /> <br /> It's typical of Hoffman's way of acting that the actor we tend to identify most with Cowboy at Midnight is Voight. I think Hoffman is one of the best 4 or 5 actors in the history of the film, playing around around him in such a way as to bring his performances well above their normal level. <br /> <br /> Buck's Voight is so naive that he will float out of the movie altogether, except that Ratso pulls him down - pulls him down but teaches him, much about how to survive and, more important, how to live. Midnight Cowboy is an escape movie that turns into a movie about your quest. I think, like a rough film, it has a very nice message, that no matter how much a loser (Ratso clearly defines "loser"), if you can find a way to be true to you, you are in possession the secret of life, and you could even share that perspective with someone else. <br /> <br /> I can not help to compare Cowboy from midnight to Klute a few years later, which I think is more like a movie about finding you that turns into a movie about escape.
