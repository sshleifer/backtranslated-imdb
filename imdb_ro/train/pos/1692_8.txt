Like the great Bugs Bunny cartoons, this movie has humor at different levels. I just introduced this to my 10-year-old daughter and my 11-year-old son. They both enjoyed the film - laughing a few times ... and my daughter is not a science fiction fan. The movie has kept me laughing despite the fact that I've seen several times ... adult humor (that is, the humor that adults will simply get because of older life experiences, things that can not be found here ) keeps the movie as enjoyable for adults. For example, from adult humor, Martial voices are based on different characters of movies / actors. The Martian pilot, Blaznee, has the voice and manners of Jack Nicholson; the scientist, the seller of Peter Strangelove. The special effects are surprisingly good for this movie. The lack of the top ten actors actually works in favor of the film, and the actresses / actors play their part well - in fact, I would say that the producers have chosen their actors and skills for the role-playing needs of box office extraction power example is the "Vern" character of Wayne Alexander). I had to write this review ... kids play this for the third time in 4 days over dinner right now. Good for a rainy day or a night of the night at night, the movie has nothing of mine.
