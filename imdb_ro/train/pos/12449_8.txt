Finally, a good movie was released, Modesty Blaise, who not only tells, but tells the story "true". I admit it's a bad movie if you expect an action thriller, but if you stop in your way and eliminate all your expectations. Then you will notice that it is a story that comes very close to the original made by Peter O'Donnell. You have a cover story just to tell how Modesty became the magnificent person she is. It's not a movie to attract new fans but a movie to tell the true story. Some things could have been better, but when you can not forget the terrible movie of '66, then it's a great movie. So you're a fan, then sit down relax and enjoy the true story is there with a cover story just to make Modesty tell her story.
