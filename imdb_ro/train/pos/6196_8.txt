Fay, the sister of the famous Nobel poet, who won the Nobel Prize, Simon Grim, loves Henry Fool. Their son receives an ingenious orgy from an undisclosed expedition, and there is a three-continent pursuit involving a collection of government agents, terrorists, flight attendants and bellhoppers. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey offers a perfect comic performance, including a brilliant physical work. With strong contributions from Jasmin Tabatabai and Saffron Burrows, Fay Grim proves to Billy Wilder's best tradition that nothing is more fun than a beautiful woman in trouble. Another good score by Hartley (and thanks to the credits given to the American Academy in Berlin, where Hartley served as a colleague in the autumn of 2004).
