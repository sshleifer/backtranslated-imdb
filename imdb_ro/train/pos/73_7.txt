This is basically a variant of the wax house, both in the plot and the role of the star of both films, Vincent Price. In both pictures a talented artist plays, who is sent over the edge in madness when his creations are usurped by other, less talented and less scrupulous people. In this film, he plays an illusion designer for stage magicians who aspire to sit in a performance career just to be frustrated when another illusionist, Great Rinaldo (John Emery), honors his contract and gives her the first choice of any illusions he designs. The price is already badly disposed to Rinaldi because his ex-wife is now Rinaldi's paramour. He does his talent as an illusionist and a glowing mimic to avenge Rinaldi and others who have contradicted his plans for recognition as an artist and designer. The price is pretty much the entire show here and gives a well-judged star turn as an unfair man, whose difficulty wins public sympathy. The rest of the cast are competent, if colorless and the weight of the whole venture falls on Price bearing the burden easily. solid B movie melodrama, this is a crime film rather than a horror picture and it is pleasant giving you not expect a masterpiece. The black and white image is low on the gore and is best seen as the melodrama and enjoyed for the presence of the star offering idiosyncratic performance
