This film is a perfect example of a movie that divides people into two groups. Those who make jokes and those who do not do that. Usually people attack what they do not understand. This movie has a comic style and a charm that has been unparalleled since then. It's a great comedy ... and a great story. It's a perfect movie. A perfect movie for someone who wants a good laugh. And if your perspective is too strained, maybe this movie is not for you and you may need to be counseled. It is an injustice that Paramount has kept this film on the shelf since the early 80's without seeing the daylight on DVD. However, they feel an Urban version of "Honeymooners" is a good idea. I find it odd that my two favorite romantic comedies have never been released on DVD. The other is Gene Wilder's "Greatest Lover of the World", which Fox has had since the early 80's. However, "From Justin To Kelly" is in almost every video store in the country. There is no justice in the world. Perhaps those who took the time to do this will enjoy "From Justin To Kelly", I'm sure one is wet enough for them to "get". Sometimes, with age, people lose their sense of humor ... Or sometimes they only get in shape and find comical satisfaction in resuming the "Complete House."
