An unusually legal actor, played by a cast and filmed by a director who obviously took the material seriously. Imperfect, as expected from a movie shot clearly on a tight budget, but the playwright implies ... is one of those movies that when repeating ad-museum on Cinemax 2 or More Max or whatever I call it , watch blocks for 40 minutes when you have to go to work. Along with W / Deathstalker 2, Chopping Mall and The Assault, a reminder that Wynorski is a much more talented director than many of his low-budget colleagues who have a real ability to make a genre when he's interested in the material (that is, do not look at any of Shannon Tweed's films with 3 or 4 after the title!) Actors who had little to do (Mancuso, Ford, even Gary Sandy for chrissakes) - a very important role in the years - as for Grieco, he has the right look though his role is a bit unique - it is clear that his character is supposed to self-destroy the film, but Grieco does not express it quite a lot. I checked the IMDB and saw that the writer also wrote "Sorority House Massacre 2" and "Island Dinosaur" for director - both minors in their own rights, but obviously "stupid" like Roger Cormon Cinema - some of the best Jonathan Demme and Jonathan Kaplan B-images of the '70s - giving you the element of exploitation, but at the same time offering drama, a real step forward. Not "Citizen Kane," and the final comedy moments are a bit destructive, but a well-written, action-oriented, high-quality, direct-to-media action. Such small achievements should not be overlooked when they come, which is quite rare (as I was reminded when I tried to stay through a monstrosity Albert Pyun called "Heatseeker" last night - things with a low budget I'm not as easy as it looks - but that's another story!)
