William H. Macy is the most sympathetic and convincing here as a loving and loving father who wants to get out of his family business without eating his arrogant parents. Going largely to the same territory as the Sopranos TV in terms of the crisis in the middle of a criminal's life (here he also visits a psychiatrist), but it is worthwhile to follow thanks to a certain direction from Brommel (I look forward to what this guy is still heading), an excellent scenario, and around great performances. Macy is great as always. This is probably the best part of "Fargo". Donald Sutherland is his most frightening father. Tracy Ullman gives a surprisingly riveting tower like Macy's wife. Young David Dorfman is excellent as Macy's luminous and sensitive son (many of his lines sound ad-libbed and are wonderful). Even Neve Campell (which I usually find troublesome) is convincing as a disturbing woman who captures Macy's eye. All of this is punctuated by a moving score and a clear rhythm that leads to a predictable but still powerful and a sense and touch after. This movie deserved a much broader release, as I suspect it was related to the audience.
