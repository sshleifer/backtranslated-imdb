An incredibly small English movie for so many reasons. First is Laurence Olivier's rare opinion in a light comedy. While his performance is not the standard he would have established as one of the greatest actors of the twentieth century, he is perfectly credible as the attorney harassed. From a historical point of view, this film is of great interest because of where and when it was shot. Being English, he did not have the big budget of Hollywood movies of the same period, and it's often shown, but more interesting is the fact that this film was filmed just before the war and shows England that will soon disappear. When we look today, we think in terms of modern morality and we forget that this film and the closest part against the American "It Happened a Night" were in their day as risqu√© as "Fatal Instinct" in our time. But after watching and enjoying this film, the first time I can only feel the sadness when I watch it today. With half the movies shot before the 1950's disappeared, saving the remaining films means heavy choices and, unfortunately, movies like this are often transmitted to save the films we all consider important. Color change, lack of contrast and, in general, the low print quality most often seen is unimaginable. This movie, along with "It's Happening One Night," are perfect for glowing with a love under a blanket on a cool evening and looking at the cold, or better yet not a double feature.
