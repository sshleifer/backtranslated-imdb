I liked Longstreet, who followed Raymond Burr's success of the Ironside TV series and was designed to give him the competition. But this show was canceled after a season because it was decided - wrongly - that Longstreet failed to compete with Ironside. especially well done and very memorable. I hope there will be a set of Longstreet speakers. Writers should remember that this idea of ​​the story has only been briefly explored here and that much more could be done to show the play and the interaction of disabilities on television.
