I suppose I always felt that the North Hotel was connected to the studio, the movement of the cars and the camera was too smooth and brilliant to be shot on the spot. But no problem - it's still a wonderful composition underestimated by Marcel Carne. The plan sometimes seems somewhat disturbing, as if they were doing it while they were going, but because it is unpredictable, it draws attention to the bitter end. Images of money when the two lovers are alone in their room are embraced by a rather shy dialogue, but everything is so wonderful to fall into any inanity can be accepted. Are these two young symbols of a pre-war cancer in France before the war or simply idiots? Suicide acts are quite common; if the suicidal people are young and healthy with their lives before them, without thinking of anything else except that they were just stupid fools? Arletty played a good part of the prostitute - she kept that zipper on her busy dress anyway! I've only seen a few Jouvet movies - it's the most impressive invention as a pimp in HDN - my problem is superficial: every time I see his face I'm thinking of Sonnie Hale in Evergreen! a remarkably atmospheric film, well acting and filmed, so much that it takes a few views to get everything in place. Annabella and Aumont made an exceptionally beautiful couple; Francois (Heurtebise) Perier, in his second film, had a little funny part as a gay man. All in all: wonderful.
