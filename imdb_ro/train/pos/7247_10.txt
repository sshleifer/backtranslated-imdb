Robert Jannuci, Luca Venantini, Venantino Venantini, Alicia Moro (are two stars from CITY OF DEAD LIVING) (I wonder what Luke is working on today, probably a lawyer or something like Bela Lugosi Jr. or David Hennessey who wants to forget that there are dark shadows.) Anyway, there is no music on the Thorn EMI on opening credits ... but the music is great once it comes ... with Italian films movies are not as good music ... my favorite scene is with the boy with the robot's arm who follows the lone-Alien through the desert .. Alien says why you follow me Tommy responds because I feel like ... Alien responds in what direction you turn Tommy says that West then Alien says well , I'm heading east, so after a while walking, the theme playing in the background Alien looks up and sees Tommy standing on a rock with a companion hamster ... Tommy looks up and says Alien, what took you so long ... I pl I want this movie ... It touches my heart. The boy with the robot arm needs a father, and Alien is enrolled to be Tommy's father in the desert. . . Yes, they also need water. . . not the ROAD WARRIOR (MAD MAX 2) by any means except a crazy / post-nuke movie with a boy with a robot arm and Alien and Trash and several other good guys with a chicken with an iron claw and CRAZY BULL who looks like Wez in the road warrior. . On Sunday afternoon on Channel 57 (Philadelphia, PA) after the church, I would go home and find this. . . often . . . too often. L love. 10/10
