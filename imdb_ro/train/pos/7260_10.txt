Hello everyone, my name Larissa I am 13 years old when I was 4 years old and I look at curly in court and beat my socks I watched that movie for a long time, actually 30 minutes ago I finished watching . Porter Alisan is a very good actor and I love the movie It's so funny when he has books to do. Every time I watch that movie at the end I cry so it's said I know I'm only 13 years old, but a story so exciting, really strange, that's Alisan 25 years ago. Every time I watch a movie someone is always young and the movie goes out one year after they did it and when u watch and find out how old the person in the movie is really u wounder how can i go from an age to next â†’. Like Harry Potter. This movie was also great, but still Daniel was about 12 years in the first movie and I was about 11. How could he go from 12 to 16 in about 4 years and are only 13. I'm not sure if he is 16 right now i think he is almost 18 but thats a strange kind when u look at a movie and the next one there about 4 years then u when they were only 1 in the last. that I have a great imagination and I like to spoil it.I am a kind of computer person, but I like to do a lot of kids stuff as well. I am very clever like suing the ass in the movie, but one thing I do not like in the movie is when the guy who calls her home care and does curly sue get picked i would kill the guy if he would be she did it in reality. Well, I'm going to stop writing I know she writes a lot sometimes, but the kids have a lot in the head that has to go out and if the kids do not get to learn. <br /> <br /> Larissa
