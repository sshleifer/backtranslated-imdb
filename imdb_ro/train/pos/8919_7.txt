Who would think Andy Griffith's "Helen Crump" (Aneta Corsaut) had a Steve McQueen movie in her past? But this is just one of the many strange and wonderful things about the 1950s teen-ages final-fighting-creatures that could best be described as Rebel Without A Meeting with God He knows what cosmic space. The rebel is Steven McQueen (who will soon decide that "Steve" sounded less prissy), a good enough savage boy to be interesting; the very good and understanding girlfriend is Aneta Corsaut mentioned above. It was pretty bad when their date was interrupted by teenagers, but they are far more unfettered when they encounter a gentle man who eats the man What it means to rain on his own hot meteorod meteorode - and he starts loud urban and left . But the elders will believe them? Of course, not what they know, they are just children! The movie is teeny bopper at teeny bopping best. The actors take the scenario quite demandingly, with a lot of feelings, and the "adult" probably claims he says "Children"! a third sentence or something like that. But the real pleasure of the film is its creature, which is well imagined, well executed and often manages to generate a surprising level of suspense. And, although clearly on the cheap side (see those thumbnail sets, boys!), BLOB is actually a pretty well made movie - and there is the overwhelming little theme song tossed to a good extent. A total of 40 people (included in me) will enjoy the film as a nostalgia, but that will not prevent them from feeding themselves with the younger ones, the sensitivity of the bread and white bread ensemble of the 1950s, and the movie it would be an excellent choice either for the family night or for a more sophisticated "mature wife". Make yourself a bunch of Jello cubes for movie snacks! Gary F. Taylor, known as GFT, Amazon Reviewer
