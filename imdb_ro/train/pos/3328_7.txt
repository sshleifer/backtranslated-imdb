It is rare nowadays to find a romantic comedy that is not incredibly disgusting in short doses throughout the movie (for example, the Greek wedding Big Fat, Me, Myself & Irene). There were only a few unnecessary noises in this movie, nothing profane by the profane. Around all, it was a nice movie with nice characters. I thought the end was a little abrupt. He feels like he should have finished the world series for a final bang to the end. The action left a bit desirable, but it was made by the story of the story. If I knew it was a Farrelly Brothers movie, I would have assumed it would be a stomach that would have transformed the piece of garbage and would not follow it, but it seems that even they are capable of doing a movie in a way accidentally. Good for them, I hope they will head their head for the rest of the road and they will start constantly making good movies.
