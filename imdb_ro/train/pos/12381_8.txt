A young woman, who is a successful model and is also committed to marry, and who tried twice to commit suicide in the past, is chosen by a secret and remote association of Catholic priests as the next "sentinel" at the gate access to Hell, which apparently goes through a Brooklyn apartment building, old but well-maintained. His tenants take the ladder and can recharge, but apparently can not escape, as long as a sentinel is there to block the path. The previous one (John Carradine) is about death, so she, by fate or anything else, becomes next and sentenced to make her commit suicide so that they are free. A lot of interesting details lie beneath the surface, the relationship with her father, the stories of the condemned, her fianc√©, so that they can pass this as a cheap exploitation, but given the sets, the large distribution and general level of bizarre, this is definitely worth seeing.
