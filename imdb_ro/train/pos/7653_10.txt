Closed in the heart is wonderful. It brilliantly illustrates the situation of Gary Gimore, a condemned murder that demanded death. Shot in the heart, he shows that Gilmore's family, hated by hatred, has gone through. This film is an incredible psychological study and is wonderfully depressing and exalting. 10/10
