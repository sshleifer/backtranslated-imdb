An inexpensive inexpensive, showing great ingenuity in using props, sets and effects (fog, illumination, focus) to create an extraordinary and moody texture. The story is removed, the act is simply functional, but it shows how imaginative effects can develop a whole visual narrative. This film is recommended for its mood and texture, not for its story.
