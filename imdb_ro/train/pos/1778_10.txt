I just want to say that I'm so glad that someone finally shed the beans in this movie. Bravo "The Spaz", Bravo! This movie is a ridiculous shooting plot. Especially for a student movie! I just want to give credit to Spazz because he took an absurd amount of time to find such a rare image and then comment on it! Most people who know they do not have this kind of time, especially so few will stop reading them. Kudos for you, sir! However, the film follows a thin story, which is just as unbelievable and simply stupid. I understand the idea behind creating a satiety of Charlie's Angels, but why do I hire such atrocious actresses! Also, what kind of director did he himself, write, produce and also edit the photo! Choose a job and put all the love in it! It's a shame because I heard he did a good movie about a murderous toothbrush. Again, thanks to Spazz for the curtain retraction of this film, people like you are a rare discovery.
