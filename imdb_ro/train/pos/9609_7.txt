It was a pretty good movie, I liked it. I thought it was a rather accurate bulimia and how it was not about diet, but about having such a deep pain that they had to find a way to solve the problem and they chose that. Beth was a very well-crafted character and in the scene she faces with her mother about the eating disorder, you can see the pain inside her and you hear her in her voice and you know how deep the pain she feels. I also think one of the best lines in the movie is where Beth calls out the words: "It's not about you." to her mother. These words were so true and added so much to that scene in the movie. I think the scene was certainly the most important scene in that movie.
