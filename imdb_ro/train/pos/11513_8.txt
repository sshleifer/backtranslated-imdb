One of my favorite shows in the '70s. Just like I remember flying out on Friday (or perhaps Saturday) night on Nine Network (?) Here in Australia. Darren McGavin and Simon Oakland were great together. Each episode usually reached a climax when Kolchack had to engage in a hand to fight a supernatural adversary. For them, the writers have made a concerted effort to escape as much as possible from the usual round of vampires and ghosts. I remember an episode in which the opponent was the spirit of an old Indian boss who "came back" like a massive electric current that began to kill people in a city hospital. The last showdown saw Kolchack attempting to shorten the "beast of power" in the midst of an explosion of sparks and fiery flames. Well .... you had to be there at that time, but it was an interesting idea. McGavin always has a lot of energy and enthusiasm in his roles, and that was one of the best. </ br /> <br /> It certainly deserves a place in the Hall of Fame of the TV. To quote Tony Vincenzo .... "Colchack is IT" ... Or, in the case of Hall of Fame, "IN it"!
