I saw this movie with my dad. Probably I was pretty young, about 15 years old. It was a star tab one afternoon. The film started a bit vague, but you could say that those robbers are gathering for a score. She really got the rhythm after the first half hour. All actors are wonderful, especially Blades and Lou Diamond. I think it's the ensemble, they play very well together. I can see this movie anytime. I think it's the relative stupidity of the plot and the characters trying to handle a very strange score. Banknotes are not horns, but they are subtle and extreme at the same time, making them so hilarious. A perfect comedy for a lazy afternoon.
