dear god where to start. this is not the best movie bar I've ever seen. the room angles are wonderful, but in my opinion the act was the best. why scriptwriters for this film do not write great budget films that I will never understand. the other is the distribution. is awesome. this is the best movie we're hanging out there for sure. I know some of you probably think "it's not much better", but it's not wrong. the raptor island is an artwork. I hope he should have had the best movie of the year, instead of that Crash movie with a bunch of names and kidnappers. I think this movie is really the most wonderful EVER thing.
