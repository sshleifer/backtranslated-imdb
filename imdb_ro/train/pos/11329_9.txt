The combination of the gorgeous black-and-white photo and the "Eugene Onegin with a twist" made it a real knock-out for me. The atmosphere created by the darkest color photographs contrasts with the occasional, very bright, overexposed white. It was a glorious moment where if the slides - apparently conventional snaps snap, but if the faces of the actors revealed the character and the subtle but instant situation - were presented accompanied by Lensky heart-warming aria from opera Tschaikowsky Eugene Onegin. /> For me, the sign of a good film is that it should take advantage of the opportunities offered by this environment, which means that the story is often less important than the image and atmosphere - Last year in Marienbad is a good example of such a movie . Krisana is in the same mold.
