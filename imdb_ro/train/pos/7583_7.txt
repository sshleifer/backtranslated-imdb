The latest chapter in the Hanzo Razor trilogy provides the closure for this series of self-entertainment fun. Inoue replaces Yasuzu Masumura in the director's seat, but the style is almost the same, probably because of Shintaro Katsu serving the manufacturer, apart from the antihero titular. <br /> <br /> Hanzo discovers a female ghost who keeps hidden treasure at the bottom of the lake. Of course, Hanzo being Hanzo, he is not weakened by the fact that he is a phantom, so he continues to rape, interrogate, using the familiar net revolving device. The plot goes through a series of blind monks, who also doubles as loans, corrupt officials, promised spouses, and the necessary hack. Hanzo's superior officer, Onishi and his two servants, provides the typical comedy notes and, in general, is an ordinary business. Significantly less complicated and easier to follow than the first (which is everywhere) and a bit of misery), less elegant, dramatic and bloody than the second (probably the best of the Hanzo series), but at the same time entertaining and deserving of its merits. Complete with trademark training sequences, binding rape, sword fighting and a mystery Hanzo is called to investigate, this will ultimately satisfy fans.
