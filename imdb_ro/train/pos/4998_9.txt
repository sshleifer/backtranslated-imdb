Shannon Lee, Bruce Lee's daughter, offers high-end martial arts action in this fascinating Hong Kong movie and proves that, like her late brother Brandon, she is a real face on the old block. There is high tech stuntwork to die for this fast paced movie and Bond movie makers should take a look if they want to spike up the action next action 007 adventure as there are many innovative things here with some fresh and the original the second unit is working to support the already high-profile content of the movie, "And now you're dead." When watching a movie as fast and fun, start wondering how the cinema was able to survive before the genre of martial arts was created. I really believe that movies in general and action films, in particular, have only marked the time until the first kung fu movies have begun. Bruce Lee was the father of the modern action cinema and his surviving descendants, Shannon, do not leave his family name down here. Although there are some nice shows in this movie (Michel Wong for one) is Shannon Lee that you will remember for a real spectacular performance like Mandy Surviving.Thus, you'd better go out whistling her battles!
