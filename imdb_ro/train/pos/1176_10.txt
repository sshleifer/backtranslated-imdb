First, let me say that I did not like the fact that The Rock won the title so gay. Next, I think Regal should have returned his European title, Jeff Hardy is a scary champion. Rob Van Dam already had the Intercontinental title too long, and Brock would have had to win it. I am pleased that Storm and Christian are the champs tag, the best match being Booker T and Big Show in my opinion.
