After watching the movie last night, I was left with a sense of hope for the organizations that are trying to address the issue the film portrays. The scale of prostitution is so great that it is hard to see how it can be defeated without major government changes in Cambodia. Anyway, with the review. Although it is a sombre film with an inconvenient central relationship, it is a very compelling film and I would go so far as to say it was pleasant. The film was well-edited for running time, and Thuy Nguyen's performance was excellent. I also felt that Ron Livingston played a very difficult role. It would have been nice to have a better understanding of why Patrick feels he has to help Holly, but maybe the reason is simply that he explains the character of Chris Penn. I will not explain it here - watch the movie. This is a good movie that causes thoughts and good intentions. I hope he will have a fairly broad release to reach a decent audience and earn more support for the K-11 Project.
