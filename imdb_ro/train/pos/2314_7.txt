I heard good things about this movie and it was, you guessed, a bit disappointed. Reese Witherspoon is surprisingly good promise, surprisingly confident, from an early age; Indeed, all (small) distributions are quite solid in the simple atmosphere of the 1950s. The reason I did not rate this movie is that the pain of the older sister did not seem so real, and that made me a little out of the movie. Maybe we're supposed to fill the plot, or maybe the movie has to be a bit longer. The character of Maureen is rather underdeveloped. It is understandable that Dani (Reese W., the youngest) would be traumatized and upset, but why is her sister upset? Because he's a few years older? Did not the end of the rest stop? The film's pacing seems to have met Maureen and the Court only when it was dragged (warning: this scene is surprisingly brutal, in retrospect it seems to have attempted to shock a little.) It depends what you want - if you want the happy story of girls on the young love that seems to be going on, you are in a surprise. The man on the moon is so strange and dreamy, as well as an age-old film - a rather strange combination? I liked the character of the Court, however, I see what girls watch this might be watching. And I loved having the courage to let it hurt the younger sister (most of the men would be, most movies did not would be) and be killed 7/10 on my pretty serious scale. For some reason, I found Jason London on a funny tractor.
