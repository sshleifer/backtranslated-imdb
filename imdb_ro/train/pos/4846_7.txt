This is a British classic comedic thriller I always wanted to check, but there was no opportunity for that until now. It is based on a popular stage play that has already been filmed several times beforehand (especially in 1931 by the same director, but unfortunately this version seems to have not survived entirely!); for the revised remake, the plot was updated to the current war situation. Anyway, I was first familiar with early British comedies through Will Hay's films: as he has a similar plot of legendary haunts, smuggling and enemy agents, he is very much in this sense (in fact, it was written by Hay's writing team, Edgar Marriott, Val Guest and Orton JOC); the failed traveler element, then, was a tried and true formula. Steaua this time is Arthur Askey (supported by Richard Murdoch) - none of the movies I've been watching - which is as unlikely as a hero like Hay himself and whose personality turns out to be just as irritating ... to him and Askey certainly comes with a series of funny lines and funny business bits to justify that the main character of the play (and the version of the 1931 film) was split into two here, Murdoch acting as Steaua is a right partner. The only remote setting (movie events take place mostly during a stormy night) offers a wonderful atmosphere; the last half-hour - with the sudden appearance of a mysterious couple (Raymond Huntley and Linden Travers) and, ultimately, the arrival of the title vehicle itself - is particularly tight and well-handled. Also noteworthy from the remaining distribution list is Kathleen Harrison as a frightened scared stelist with a constant companion parrot who is driven by all the enthusiasm to take the first drink.
