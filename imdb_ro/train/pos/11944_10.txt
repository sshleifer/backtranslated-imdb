I wanted to give her 8, but since you made 6.5 of the much better votes, I had to make my contribution. The Styx River was a pure genius. Of course, Woody was his perennial thing, but at least his role was right. The first half hour was very hilarious and the rest of the movie was easy to watch. The dialogue was smart enough, and Woody's tricks at parties, along with the reaction to the upper crust, were fun to look at. This was much better than the newspaper critics have done. And a plus, a Sorcerer disciple, to go with him. And, of course, did you notice that Johansen gets sick? Charles Dance is always fun, as was Hugh Jackman.
