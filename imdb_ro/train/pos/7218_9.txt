Deathtrap plays as a piece in a movie about who did what, because it takes place primarily on a set. The premise is that an accomplished playwright, whose star is falling, receives a magnificent manuscript from a former student, so he plans to untie his protector and match his play with his wife's protests (voice). Or so you think, for the first half of the movie. Halfway down the road, Deathtrap begins to move in surprises and surprises that turn the premise on his head, then around around and then in a mad spin, always keeping the right title. It's an excellent mystery film soaked in spirit. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine, as a senior playwright, plays in this movie - a British Briton, easy and very dramatic. There are no surprises here - he does his usual work. He receives the best line of Deathtrap, which he performs perfectly: "What is your definition of success, being a bang at a state penitentiary?" <br /> <br /> Christopher Reeve, on the other hand, juggles comedy and drama in a surprisingly powerful show playing the ambitious (and psychopathic) young playwright. He also highlights the highly toned body, which he must probably keep from Superman's films. Caine and Reeve have collaborated on another movie that is one of my favorite comedies - Noises Off. It revolves similarly around a piece, though this time Caine is the director and Reeve is an actor. They joined comic veterans Carol Burnett, John Ritter, Marilu Henner (Taxi) and Mark Linn-Baker (Perfect Strangers). Together, they demonstrate the calamities they encounter with the play and the crew of a piece. On the surface, the film seems to be mostly a slapstick, but after seeing you find there are many subtle jokes that require more than a watch to catch. The desire for this undervalued movie to be available on DVD.
