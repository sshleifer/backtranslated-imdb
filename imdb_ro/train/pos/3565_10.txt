Guys and Dolls is a unique character game. Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando) is a top class player who takes a bet with Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) for a thousand dollars. Nathan needs money to play his usual game and make a fortune. The bet was that Sky could not take any girl in Havana, Cuba and the "doll" she chose was Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons), who is in charge of a missionary. Sky finally Sarah bribes enough to go to Havana with him. They fall in love with each other, but later accuse him of something in which he has no part. Nathan fled to the missionary during the night. For four years, Nathan Adelaide's fianc√© (Vivian Blaine) disapproves Nathan's gambling and tries to stop him from doing so. However, when the movie ends, it all ends with a double wedding. <br /> <br /> The songs in this movie are wonderful, no matter who sings them. Marlon has no voice to sing and he really could call it, but it does not really matter. He did a wonderful job (obviously seeing as Brando) and played his character very well. I saw some movies with Jean Simmons and I thought this movie was the weakest, and she could not play at all. However, the singing is made up of Frank Sinatra, Vivien Blaine and Stubby Kaye. Vivien Blaine and Stubby Kaye were also in the original production of boys and dolls on Broadway. Vivien Blaine had a great voice and was perfect Adelaide. If you like music, and if not, I advise you to follow this.
