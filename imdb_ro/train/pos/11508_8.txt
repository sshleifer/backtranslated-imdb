I would like to give Kolchak a higher rating, but the show has quickly gone from scary / suspense to silly. ABC blame. They moved the show on Friday night at 20:00, then known as the "family hour". It should not have been first Friday. I was a high school student and I loved the first episodes! It was the first time against the NBC Women Police. ABC had huge problems with Friday nights. The bad season for them as a whole until Barney Miller, Baretta and SWAT started in January '75. Kolchak should have been a blow. Darren McGavin asked to leave the contract to conclude the show. Too bad that the writing was not up to Richard Matheson in the original TV movie. However, McGavin made Kolchak his own, as actors can do. Jackie Gleason in the role of Ralph Kramden and Caroll O'Connor as Archie Bunker. The same NIS set up with manual and clear teletypes seems strange and ancient today, but that is part of the appeal. They were very fortunate that Simon Oakland suppressed Vincenzo in TV movies.
