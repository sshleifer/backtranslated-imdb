I accidentally felt this movie on TV and I could not leave it ... It's an excellent movie that makes people learn about the history of the Americans with the Vietnam War, the time of the power of the flowers, the fight against racism ... It illustrates the conflict of generation, of political opinion, race that took place in the 60s. I was born in 1980, so I did not know all that stuff before ... In France, US history is not a priority and that the film taught me -this a lot of facts! By the way, I think all the actors are wonderful; especially Jordana Brewster, Josh Hamilton and Jerry O'Connell. Now I can see this movie more than once every day! It's really great ... what a shame it just appeared on TV not in cinemas ... <br /> <br />
