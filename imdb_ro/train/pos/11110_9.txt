I can not add much to the positive reviews already here - great action, balanced writing, multi-faceted characters, a great anti-hero in Tony, a great commentary on millenary American life. The full use of psychiatry along with Tony's mom's problems is particularly fresh and humorous. Some other characters add a lot of depth - Hesh's interesting story, in which an outsider strives, Ralphie's total wickedness, Chris's dual wishes in life, and so on. criticism, however, especially that "it glorifies violence / reduces the abundance of American Italians." Most writers and actors are Italian-American, would they attack themselves? There are several positive Italian characters - Artie Bucco chef, Dr. Melfi and his family and Cusamanos alongside Soprani. Indeed, Dr. Melfi's former husband notes in season 1 that only a small minority of Italian-Americans have ever had links with Mob (certainly lower than the proportion of African-Americans involved in the crime, I dare say that.) In both cases, poverty and lack of opportunity are the biggest causes). Most characters do not really choose the life they have; family or family circumstances largely fall into it. Businessmen (even from Italian stocks) trying to integrate into it normally encounter pain - Matthew and his friend in season 2, for example. If you criticize this show, I suppose Frasier made you want to be a psychiatrist or did Will & Grace make you want to go homosexual? You will probably not listen to rap music that talks about gangs or r'n'b discussing promiscuity or rock music that discusses drugs (or any combination)? People are not as stupid as some of you. <br /> <br /> Not everything is perfect, though. A lot of characters came out once, when, by all logic, they should have been seen or at least mentioned in previous episodes - Tracee the dancer, Meadow Ally's girlfriend, Uncle Junior's girlfriend (20 years old split in season 1).
