I liked the TV show because it was a thing of its own, a girl who was sixteen years of age, finds out she's a witch, and she lives with her nuns in the house and they're a witch. Well, it took about a few weeks of habit. When he used his powers for the first time, he was so amusing because he turned his enemy into a pineapple. He had to turn the time and repeat a day. This series is very cool and it's a series of typical teenage girls but she was thin when she moved from her house and into a college apartment her college friends and then it was boring and I stopped watching.I loved her aunties they were so funny and the other one was really ditzy. I loved Valerie and hated Sabrina's enemy, Libby, she was ugly.
