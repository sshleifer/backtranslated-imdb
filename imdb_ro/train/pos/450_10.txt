I am biased towards any film that paint a lush image of Italy - in my opinion the most romantic country in the world. Unfortunately, the film was quite short, unusual for a vintage piece and a little reduced in cinematic aspect. However, the excellent story does. The four ladies engage in a much-needed relaxing holiday in their minds. Throughout the movie, they realize their problems and start repairing them. They believe that San Salvatore, the castle they live in, has a charming effect on people. "It's a bath of love," says Lottie Wilkins. You can follow their gradual change from discontent to exuberant, because the Italian coastline is working their magic on them. All their problems and solutions are plausible. The actress was wonderful. Background music seemed very appropriate for a romantic romantic place. Overall, a movie for me for 10/10.
