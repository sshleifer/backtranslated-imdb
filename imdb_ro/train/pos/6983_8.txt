I liked it, being a fan of the original series, I always wondered what the story was from behind - I did not like it at all. I also like the fact that, apart from Eric Stoltz, I have not recognized any person - this is refreshing, just like BSG. He introduced me a whole wealth of new talent - I can not wait for the series to start broadcasting. Well done to Ronald D. Moore and the team - excellent job. The special effects, dialogue and acting were all on the scene, and I felt emotionally tied to the story. I know there are purists there, who probably do not agree with my assessment, but I felt that Caprica was far superior to most of Sci-Fi's produced in the last decade.
