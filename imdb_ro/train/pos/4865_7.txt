I could not wait to get my hands on this when I read about Fred Astaire with George Burns & Gracie Allen in a film with P.G. Wodehouse and music from Gershwins. It's definitely worth seeing, but it does not have the cohesive quality of Fred & Ginger films. Perhaps the story would be better to read in a Wodehouse book, where humor is better met. Some of the actresses are really painful to watch (especially the boy and the ladies). But ...! Funhouse dance is worth more than most movies. I never knew that Gracie Allen could dance, but guys do it in this movie. Have you ever tried to stand on one of the discs that are spinning in a funhouse? Imagine Tapdancing on one in high heels! It keeps awesome with Astaire and adds a lot to the overall picture quality. Few beautiful, really fun songs are Beautiful, if you can get a better lip. <br /> <br /> Recommended for Astaire, Burns & Allen fans. I had to go back and see the funhouse dance as soon as the credits rolled.
