What would you expect from a movie titled "Surviving Christmas" and presented as "festive fun", something like Ghandi or an English patient? There are a lot of things that I love about this movie, it's fun, it's very well distributed and it's gorgeous. I came to the film as a fan of Kaplan / Elfort, but it was dubious when I read the plot, it sounded ridiculous. But the movie does not happen because Affleck (as Drew Latham) plays his role perfectly, an adult adult minute, the next mature man who realizes that he has won everything in life, aside from what he really wants. In fact, we see that Latham grows in this film when he meets the problems he envies and realizes that his life is not so good he sees that his own crowd is not that bad. the movie has fewer scenes or duddy than many other comedies I've seen. Comedy is so much more difficult than any other type of drama, whether it works or not, and very few comedy writers correct it every time. I especially loved a theater scene, where the family reads Latham's songs. The pleasure is in the reaction of Tom Valco (James Gandolfini) and the comments of Brian Valco (Josh Zuckerman). It is the dilemma of the greedy Tom Valco, who has to bite his tongue, wear silly hats, or sing to the Christmas tree to win the prize that keeps the film moving in the course of time. of her daughter Alicia (Christina Applegate) in the story brings a delightful romantic angle, and why not in a Christmas movie? Of course she is frightened and contrary; he is rich and beautiful, he is beautiful and alone, so inevitably she and Afflect end up falling down in the snow and meeting face to face. That's great! One thing I would have liked was a greater use of festive music to stimulate the atmosphere, but I can not complain. I got what I wanted.
