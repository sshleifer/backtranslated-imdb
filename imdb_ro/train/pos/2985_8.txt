The whole idea of ​​doing this film, one of the oldest and best international color versions of the cinematographic work, was to make it more accessible to the masses. And he managed to do it admirably. The general public would not be available for a love story about two young lovers exotic ancient Egypt, if they played by the 300 kilograms typical over 40 tenors and sopranos of vocal equipment to play music glorious properly. Therefore substitution of visual princes beautiful (a young Loren, handsome Della Marra and a nice lady Maxwell) that make the story more credible, given to those who are not familiar with the plot or music better chance of being lured into the great arias which otherwise could not be. In total, a delightful introduction to one of Verdi's great works. I remember seeing this when I was in high school, and it sure gave me the interest in the opera, a form I was not well known about then. I still consider this film love and I highly recommend it to those who can appreciate extraordinary music, accompanied by better than average visions. Luciano Della Marra was a standout like Radames, and unfortunately for audiences he did not appear in any other movie.
