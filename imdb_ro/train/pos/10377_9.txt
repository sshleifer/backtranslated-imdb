A movie that I expected very little, and I just wanted to go for a quiet hour - but what time it turned out to be. Roll is an excellent story, if not too serious, about the "stray city in the country", it's funny all the time, the characters are bold and the rhythm is right. Toby Malone is the true star of the movie, with his impressive portrait of Matt, said the country boy and Aussie Rules football actor came to the big city to try one of the big teams. It is brilliantly supported by John Batchelor as a local gangster Tiny. Beware of these two. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
