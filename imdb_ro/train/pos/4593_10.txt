Story Police is one of Jackie Chan's classic films, who helped shape Hong Kong cinema. It's a masterpiece that should not be missed by a movie action fan. From the beginning, it is obvious that Jackie Chan's stunt team risked their lives to make this film. Both action and stunts are extremely realistic and innovative. Even today, no film has surpassed the story of the police in dangerous stunts. Many people have been hospitalized in Story, including Jackie Chan. Fights are not as inconceivable as stunts, but the fights in this movie have helped change and define Jackie Chan's props. Throughout the movie, Chan uses a strange object to stop attackers and constantly throws aggressors through thick glass. The action feels real, because stunts give the film everything to give and Jackie Chan's coordination is remarkable. The rest of the film's aspects are not defective, but will not disappoint any fan action. Chan does not just play a credible risk of taking the cop, but he shows the strong changes that his character goes through falling into escalated despair. The plot is strong, but a modern viewer can sometimes find it tedious. While the comedy will offer a good number of laughs, it does not always distract the audience from lack of action. However, for the period of time it has been done, the driving aspects of the plot are fun. There are a large number of interesting and well-played characters spread throughout the movie. The general story of the police is undoubtedly one of the best action movies ever made. And even in Hollywood, the influences of this film should not be ignored.
