I will start by saying that I am very pleased with this culmination of the Bourne trilogy. Please do not destroy it by doing a sequel of years ago or a prequel. Just leave it alone. That's how talented and versatile as Matt Damon ... it seems he just wanted to play Jason Bourne. If you are a fan of Bourne's first two films, you will not be disappointed at the third installment. It sticks to what works and adds something more. I was very happy to see how well all the information in "Identity" and "Supremacy" had all sides in "Ultimatum" to finally paint the full picture of Jason Bourne's troubled past. The sequences of action are fast and keep you on the edge of the seat. The fighting between Bourne and the assassins is always fun to look at. I have always been a fan of the movies surrounding CIA agents and how CIA gathers Intel and this movie is right on this street, making it even more exciting for me. If you choose to watch The Bourne Ultimatum without following the two previous installments ... you will be able to enjoy the movie very much, but I would recommend you follow them first. This will allow you to fully understand the character of Jason Bourne and become attached and part of his world. This allows you to appreciate and enjoy the film even more. I'm not sure which is the best of the top two, but I personally think that "Ultimatum" could, just MIGHT, have the advantage when comparing the trilogy.
