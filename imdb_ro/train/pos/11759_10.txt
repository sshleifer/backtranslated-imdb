The best time is one of the best crossings of all time. Configuration does not charge you patience, development is constant, many interrelated relationships are well established, bands and bits all work and all are fun. There is a lot of sentimentality. Kurt Russell plays Reno Hightower put in one of his best performances, and Robin Williams plays Jack Dundee is sure never. Also, the cast includes many big supporters. Jack's wife is interpreted by Jack Palance's daughter, who is wonderful as Reno's wife, who is a great comedian. I can not tell you how many times I've watched this movie, how many times I've enjoyed it, and how often I want more people to see it.
