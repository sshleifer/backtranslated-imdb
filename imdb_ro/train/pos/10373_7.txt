Matro Spirogolou's (Toby Malone) family knows he is a talented footballer and is pleased to hear an audition to join a big club. They hope that when he comes to the city, the cousin will take care of him. But the cousins ​​are like chalk and cheese: a naive boy and the other a master who managed to get involved with drug dealers and gangsters. Mat is unlikely to have a quiet evening before his big day. After losing his cousin George (Damien Robertson) on arrival in the city, Mat faces additional problems when a young motorcycle takes him for a walk in more ways than one. Toby Malone, perhaps better known for his work in the theater, puts himself into a commendable performance as the bucolic teenager. There are indicative signs of a low budget, but just as many other low budget movies, there is more fun, apparently more spontaneity and more charm than can be seen in the Hollywood average blockbuster.
