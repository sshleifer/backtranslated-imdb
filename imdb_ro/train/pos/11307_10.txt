To get in touch with the beauty of this film, pay special attention to the piece of sound, not just the music, but the way all the sounds help to make the pictures. How beautiful the original scene leading to Gino's expulsion sets the theme of moral ambiguity! Keep in mind how music introduces the characters while we are condemned to Giovanna's marriage. Do not expect to find too much here in the political life of Italy in 1943. It's not about that. On the other hand, if you are susceptible to the music of images and sounds, you will be led in a word that goes beyond neo-realism. By the end of the movie, there are moments of landscapes similar to Antonioni, which has more to do with the inner life of the characters than with real places. This is one of my favorite films Visconti.
