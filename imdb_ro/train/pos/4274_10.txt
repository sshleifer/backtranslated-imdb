I love this movie very much, but it is a reality that you can only understand it if you are from the former Yugoslavia. Most actors are now dead and they were the best actors in the former Yugoslavia. I appreciate that this movie is now on Divx and I can have it in my collection. Macedonia. Serbia. Montenegro. Bosnia and Herzegovina. Croatia. Slovenia. All this was former Yugoslavia, a melting pot of the Balkan nations. It could be a dream land if Slobodan Milosevic, Franjo Tudjman and other nationalists would not poison the mind of the nation with their sick ideas.
