An incomparable, subtle and thin film, "The Man in White Suit" is still a fresh air of Ealing studios. While I suspect that some modern viewers might find it initially obscure, I doubt that many would not be fascinated by the expert way in which plot, themes and characters are transmitted long into the movie. Alec Guinness gives another fine characterization in a movie, perhaps not as obvious as the virtuoso as "Hearts and Coronets Kind," inspired by Ealing in 1949. This time he just plays a character, rather than eight, but as a foreign inventor and scientist, Sidney Stratton finds the right tone and expression. Together with Guinness's subtle, expressive performance, the rest of the songs are effective. Among the main players, Cecil Parker and Ernest Thesiger are not remarkable. Thesiger is unpredictable absurd as critically acclaimed but influential business grandeur, while Parker is trustworthy as the owner and father of the factory that has no effect. Father, that is, Joan Greenwood, the delectable comic actress who is at its unparalleled point in this film. Revealed and seductive in appearance and dictatorship, she is quite sublime in this film, a contrast with Guinness, just as unusual, but worse. The scene that seems to try to tempt him is played so deeply by the pair that he is so profoundly moving and funny ... The themes are treated very efficiently, without being drawn to light morals. The complexity of the relations between science, business and the workforce is viewed in a visible and pleasant way. Experienced by Alexander Mackendrick, this film is practiced in all fields; evocative photos, sound effects and matching music, and a glamorous script, impress silently. A totally satisfying film with wonderful Guinness and Greenwood. <br /> <br /> Rating: - 1/2 / *****
