In fact, a certain person / character is not "right there," but my short line refers to the power of the movie. And this is done without the fanciful movements of the chambers and / or large sets of production, but with a wonderful and very credible story and good actors who transmit the story. a movie accompaniment for Japanese cinema films (like Tokyo Story, etc.), not so much a story, of course, but more awesome! Excellent actors, shades in shows that are really stones. If you are eager to experience an emotional story and want to see a movie that emotionally touches you, it is one that has to go. As you have noticed (as in many of my reviews), I do not get into the story. There are places here at IMDb where you can look at them, I'm not one for spoiler the story of everything!
