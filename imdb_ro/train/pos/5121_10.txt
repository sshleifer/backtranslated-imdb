I'm a big fan of the movie, but not for the usual reasons. I think Travolta and Winger performed at higher rates than the average, I think the sets were representative of the location and it was, I liked the sound track and Charlie Daniels Band. However, I think the photo was amazing! Since indoor scenes were filmed in the current club, and Gilley had low ceilings - probably 10-12 meters tall, and the smoke that had to simulate a "smoke-free bar" was hanging 2-4 meters below the ceiling . The camera managed to take pictures of the smoke and focus on the actors, the bull, the bar, the women, the dance, the low level of light that was actually in the bar! What a deed! There was certainly an auxiliary illumination, but in order to maintain the atmosphere of the bar, it had to be low light shots. Ray Villalobos (camera operator) was remarkable! He got some pictures that he had no hope of accomplishing, and their impact brought a sense of reality to the film. Thank you, Ray - A great job!
