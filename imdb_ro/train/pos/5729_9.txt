This is a little puzzle for a lot of Lynch crow arts. They tend to try to write this as a sort of Lynch's senseless, crude, side-by-side project. Like that, Lynch passes the gas between his real art pieces of film. Well, it could be a fart but one of those exciting fingers that you catch by a whiff of and I am embarrassed to admit you enjoy. Dumbland distilled down beyond that is art. What you can do with aspects of modern life, but laugh at it. If you had taken it seriously, you would break. Crash it, feel it, taste it, feel its agonies, its unsolved stupidity, and then express it in any medium you choose. This is called art, and art is not bad. But it is Dumbland.
