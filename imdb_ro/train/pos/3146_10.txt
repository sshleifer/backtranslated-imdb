If television was a baseball league, this show would have a perfect record! With an excellent cast and perfect plot, this show gave 8 stunning seasons and great joy on TV after dinner. With the constant change in relationships and discovering who is Hyde's true father, this show was a success when it began in August 98, although it was established in 1976. And the party in the house of Foremans was always the thing to do , and is still today, along with circles. This show laughed for the first time and still takes place during the resumption. If you watch a few episodes of this show, you get everything and want to get more. Now just this show is one of the best ever created, it's smart and funny.
