Start low, solid environment, fantastic finish. That's my impression of this movie, anyway. I liked Simon Pegg in the two films I saw in - Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead. His role here, however, had a completely different tower. He shows his line as an actor, but I still liked the character very much, as he was portrayed at first. There is a kind of humor I call "frustration comedy." His "jokes" and spirit are only painful and uncomfortable moments. Just like the Bean character played by Rowan Atkinmson. There are a number of other comedic actors portraying and similar characters. I do not want to fight them here, so it will not be. But you have to be warned that if you are like me, and you do not like smart and mad idiots, Pegg shows just the same characteristics for the first time in the third. However, it improves. I have read somewhere that this is based on a true story. Hmmm. May be. The story of the movie has ceased to be annoying and has become a triumph of the "little guy" in the last third. I do not need all the movies to be sugar and light --- but coincidentally, as this movie has improved, it has become more and more a happy ending. It was also a pleasure to see an old favorite, Jeff Bridges, play such a great role. I liked Iron Man, but he was saddened by the fact that Bridges' character was a villain. The pure taste, of course, because his action was superb. However, he was a wonderful man here as a bigger man than life, Sharps editor. It was nice to see him in a role that I could really enjoy. Generally, then I liked it! I just wanted to be 40 minutes late and I lost the beginning.
