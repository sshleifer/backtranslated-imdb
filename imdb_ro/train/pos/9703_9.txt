One of the best comedy series ever to come from the UK. Mark Gatiss, Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton are extraordinary actors and performers who seem to be home with drama, as they are with comedy. Hardly supported by their writing partner Jeremy Dyson, they populated the series with the most memorable characters in recent years. Little Britain seemed insignificant as a poor imitation of their ideas. Consistently and originally, I'm sure many people hate these series like them, but I'm also pretty sure nobody could have any opinion about LOG. I still see the movie length, but I hear good things and bad things, so I'm going to reserve the judgment. The original radio series from which LOG came in was as innovative as the TV series. I do not know if the TV series did it in the United States, but I would be fascinated to see how the American audience found the English sparkle of humor
