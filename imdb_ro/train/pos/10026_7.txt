Without Kirsten Miller this project must not have been completed. However, with the beauty and talent inspired by the amazement, which is Miss Miller, I would certainly recommend it. It seemed that the other actors only played on her strong performance. Wagner tries to honor this film and was a little disappointing, but some of his scenes did not make him entertained. For the most part, my criticisms are related to writing and plotting, the group of assembled talents has done a heroic job of saving what should have been a disaster. Miller's charismatic delivery and calendar were impeccable and credible. She plays that beautiful line between assertive and boss, but never offensive she is actually the structural engineer she claims to be. I wish I had seen this on the big screen, but unfortunately I was lucky to rent it before I lost.
