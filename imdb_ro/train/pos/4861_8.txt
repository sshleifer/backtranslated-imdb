Joan Fontaine is "A Little Girl in Distress" in this 1937 musical with Fred Astaire, George Burns and Gracie Allen. The plot, of all this, is about a British woman (Fontaine) in love with an American who is mistaken for Astaire, a musical comedy star. The film, directed by George Stevens, contains a wonderful Gershwin music, which includes "A Good Job if You Can Take It" and "A Foggy Day". The best scene is the "Stiff Upper Lip" number, which takes place in a fun house. Astaire's singing voice sounds more robust in this movie than in others, and has some excellent dance numbers. Burns plays the role of top publisher, and Allen is Burns' secretary. It's hilarious. The problem, as others have pointed out, is Fontaine, who has to dance with Astaire at the end of the film. Stevens could easily use a double because he shows the dance in a long shot and takes place between the trees. I would have thought it was double, except that the dance was so bad. <br /> <br /> It is definitely worth seeing despite its flaws.
