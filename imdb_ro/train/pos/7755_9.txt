"Written on the Wind" is an irresistible, impressive film that only director Sirk could have done. The film is immersed in a bucket full of Freudian symbols, strange melodramas and colorful contrasts. The link between financial success and moral decay is the main theme of the film. Sirk seems to suggest that sexual dysfunction is one of the side effects of capitalism. However, I prefer to see the film as a prime example of what Sirk could do with kitsch material. The color palette is particularly impressive. The actor in the movie is also great. Rock Hudson and Lauren Bacall are extremely glamorous and give the film an aura of elegance, but the film belongs to Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone (who earned the best Oscar-winning actress) who manage to keep the film at a boiling point . Kudos for Frank Skinner's pulsating score, Russell Metty's shining work (each movie is a masterpiece by itself) and the production design department. Also, the title tone is a beauty. It's an unforgettable movie.
