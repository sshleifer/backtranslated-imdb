I enjoyed this show very much - I got the first and only one in the UK, a series of series in Book 4. The characterization took place on money - like the Simpsons, because all the different facets of the population in small towns were Not there was no laugh - I did not see this in an American TV comedy at the time, except for Larry Sanders, and it worked well here, suggesting that these crazy policemen did that and not just get it pack for your camcorders. All in all, a strange little number that just crouched me like this: I can not believe it may have lost some audiences. I think it would have been a cult hit in the UK if it had been shown at an acceptable time. I'll end this with my standard comment: Where the hell can I understand this you look again? Any idea?
