I rated 10 out of 10. Why? <br /> <br /> * Provides insight into what I barely understand - surf surfers because it's all they want to do; Nothing else seems to matter as much as navigating; It's not a temporary thing - it's a life for these guys * Funeral in the movie is a great surfing story; I never navigated, but I like surfing movies and I've seen a lot. Nobody taught me what this movie made * The movie was very well edited. It was going well. Interviews were remarkable * It's interesting from start to finish <br /> <br /> In conclusion, it's about as good as a documentary as we have seen, so you have to miss out in terms of it. So, 10/10
