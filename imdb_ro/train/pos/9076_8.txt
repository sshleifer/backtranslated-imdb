This should be one of the funniest TV sitcoms that will emerge from the states since the death of "Everybody Loves Raymond". Warburton is always hilarious, and in this way completes the rest of the ensemble expressed in perfection. David Spade continues to gnaw his amusing bone enormously with his rather unique delivery of his lines. After I got across the British series, "Coupling" can see exactly where the creators of the "Engagement Rules" took their initial idea, but this is not intended as a "brickbat" - the brilliant dialogue and how it is transmitted put this particular series completely separate. But it takes more than a competent distribution to bring success to a new series, especially in the very difficult field of comedy. Being part of a professional television professional comedy team for most of 7 years in Australia, I can particularly appreciate the role of the director and the perceptual and creative talent of the crew of the room. One of the few grievances I have had with the series is the very preserved laughter. Certainly a live audience could have been used in filming the series.
