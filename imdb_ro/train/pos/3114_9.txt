I will keep this short enough to not hurt anything for you. This movie is great. From start to finish, it is full of genuine emotions. The battle scenes are fantastic, tracking scenes are delightful and move at a pace so it really feels slow to the end when things are explained, but only because everything that preceded it. Damon shines and he really proved to be a very solid actor, dare not to believe him in this role. It is this role. A welcome addition to David Straithrain's series (I hope I said close to the right) as an aggressive CIA agent who killed Bourne. This is non stop and will really leave you on the edge of the chair for most of the road. Some things to the end are just an absurd smidgeon, thus denying a rating of 10. The end is left open for continuation and I hope I hope to do more of them because none was bad. Excellent movie in all and a fantastic ending with an amazing trilogy. The crazy camera did not hurt any action, but I think we can do without it. The good news is that, indeed, you really notice when people talk and not so much.
