I did not see BSG, I tried to see it once in the middle of the show, but I could not get into it. However, I saw Caprica Rebirth yesterday that I felt a little lost, so I decided to see the pilot today and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. I think this is a promising show and the only side effect I have on me is that I now want to look at BSG as well. But what I really enjoyed was that I was not supposed to be a hardcore BSG fan to understand what was going on in Caprica. From what I read on the net, they try to reach the feminine population, because BSG has reached more men and at least in my case it worked. However, I suggest that if you try to watch the show, do so from the beginning with the Pilot.
