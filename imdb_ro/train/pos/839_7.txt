Think of Pierce Brosnan and think you're courageous, dapper, smart James Bond. In this movie, Brosnan plays against the guy - and he has a lot of fun doing this (like the audience). This is a movie about a hired assassin who is friends with a terrible businessman ... and works! This is a fun movie with very good scenes (a Brosnan riveting broach and a good, off-the Kinnear edge has some good lines). My only clue is that Hope Davis, playing the wife so tolerant ("Can I see your gun?") It does not appear more often: it could have been a wonderful foil for these men. /> This movie is like a matador: playing with the audience, while "going for a killing". The end is wonderful because a story (with a moral positive!) Appears: This is a frenetic, frenetic and fun movie that deserves a wide audience.
