With GEORGE NADER's death on February 4, 2002, I thought of this very exciting program, which, although it was only short-lived, was an extraordinary idea with good story lines. Generally, unseen for over 40 years, it would be worthwhile to view it again. The opening credits showed many different images, one of which was a snippet of JOHN PAUL STAPP COLLECTION, riding on his famous rocket sleigh at the point where he was often called "The Fastest Man in Life."
