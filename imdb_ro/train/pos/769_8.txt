Of all the breakdancing / hip-hop movies released between 1983 and 1986, 1984's Beat Street is undoubtedly the best film. The story comes after a DJ, his younger brother, a graffiti artist and a showbiz promoter, in a single winter, trying to get out of the ghetto using their "street" talent. The actress is not always on the hair and the characters are not completely drawn but they are more than offset by dialogue down, a plausible story, fantastic dance sequences and an uninterrupted hip-hop song. It should be noted that this film was shot in the birthplace of breakdancing ("It's not New York, this is the Bronx!") And there are occurrences of Breakdancing parents, rock band Steady Crew and rapper Afrika Bambaata. Rock Steady Crew provides the best scene in the movie when it dominates a dance battle at the breakdancing club of the early 80's Roxy. He has to see for hip hop lovers.
