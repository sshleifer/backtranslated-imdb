Men from HONOR show Cuba Gooding Jr., which is probably the best performance so far. He plays the role of Carl Brashear, a brave and heroic man. He is a poor southern farmer who wants to become a diver of the Navy but has problems because of his race. The head of the diving school, played by Robert DeNiro, is a racist blush, which, however, grows in Brashear's respect. The film is about how Brashear must compete with almost insurmountable quotas, not once, but twice. Performances are what makes this movie special. Goodness is wonderful, and DeNiro, the best actor in the history of the film, offers prominent performance - the best dramatic work in recent years. Charlize Theron gives another solid performance as DeNiro's wife, much younger. The movie puts patriotism a little too strong (though not if the level was close to The Patriot), and some of the characters are just a bad dimensional dimension (Pappy's Hal Holbrook is just that bad) but the movie is a rarity among today's films. It is uplifting and unique. A wonderful movie.
