How can I get to see Orlando Bloom and Heath Ledger together? Well, I could not and so, I rented this film disaster. I've never heard of Ned Kelly and I was surprised at what I learned about this young man's legend. I was also surprised at how mediocre this movie was. Maybe it was very, very late and at the end of a 4-hour movie marathon or perhaps because it was really a bit slow, I found this difficult story to follow. Not because the story is complicated, but because it is slow. Even with a slow story, Ledger and Bloom have managed to create interesting and dimensional characters. <br /> <br /> Although I am going to recommend that you have to see, it's a wonderful story of Australian history (considering how young the country is, this is very rare and must be appreciated) and the movie has some sequences good actions. <br /> <br /> 6/10 you see it with historical value .... (yes, well ... and this is the only reason to see ...))
