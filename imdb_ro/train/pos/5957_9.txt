The title says it all. I'm not a film critic, nor will I handle the rest of the snob people commenting on this movie. Obviously, this movie did not have a budget of over one million dollars, but the plot was very well done, the act was great and the cinema was great! It looks like you had a lot of fun doing this movie! I voted 9 out of 10 that the sound was strong on one channel instead of both, but I imagine it could have been an error in recording the DVD. I'm sure I'll check out other movies produced by brainwave films! <br /> <br /> Dylan O'Leary, cast and crew, thank you!
