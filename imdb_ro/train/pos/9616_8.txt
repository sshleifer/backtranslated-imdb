It is worth watching twice because of the rapid causal changes between some compelling stories, "Bug" appears to be an entirely satisfactory work of art that plays ever more optimistic love for countless examples of frustrating reality. the characters are Wallace (John Carroll Lynch), whose prolonged preoccupation with life - from that of a beetle to the airline passengers for which he is partly responsible - fits the film; Olive (Christina Kirk), who spends a lot of time creating surreal, but tasty tables for her impossible husband Ernie (Chris Bauer); and Mitchell, a cable television technician with unlimited trust in cookie messages: "You'll meet the face of your dreams." Against such optimism are the forces of strange reality, all generated by the actions of the characters: parking tickets, clogged drainage in a Chinese grocery / donut, TV interruption, a crushed automatic machine, a wiped mass reservation, which eventually leads to cancel a Hawaiian vacation. The film is funny: Olive dresses in Chippendale performance, Johnston (Michael Hitchcock) as a customer service service that tries to handle an irritated customer, Cyr (Brian Cox), a germ obsessive who faces the inspector Dwight (Jamie Kennedy) refuses to have children by writing some nasty Chinese kitchen warnings: "Your friend lied to you" and the guy who sleeps while he's doing a car because he spent the night looking for his girlfriend's missing cat. a minor public-affair story is a host of access (Darryl These) and a local teacher who reads "The Boy in the Bubble" expresses the main theme: love comes from the heart. Bug has fun at the same level as "trains, planes and cars," but with a smaller budget and a fresh eye.
