Some bad reviews here for that, and I understand why, but treat it as a serial serial killer and you could get more from that than most. I thought this worked in a way because afterwards I felt dirty and wanted to take a long shower, so it's a certain degree of success, is not it? I would say it is just the right level of sleaze here to get under your skin, although the drive is maybe a bit too uneven. David Hess is just in this bullshit, so do not worry too much hope if you like the Last House. Other than that - it's worth a look.
