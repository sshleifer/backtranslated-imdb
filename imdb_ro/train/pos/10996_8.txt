Who can watch a movie, look at Lucy Liu and not be happy. This woman is amazingly beautiful and a talented actress. This is a tough combination to find a few days ago. And Jeremy Northam. I've heard his name many times, but I have never noticed it. My advice for Hollywood is "use it more". Now about the movie: I saw her in one of my cemetery changes. I do not recommend this to anyone. It's a bit complicated and mysterious for that. I still can not believe I have not seen the coming coming. I'm not going to tell you what the cause of the film will break with the hole. though saying that is quite bad. <br /> <br /> Now I think I will vote my vote on this movie. I like the dark mystic story, the actors have done a good job, and I like directors (natali) to work in the past. There is not a big audience for this kind of thing, that's pretty risky too. you know what, I'm gonna do this work 8 because everybody should see that. Then again, 1 deduction point always causes room for improvement.
