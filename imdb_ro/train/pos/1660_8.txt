I am a fan of ART, I love nothing about Art, I like paintings, sculptures, etc. This movie shows him, so I like it a lot, it shows how a woman wants to paint something about Art, especially about bare bodies, but she can not do it because of the strict family (father), at the beginning of the film she painted itself naked, but he wanted a man for her paintings, but her family did not let her paint naked men because she was against moral. Even so, Artemisia could paint his friend and art teacher completely empty. She falls in love with her art teacher, and it seems that the art teacher is totally in love with her too, so that she finally sacrifices her freedom for her by lying. He said he raped it, but it was not true. Artemisia fell in love with him, but if he says he will suffer much, because in the process where Artemisia, her father and art teacher were, someone hurt his artistic hands to tell the truth. I think this wonderful film about ART and artistic love is worth watching. Valentina Cervi is wonderful as Artemisia, she behaves very well, I like her performance in "The Portrait of a Lady", such as Pansy Osmond. 8.5 / 10
