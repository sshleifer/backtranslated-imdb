I know it's brutal and I know it's not a PC at all, but it's so funny. If you can say it's from the early 1980s and that it bears all the stereotypes of time - and the movie makes you almost laugh - it's really a good comedy. Going with the tradition of what comedies have been for thousands of years, the subject of this film is exaggerated. If you can suspend political correctness for an hour and a half, just to have a total laugh, than you look at it. Someone would put this on DVD, it's so hard to find on VHS.
