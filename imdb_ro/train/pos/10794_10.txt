I always enjoyed seeing Chuck Norris in the movie. Although the act can not be superb, the battle scenes are fantastic. I also liked seeing Judson Mills playing with him. In my opinion, the Norris brothers have proved to be fans of entertainment and this was still a fine production! I hope you have time to watch this movie!
