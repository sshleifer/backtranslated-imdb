A comedy from LAUREL & HARDY. The boys get to shake the baskets at the home of Professor Noodle, a crazy scientist who has just perfected the rejuvenating serum. Stan & Ollie continues with their work, scattering destruction inside the house and on the roof. Then the teacher wants to try out his new potion ... A very funny movie. The end is a bit steep, but much of the slapstick that leads to it is terrible. Stan & Ollie's contest with wills from the opposite ends of the chimney is particularly good. That's Lucien Littlefield as a teacher.
