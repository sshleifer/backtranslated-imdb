The movie is not amazingly visual in the conventional sense. He does not have a series of beautiful pictures. Instead, it's a visually exciting movie. It forces viewers to process constantly, or perhaps to imagine the context of different photos. This type of work is easy to try but hard to succeed. The film refuses to use a kind of cake to help viewers who are not fully engaged in getting what's happening. Instead, the film touches and passes through several different genres. The trick to love the movie is capable of enjoying this play. I suspect that 99% of North American viewers will not receive it. If you try to identify the narrative of this film or the philosophical message or symbolic structure, you will waste time. There is none of these. The film refers only to these genres and to others at times. The only unifying force in the movie is Claire Denis's feeling to fit together. There are so few feature length films that come close to Kant's description of what art is, namely, the joy of the power of judgment itself, instead of simply emphasizing experiences under concepts. The movie usually has the easy way and opts for a simpler pleasure to understand what's going on. Most of the film is not art. Most of the film does not come close to art. When a movie has, as it does, and is still enjoyable by a wide range of viewers, it is something of a miracle. My negative commentary is the fact that sometimes I find that the film buys too simplistic the various narrative threads that go through it. The Tahiti-father-son narrative, though not even conventional, ends up doing things a little clear and simple. It is dominant too much.
