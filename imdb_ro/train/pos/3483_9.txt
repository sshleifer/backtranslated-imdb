Although the film is the adaptation of the French play (forgot the name - sorry), it is a wonderful portrayal of the gorgeous part of the Georgian character. This movie will make you laugh and you will fill your heart with a warm sadness. He will present the overwhelming love of life, along with human eccentrics.
