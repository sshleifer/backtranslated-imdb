"One stroke, one murder, no exception". You have to see if you're in the navy or the sniper. two big fingers! An excellent story, a great chamber work, a good drama, action, details and more. Quite close to real things. But this is not a breakdown movie and you choose editing flaws. this is to sit back and have 99 good minutes. The plot has a depth, but this movie is not going to think. to enjoy the sniper's lifestyle and action. Sniper 2 and 3 are pretty good follow-ups, but the first is still the best overall movie. Tom Berenger is doing a good job playing his character and showing the hidden part of sniper life. the field to treat all death. He must see for sniper fans.
