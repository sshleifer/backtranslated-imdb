I saw the short film a few years ago. After that, I follow all the sequels. The first is not really the best - but it is the most popular. I've already watched the formation of Guinea Pig 1. It's really great what these guys did. Also, follow-ups are excellent in terms of special effects. Get your chance to see it!
