I have seen this with few expectations and I loved him absolutely! Believe it as Beckham is quite a typical film about a pretty atypical girl. This is the role of Parminder Nagra ("ER") playing Jess, a teenager in England who is caught between her traditional Indian family and her love of football (this is North American football). And even if she is actually much older than her character, she plays the perfect role. This is a film about friendship - especially Jess's friendship with Jules (Keira Knightley), her teammate, through family problems, especially with her mother who wore purple Polish and small arcs on her shoes and who wants Jules to be more feminine, wearing cute lingerie and flirting with boys and is terrified that sports play means her daughter is lesbian. Jules and Jess both love the game and have trouble trying to persuade their families to let them go after their dreams. Also, unfortunately, both love the same man - Joe, their coach (played by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers). The love triangle causes a certain tension in their friendship. In some places, Bend It Like Beckham falls into clips. In others, scenes take too long, and this movie could have benefited from more editing. But this was a funny movie about the growth, the clash of culture and the love of football. It's about empowering women, watching your dreams and supporting your friends. Funny, charming and fun, Bend It Like Beckham is the little movie that could ... and it did. Excellent. 8/10.
