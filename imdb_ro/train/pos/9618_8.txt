I recently bought this movie and I do not regret having it at all, in fact, I am very pleased to add this movie to my collection. Matt Manfredi and Phil Hay, film directors, had less than a month to shoot and spent about $ 1 million to produce this great movie. This proves that not only great productions make great movies. The title of this movie fits perfectly. In computer language, BUG means programming error that causes reactions in the computer function. Our reactions can cause these negative side effects, but also moments of beauty. The vertiginous events of this film begin with the death of a BUG. A man confesses "murder" on the other side of the road ... From there, everything gets complicated ... I noticed John Carrol Lynch ("Fargo"), Wallece, the man who can not do everything right.
