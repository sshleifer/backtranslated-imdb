Frankly, I do not understand why this movie was such a big flop in advertising. Sharon Stone certainly has not lost any charisma and "touch" from the "basic instinct". I voted this movie 10 and tell you why: The game opens in London this time. London is the city where Catherine Tramell moved from the BI1 events. Again, she turns out to be a manipulator of the creation of her own class - it has penetrated. It screws your brain like Catherine with such a skill that you're finally not sure who the real negative person is. Regarding the technical part of the movie: Only the actual replay is crew B of actors. Sharon Stone is the only really big name in the cast, compared to her and Michael Douglas, etc. in the first part. I also think BI2 would have been better if Sharon Stone was a bit younger, but she's still pretty amazing in her eyes and she's only gotten better with her charisma. Her "B" assistants are not that bad, though I would have liked some bigger names for the cast. I think there are pretty good improvements in the basic plot. I think this is a much better thriller than many of the crap that Hollywood has very easily distributed these days. The plot is great, it's easy to see technically, you do not snore half through the film and most importantly - it's armed.
