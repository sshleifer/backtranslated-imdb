If you are in need of an escape, something that will keep your attention for two hours and will allow you to lose yourself in another world, Domino will satisfy this need. That's fun, after all! The plot keeps your brain moving - one of those movies (like the usual Ordinary) where you want to see it the second time to find out everything. I asked myself about Domino Harvey, how her life became interesting for Hollywood. As for the act, many celebrity appearances are not presented in trailers. And any actor who makes me forget who they are doing is good. Not once I thought of Kiera in a uniform or pirate football suit. And given, Mickey Rourke plays well and often Mickey Rourke, but here, despite violence, he shows signs of being able to care for other people.
