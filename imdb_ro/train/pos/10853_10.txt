This movie is great for spirits. Every time I watch, I see and hear funny things that I've lost before. The soundtrack is unbelievable. Mick Jones (stranger) and Chris Difford (Squeeze) wrote the songs, making Strange Fruit the best thing ever to hit the music scene today. Unfortunately, Strange Fruit is a strictly washed fiction in the 60's and 70's that have never been good to start off because of drug use and home struggles. One wonders what they could while listening to their fanatic soundtrack. Inspired by The Rolling Stones, Deep Purple, David Bowie and The Who. <br /> <br /> The Fruit member is quite memorable. Stephen Rea plays Tony Costello, who is asked by a festival promoter to reunite his band for a reunion tourney with hopes of getting monetary benefits. Costello approached Karen Knowles ex-roadman, played by Juliet Aubrey, to help him reapply the flame of a past past. Juliet squeaks Jimmy Nail (Les Wickes) bitterly, making Timothy Spall David "Beano" Baggot) and extraordinarily glamorous Ray Simms (Bill Nighy). He is another ex-roadie, hugh-toker-jokester Hughie (Billy Connolly), who never lets the flame burn. As Juliet searches for the latest member of his band, guitarist-songwriter Brian Lovell (played by Bruce Robinson), the reunited members buzz, like old times, fighting against the rusty talent of others. <br /> <br /> The band then has the chance to make a small Dutch tour to prepare for the festival. With the young Hendrix, such as Luke Shand (Hans Matheson), who takes the place of Lovell, the crew hits the road. Sparks act as a reminder of their flames, threatening to burn their unfinished gaps ... Be prepared to laugh, sing, cheer and cry, as these memorable characters lie in your hearts. .
