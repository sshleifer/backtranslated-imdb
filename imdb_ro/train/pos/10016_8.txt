If there is something to recommend about this movie is that it is interesting. The premise certainly attracts the audience, because it is a mystery, and throughout the film there are signs that there is something dark. However, there is not much tension, and William's portrait with a gentle maneuver does not do much to make us refer to his obsession with the boy. Collapses are much better with a woman whose true nature and intentions are not very clear. Production hastened and holes were highlighted. You surely feel like a preview for a much more complete and better effort. The book is probably better. One thing is certain: Taupin must have written something really good to inspire at least a commendable effort.
