Born Limerick again: If a man could come back from the dead <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> And live in a little girl's head <br /> <br /> Revenge he will get <br /> <br /> For the killing he has encountered <br / > <br /> By the guy who is now in his wife's bed. <br /> <br /> For me, Born Again is a very undervalued classic episode that is part of what has defined X files for me before I start seeing it. I saw some segments before the show first appeared and I was too young to watch them as The Jersey Devil songs, but I especially remind you that you looked at this episode as a man of 11 and that you are absolutely out of the scene where you get sick of the bus and then of the hypnosis scene with your little girl. I tell you I can not sleep for weeks! For this reason, the episode has a special aura at this moment about the humiliating factor we have developed since then. It's enough to let me look at some of the obvious defects of the plot, such as why the girl had to wait until she was nine years old before her previous spirit of life really started to get revenge. Or what she was just doing on a bus in the middle of the night. You think her parents would have been worried. And maybe I did not really see that part of the story. And was she with telekinesis? Apart from adding the really cold Carrie factor to the already horrible story, there was no good explanation for him. But even with its little flaws, in my mind, this is a classic episode and has no reason not to like it. 10 out of 10.
