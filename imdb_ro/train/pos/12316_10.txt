Ching Siu Tung and Tsui Hark's Chinese Story, apart from being one of the biggest wuxia piano movies ever created, is a beautiful and romantic love story, as well as an impressive choreographic martial arts film that must belong to the collection of each movie lover. Leslie Cheung, Hong Kong's super-star, who has been badly missed, plays a travel tax collector who spends the night in a haunted temple. While at the temple, he meets a number of colorful characters, including the spirits of Yin (Wu Ma) and Hsiao Hou, the Tree Devil and the beautiful ghost Lit Sin Seen played by the wonderful Joey Wong. <br /> To release him from the evil Devil's claws, he must re-incarnate his body and travel to the underworld to defeat an even stronger demon. Can not say enough good stuff this movie. Pacing is perfect, with a great combination of romance, action, fantasy and humor, and the enduring feverish ritual has to leave you with little chance of breathing. The chemistry of the wonderful tragic Joey Wong and Leslie Cheung (whose legendary career ended too soon) really allows the spectator to feel for both. Indeed, the overall action is so lively and lively, I would say that this is one of the most entertaining viewing experiences I've ever had. Much of the credit is given to Wu Ma in his portrayal of mysterious spying Yin. His top-up person of a disappointed hell who bends in the fight against evil leads to some wonderful moments of HK's humor and traditional drama. A wonderful score, a lush, eye-catching cinema that opens and some frenzy of action, offered by Ching Siu Tung, combines this wonderful movie. Find a copy wherever you can. 10/10
