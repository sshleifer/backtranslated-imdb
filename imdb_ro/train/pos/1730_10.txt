This tranquil stone reveals the true story of an escape during the Second World War. Performances are incredible, especially Anthony Steele. The film works on several levels: brain, emotional, visual and literal. The dialogue is ingenious and the rings are very real. In fact, an unusual authenticity all around puts this head and shoulders above most of the war age.
