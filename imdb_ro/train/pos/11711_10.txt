Patty Duke's story about her life and the fight with manic depression were like my life struggles. I saw acting just like her. I was so amazed at the similarities in our lives to include the sexual abuses we both endured as children. I saw the film when it was awarded in 1990 and I loved this movie so much. Anyone who struggled with manic depression could get so much out of this movie. It does not matter whether she would show her the prizes or what they were. This is not the problem here. The problem is how Ms. Duke had a disease and struggled to survive and overcome. Ms. Duke has a lot of pride in her accomplishments with her struggles for the survival of a disease that often leaves many hopeless victims. If a person did not fight this disease personally, they do not know the hell they have to live with. The film for me was a success because it showed the real problems and the way a person who is depressed and acts maniacally. It was so true ... so, true. It was like looking up there on the screen. I would like to personally thank Mrs Patty Duke for having the courage to inform the public about her illness. Bock
