Having just welcomed home, my 23-year old daughter, a year in Iraq, the Camp Anaconda healthcare unit, I felt compelled to get this DVD. I wanted to hear other feelings from the returning veterans to try to better understand her mentality on arrival and not wait until something bad happened. Whether you're dealing with war and peace, this movie serves as a wonderful start for all Americans to begin the healing of our returning veterans. The primary statement of the entire film is "Take Action" on this issue. Incredibly emotional movie. I would recommend this movie to veteran veterans the whole mature family and ask them to follow with a plan to listen to the comforting help of returning war veterans from the Gulf War of Enduring Freedom. <br /> <br /> Fast before almost a year later & My daughter saw this DVD. She took into consideration her emotions and, in fact, has committed to renew for another six years. Taking his time in the sand is that he did something good. Local Baladic children received first-rate medical treatment for various common conditions, which usually can not afford free escort and translators. Look over your shoulder at her tour of Iraq. "I've changed some hearts and minds back" The wonderful DVD needs to keep an open mind and see all the parts
