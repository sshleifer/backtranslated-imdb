I admit I have a weakness for alternative story stories, from a wonderful life to GROUNDHOG Day until 12:01. Among the best is this little jewel. It's pretty hard to get through MR. DESTINATED without giving a mark of appreciation to each of the cast members, from the good James Belushi to the murderer Courtney Cox. This movie has no gravitas and ladder to make a great movie, but it is a beautiful joy on a rainy afternoon. It's also a great rental for a cheap day.
