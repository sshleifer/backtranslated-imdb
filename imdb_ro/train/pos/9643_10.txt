This movie has everything. Emotion, power, affection, Stephane Rideau's pleasant beach dance ... Exposes the need for real inner communion and external communication in any relationship. Just because Cedric and Mathieu are a couple who happens to be homosexual, it does not mean that it's not quite a useful perspective for anyone in it. I would probably classify the film as a gay movie, but one that can be appreciated and loved by heterosexual, homosexual and bisexual people. Mathieu's incapacity to treat emotions reveals how our society does not encourage us to act differently, and this generates discord between him and Cedric. This is definitely a must-see !!!!
