This time, Kermit, Fozzie, Miss Piggy, Scooter, Rowlf, The Mayhem Electric, Gonzo and Camilla, the chicken are out of college and play in a musical they're trying to do on Broadway. After they succeeded in producing it, they broke up and broke up. I like the characters and the chaps. The songs in the film are "Together Again", "Look at me, Here I am", "Say Goodbye," "And I'm Always Going To Love You," "Rat Jazz" ". Frank Oz leads this excellent film and all the actors do a great job of acting as Muppets are real. See it! 91 minutes. Evaluated to G. My rating: A.
