Another comedy about a joyous country that fights through the jungle of the modern global world (for the forties), with a native spirit and a thirst for guiding them, is a good entry into the Ealing cannon. Terry-Thomas sparks as usual in the lead, as an unfaithful service man led to a disaster, when a nation he is supposed to begin to attract the interest of the world, Ian Bannen makes a great romantic lead , Peter Sellers puts one of his quieter performances as a corrupt politician and uber-suave John Le Mesurier plays against the guy as a robust revolutionary leader. A lot of fun is all about, especially the viewer; probably not in the classical Ealing echelon, but quite tall.
