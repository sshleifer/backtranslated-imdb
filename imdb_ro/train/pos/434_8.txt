Developing beautiful character in a rather cold environment. Being a man, I probably do not qualify to fully understand, but I do a good job of establishing from the beginning the restriction of the Victorian environment. It's not as bleak as it really was and the treatment of women was probably even more harsh. What makes this is a wonderful chemistry among the main characters. Everyone has their own "thing" they face. Once they came out of the rain and came out of the spider, they begin to interact and slowly lose their feeling of suspicion. What I liked about this movie is that she did not go to cheap comedy when she could. He has not tried to multiply our lesson. People who seem absolutely merciless are really developed human beings who come to see the light. We had a little problem with the character of Alfred Molina having such an epiphany so quickly, but in this world it had to happen. Acting well around all with something positive that takes place in the lives of some pretty good people.
