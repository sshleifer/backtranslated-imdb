well I was not sure what the movie would be like it would have seen only a small clip but I thought it would be good and I was right I saw it twice a day I got it and it's fine my favorite movie . I think Alison Lohan played beth really well as an actress like that and the writer must have gone into a lot of research to find out about bulimia, although it ends when beth is in the hospital and has 2 observations Horus after meals because she was told that a house is ok and that hospitals do not help bulimica as I said it's probably why I'm still home even my sister and my mom would like to sleep in the hospital because I have bulimia but this is a film on the grate, recommend it to anyone with or without an eating disorder or for those who know someone with eating disorders because they can leave them alive and see the world how to do a bit over all a barbecue movie and I recommend it for anything and any type of person
