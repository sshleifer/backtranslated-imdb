The true adaptation of the fictional and interesting French novel about a cynical and depressed middle-age software engineer (or something), relying heavily on the first person story, but not the worst for that. Unfortunately (philosophical and unhappy), the best way to describe the film and the novel is that it is more intellectual than Charles Bukowski (not a lack of respect for the intended CB). Miraculously funny, but also a bleak analysis of social and sexual relationships, the film's greatest achievement is that it reflects real life in a way so recognizable as to make you wonder why there are no other movies to stay? One of the rare examples of a good book that makes an equally good film.
