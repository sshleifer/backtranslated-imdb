This story is a complex and wonderful story of the last Harem of the Ottoman Empire, well said and provocative, we see the inner workings of a missing world now and learn about the people who lived there. <br /> <br /> He enjoyed the story, characters, actors and scenes. Some scenes have been quickly edited and the subtitles have sometimes disappeared too quickly, or a wonderful piece. The main character of Safiya is marvelously played by Marie Gillain, with whom I'm glad to say he did a fantastic job without it. The scenes with her and Alex Descas (Nadir) are charming and wonderful. We recommend this movie to anyone looking to see something less Hollywood and more authentic to the world they are simulating.
