A favorite of me, this film tells about two New York girls, Steve Brodie (Raft) and Chuck Connors (Beery), who strive to be Bowery's "main guy" at the end of the nineteenth century. <br /> <br /> Brodie (1863-1901) and Connors (1852-1913) were real people, although this is a fictional tale of their antics (based on a play). Legendary of Brodie (he did - is still a cause of argument!), The sink from the Brooklyn Bridge (1886), for which he became famous, is presented here as a period similar to the Spanish-American War (1898) . a great affection for the period, so beautifully recreated here, and includes a wild ragtime number from the singer singer Trixie Odbray (a young Pert Kelton). The record is the thinnest as Brodie, and Beery again shows what smart actor was , like the tough, big heart, and sometimes quite touching Connors.Pretty Fay Wray is the love interest both boys are looking for. full of life and energy, "Bowery" is moving at a fast pace (unlike many "talkies" early). It's not an easy-to-find movie, but it's worth looking for it.
