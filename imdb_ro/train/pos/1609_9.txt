"Moonstruck" is a movie I liked the first time I watched him. I really liked the second time. I liked the third time. Now it's one of my favorites all the time. Humor is subtle but very good. The film offers a lot of warm humor. the story takes place in an old neighborhood of the Italian school in New York. Cher's quest for love is pleasing to follow. This film is by far the best job Nicholas Cage did in the film. The old character is fantastic. He lights the screen without saying a word. The scene with his dogs screaming at the moon was fantastic. But maybe the best character is Olympia Dukakis. The climax of the film is a scene where the main characters have a breakfast of oatmeal in the family kitchen. Exceptional direction and end.
