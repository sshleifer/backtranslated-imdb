I was amazedly impressed by this movie. It contained fundamental elements of depression, pain, loneliness, despair, hope, dreams and companies. It was not just a genius musician who hit the bottom of the rock, but it was a man caught in pain, trying to find his wife in his music. He finds a comrade who comes up with her problems. Claire and Des were able to offer each other friendship and love, but more importantly a conclusion of the events that formed their life for the worst thing. <br /> <br /> Des is an unlikely character according to today's rock stars. However, he has a musical genius. He also has a past event that made him stagnate, while the things around him literally go to ruins. His focus is to create whale music, in fact, it becomes an obsession for him. Claire is the streetwise child who needs a place to stay. She finds hidden talents while she was in the Des company. She also finds a common friend who accepts her. Learn to trust him for a while. These two find love with each other. Not the mind blows, the sex infused a passion, but a love in which friendship and understanding mean more. For two people who have been injured, they find trust together.
