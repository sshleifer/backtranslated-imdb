This movie has an exceptional story, John Candy, Richard Lewis, Ornella Mutti, Cybill Shepard and Jim Belushi, to name a few, run amuck in Monte Carlo as well as other beautiful places in Europe and it is very funny. The problem that everybody encounters when it comes to protecting is wonderful, and I highly recommend watching this movie, it's worth it! John Candy is in the best shape in "Once a Murder", like everyone else! If you and your family are looking for a great family movie, this is your ticket. Everyone offers stellar performance, great action, great comedy and a great program that is rare in today's movies. The big plot, a great mystery (which I love anyway) and generally worth the money you spend. So take the kids, grab some popcorn, juice or tea, or juices, and enjoy the show !!!!
