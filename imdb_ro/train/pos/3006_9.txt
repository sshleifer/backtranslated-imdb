Although a 9 may seem an unusually high score for such a small film, however, compared to the hundreds and hundreds of detective films in the 1930s and 40s, it is one of the best and compares a lot favorably with "Man". Now, it does not mean that the film is similar to thin films, because KENNEL'S CASINO WORD is not a comedy, it's more a traditional mystery detective film. Now you thought you were not lucky Nora Charles or That or a traditional comic comedian (something found in almost all detective films), but I did not miss at all, because it was such a great movie - having a really interesting case, as well as excellent uniform performances by all. The film starts at a show-dog and is called KENNEL Crime Case, although Philo Vance's movie actually actually spends little time in the dog show and dogs are not a super-part of the movie. Instead, a very ugly man is killed and left in a completely sealed room - a repeat idea in many other detective films (such as the biggest case of CRIME DOCTOR). However, the way all these are explained seems quite credible and fit together very well - keeping my interest all the time. Of course other detective films of the day had such clever and exceptional scenes as this one. This is definitely a goalkeeper.
