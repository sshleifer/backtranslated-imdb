Greetings from this Portuguese guy :) I think Sopranos are one of the best productions ever, they have reality and fiction mixed in such a way that it's hard to see the difference. It has the same quality as the Girl of God! James Gandolfini fits the paper like a glove! I would love Sopranos will not end at all. It's perfect! It should be a subject at school :) I saw Sopranos when I was a kid, but I was too young to stay awake until the episode is over, so now I bought all the episodes in DVD format and I watch all the episodes at home before and after dinner and I'm addicted, as I did with Prison Break. In my opinion, Prison Break and Sopranos are the best series for television. The argument of both is splendid and the actors are perfect. Congratulations on such a work. <br /> <br /> Sorry about my English. Thanks for reading.
