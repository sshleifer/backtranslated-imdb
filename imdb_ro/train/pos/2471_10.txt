I have never read Shakespeare's Hamlet before I see it, but I had a Shakespearean book with me and I could follow the dialogue through him. My vision on the film may be partly biased because I did not read the song before, but I was shot in the mind of this movie. Shakespeare is undoubtedly one of the best writers ever to live, and Hamlet's story is certainly one of his best achievements. But now, at the movie ... I found that all the actors in the film had a firm understanding of what they said and so they managed to articulate it quite well. Leonardo in Romeo and Juliet is nothing compared to Kenneth Branagh and the King. The thing I liked about it was that it worked very well as a "movie" and not as a piece you are studying. You do not have to be triumphant with Shakespeare to refer to all the chambers of Misery must go through. I would recommend this movie for a wide audience. These are my two cents.
