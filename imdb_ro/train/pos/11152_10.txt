Watching Cowboy at Midnight is like getting a masterclass in acting / directing / cinematography / editing / writing. I was too young to see him when he was first released, and I saw him for the first time a few years ago, but he was absolutely the test of time and I've followed it several times. Everything about this movie is brilliant, from the spectacular shows at Voight and Hoffman (even if I know this movie well, I still find myself fine every time Voight flashes one of his innocent looks, Hoffman coughing sickly and threatening cough) at stunning cinemas and superb stunning sequences of stories. It's a shame that many contemporary filmmakers are not ready to take the risk of making movies that are so visually and phonetically interesting as this one. Midnight Cowboy should be watched at all film schools. <br /> <br />
