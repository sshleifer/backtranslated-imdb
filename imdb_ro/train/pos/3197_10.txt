If you're a Crispin Glover fan, you have to see this. If you're a fan of Sean Penn, you have to see that. If you are a film fan in general, you must see this. If you have no idea who Crispin Glover is and you have no idea who Sean Penn is, this movie will probably have a lot of value, but the more you've seen before Crispin or Sean, the better. <Br /> <br /> This movie is so funny, but it's also a pure genius. I do not know anything about this that resembles this movie. It's his own kind. I doubt this will happen again. I can not say anything more exactly why I have not broken it partially and some of the other reviews here have already done a good job in this regard. <br /> <br /> In response to any of the commentators here who gave her a bad review, please see the movie again. In reality, there is no point where this movie can be properly called "boring". This is probably the funniest, most fun and less boring movie ever made. And it gets better with age and repetitive views. An old classic who, unfortunately, very few will be able to claim that they have seen him. Beaver Trilogy is the brilliant work of director Trent Harris, also responsible for the amazing Rubin and Ed, which Crispin Glover stars in. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, copies of this film are rare and hard to find. I've managed to find a VHS version after a diligent search, though, and there are a few ways to find out about what I know. But I really want someone to put this on a DVD.
