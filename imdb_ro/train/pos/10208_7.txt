We rarely see such short comments written by IMG Movie. Perhaps it is because this dark, light comedy is fun and enjoyable without depth, or is it missing something? I would look again if I had some incentive. So what's a chance? For the French is Serendipity "Le Battement d'Ailes du Papillon"? Fate? Perhaps it is an event that is the culmination of a series of random events. We all have these things (it's called life), but when you look that way, you start to feel that "random" might be "a fetus." this movie could be a minor event, like killing several salad leaves on the back of a truck or just as important as relying on a major life decision about the accuracy of a tight gravel throw. All these incidents cause other events that ... well did you take the picture? Domino. Multiply them by 30 characters and an average of 6 each and you have to really stretch your imagination to accept the remote chance that this scenario will happen. And I think there is a diagnosis for those who think life is so. But then this is the magical world of cinema. We recognize that it is fun to watch the way the writer / director creates together these unfamiliar events together in a story that combines the lives of these French citizens. If you have a few hours and are looking for a capricious escape, here's where to do it. Or if you recover from surgery and do not go anywhere anyway, this will engage you while the stitches heal. <br /> <br /> Happenstance will not descend as a winner of the prize, but should develop a cult following. Soren Kierkegaard is attributed to the following: "Life can only be understood backwards but must be lived before." If you looked at the detail in many of your own life experiences (meeting your first love, finding the perfect gift, your last car crash) you would find a series of seemingly random events that led to it. <br /> <br /> This is the answer! I forgot to bring an existentialist to explain Happenstance.
