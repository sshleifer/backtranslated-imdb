What kind of British cinema class! It was about time. And a comedy to share the party at the boot! Anyone looking to relive a bit of freedom from their bad youth, this road movie will prove the ticket. It's a mix between "Cunail and I" and "Easy Rider". The film runs at a solid pace and does not let you slip too much ... Sometimes there are reflexive moments, but I think they are well justified and add to the characters the actors portray. I was a little worried about Phil Daniels's character at first, but fortunately he was over halfway through what was one of the funniest scenes of the whole movie! Generally, I found my laughing laugh through the movie most likely disturbing some people around me. Oh, okay. I would recommend it altogether. It will become a cult British comedy. It's worth a visit.
