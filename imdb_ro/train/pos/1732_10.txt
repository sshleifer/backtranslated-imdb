"Sandra, Making a Woman" is one of the most important exploits, and this is for two reasons: (1) Monica Gayle's excellent and effortless performance and (2) the fact that Gary Graver was in charge of project. These two talents, both fairly undervalued, make "Sandra" a movie that should be seen. Another key element of the film's success is its realism - there is nothing fake or "Hollywood" about this film set in California. It's really a slice of life. Sandra's modest house at the beginning of the movie, simple dresses dressed by the character, the scene in which Sandra wakes up in the morning to find Uschi Digart jumping on the front door, and Sandra sits on the couch without - while Digart tries to selling some cosmetics, looking really like she had just (but still beautiful) awake, strange weird, Sandra, who likes to make love to her while wearing a brassiere that Sandra moves - all these elements of the film are all real, and as such, the viewer is attracted to Sandra's little world from the beginning and immediately becomes interested in her and wants her to succeed. Sandra also makes her case of free love with eloquence and dignity, and she gets off with a lot of class. This film could have easily failed in less competent hands and could have disappeared into any of the usual sexploitatic habits, but the Garver / Gale team ensures that "Sandra" is not just a woman's girl, but also realizing a excellent movie.
