I lost my father at a very young age. Actually, young man, I do not remember him. Years later I learned a lot about him. One of these things was that he loved the Westerners and that he was following Bonanza every Sunday night was an absolute ritual for him. I remember the final end of the show, at the age of eight, when the show ceased production in 1973. Watching this show over the years makes me closer to my lost father. It has all the elements to make a successful show: laughter, tears, the edge of the seat suspension, and even eaten you at times. the remembrance of the original round of the show, came shortly after the death of our beloved "Hoss" Cartwright, Dan Blocker. A special episode and the end of the closing credits threw a Blocker image and disappeared on black and I can also remind my oldest sister with a tear in the eye for that. I remember that as if it were yesterday. In the name of my late father, who is not here to say it himself, we love Bonanza. .
