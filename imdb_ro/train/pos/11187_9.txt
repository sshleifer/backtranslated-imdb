Pet Semmen (1989) 9/10 The Creed family moved to the small town of Ludlow. The family is made up of a father, Louis, a mother, Rachel, a Gage brother and a daughter, Ellen. They are gladly welcomed by Jud Crandall. Jud is 89 years old, and he could tell you all about Ludlow's history. Behind the Creed House, there is a path leading to a pet cemetery (Pet Signature). When Ellen wants to go see her, Jud takes his family on a trip. This is the beginning of hell for the Creed family. When Rachel and the children are gone, Ellen's Cat's Church dies. Jud thinks Ellen is not ready for the death of his cat, so he suggests Louis follow him on the path next to the pet cemetery. Jud says Ludovic about this burial site once used by the Micmac Indians. Louis buries the Church without the help of Jud. A few days later, the Church returns, alive, but out of hell. This movie was one of the two horror movies that could actually save me, except "The Exorcist." The greatest performance would be Zelda, Rachel's sister spinal meningitis or Victor Pascow, a ghost who tries to help creeds make the mistake of bringing back the things from the dead. the film plays an extravagant part. It is both sad and mysterious. It goes along with the wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> 9/10
