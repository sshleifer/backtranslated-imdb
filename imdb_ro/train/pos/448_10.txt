I think this movie is absolutely beautiful. And I'm not just about the amazing landscapes. It's about two unfortunate housewives in England who decide to rent an Italian castle to take a break from their family life that is not so happy. Finally, four women rented a seat together, all with different personalities and different reasons to be there. In this beautiful magic place they find the peace they want and, interestingly, that peace comes from reflections and interior resolutions, more than that. It also seems to me wonderful because of relationships that are developed in kindness and understanding. The actor is a joy to look at himself. I especially love the characters of Lottie (Josie Lawrence) and Lady Caroline (Polly Walker).
