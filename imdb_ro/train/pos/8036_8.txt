Some boys think the sniper is not good due to the fact that the action was not good enough. If you consider it an action movie, this view might be true because the part of action of this mob is not really interesting. However, I think this is a psychological drama rather than an action. The film told us mainly about the inside of two snipers who certainly had different personalities and different experiences. Tomas Beccket, who was a veteran and had 74 confirmed victims, seemed cold. However, after Beccket showed his day dream about Montana, we can clearly see his inner core. The cruel war and the sacrifice of its partners made Beccket become so called by the heart. Millar, on the contrary, was a new bookmark, a green hand and was not even qualified as a sniper. Billy Zane did pretty well to show him hesitation and fear of Millar when he first tried to "put a bullet through the heart" (as Beccket said). What he thought about the current suicide mission was that it could be easy to accomplish, and then he could safely return and receive the prize. These two guys were totally different in their personalities and I think the film has successfully shown the difference and the impact they had on them due to the difference between their personalities. These two snipers have quarreled, suspected each other and eventually came to an understanding through communication and what they did to help even save the other. The sniper is not a good action movie but a psychological good.
