I really liked Fight Girl. There's something I could always look at. The act was fantastic and I thought Michelle Rodriguez did a good job in the movie. Very convincing I could say. The film shows how women have to get up for what they want to do in life. He had so much compassion and yet so much hate at the same time. To treat an ignorant father did not help her too much. Even if she loved her, she was very ugly. Her mother died when she was younger and that made her sad. The love story was a part I really enjoyed in the movie. I felt the passion you had for each other. Then, again, the drama sets itself and then how to choose between her boyfriend and her long-lasting dream. I thought it was over. It was the kind of end to decide what happened in the future for them. For all those who like a sport-based video with a good plot, it would suggest that you check this
