This film was directed by Ruggero Deodato, a true icon for many fans of the horror film, after conducting the Cannibal Holocaust. However, do not expect to find such a notoriety in the movie reviewed here because it turns out to be incredibly impressive in comparison and plays more like a Conan inspired trip for a young audience. Such a description can instantly stop fans of the entire genre inspired by Connor's Sword & Sorcery, but before you turn your nose in this direction, it must be said that this movie is fun! laughs and lives two terrible and extremely pleasant heroes in the form of David and Peter Paul as well. barbarian brothers who seem to have a ball with their characters. Richard Lynch, the favorite of the B-Movie, presents himself as the main character in the play and is also great to see the roles for Big George Eastman and Michael Berryman. In addition, ladies are amazing to look at and adequately glitter hung throughout the film (a basic ingredient and very well received in the genre!) What can I say - this is simply a really fun and really fun game and I wholeheartedly recommend it!
