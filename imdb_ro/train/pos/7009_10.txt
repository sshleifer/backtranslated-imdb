I thought it was a great movie. It touches every fiber of a human being. The love of the film is very intense. I thought it was Will's best performance so far. Very good director. He enjoyed editing. The music was great. Easily use flashback. This is the kind of movie everyone should see. I hope people will get something wonderful from this. Overall, great movie. I think Hollywood should do more movies with substance. Even action movies can have a caretaking story. I like the fact that Will was very subtle in acting. He had a purpose and a dedication that is rare to see. I would suggest you look at it alone or with someone who really cares about you. For me, I discovered that the world stopped and my only focus was on the film. The outside world was suspended for a moment. It was a pleasant feeling with all this chaos that is happening in this world. And with this generation, I was great to see something (someone) care for other people more than himself.
