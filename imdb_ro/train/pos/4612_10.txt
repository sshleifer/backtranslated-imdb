Fred Gwynne, Al Lewis, Sid Caesar and Yvonne De Carlo star in this funny, funny movie. Fred Gwynne is truly wonderful as Herman Munster, who lives with his grandfather Munster (Al Lewis), wife Lily (Yvonne De Carlo) and his son and daughter. Sid Caesar is hilarious as the owner of a wax museum that has a whole section dedicated to the Munster family. When Herman's and grandfather's wax figures start to terrorize the city, everyone blames them. The two must clear their names before it's too late. You will laugh aloud as I did.
