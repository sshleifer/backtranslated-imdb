It's a superb Swedish movie .. it was the first Swedish movie I've seen .. it's simple and profound .. what a great combination! Michael Nyqvist has performed tremendously as a famous conductor seeking peace in his hometown. Frida Hallgren was great as his inspirational girlfriend to help him continue and never give up. The fight between the conductor and the hypocritical priest who loses his battle with Michael when his wife confronts him and defends Michael's noble cause to help people in his hometown find peace in music. The only thing I did not like was the end .. it was not that good, but it has a profound meaning.
