Convincing and innovative! At the beginning of this crime, Whoopi Goldberg writers draw a parallel between Theodore Rex and the classic Citizen Kane, Orson Welles, in 1941. Writers are entitled to draw such an apparently disparate parallel, but the visionary audience is too often harassed to see a Hop Hollywood too pleased to appreciate the subtle similarities between these two films. In "Citizen Kane", Charles Foster Kane is feared and admired by his colleagues and his subordinates, like Whoopi Goldberg in this film. This film aims to find love in the differences of all. It is an epic examination of the fear of abandonment and the need for love and acceptance in a society dominated by greed and self-absorption. Whoopi Whoopi Goldberg and Theodore Rex formulated a dyad for centuries, the only justified comparisons being Bogey and Bacall, Hepburn and Tracy and Hall and Oates. If you want to pursue a philosophical, uplifting celluloid examination of some of the deepest units of mankind; Bergman-esqe but not so depressing, Theodore Rex should be viewed immediately!
