A dying Kung Fu master sends his last student to discover what happened to the five previous students who were members of the Poison Clan clan banned. He has to see if he works for good and if he is not to stop the master, he also wants the student to find another clan member who has fled with the clan money the master wants to use for good. All students were taught in a different snake style, centipede, scorpion, lizard, frog, while the last student was taught little in every style. All students arrive in a city looking for the old man with all the money and soon everyone is struggling to get the money. The classic martial arts movie has the title that even many non-fans know. I talked to some occasional fans, and this seems to be the only movie in the head. It's a very good movie, though I'm not sure why this movie stays with people, when for my money there are other movies that are better in the Shaw studio (A Swordmen or Brave Archer Series, for example). This is not to sell the short film, no, since the film is structured like a mystery, our hero has no clue who is someone and the venoms themselves know best in the best of two of the others. He gave us the identity of four, but we still have to determine who is the fifth. The film is also strange in the fact that for a martial arts movie, other than a training session at first and killing the old man and his family for money, there really is no action for about 40 or 45 minutes . It's a bold move to do it, but it's paid since the plot and the shows keep your attention. (The film is also strange in being the first martial arts movie I think I've ever seen where there are no women. I do not think she has a speaking role and I'm pretty sure none of them the background is nothing, just something that hit me.) This is a good and solid film that can not live up to the reputation it has in some circles, but it's still a great movie to get stuck on the couch Yours <br /> About 7 out of 10.
