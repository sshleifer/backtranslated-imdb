What is taboo about love? People seem to have major problems with the transgenic ones. The title of this movie has not caught my eyes. It was a granular shot of about 4 minutes in the movie is what made me stop surfing the canals. I can not believe how stunning this movie was. She touches so many levels of human emotion she never did to move me in some way. It's by far one of the best independent movies I've ever seen. I did not see these characters as sex, but only human. I would recommend it to those who love movies. Independent films in particular. Praise all filming without fear!
