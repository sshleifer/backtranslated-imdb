An occasional, surrealistic thriller that pushes the buttons of most people. The 4th man will offend someone with a taste for the right policy. The protagonist of the story is a bisexual alcoholic Catholic writer, Gerard (Krabbe), with a feeling of seriously twisted imagination. Verhoeven offers up to Gerard has an example of everything that is wrong with modern man. He is embarrassed, delusional, unable to control his needs, afraid to commit himself to having meaningful and absolutely apathetic relationships for life in general. As the character himself declares at one point, he is a professional liar, incapable of remembering the truth. The film opens with Gerard dreaming of the spiders eating Christ and then waking up to the long march to his own destruction. It removes a man (probably a lover), then follows another at a train station. Later, in a conference, he meets a woman who seems to want to help him, maybe he has more bad plans. She catches Gerard on the internet, attracts him with sex and money, with a lot of both. She also has secrets, like three dead husbands. Is she alone and really looking for someone to feed - or is she a dead black widow, drawing Gerard to his death? Will Garard be the fourth man he kills? The woman is Christine (Soutendijk), and Verhoeven does everything she can to keep you up to what she's doing. This is an interesting movie, with many sexes and intrigue. It is similar to Verhoeven's basic instinct, but it has much more depth and is certainly more shocking. There is a lot of very strong gay content, which can make it hard for spectators. Highly recommended for intelligent intelligent thrillers or anyone looking for something completely new.
