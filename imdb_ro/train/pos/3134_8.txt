This was a well-written story about the achievement of Batman Sitcom and, in fact, brings our heroes together on a great journey and offers the history of TV shows. Unlike the documentary films of the Brady and Partridge family, we not only look at Adam's and Burt's past and present life, but we also get to see them back in action. Filmed with Kapow and Catwomen and Riddler (s), Batman is back well said, the story not only provides us a satisfactory closing on the Batman series, but fills modern fan in all the Hollywood stories about them, has been heard in 35 for years. <br /> <br /> Kudos !!!
