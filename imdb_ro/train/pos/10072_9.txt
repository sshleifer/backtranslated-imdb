An unexpected pleasure, because I did not hear anything about this movie. Intimidating because it has the purpose of having a wider audience. A wonderful human story, with a social message, said slightly, though, predictable in its resolution. Act firmly on the main ones. Beautifully photographed with floating gray colors that captures the nostalgic tone of the movie. My recent Chinese movie (Duh, The Road Home, Not One Less) was an interesting one that I hope to continue exploring. China and its people is an amazing cloth for filmmakers. "King of Masks" can be highly recommended as a starting point for anyone who is similarly interested in the recent Chinese film. <br /> <br />
