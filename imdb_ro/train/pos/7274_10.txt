No Strings Attached is one of the best performances of Carlos Mencia so far. Mencia is known for having struck and entertained racial problems. However, he does more than in this stand-up show, which took place in San Francisco. In general, Mencia's material not only makes you laugh, but makes you think of what is really wrong in today's society. In this performance, Mencia talks about things like illegal immigration, what women really mean when calling for equality in the workplace, terrorism, his opinion about Mel Gibson's Passion for Christ, and the argument that he entered a woman about the fact that Jesus is affected or not, and how society should be treated, those who are physically or mentally disabled. Mencia discusses whether or not someone should have the right to speak and say a joke. Carlos Mencia is not afraid to offend, which often challenges his critics. For example, he goes to some extent (and recognizes it) with a joke about Pope John Paul II and about what he most likely does in heaven right now. <br /> <br /> Mencia's main message in all its performances is that we all have a voice and that we should use that voice to talk about what we feel and not be afraid to offend. He reminds us that we have the right to free speech and that we must use this right as an American. If you enjoy this performance, I definitely recommend watching Mind of Mencia, your show on Comedy Central.
