King of Masks (China's Bian Lian) is a shockingly beautiful and deeply moving film. Winning 16 awards across the world, this true story film focuses on Wang Bianlian, a 1930s street artist in China, who is out of date but does not have the heir to pass on the art of changing his work. He has a unique talent of rapidly changing masks in performance, and no one knows how to do it. He has a desire to have a nephew because his art is a family heritage that can only be transferred to a male heir. Then we go down the streets and see that people sell their children because they can not afford to take care of them; some even beg for taking their daughters for free, because daughters do not deserve much in this society. Wang Bianlian's story continues from there. The movie was so amazingly good, the actor was amazing, and the issues were so heavy and well tackled. There is gender inequality and the depressing fact that nobody wants a girl at this moment and where they are. Also interesting to note is that the famous opera actor who always plays a woman and is known as a living Bodhisattva is a man who dresses like a woman and, while he is famous and respected, is considered a low and half woman. As we go further into the film, we face the problems of human slave trade and its demand, and therefore the lack of a possible solution for it, the brutality and corruption of the soldiers and policemen, the lack of power and the lack of power, every person can face due to unfortunate events or even good intentions. This is definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life, and Xu Zhu, the actor who plays Wang Bianlian, has another beautiful performance.
