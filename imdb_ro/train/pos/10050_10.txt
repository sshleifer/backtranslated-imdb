Daniell Steel Dance, a refreshing story. This film glorified the importance of the family and the importance of parents in the lives of their children. How rare is this? In these times, "Heather has two mothers" (or whatever you want, fill in the blanks), it's easy to see why this theme is not for everyone. As the father was prominent, we hoped there would be another Daniell Steel Saga. How disappointing it is to finish. Each character was important and he made a fabulous job that fulfilled his role. I would have liked to see every character developing over the years. I liked this movie, it's one that I will watch defiantly every time it's turned on. Good story, good action and I hope it's not a spoiler, but no disturbing sex or bad language. Yeah, it touched my heart. Watch out for Kleenex. What sad to me is that this part of family life is rarely described today in our entertainment, be it television or television. Movies. Daniell if your obedience, you go girl, gives us more.
