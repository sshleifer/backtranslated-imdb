This short Short Biography was so fun to watch. The second on disk one by D.W. Griffith's "Years of Discovery" DVD set (highly recommended) has three great shows by the top leaders, and it's interesting to see Henry B. Walthall (Little Colonel, Birth of a Nation) and other things. The husband's husband berserk at the betrayal of his wife and has a room with her paramour in the wall. It's incredible they will not hear the wall go up, but hey, maybe the wine has something to do with it. Here, Mr. Johnson (the silent player's father Raymond Hackett) wildly gesticulates and this adds to the melodrama, but in an unexpectedly comic way. The best moment comes to the end. As the lady moves from shock and fear, once she realizes she is convicted, Henry takes her instrument and "fans" over her. The way he did it was so unexpected and strangely sexy, and I just lost him and I laughed. Expression on his face! From that moment I was enchanted by Henry B. Walthall.
