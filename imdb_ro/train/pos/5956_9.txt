Yes, this is a low-budget movie. So the act is not a winning material, and sometimes the action is slowed down, because producers are filming longer sequences and not a million clips that are then edited in a movie. This film compensates for this with a remarkable scenario that takes vampirism seriously, explains and develops a complete plot of it. Apart from the vampire story, we obtain detailed, legal and lawful genetic information, martial arts actions, philosophical films, and good metal music. Kudos goes to Dylan O'Leary, the director / writer / lead actor. Beyond me, how this man could have accomplished all these roles and would do so well. I think that in order to appreciate this film, you have to be well versed in all sorts of themes to see that the writer has done a lot of research and knows all these things. There is also great room work, exciting room angles, and an underwater vampire attack - something I have not seen before, but that pays tribute to the underwater zombie attachment of Fulby's Zombie. Casting is good, as the sexy woman is really sexy. The main vampire also looks perfect for the role. The feminine victim seems vulnerable. My only complaint is that for a horror movie, there should have been more nudity. If you want to see an original vampire movie with a wonderful story, this movie is for you. I look forward to seeing future projects by Mr. O'Leary.
