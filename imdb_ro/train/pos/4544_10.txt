Okay, I know I do not like this movie, but I do that. From Pat Morita's pleasant interpretation of a Japanese stereotype to Jay Leno's annoying cry, I laughed along this film. As long as you keep in mind that this is not the best movie in the world, it's a good mv. My favorite party is for Morita to talk with his boss in Tokyo with a drink for about a second.
