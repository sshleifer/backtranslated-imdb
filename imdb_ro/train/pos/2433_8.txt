I was about 12 years old when I saw this classic cartoon "Casper the Friendly Ghost". Apparently it was an early one, because Casper did not show * correctly * in the same way that Porky Pig does not look good * in old cartoons of the 1930s. But I broke up ... Anyway, this episode of life after the death of the ghosts makes him become friends with a young hunt called Ferdie. I remember being happy to see Casper have a friend, because those who watched cartoons will not know that most people are running away from him, screaming "A Ghost!" Casper and Ferdie have fun together until no one else appears ... I do not like to leave you with a semi-spoiler, but the cartoon has only seven minutes, so you can not be too ambiguous. In addition, anyone reading the IMDb synopsis of the cartoon can deduce what's going on ... The end is a little awkward. In fact, it's probably the saddest thing I've ever felt to see a cartoon. But that only means I moved, which probably explains why I decided to write a comment about this particular cartoon and not many others. Or, damn, the fact that I REALLY CHOOSE this cartoon is due to its emotional effect on me - I have not seen it since then. But the cartoon ends on an optimistic note, and I was thrilled to see Casper and Ferdie again. I would give this cartoon 8 out of 10 stars. Second, just to the Warner Bros. cartoon "Peace on Earth," this is the most I've ever hit an animated shortcut.
