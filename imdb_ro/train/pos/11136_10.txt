"Midnight Cowboy" is one of those movies that has been proclaimed a masterpiece for good reason - it is indeed one of the best movies ever made in America. It is valid from an artistic point of view, but it is completely accessible and commercial. No wonder it was a great success when it was first released. But be warned, it's also one of the most innovative movies ever made. Characters are memorable, well-developed and, ultimately, tragic. Manufacturers should be applauded because they did not end the Hollywood, which was basically mandatory in the 1980s. However, that's why I cherished the years 1967-1977 for the American film. It's time to make well-made, innovative films and, above all, the big budgets that Hollywood could offer. It all ended until Star Wars was released. John Schlesinger's direction is doing material work. It combines a simplistic style with some experimental edits. Unlike many other movies featuring these psychedelic effects, "Midnight Cowboy" aged quite well. It was as strong now as when it was originally released. However, acting is what makes it a masterpiece. The background of the characters is never fully explained, but the performances make them fully developed. Both Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are absolutely memorable and sympathetic (despite the sometimes reprehensible actions). In addition, being a fan of vintage epic films, I liked the scenes on 42nd street, all in all. "Midnight Cowboy" is close to being perfect and one of the most powerful movies ever made. (10/10)
