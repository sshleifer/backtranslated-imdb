I really enjoyed this thriller! I wanted to see it again as soon as it was over. The cast was excellent, the script was suspense and fun and it was just a nice movie! I think this is one of the best thrillers I've ever seen! The girls in her were really pretty, especially Denise Richards. She was very ornery throughout the movie and gave the character something OOMPH!
