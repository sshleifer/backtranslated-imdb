"Capitale de Abril" is very good. The story is not a documentary about the 1974 revolution in Portugal. But it gives us an idea of ​​how it was. The fiction of the story is not of great interest, but it does not destroy the film. Captain Salgueiro Maia's heroic actions are not exaggerations, and the film is also a tribute to his deeds. Captain Salgueiro Maia remains one of the greatest heroes of the April 25th Revolution. All the actors are very good and even the smallest roles are played awesome. Lisbon looks beautiful like never before. Do not miss! I really enjoyed this movie.
