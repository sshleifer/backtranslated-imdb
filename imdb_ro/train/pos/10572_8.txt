I have the feeling that Warners Bros Depression musicians will become much more relevant in the coming years. Yes, we are in the economic depression (or you lived under a cliff) and the times were bleak. But we always have movies as a way to get rid of our problems. In the 1930s, the film was extremely popular even at the height of the economy. "Footlight Parade (1933)" was such a movie that the audience gathered. While this musician directed by Lloyd Bacon does not capture the social problems of time quite well, as he does, "Gold Diggers of 1933 (1933)," is still a wonderful showcase of talent. We have to wait until the end of the movie for the three extravagant Busby Berkely numbers, but guys deserve to wait for me. Yes, the little Ruby Keeler is a terrible singer and actress, and her touch is so, but Busby's "By A Waterfall" magician makes her and what seems to be a hundred other choir girls, a wonderland wonderland. Of course, Busby's numbers could not really be done on a scene (they defy the limits of gravity for one thing) and they are terribly contrasting with the realism of the non-musical, painful scenes. And "Footlight" also has James Cagney in one of his musicals (too much, what can not this man do?). He even gets to take the lead, sell his clothes and lose the Shanghai Lil sexpot (which is really little Ruby in the Chinese wig!). He collaborates with Joan Blondell, his adorable secretary, who Cagney somehow looks for in favor of other women (up to the last drum that she is). It looks like Blondell was the only woman Cagney loved, besides his wife. And you can see mutual adoration in every scene.
