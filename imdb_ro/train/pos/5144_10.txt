This very strange movie does not look like anything made in the West at that time. With his tumultuous emotions and a sense of vision, dreams and stunning images, his effect is so beautiful and unsettling. Actors are more choreographed than dancing than acting. It contains the only dream sequence that I know is like a real nightmare (I'm sorry, Dali fans).
