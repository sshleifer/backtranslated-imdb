This is undoubtedly the best documentary ever produced, providing a correct and epic description of the Second World War since the invasion of Poland in 1939 until the end of the 1945 war. Frankly and to the limit, the documentary presents opinions from both sides of the conflict, offering a very human face to the war. At the same time, the tactics and importance of battles are not overlooked, many things have been put into giving a detailed picture of the war and, in particular, the high, low and turning points in allied wealth. Being a British produced documentary, this part of the 26-party series focuses mainly on the UK, but the contribution of Russia and America is not reduced over this is just such a benefit of a series of such lengths. Another dignified statement is the score, the music and the whole documentary feeling is one of turbulence, struggle and perseverance. As a film, this series leaves the viewer no doubt about the difficulties faced by the Allies and Germans during the war, building a climax at the end of each episode, which serves to strengthen the edge of the Second World War. After watching all 26, the spectator is left with extensive war knowledge and amazed at how much we owe to members of the previous generation.
