I really liked this movie. The act was great as the plot. Jeff Combs has more talent than is recognized. The only part of this movement that I would change was the end. The death of the creature was far too awful for the Sci Fi Channel. There have been some interesting religious messages in this movie. Jeff Combs clearly interpreted a Messiah figure, and the creature (or the shark if you prefer) represented the antihist. There were some particularly frightening scenes that had that "end of the world". I noticed this only after seeing the third part of this classic creature feature. I know many people will not get references to Christianity, but if you look close, you will receive it.
