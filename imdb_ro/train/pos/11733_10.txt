Elvira Mistress of the Dark is exactly that, a mixture full of fun, sexual attraction, horror and comedy, all cast in a black dress cut down and pinned with a black deer hairstyle. This movie is sure to delight any fan of Elvira. She takes you up and in person with Elvira and deep wells in her ... I'm past revealing enormously ... her ancestor. The film takes you on a walk with Elvira as she goes from TV Horror to Mosteza Hostess to her hometown of Fallwell Mass to claim her inheritance from a deceased aunt. Where a clumsy city meets, a cinema owner, a creepy uncle who seems to be after her for more than she looks good. A bunch of high school kids who love her right now and a city council who will do everything to get her out of town, even if it means burning it at stake! Follow Elvira to beat the children, let her go, avoid her great uncle and nudge him in the eyes of those who have no good words for her in Elvira Mistress of the Dark! Elvira would say, "I guarantee it will be a scream!" (Cry in the background) Okay, I did not know it was a gas!
