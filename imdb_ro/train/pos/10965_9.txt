Little Edie and Big Edie are characters that anyone can feel compassionate about. Even if their home was dirty, this is somewhat understandable given their mental illness. On the message board, a poster wrote that "Little Edie has eight-year coping skills." This reminded me of the fact that, in the dramatic version of 2009, Big Edie tells Little Edie: "If you're stuck, it's just you!" These women had everything; beauty, talent, intelligence, firm belief in their opinions and actions. Perhaps if Little Edie had not been so strong for herself, for the first time when things did not happen, losing her hair, work and the love of her life, she would have succeeded. This is somehow related to what I think is her mental illness: her inability to rise up in difficult moments and to see that good times are ahead. The world will never know what happened if she did not listen to her mother's request: "Come home, Edie! Let me take care of you!" Still, these miserable women have somehow been brilliant, full of heart and pleasant, even in their extremely dirty house. These women were extraordinary, and the interaction between them brings humor and sadness. When Edie had one of her emotional defects, living about what she might be, or how she wanted to get out of the house because she felt like a little girl, she wanted an intense desire to embrace her and tell her that "everything will be ok!
