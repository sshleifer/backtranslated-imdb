They have not seen this film since 1958 in a very long time and enjoyed a lot of Kim Novak playing Gil Holroyd who is a witch and has an aunt named Queenie Holroyd who is also a witch and Gillian has a black brother called Nick played by Jack Lemmon. When Gillian looks at her eyes, Shep Henderson (James Stewart), who is engaged in a girl, will marry; Gillian interprets magical spells with a cat and changes his mind about the intentional bride and then becomes very full of desire and falls in love with Gillian. The story says a real witch can not fall in love, roar or cry, and this is starting to prove a big problem between Shep and Gillian, so Nick and Aunt Queenie have decided they have to do something about it. Great film to see again and again a great classic film of 1958.
