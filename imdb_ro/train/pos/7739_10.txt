Did you ever read Jim Thompson? It is hot noir, with the greatest fatalism and misanthropy I have ever encountered. There are rarely private detectives in his work - just losers, psychotic and small con artists. This movie has Thompson with a nail - "If God made real mistakes in this world, it was in giving us the will to live when we have no excuse for it." Every character in the film is balancing a ragged edge between surreal and creepy realism. There is Uncle Bud, played by Bruce Dern and Doc Goldman, played by George Dickerson. Jason Patric gives a wonderful, often heartfelt interpretation, like Kid Collins, an ex-fighter who is not too bright and shy and who is more scared than himself. Rachel Ward is Fay, sexy fatal females we can not figure out ... It's not your standard noir movie, it's not meant to be. After Dark My Sweet, along with The Grifters, there are two great adaptations of the Romanians by one of my favorite writers, Jim Thompson.
