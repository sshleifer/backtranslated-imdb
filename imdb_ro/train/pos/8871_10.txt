This was a great movie that had a lot of lying topics. She dealt with racist and class problems. But he also had a message to know you and take responsibility for you. This movie was very profound and gave the message about it, and only you can control your destiny. It has also shown that knowing and confidentiality with who you are is the only way to ever fit into society. What others think about you is not important. I think this movie has done a great job to show it. The actors believe they managed to convey every wonderful character. I just thought it was amazing how deep this movie was. At an amazing look, you did not see how deep the movie is, but on a more important look see the underlined meaning of the movie.
