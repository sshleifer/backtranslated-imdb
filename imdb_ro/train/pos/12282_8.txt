At first I did not like that much, though I did. They did not include the third generation Trueba, the love between Blanca and Pedro was not well explained and some actors were too different from what I imagined. Later I realized that if the movie were more loyal to the book, it would have been five hours and it would be a little boring. Now I like it very much, because my favorite characters are there as I portray them. Clara really looks like an Angel in Life, and her introduction to the story at the beginning of the movie was fantastic, loyal and short. Glenn Close is Ferula. I imagined it so, but not in mourning the whole thing. Esteban finds enough. I never liked his character, and though I was interested in him, I hated him a lot, especially when I hit Clara. As in the book, the last part is the most interesting and has a real history too. The film is very good, especially since it was a gringo movie based on a Latin American book. It's amazing how many famous stars are there, do not you think that?
