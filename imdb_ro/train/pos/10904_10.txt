The most moving and truly eye-opening document ever created. I cried out all the way from start to finish. Watching the show, you are immediately captured by a man's struggle to live without pain, to live a life we ​​take as a property. The first time I heard the title, I was almost afraid to see the program, it was hard for me to understand that I live in agony every day of every year of my life. I really felt for him. The saddest part of the documentary is when Jonny removes his coffin. Can you imagine doing this? Even more, even if he was in painful and unbearable pain, he still opened a charity. (DEBRA) Jonny is one of the only people who deserve true respect and admiration, he is the definition of a role model, a true and incontestable hero!
