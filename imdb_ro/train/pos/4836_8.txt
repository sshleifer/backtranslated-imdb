I saw the movie a few days ago on a video tape and even if it was hard to swallow at one time (due to length and story) I liked it a lot. I was impressed first through the script and then doing this scenario. The movie takes you on a walk, but this is not a light, joyful walk; passes through different political times and regimes and shows their influence on the lives of ordinary people. What I liked was the inner logic followed by the film; logically, which, like the logic of life, was rather illogical and sometimes confusing, but eventually, when I thought about it, all the events and upheavals made sense. It does not make sense to try to resume the story as it spreads in more than 50 years. I really liked the character of Nikita Mihalkov, Aleksei, and the way he played it, as some critics have seen, with an uneasy abandon. What I did not like was that I think he later played characters that remind me of Aleksea in films such as "Cruel Romance" (Zhestokij romans, which I really love) and to some extent in "The Insulted and The injured "(" Unizhennye i oskorblyonnye "). "Sibiriada" shows, I think, what a great filmmaker Andrei Konchalovski was before going to Hollywood and making ugly films such as "Tango and Cash" and less forgetting as "Runaway train". I would prefer "Kurochka Ryaba" to them ...
