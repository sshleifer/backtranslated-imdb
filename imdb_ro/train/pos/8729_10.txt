Bug's Life is a very good animated feature. This movie is for younger children, but it is also a wonderful movie for my age people. The story is about an ant named Flik. It caused a collision when it destroyed the food for the locusts. He gets exiled and needs to find bigger bugs to solve the mess. This movie is a classic because it's a good movie and it's a Pixar movie. The animation is brilliant especially for the late 1990s. The story is good, but a little more detailed would be enough. The voice actor is as good as most animated movies. Music is nice to listen to. Nothing special but he won a nomination for one of the music categories. On the whole, this movie hit me like a treer. This is a good movie for all families. I rated this 10/10 movie.
