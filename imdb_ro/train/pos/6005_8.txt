Although this movie is somewhat disinfected (because it was done at a time when people did not talk about sex), it is a short film extremely useful to show the prepubescent girls so they know what to expect during menstruation. Not surprisingly, it was paid by Kotex, although what many can surprise is that Disney made this film - because they made a lot of educational films in the 1940s and 1960s. However well done the film is, though, I think the film producer missed a real opportunity. Instead of the nice voice of the narrator and the relatively soft visuals, it would have been EXCELLENT if he had used Minnie Mouse and the rest of the Disney tape! I know this would give an old Walt a heart attack, but that would be a great movie! By the way, although the notion of sex is barely targeted in the film, it adequately explains menstruation in general. However, I miss some details (especially about sexual intercourse) which I suppose have been included in the accompanying brochure. Now, if I can figure out why I saw a cartoon about menstruation.
