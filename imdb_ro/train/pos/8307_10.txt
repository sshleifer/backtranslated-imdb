Tressa's voice performance was remarkable! Tressa played the singer, while Richard was in the club. When he first stepped out on the stage and began to rifle and ruin his stuff, he made me tremble. Her voice is platinum. He has to make a CD. She has more fans when she realizes. I liked the spectacle of stopping the show in the five beatings of her heart, which she also played with Leon when she was younger. How can a little girl have such a big voice. She is truly amazing. Good sound Good Good Good voice Good voice voice excellent voice voice fantastic, back trembling, crying tears, uplifting, take you back in the voice of the day. Tressa if you read this committee, please take my advice and start recording a CD. If not just for love to sing, but also for your fans. I think you can really do it. Look at these other singers in one studio, lol.
