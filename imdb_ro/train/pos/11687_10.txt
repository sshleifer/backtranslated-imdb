My love for Chris Rock varies from his films, I hate him for Lethal Weapon 4, but I hated everyone in that movie after him. I like him when he himself and does not keep back, as in Dogma. Well, this is his best yet, did not expect this to be so good. He's got my ass up all the time. Chris Rock offers a wonderful, cute tale, supported by some of the funniest comedies I've seen for some time. I liked.
