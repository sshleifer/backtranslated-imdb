Kurt Russell, whose career began when he hit Elvis Real in "Happened" at the World Trade Fair, will probably never be in the top of his performance as a king in this biopic, accompanied by the siret and the shock of Meister Carpenter. There are times when you feel you're following Elvis until something returns you to reality ... maybe memories of an unfortunate Don Johnson in Elvis and Queen Beauty? All the shows here are excellent: Hubley Season as Priscilla, Pat Hingle as Colonel, and even Shelley Winters brings an adequate level of nerves and hysteria to Momma Presley's play. Kurt Bing's father plays here Elvis Vernon's father, and there's a fine understatement by Robert Gray as a friend and guardian of Elvis Red West. <br /> <br /> You have to watch rock n roll fans.
