The musical jam without Meanwhile, with Gene Kelly in top shape, elegant direction of Vincente Minnelli and wonderful musical numbers. It's great fun from the beginning to the end, one of those movies people are watching with a smile and say "do not do as they did!" But they never did. The 25-minute musical sequence with no dialogue is among the most beautiful in the history of the film. Magic movie, clearly derived from the heart and soul of all involved. I need to see!
