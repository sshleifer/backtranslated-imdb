A meteorite descends from the sky and a plesiosaur that has long used to terrorize the area around Lake Crater. As the monster eats the locals, they try to find it far from killing monsters. Recent attempts to send horror films and science, such as Lost Skeleton of Cadavra and Alien Trespass, feature films like Crater Lake Monster available for screening. It's kind of a movie that those movies make to get out and just send this is the real deal. It's all that movies try to be just with tongue in cheek and much more fun because of it. This is a true unity - a kind of movie that had the unfortunate luck to come as Star Wars changed the way we look at the special effects. The monster, a mix of stop motion and a life-size head, is a charming weird beast. Those who create the movie destroy the audience with frequent photographs of the monster and its chaos. Sure it is clear that all her fake, but not movies about the suspension of mistrust? In fact, I think about really cold monsters, what has this. I like this movie in a low-budget way, in a way. If you want real authenticity in the monster movie, stop looking. This would be perfect for a double or triple feature with monster-like films (Boggy Creek etc.)
