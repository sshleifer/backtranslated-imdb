He has seen this on the Sundance Channel a few years ago and received a nice kinematic blow to the system. A semi-surrealist, but loud approach to modern (or lack of) media culture, focusing on marginalized people beyond hollywood. He had a funny early interpretation from Mark Ruffalo and a series of memorable cinemas from DP that made the Polish Brothers movies. There was a humorous, humorous humor and an original strange feeling that completely determined him. This movie had a classic worship written everywhere, and I'm surprised it's not yet on DVD. <br /> <br /> We hope that soon.
