There were some moments of reality describing modern life (not only in Japan, but everywhere). It shows how overwhelming the culture is and that they want to burst out of the mold she created for you. Dance was just a vehicle to say, "Do what you like even if it's against the norm." Rather Billy Elliot as I say. I liked the movie too. <br /> <br /> The humor was well-programmed and the emotional moments felt so real that you could feel the embarrassment between Sugiyama and his wife, tantras in the dance hall. I loved Aoki - he and his wig and excitement on the dance floor just made me cry! The actors did a great job, the story was well written. I saw her the second time and I caught some tiny shades we lost at the first view. Have fun!
