I found this movie exciting from the very beginning - like a Spielberg movie - and found the intrigue intrigue as I tried to figure out what the current situation is. begins - before the opening of credits - the action begins, bringing with it an immediate suspense. The two main characters are very collapsible. (I have no problems with any of Baldwin due to Alec's extra-curricular political activities, but William was not too bad in this movie.) There were some extremely unexpected upheavals that contributed to joy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there were many places where there was an enormous sound in the soundtrack - something like 19K Hz. I suspect the microphone is picking up video monitors on the set.
