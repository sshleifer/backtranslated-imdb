This movie was great. A sad truth about how culture tends to collide with sex. This is just a big hot fuzzy type of film. You have the master who is animated in tradition and kindly in his own way, Doggie, despite being a girl to win her affections and defeating her with a nice monkey with a thousand facial expressions. This is equal to the great happy film in the end. This movie does a good job to show how rich in tradition it can be, so excited that she is willing to die without sharing her secrets. You will see the sides of a culture that has not been seen before and which helps to improve the drama that unfolds near the end of the picture. Cinematographic photography is excellent, especially the opening sequence with all the sparks. Tied to being in the Oscar for the best foreign film.
