How can someone NOT like this movie ??? This movie is so good that in the first week I saw it on the shelf at the video store was stolen ... BEST Horror Movie Ever !!! .... I mean, it took Carrot and he ... you know HAHAHA .. How is NOT funny? The only movie that comes close to reaching this is the Chucky bride and that was great!
