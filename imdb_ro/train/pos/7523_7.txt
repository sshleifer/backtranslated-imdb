I saw this movie at the 2006 Palm Springs International Film Festival and it's a movie and not a movie because it was apparently shot by HBO to be broadcast on the cable network sometime this year. This film presents the page as a fetish and fetish discipline and a B & D film actress who has enough talent to become a true actress. The page was a bit more than that, and the film refers to some of its modeling roles, but it is not enough to balance the icon's career for 50 years. This movie is supposed to be based on Richard Foster's "The Real Bettie Page". He is shot in black and white for nostalgia in the 1950s. I have a book called "Bettie Page Life of a Legend" that has a lot of wonderful pictures that characterize the page career and I have to say that this film reproduces on the film with Gretchen Mol as Page , many of the best-known shots with accuracy. Mol with wig contact lenses and brown lenses Bettie Page is Bettie Page. Not only has the look of Bettie Page, but it has the smile and the characteristics of his personality, who came through the perfect room. And her body is just as close to a replica of Pag. Wonderful casting. The story is rather thin and tabloid and could have been much better. But this is a pretty good movie. I would give you a rate of 7.0 on a scale of 10 and we recommend seeing it when it comes to television.
