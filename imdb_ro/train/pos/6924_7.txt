This complicated western was a milestone in JAMES STEWART's career after returning from war, wishing to change his image by making a vest that is largely considered to be a reason for the influx of Westerners in the 1950s, because it is very impressive. Too bad he was not photographed in Technicolor. Stewart wins the first prize for the "West Wing Gun", but then he has to spend the rest of the movie trying to recover it when stolen. SHELLEY WINTERS is a shady pit with an unpleasant reputation, and STEPHEN McNALLY is the evil local kidnapper in Dodge City. GEER is Wyatt Earp, and DAN DURYEA is Shelley's evil lover. And you did not know that as a Universal-Universal movie, TONY CURTIS and ROCK HUDSON (both quite unknown at the time) have small roles. An interesting sequence is the first Indian attack, through which CHARLES DRAKE reveals himself to be a coward who leaves, leaving Shelley alone in his horse-drawn wagon. He redeems later, but it is just one of the twists and turns that have the gun going from one unpleasant hand to another - but eventually ends up with the rightful owner. STEPHEN McNALLY and JAMES STEWART have quite a final shots, which is almost as melodramatic (but not enough), as was the end of DUEL IN THE SUN. McNally makes the perfect bastard and DAN DURYEA is as treacherous as he played in the 1940s as a low-life gunman. The well-built story is extremely well directed by Anthony Mann and it's fun to see ROCK HUDSON (credited as Young Bull) wearing Indian war paint and TONY CURTIS as a young soldier who craves desire at Shelley Winters, so thin and appealing. <br /> <br /> It was worth watching and definitely a story above average.
