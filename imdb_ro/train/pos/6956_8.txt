I have to say that Uma Thurman is the sexiest woman on the planet. this movie was cute uber and I mean nice uber. It had all the "sexual" content that most of Ivan Reitman's comedies have, but with something extra, CHEMISTRY. Uma and Luca both have that foreign, but credible chemistry that seems to transcend in every scene. Both seem to create this strange, twisted and interesting relationship with a strong "sexual" tension that you laugh until you can not feel your face anymore. Anna Farris and the other distributors support seem to play perfectly the roles of others and even the rather small role of Wanda Sykes will make you laugh. Although these kinds of comedies are not for everyone, but I have to say that I went with a person who does not usually enjoy these movies and he laughed like a fool. This movie is certainly not for everyone. especially younger children, since some moments are too small ... well, say ADULT for younger viewers. Generally, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, it's hard that the end we found was a little weak compared to the rest of the movie. (3 1/2 * of 5 *)
