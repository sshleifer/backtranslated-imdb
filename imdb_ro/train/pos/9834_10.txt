Yeah, sure it's not Zombie, but it's not that bad either. Has Beatrice Ring, which is a huge bonus and is fun. I was lucky to meet Fulci later in his career and remained philosophical about this experience because he was never completely satisfied with her. It's good that it's worth a search, especially for fans of the genre and Fulci. It is a film that is too often removed from the hand.
