Somewhat too long and over the end, this comedy is an absolutely delightful, never condescending or ridiculous view of the problems of a "man of power" who likes to wear women's clothes for threads. <br /> <br /> Julie Walters is beautiful as always, but Adrian Pasdar is absolutely credible and steals the movie. He (she) is absolutely superb in high heels and silk stockings.
