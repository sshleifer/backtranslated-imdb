Fox's epic story about one of America's greatest pioneering efforts comes on DVD with some truly remarkable extracts. BRIGHAM YOUNG ("The Frontiersman" was added for the European version), telling the story of the great pioneer leader who inspired the inspiration of members of the Mormon faith (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) in Salt Lake 1847, after the mobs had killed their prophet / leader Joseph Smith (played by Vincent Price) was brought to screen in 1940 just as America was about to enter the Second World War. There was a bold move on Fox's head, Darryl F. Zanuck, and it was a breath of fresh air for the Mormon people, because this was the first attempt to positively show faith on the screen. Now, Fox, working with James D'Arc, curator of the excellent artistic films at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, brought this DVD movie to an extraordinary edition. Mr. D'Arc, who a few years ago made his doctoral thesis on the film, offered one of the deepest comment tracks he ever made on a DVD. He separates this fact from fiction and allows listeners to understand why these films have been so much appreciated by church leaders, even if the perfection of truth takes place throughout the film. One of the jewels of information deals with Dean Jagger, the actor who plays the lead role. A few years after the film, she married a woman from the last centuries and eventually converted to the LDS faith. There are many things to learn from D'Arc's knowledge and it's great to have this as part of the DVD! There are over 100 images of the Fox & BYU archives included on the disc, plus the incredible recordings of the seven premieres in Salt Lake City. Thanks FOX for another great DVD - and thank you, James D'Arc for your great comment!
