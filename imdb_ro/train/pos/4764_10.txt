There are some comments about this movie that say he is a bad and bad guy and such an excellent actor like Pierre Fresnay should not have been willing to act on it. I think, quite the opposite, that even when the movie is weird and has some deficiencies, Pierre Fresnay's performance is so great that it converts the film into an excellent movie. Its performance is probably the best in history. <br /> <br /> The film itself has a very controversial scene about the consecration of cabaret wine. For someone who does not think a priest? even one defrocked ?? can convert it into the blood of Christ, the scene is perhaps bizarre. But for someone who has been raised in a Catholic setting, it is very emotional even if it is quite unpleasant. The death scene of the youngest priest is extremely shocking. But it's very well done. Pierre Fresnay turns the crazy act of murder into something easy to understand in the temporal madness of his character, the tortured Morand defrock, which, in this terrible way, returns to duty.
