This is a great show and will make you cry, this group of people who really love real life and shows from time to time. Send me an email and let's talk. I was in Australia and they really talk like that. I want you to enjoy Five Mile Creek and send these wonderful stories about good and evil and friendship with your children. I have all 40 episodes on DVD-R that I have collected over the last 5 years. See the Five Mile Mile tribute from www.mikeandvicki.com and listen to the extensive thematic music. Let's talk about them. These people are so cool!
