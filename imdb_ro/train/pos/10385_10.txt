It's been a while since I watched this movie and the series, but now it revives my memory! This was a very funny movie based on the classic series! Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott were hilarious together. Bo and Luke Duke help Uncle Jesse to lead Moonshine to General Lee. When Boss Hogg forces Ducks from their farm, Bo and Luca sneak around Hogg's local construction site and find coal samples. Soon, they realize that Boss Hogg will unleash Hazzard County, unless the dukes can stop him, with the help of their nice cousin, Daisy. My only problems with the film were that Burt Reynolds was not right for Boss Hogg's side, and Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane was too serious. Besides, I strongly recommend DUKES OF HAZZARD !!!
