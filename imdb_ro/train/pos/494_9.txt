This is the start of a new and exciting Star Trek series. She has a "land" - a sensation with darker and less "plagiarism" scenography. Characters need more time to grow, but they have the potential. One thing that is quite disappointing (with all the Star Trek series) is that they present such a grim picture of equality between men and women in the future when they paint a very positive image of anything else. (Earth stopped war, famine, etc.) The female characters are two, T'Pol subcommander, who is the human volcano and communications officer Hoshi. Hoshi is pretty sad and T'Pol is made to be a volcanic babe. Some crew attitudes feel a little too American (unlike the TNG crew) but create an exciting dynamic. A very good pilot, though for a very good series.
