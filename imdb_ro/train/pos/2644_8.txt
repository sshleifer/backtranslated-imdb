I do not know what it means to be so excited about this movie, but the first time I saw it, I wanted to see how it ended. I'm not a big fan of Paul Winfield or war drama, but I really wondered how and when Winfield would find his baby. All he knows is that the boy has green eyes. The truth is that I have not seen this movie for years and it has not been featured on television in a while, but this film is somewhat a man's aftermath of the pain of the war. Winfield presents a very sympathetic portrait and heater of the heart of a man lost by his memories. There is an underlying message in this film that he is looking for the latest fragment of human morality following this war and the reality he faces. Why this movie is not yet on DVD or video is a mystery to me.
