This, and the "hidden city" are those Kurosawa that are most dear to me. I do not give 10 as candy, but that's certainly worth it if there's anything. Even though he's long enough (like Kurosawa's pretty much), he's got the problem that bothers me with most of his movies; the story is often too free and slow, containing scenes that are unnecessary or too long without a real purpose for the story or description of the character. Dodesukaden gave me the same experience as, for example, "The hidden city"; Despite its length, there was no minute I'd cut it off. It is also an unusual film Kurosawa in a way, has no story, but many independent stories that rely more on the description of the character than on the story, unlike any other Kurosawa film we have seen so far . It also relies heavily on the dialogue it uses brilliantly (especially in the story between father and son planning their "new home"). Everything that makes this a masterpiece is how the subject is so tragic it is, it is able to be described so human and sympathetic, without indicating anyone's fingers at all times. From the beginning to the end, she offers the entire emotional scale from laughter to tears in perfect balance.
