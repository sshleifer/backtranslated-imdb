Congratulated, furious and implausible, Fay Grim is tough to stand, but Parker Posey is indeed the only actress who could take this story and do it with her. She touches once, funny, cunning. Supporting actors are also committed to this. I'll even try to tell you the plot. Includes characters from Hartley's Henry Fool and tries an international espionage story. <br /> <br /> The movie works well if you continue with it - understanding is. in a sense, completely ridiculous. She becomes more and more ridiculous as you join. (I opposed the temptation to disable the DVD twice). Fay Grim demands an adventurous movie that wants to handle something that is not a cutter. Finally, it offers something that defies the description.
