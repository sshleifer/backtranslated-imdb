I just saw this movie on Turner Classic Movies last night and was dismissed by Victor McLaglen's performance: in every sense of the word "power tour". The Dublin atmosphere of 1922 evoked through cinematography and production design has pretended with truly techniques used in the best film nights of the 40s and early 50s. Very nice attention to detail, also during the awakening of Frankie McPhillip (Wallace Ford) galic. Max Steiner's score is unforgettable. As in later films, such as the GWTW of 1939, he has mastered popular ballads to give local color and a sense of place and time. John Ford: already a film giant in 1935!
