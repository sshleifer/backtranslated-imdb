OK, so the Soldier is not deep and significant as the Blade Runner or a budget so big as Terminator 2, but overall it seemed quite pleasant to me. That Kurt Russell remained in character and is practically not speaking without emotion made his burst moments when humanity all the more painful. I found my portrayal restricted emotional development more exciting than the movies Arnie T (and prior to receiving comments yes, I know that Arnie was a cyborg and Kurt was human, but the premise presented by both films was the same)> <br /> So , the film itself, a reasonable American / British distribution is able to reveal this little story. Not sure if Gary Busey and his two deputies were bad or good, so he could not decide whether I liked it or not. The colony was slightly more realistic, no wrong bunch of peace-loving patients / răguşitori / Lasica were deleted after departure or a group of terrorists, subversives aggressive, paranoid about the world around us and each other. Kurt Russell is good and unlike other reviews, I do not think this will have a negative impact on his career (unlike Escape from LA - sequels are creatures so miserable!). Sean Pertwee really did his father's pride late, continuing the noble family of the Sci-Fi family. And the rest of the play has helped this pathetic career of people who have done the most of a bad situation and did not do too bad. If you see this on your television program, I'd recommend giving it a chance. I do not think you will be disappointed.
