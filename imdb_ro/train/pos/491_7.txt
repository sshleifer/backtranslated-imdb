Take 4 couples whose relationships are already on the rocks and put them on a paradise of the island where they will be tempted by 26 lonely ones. This was the premise of the show, simple but frightening and funny. Let Fox throw the morality off the window and leave the flow of despair. It was like a real version of Melrose Place. The best thing about the show is that it was not people who persuaded and manipulated for a cash prize. It was about lust and temptation, just the last test for a relationship. People either love the show, or they hate it. It was like slowing down to look at a horrible traffic accident. You know you do not have to look, but you can not help looking. Drama aside, it was a lot of eye candy.
