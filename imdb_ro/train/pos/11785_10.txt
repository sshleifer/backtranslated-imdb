I do not know exactly how to explain the "Dark Room" because, to summarize, it would not really be right. It's a short Lynchian short film with two pretty girls in a strange, mysterious situation. I would say that this short is certainly more at the end of Lynchian Spectrum "Mulholland Drive", unlike "The Elephant Man" or "The Straight Story". It's hidden on Lynch's site, and it's worth it.
