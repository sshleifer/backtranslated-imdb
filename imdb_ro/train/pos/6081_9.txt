Do not become darker or more tragic than "Othello," and this movie captures the play quite well, with remarkable performances by Lawrence Fishburne and Irene Jacob. "Fishburne's" expresses Othello's torment, as he falls prey to Iago's lies very convincingly, even giving a realistic epileptic episode. Jacob is the loving and loyal wife, which becomes either the instrument of Iago's revenge against Othello, or the object of his anger (it is not clear which, since no reason for Iago's behavior is offered). Although Kenneth Brannagh (sp?) Shows his usual talent for Shakespeare in this film, he is somewhat marginalized. The characters of Cassio and Emilia are also wandering in the scene, even if they, like Iago, seem more important to the plot. I did not check the movie against the play to see how many lines were cut, but I know that Shakespeare tends to develop his characters, even those seemingly irrelevant. Very good. the film's criticism would be that the story unfolds too quickly and that the relationships between some characters are not more exposed. The director had a large cast and nobody provided poor performance. The relationship between Cassio and Othello and that between Emilia and Desdemona must be developed earlier in the film. I have the feeling that they have come close to each other than the film suggests, although you feel very good about it in the movie. Othello and Desdemona also need more time together. Although their suffering is convincing, the amount of interaction they have between them makes them seem to have met. On the other hand, she may have met only as Romeo and Juliet. In short: Good, too short performance. <br /> <br />
