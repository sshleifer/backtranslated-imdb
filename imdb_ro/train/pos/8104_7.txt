This is an amazing film from 1936. Although the first hour is not very interesting (for modern contemporaries), the elegant 2036 vision, which comes in words, makes it. However, do not plan to understand all the dialogue - sound quality and accents (it is American, but "Americans of the 1930s") make it difficult. In principle, the story is a sweeping 100-year look at a fictional American city called "Everytown". It stretches back to 1936, when a war is on the horizon, until 2036, when technology leaps forward and creates its own problems. The first hour is a little sluggish - though it's hard to say what public then he would have thought. Events, suspense and visuals are quite limited in today's terms. However, when it comes to the future, it's just fun to look at. Big sets and the retro-sci-fi look of all things are hard to beat. If you do not have great listening skills, this movie is hard to hear. I think I understood only 80% of the dialogue. A subtitle can be used. If you are a science fiction fan, this is one of the classics of the genre and you have to see (well, at least after the first hour). For the average viewer, wait until there is a closed caption version and then watch it if you are comfortable with movies of this time period.
