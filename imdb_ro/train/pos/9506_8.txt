A sober, reflective piece, a small miniature that blooms in a magnificent human painting sequence that goes beyond a simple dramatization of the screen. This quiet story will keep you captivating - if you do not have too many problems with different Spanish accents, ranging from Mexican to Peruvian, and the more authentic use of Iberian Peninsula Marisa Paredes! Garcíadiego made a perfect adaptation of the novel: even the great master García Márquez should be proud of her superb work. And slams Arturo Ripstein who has so much concert in a jewel, a ruby, so refined, so elegant, so sensitive, so emotional ... El Coronel - Fernando Luján - awaits his he received his pension while he continued to live in the timber that lived deep in the Colombian jungle (however, filmed elsewhere, NOT in Colombia) with his battle cock and his wife (in that order?). And that's all there is. But, oh, much more .... This movie is a rhapsody. I have to see this poetic piece again as soon as possible. It's worth the big part of 8 out of 10, which is very big on my scale. This is not easy commercial stuff at Hollywood.
