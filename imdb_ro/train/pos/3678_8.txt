is a very beautiful film and I would definitely recommend it to everyone. but there are 2 points minus: - story level has a broad spectrum. some of the scenes are very good and some are just boring. - Many stories are not self-contained (if you compare to coffee and cigarettes, where each story has a point, a message, a pencil or anyway you want to call it) but well, most stories are very good, some are great on the whole is one of the best movies this year for sure! <br /> <br /> Annoying, I have to fill 10 lines to a minimum, I have no say and I do not want to start by analyzing the unique sequences ... well, I think that's it!
