This film is directed by Renny Harlin, the Finnish miracle. Stallone is Gabe Walker. Cat and Mouse in the mountains with ruthless terrorists. Renny Harlin knows how to direct the action. Stallone needed this role to get back on the right track. The Snow Mountain is a very good place for the action movie, and it's best to make the film snow, ice, cold and bad weather than the Finnish man. The action is good! The music in the movie is spectacular. The worst is John Litghow, other stars Micheal Rooker (The Portrait Portrait), Janine Turner (Strong Medicine). It is placed in a wonderful place and is a very interesting film. Very good movie **** / ***** <br /> <br /> Remember Extreme ääliöt: special edition of collectors with good extracts. Soon, in Finland, directly to the video.
