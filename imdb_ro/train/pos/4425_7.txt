Another attempt by modern Japanese directors to redefine the Chambara genre. Success and not different degrees. The Buddhist monk has a vision that he must kill a legendary (and very active) demon on the Gojoe Bridge to achieve enlightenment. While not in the forefront, Buddhist thought is at the heart of this film, just like Kurosawa's "Ran". Probably what made the movie the most interesting for me, although it is now close to the "Ran" league. <br /> <br /> The elegant visual direction and excellent photography keep the movie mostly interesting for the entire length of the two hours and eighteen minutes. The main actors are equally excellent. Music is very good. The two weaknesses are the story and battle scenes. The film draws in the middle, which could have been resolved by a prudent editing. And battle scenes are mostly filmed in an unclear lock. This works for most of the movie, but the end feels like a cheap one. Another recent film, such as "Seven Swords" by Tsui Hark, is a great movie, but the promised battle scenes are disappointing. Asano does not really move like a demonic sword, his action is great, but he would be extra in a traditional chambara fight scene. Good movie, you'll probably find it interesting just because you did not expect the traditional battles of the sword.
