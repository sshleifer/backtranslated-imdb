The year 2000 was a bad year for Indian movies due to lack of quality and imagination by film directors. Other than Mohabbatein and Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai nothing has gone out. CCCC has had a lot of controversy over film funding, and this, without really knowing what the film is about, has generated good advertising and advanced sales of tickets for the film in India and abroad. The only information was that it was a suspense thriller. The film was released in 2001, and the movie was surprisingly good. The main plot has to do with the surrogate and is well manipulated. Salman and Preiti give a good performance if Salman does not actually take the shirt off at all .. must be special effects! Rani interprets Salmans' wife, but she is a bit more pretentious than Preiti, who plays the role of the prostitute who eventually becomes surrogate mother. The three main reasons confirm, after Har Di Jo Pyar Karega, that they have a solid screen and an on-screen chemistry (apparently). Salman Khan, who is excellent, plays a serious role in the film as a successful businessman and is a sin exploited as a wannabe comedian in his other films because he is quite underestimated in the Mumbai film industry, partly due to the films which they choose. The character of Rani does not know that Preiti is a prostitute to the end ... this one kept by her and the rest of her family ... the rest of you should know that it will destroy the movie if I tell you. The songs are all good paintings and especially zen and walon and the main title title. The other actors support a minimal effort, but a loving Salmans family. Abbas Mastan produced a hit and manipulated the subject of the film tactfully. I say you go and watch or rent whatever you want!
