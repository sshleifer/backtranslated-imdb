Being that this movie has a lot of fine entertainment qualities, I think it should have some more credit than it was given on imdb. It's your core "who did it?" thriller with sex and killing, but it guesses you until the end. I like these types of movies and I certainly think that it meets the standard. For me it's worth looking a few times, so I'll give it an 8 on imdb.
