I'm going to have a date with my first encounter with Prince's music. She was in a bar, on my 39th birthday, and a girl dancing naked, who played on "1999" by playing on the speakers. I asked people, who is the singer? I was told he was a prince. It was so good that I had fun in a beautiful, unpopular dancer. Later I began to hear other Prince songs and even "dig them". When Purple Rain came out, I still knew very little about this colleague of Minnesot. The movie let me go. I became instantly a fan of Prince 1 of the War Baby generation. Later I learned that one of my cousins ​​was his secretary and took me and my nephew into a V.I.P. Prince concert where I stayed next to his mother ... how cool this is! Returning to the subject in question, I agree with Siskel & Ebert, who called Purple Rain an instant classic. I have seen it over 17 times and love it absolutely. I thought Prince's action was good, Apollonia fought a little, but everything was fine. John Gielgud was not available to play "The Kid," so the Prince took over the role. The film is stunningly visual, brilliant with rhythm (never slow) and terribly directed. I classify him as one of the best musical films of all time. The last time I saw it was after a 7-year gap and it was still delivered. I'm so proud of my colleague Minnesotan, Prince Rogers Nelson, and I'd like to tell him personally. He went right in front of me during the concert mentioned above and said, "Hi," my nephew, but not me. He was talking to his mom. I was a bit shaken, but he's still number one with me.
