I have seen a special examination in advance of this thing today. I have to tell you that I'm not a big fan of Dane Cook or Steve Carell, so I had no expectation to go into it. I've finished it a little while. Dan in real life is the story of a widow with 3 daughters going to spend a weekend with their family. While at a bookstore, he meets the woman of his dreams only to find out that he's going to be his brother's girlfriend. This movie is pretty well done - the soundtrack, cinema and acting are all top-notch, especially Steve Carell. My problem was that most of it seems there is no character development, especially with Dane Cook's character. We never look closely at the relationship between Dane's and Steve's characters, and I felt he could have helped a little to show Dan's inner conflict about being in love with Dane's girlfriend. Otherwise, Dan in Real Life is definitely a solid and sweet film - definitely a pleasant break from all the horror and action films we've got this year.
