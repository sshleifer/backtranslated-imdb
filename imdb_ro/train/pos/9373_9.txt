Like many of you, I'm a big fan of real things - the noir movie of the 1940s - but Red Rock West was a real treat for all those who wanted our past. The term "neo-noir" has been used so often inappropriately over the past ten years that it has lost its significance and impact. John Dahl's film, on the other hand, really deserves to be described as such. Casting is perfect all around and would have felt like home with Tay Garnett or Jacques Tourneur. The plot is so tight that you are engaged in the first fifteen minutes. James M. Cain would appreciate it. Many contemporary films let me wonder why I do not do as they used to, and I'm not that old. Movies like Red Rock West give us hope for the future, paying tribute to the past.
