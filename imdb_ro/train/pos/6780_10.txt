Colman's performance is helped by the brilliantly written script. The giant studios at Hollywood in the 30's and 40's managed to copy some of the German expressionist elements and incorporate them into Hollywood movies. the very good use of shadows and light and silhouette. I really liked the scene where Colman stops the light in the wardrobe near the start of the movie and begins to recite Othello as his face becomes instantly dark and evil. the viewer already sees Shakespeare's text and drama, which is "Tony," and goes on his despised journey. I also enjoyed the dramatic scene of death in the play, when she became overwhelmed by emotion and inadvertently tightens her cost too much for her. her pleadings "stop me hurting" are frozen and suspensive. you just do not know if it will go over the top and kill it at any time. the cat and mouse to discover the killer was nicely added 2 / 3rds of the road through the movie to add some faster pacing and also add to the narrative of the movie. Master's work from George Cukor. He's like a smart director. Excellent film. It's a shame I do not do as I'm used to ...
