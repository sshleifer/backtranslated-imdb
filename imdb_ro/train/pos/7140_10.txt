20 of 10 This is a really wonderful story about a wartime evacuate and a carpenter Tom Oakley. The boy (William Beech) is busy with Tom and it is immediately obvious that he has serious problems when his bed ages the first night. William is illiterate and frightened, but somehow the two find consolation in the loneliness of others. It seems that William has the talent of an artist and we see Tom's father as a choir in a funny interpretation of Jerusalem. William is friends with Zacharias Wrench, a young Jewish young man from London, and together with Tom and Zacharias, he finally learns to read and write and feel part of this small knit community. As established, William is recalled back to London by his mother, and here we see why he is so deceived. His mother is clearly mentally ill and when Tom does not hear from William, he travels to London to look for him. Eventually, he finds his dead sister, where he was tied to a cellar. After a while in the hospital, Tom realizes he has to kidnap him and take him home with him. The climax is the sweet-sweet end when William is told to be adopted by Tom, while at the same time learning his best friend, Zacharias, was killed in an air raid in London . For me, one of the most exciting scenes was when Tom was talking to an official at his home office. I like "im, and" for what it deserves, I think she loves me too. "It just is not better for her to do it?
