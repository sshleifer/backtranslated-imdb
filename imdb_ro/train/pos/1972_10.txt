I do not understand the objections to this movie. It is a tense, thrilling extension of the character created in the "Basic Instinct". The only part of the story, which is at least a bit unrealistic, is that Sharon Stone's character is still alive and not in jail at this late date. <br /> <br /> ALERT SPOILER: As the film progresses, we are presented with three theories about what is happening: 1) The character of Sharon Stone kills all these people because he is crazy (dependent risk); 2) David Thewlis's crooked officer kills these people to fit the character of Sharon Stone; 3) David Morrissey's analyst kills these people for revenge. What annoys most people about the movie seems to be that none of these theories is ever explained as a "real" story. (Although the analyst is in a psychiatric care unit for killing the cop, the only killing that appears on the screen.) I think this is a brilliant plot plot in the spirit of "2001, A Space Odyssey." Who scares what's real? The blonde is really crazy, the policeman is really crooked and the analyst really wants revenge. What is important is the interaction between these and other characters in the story. Like real life, everyone is more complicated than anybody believes and reality it's more complicated than a movie.
