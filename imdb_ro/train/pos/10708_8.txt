John (Ben Chaplin) is a lone banker who lives in a small town near London. Although the Internet, he contacts a Russian brides agency. Selects Sophia (Nicole Kidman - the guy can be lonely and shy, but he certainly has a good taste, is not he?) And when they met, he realizes he does not speak English. Communicating with others is basically limited by sex (again, imagine what a terrible situation the guy just has some sex with Nicole Kidman!). At her birthday, two Russian friends visit her. Then there will be a lot of surprises. I liked this movie: first, it is almost impossible to be tagged. Is it a black comedy, action, a thriller? I think all the choices are correct. Nicole Kidman is wonderful as usual and I am very curious about her shame: do I speak Russian really with a correct or just forgery? Anyway, I found a nice movie. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Isca Perfect" ("Perfect Bait")
