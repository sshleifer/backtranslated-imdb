This is 2009, and so underestimated jewelery has lost nothing of its power 31 years ago. Connects a fairly wide variety of characters and different stories without seeming to be crowded. Clothes and music might have changed over time, but in the end this is a story that will not be lost until now -dateness. And especially this movie does the job pretty well. Of course it is sometimes weird, but also very moving. Jodie Foster's performance is striking and shows that she is indeed a natural actress who has shown her true potential, especially in her previous films. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this.
