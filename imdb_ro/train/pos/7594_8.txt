I do not know the stars or modern Chinese teenage music - but I know a very fun movie when I see one. Kung Fu Dunk is purely Hollywood in its values ​​- it's playing for laughs, for love and is an excellent mix of Kung Fu and basketball. Everyone shows that they had a lot of fun doing this - the production values ​​are excellent - and modern China looks more glossy than Los Angeles here. <br /> <br /> The abandoned orphaned land that grows in a kung fu school just to be kicked out and then discover the superstardom as a basketball (and even more love etc.) is great - it's fresh, fun and extremely fun. With great action and good dialogue, this is a simple one to enjoy - for all ages - and because our money was one of the best family movies we have seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> Please ignore negative reviews and give Dunk a chance - I was really glad to have done - a good sports comedy movie.
