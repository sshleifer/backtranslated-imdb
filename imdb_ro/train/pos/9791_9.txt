I will not give anything by describing the plot of this film, other than saying that starting with the return to Israel of a young blind, whose closest friend and comrade just committed suicide. It's like a detective story, while the blind woman tries to figure out why her boyfriend's life is over. While pursuing its investigation and gathering information, it leads inexorably to a devastating conclusion. The film is experienced, and the actor, especially by Talia Sharon like Ya'ara, the blind woman, is excellent. Israeli film has certainly reached age and is now fully competitive with other foreign movies, although few have found a large audience in the US.
