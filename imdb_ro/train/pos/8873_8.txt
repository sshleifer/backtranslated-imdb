This movie came and went to theaters. Due to its nature you can see why it was not welcomed. It was unfair due to its subjects, more than the actual movie. Higher learning is not spectacular, but it was a good film that tried to talk about a topic feared in America: racism. Plot / Story: Higher education focuses mainly on Malik (played by Omar Epps) naive track star, who has to deal with not being fast enough, and a severe teacher (played by Laurence Fishburne). He is friends with Fudge (Ice Cube), and with a beautiful lady named Deja (Tyra Banks). Later, they get to face skinheads on the campus. Remy (Michael Rapaport) is a confused child who gets to be friends with some local skinheads on the campus. Once they impose their points of view, he becomes as racist as they do. Opinion: Higher learning is not without its flaws: The development of the character is rare, the performances of Omar Epps, Tyra Banks and the skinhead leader (whose name I forgot), Busta Rhymes does not fit into this movie at all. In addition, women who became homosexual after being abused by men were clich√© before this movie, so you know I did not like that part of the movie with Kristy Swanson. Besides, this movie was not half bad. Laurence Fishburne was good as Professor Phipps (even if I could do without accent), Fudge was the best interpretation of Ice Cube and Michael Rapaport was good as Remy was confused. Generally, it was one of John Singleton's best movies and it's one of the reasons why I frown on the garbage that he's pulling out now. Cinema needs more movies like Higher Learning, Mississippi Burning and American History X, and fewer movies like Baby Boy, 2 Fast 2 Furious, and Shaft's unnecessary remake.
