I've been trying to find out about this series over the years! Thank you, IMDb! I saw this as a child and I never managed to get it out of my mind. As a 6-year-old, of course, I was particularly affected by the cyclopic episode, which was absolutely cold (I talked so much about the fact that my big brother made me a cyclop from a fish figurine from plastic, which I still have) What I also remember was the atmosphere, which was unusual from the beginning - mysterious, austere and extremely authentic. When I read the original many years later, I felt the same feeling. It's a very difficult thing to capture - and probably impossible in Hollywood. Every "Odyssey" I have seen since then has been enormous debauchery. The characters in this series looked real, real people - the ancient Greek people - and not Hollywood seeing in costumes. This is a true masterpiece! But - Why is not it better known? And why is not it available on VHS or DVD? I would love to have the opportunity to see this again!
