Mel Gibson's melody was a spectacular film, but he left a sour taste in his mouth. Rob Roy, on the contrary, is a bit polished, but a better film far. This is a historical film that combines themes without any real historical value, while Braveheart put a coarse and uncomfortable contemporary gloss on an ancient story. What this movie does is the distribution. Liam Neeson plays the role of the hero in a role he has fundamentally restored (twisted) in "The Phantom Menace." The character is heroic, but he is neither the greatest fighter nor the most demonic boyfriend. Admirable, but human, command the screen. Against him there is a selection of equally human opponents, including the unfortunate but brilliant Tim Roth's Cunningham, and John Hurt's bankrupt jargon. Also to praise is Jessica Lange, Rob's pragmatic wife: and strong and noble, but 300 years from a modern heroine, which is just the way it should be. This is not the most original movie you will see, but it has the courage of your own beliefs, and your powerful performances worry you.
