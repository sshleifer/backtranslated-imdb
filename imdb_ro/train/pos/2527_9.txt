That's what I call a "pre Sci Fi, Sci Fi" movie. It does not get better than Lugosi / Karloff in this incredibly good cinematic picture. These two authentic artists are as good as the story. Karloff does an amazing job as a scientist who sees himself in a manner of vanity, pride and scientific competition. I was caught in the idea of ​​looking at a man as he drowns in the three concepts mentioned above. I was sad and at the same time fascinated by the two stars as they meet. This is a kind of movie that begs a remake. This time he put Harrison Ford on the Karloff side and maybe Kieffer Sutherland as Bela Lagosi. It would be possible to do it almost as well. This is one of the best Hollywood EVER products. As I said ... it does not get better. No way.
