The classic for Louis Sachar's children is about Disney as well as Freddy Krueger. It has a crime, a racism, a facial disfigurement, and a murderous lizard. Very well plotted, it's a history-related story to reveal Stanley's patrimony and the secret behind the holes. It competes from the lush greenery of Latvia to Camp Green Lake (which has no lake or green). Disney's first success is the recreation of the novel's medium so convincing - the design of the set is superb and glamorous. The other plus is casting. Rising star Shia LaBeouf (Charlie's Angels 2, Project Greenlight) may not be the fat boy of the book, but his attitude is correct and he is far from the usual pure hero. The rest of the cast is completed as well, from Patricia Arquette as the Frontier School Thief Marble, to Henry Winkler as Stanley's father. The downside is the pop soundtrack - a pure marketing department - and feeling back to full volume at the end of the year.
