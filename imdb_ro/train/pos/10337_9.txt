This movie was very funny, I would love to have it for my 1970s vintage collection, the movie has to see the list again, I know this cast of characters, there are people I met, over the years and making me look for this comedy, unfortunately this has never been put on DVD or VHS. Redd Foxx Always a comedy clown, Pearl Baily a wonderful match as his spiritual and sassy wife, Norman a son with a secret I'm not sure if he's going to have a future if he's out, Dennis Dugan a funny crazy man. Miss Dobson, with a heart and a little conscience. Love, lust, strange family relationships, this movie qualifies for a comeback encore performance, a comedy with a mix of events, as it could and should find its way as a remake, I think finding a cast will be extremely difficult, Seinfeld, who plays Dennis Dugan, this cancels a few episodes of Seinfeld who also brought me back to Norman is that you, keeping them in the nearest era is certainly impossible that it is impossible to reformat claim the female girlfriend and the infidelity of a parent. This movie was a wild walk cabin tips, reminding me of the Kramer episode taking his caddy's advice over his lawyer. (episode of Seinfeld) Parents have there jaw drop moment, fun over fun It cries bring me back.
