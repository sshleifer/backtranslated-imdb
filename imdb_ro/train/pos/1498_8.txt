It is a very funny and sometimes horrifying anthology, that if it is a little short in the scriptwriting department, it more than offset the shortcoming in acting, work and general exuberance. The best episodes are the first, with Denholm Elliot playing a horror writer watched by a character in his novel in works (a perfect example of the act that pulls this from the pedestrian); with Christopher Lee as a man frightened by his daughter and the final episode with great grandson Jon Pertwee as a pompous horror film star, who only has a new role in his latest project. The dialogue between Pertwee and Ingrid Pitt is sparkling and inspired, both clearly showing the opportunity to really debate! Cushing is usually good in the worst segment, which is certainly not helped by the fact that the woman's wax figure she obsesses at the local wax museum is only "beautiful" as we are told to believe she! Somebody needed a shocking beauty and instead we were given a woman with a turtle jaw. Minor quibbles aside this movie and it's great setting the country house is one to catch when you can.
