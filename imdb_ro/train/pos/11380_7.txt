Although the word megalmania is much used to describe Gene Kelly and sometimes its dance is too rigid, you have to admit that the guy knows how to put a show. In the US In Paris, he corrects some remarkable numbers, some that make the plot difficult, but they are amazing to look. (See Gene Kelly "Out of the Routine Bed" for Stars) Gene Kelly stars as a GI, having its headquarters in Paris, he is there to paint, soon he is a gigolo rich woman, but he really LOVES someone else! Hoary was sure to tell, but the musical numbers save the show here! I really enjoyed Georges Guitar's voice work on this. "Stairway to Paradise" and his duet with Le Gene on "Wonderful" is great. Oscar Levant and Leslie Caron can take or leave. On the whole, a pretty good movie, but not a dynamite.
