This is not one of Jimmy Stewart's best movies - I remember very quickly. However, while some see their movie as pure propaganda, I wonder what is so bad about that? Yes, of course, like the FBI TV show, this is an obvious case of the Bureau doing PR activities to try to help support. But as the fun goes, do a good job. In addition, surprisingly for the time it has been done, the film focuses more on crime than on espionage and on "Commies". Instead, it is a fictionalization of one of the oldest agents and the career he has chosen. Now that the agent is played by Jimmy Stewart, he's pretty sure that acting and writing were good - because it was a real-budget movie and a studio that was not going to lose the star in a Trinity. So, overall, it's worth seeing, but not particularly great.
