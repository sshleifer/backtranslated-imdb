I just used this video and I looked last night. The actor started extremely bad (hey ------ hey ------ twister), but he became very good soon after the sections. The tornadoes were extremely fake, and many of the CGI effects were very troublesome, but the scene with the house cracking out and the contents inside were breathed around and sucked out were extremely well made, and almost twisted with movies like Twister. Scenes of devastation were also extremely good. The story was very well written and it's refreshing to see a movie like this, far from the same old "disaster formulas," movies of this kind seem to have been blocked for 30 years. the movie had a very strange mix of FX and the quality of the actors, this deserves an A in my book.
