This film (with the alternative title "Martial Law 3" for some reasons) first introduced me to Jeff Wincott. And it was a wonderful introduction. Though I had not heard of him before, he seemed to be an excellent fighter. The action scenes in this movie are GREAT! There are also many of them, by the way. Peace recruiter's fight is particularly good. There's only one thing about a guy who beats the carp out of a bunch of people that's really fun. And for the rest of the cast: Brigitte Nielsen was a good choice for the bad guy. Roles like this fit them (but others do not). Matthias Hues has also done a good job, as always. He is a great fighter and macho character, and was a good rival to Wincott in this film.
