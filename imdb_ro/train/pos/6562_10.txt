Pretty simple, the best reality show ever made. The first two seasons (the only ones that matter) are on Hulu. We challenge someone to watch the first three episodes of season 1 and they do not like it. We guarantee that you will finish watching the season. Then I guarantee you will watch season 2. Other quick motives to watch: 1. Anderson Cooper is hilarious 2. Locations in Europe are wonderful 3. The games are mentally challenging 4. It's very interactive 5. In one episode , a player responds to the desperation of another player: "I'm trying as much as I can!" with a sort of despair, "Not necessarily." <br /> <br /> You can figure out ... Who is the molecule?
