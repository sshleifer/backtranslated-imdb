This movie is a small sunshine in a closed season. He celebrates a quality best described as old friendship. Morgan Freeman plays a character very similar to Freeman himself - a successful actor for 70 years. He traveled to a small, dirty shop that wanted to investigate a part he could play as a manager of such a place. Soon, he convinces staff and customers, especially the beautiful woman, if it is a young woman (Paz Vega), who presides the band of 10 items or less. 10 Elements or less do not have a great affirmation to do and do not claim to do so. Freeman and Vega follow as they become friendly and, as the elderly man offers his advice in return for a trip - the shooting company that should not take him in his arms and Freeman forgot his own phone number he can not ask for help. I had a small case of blues on a gray Sunday afternoon in New York City and this movie cured me what hit me.
