This is one of those unfortunate films that have suffered a more sad, unfortunate death at the box office. I saw this movie at a local cinema, in the form of a revival, shortly after being tanned in the main cinemas. It certainly deserves to be approached a second time (or even a third). Sandra B. leads her to the limit, making a word by speaking and taking some songs well known in this play (Hank William's version, "I'm so alone, I can cry," she could easily move you to tears ). Perhaps one day, the audience will be ready to make this film a bit more serious (but not without some good laughs). The film moves at a rhythm (due to beautiful editions), so some viewers do not find it obsolete and boring. Perhaps a rebirth is only on the pipe.
