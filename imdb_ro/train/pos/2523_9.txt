When I heard about Moon Child for the first time, I thought it was a joke. A few months later, I realized it was real. Some reviews I read, which were not made by fangirls screeching, were not very promising. When I was given the opportunity to look at her, I was fully prepared to stir up, to wander, or else I had to close my eyes to avoid disturbance. I was more than a little surprised and in a good way. Yes, the Child Moon has the moments of cheese, camp and general dorkiness - I think this is impossible to avoid when it involves Gackt Camui, a man who is not known for his health - but it was totally pleasant. No, it's not a cinematic genre, but it's very, very sincere, fun, with fun choreography, a score that also touches a fun distribution. I know a little about the Japanese cinema, so I can not really judge the act, but given that the distribution spoke a foreign language or foreign dialect strange to them at some point or another and that some of them have almost no an acting experience, was quite impressed. If you can enjoy a good action movie, a good drama, a good comedy, watch this movie. At least let you rent it since I come to Region 1. On a side note, there is homosexual / homoerotic zero content in this movie. I have not even seen a lot of subtext. Do not let people who read too much to ruin this.
