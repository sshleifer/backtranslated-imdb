Billy Wilder is co-credited for the story, and his sentimental touch is remarkable in this pretty original story of ghostwriting composers working for the legend of burns Oliver Courtney. The obvious misunderstandings are overtaken quite quickly, thanks to the sky, and what remains is a bizarre mixture of breezes with some beautiful songs (and some more forgotten), Crosby at the most charming, a great twist of the Broadway legend, Mary Martin and Basil Rathbone and Oscar Levant, who provide most cynics (Levant is rare and his quips have not given). A delightful surprise and recommended to all fans of the genre.
