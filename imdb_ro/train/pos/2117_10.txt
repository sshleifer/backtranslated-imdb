Every time I watch this movie, I'm more impressed with the whole production. I have come to the conclusion that it is the best romantic comedy ever made. All involved are perfect; scenario, action, direction, sets and editing. While James Stewart can always be invoked for good performance, and supporting support is magnificent, Margaret Sullavan is revealing what an undervalued actress was. Her personal tragic life gives her a battle of qualities as an interpreter in which comedy skills are not easy to accomplish. Lubitsch managed to get the best and obviously gave the best results. Watch the number of scenes that were made in one shot - breathtaking.
