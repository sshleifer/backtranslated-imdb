I find it hard to criticize anything that Mitzi Kapture did. She radiates the beauty and grace on the screen and is a phenomenal actress. Yet, yes, the plot was predictable. I think if Jill HAD slept with Richard, then he could have made him a little more crazy than he already was, which would have added more to suspense. It would have been nice to see Jill and her husband find out about Richard's little problem with his ex-wife, perhaps a less back story. I was a little disappointed at the end of the movie. I would have liked to have seen more closure with Zack's death and eventually closing with her husband. But I have to say that I will never be able to see a flare weapon and not imagine her sitting there. It was a very fitting end for Richard. Of course, Mitzi ROCKED! I look forward to future projects.
