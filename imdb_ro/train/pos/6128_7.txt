Yes, a B grade horror. But at least producers, directors and distributors do not claim that this film is a hand in the sky. Intrigue is a horn, a psychotic serial killer on his way to execution is sprinkled with the genetic acid turning it into a snowman. The snowman, for example, Jack Frost continues a murder murder to find the sheriff in the small town who finally arrested him. With a limited budget, the crew had to deal with limited special effects, most money seems to spend on the snowman's suit. Tough photos are managed by cartoons or photos (photos where the camera moves to hide details). <br /> <br /> This is not a child's movie and should not be confused with the Disney movie of the same title. If you do not allow your children to watch pg-13 movies alone than parents should not let children watch this movie. This film has two claims of fame. 1. Beautiful Shannon Elizabeth (American Pie) has made her first important role in the film. The scene in which Jack Frost attacks Shannon Elizabeth deserves to watch several times. 2. This movie has the worst snow joke ever. The joke is so bad that executives believe credit in the credit list.
