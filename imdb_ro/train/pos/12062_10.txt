This movie scared me from the first day I saw it. My mother watched her when she was back in '92. I remember I was awakened in the middle of the night by her tears, as my dad helped him climb the stairs. She said something like "Do not let her bring me" or something like that. I asked what made him so upset and told me he had watched The Woman in Black. So obviously, I had to look at her and even if I only had eleven, he left me. He scared me. I've been immune to the horror movies since I saw that!
