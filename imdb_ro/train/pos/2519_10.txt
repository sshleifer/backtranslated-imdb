This movie is very special. It's a very beautiful movie. Starting with three orphans, Sho, his brother Shinji and their friend Toshi, are poor children living on the street, but one day they managed to steal a bag full of money, and then they lived, bought a home, and their life seems to be much better. They make new friends, friends of life. But something went wrong and became enemies and everything ends by killing one another. I was negative about this movie at first, because when the singers (Gackt - Solo, ex - singer at Malice Mizer, Hyde - Solo, singer in L'Arc ~ en ~ Ciel, both well - known in Japan and singer Wang Lee - Hom-Taiwan) trying to become actors, but it's not like other movie singers. They do a great job and have no experience earlier in the movies (except Lee-Hom, who was in two movies before). This is absolutely one of my favorite movies. Maybe that's a little bit because I'm a very big fan of Hyde, but - that was the movie that made me discover it. Gackt (playing the main character - orphan Sho) was part of the group who wrote the script, and he insisted that Hyde play Sho's friend, vampire Kei. At that time they did not know each other, at least not as friends. But after the film they became very good friends and that shows us that they really worked in this movie and that they had a good collaboration. The film has many different feelings that are unfolding through the story, Love, Hate, sadness, pain, loneliness, happiness and so on. I think the first hour is the best, it's so beautiful. After that people die, Kei leaves and changes so much. But still it's a great movie, it's the only movie that made me cry, it ends up so sad, but still beautiful. So if you did not see this movie, you should do it. Because it's wonderful, but sad. You won t regret. ^^
