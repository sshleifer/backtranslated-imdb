This is a docudrama story about the Lindy Chamberlain case and a look at its impact on Australian society. He especially looks at the issue of innocence, gossip and expectations when dealing with real-life drama. A problem that the story deals with is how everyone is expected to give the same emotional response to the same situation. Not everyone enters wild melodramatic hysteria for every major crisis. Just because the characters in the movies and on the TV act in a certain way is not a reason to expect real people to do so. This is particularly apt for journalists and news publishers who seem to look for the great soul scene that will draw ratings. It is a problem that needs to be addressed constantly. Conductors play the characters with depth, personality and sensitivity. And they are supported by a widespread distribution of all people who actually play. Some viewers may be surprised to learn that many of those who support this story are more popular in Australia as comic actors. It reaffirms the idea that comic actors do some of the best support in drama, because with comedy they know how to make quick impressions of individuals. <br /> <br /> (Warning Spoiler!) <br /> <br /> I have to say something very personal here; in the sense that they are actually an ex-Adventist who was a practitioner in Australia at the time of the incident; so I have an impression slightly different from the story than most. I think it's handled with amazing creativity and personality and emotional heart. I think the best scene is where couples are hunted by new choppers. She captured the themes of the brilliant story. Once I heard Fred Schepsi say in an interview that he told actors to "play the best case for the character they could". While this is particularly apt for this story, I think it is also a general principle that should apply to all those who act as well.
