This eternal proverb is reverberated in this film and in my heart. For so many years I've been waiting to see this eternal story! I was not ready, maybe. My sensibilities may not have appreciated my strength. So now I rejoice in my soul with joy. My respect and admiration for PAUL MUNI was long. Now it's a legendary luminiscence. But now I have finally discovered the invaluable gifts of LUISE RAINER's splendid talents. Oh, how many faces can I talk about as hers? Some said they were made of her silent years, and that would be just her speech, she is quite eloquent when given a chance. She deserved her Oscar. This movie is in an epic in the most classic proportions. All parts are equal, necessary and perfect. Naysayers can leave, if they wish, but they would avoid a story that remains with a lifetime. <br /> <br /> THE BEST EARTH enriches one in ways it does not expect. But it will not come out of it with the joy that I have done. But I can only hope that this film will be remembered for many years. Do not promise me with simple techniques on the main players race. These are the expectations of modern times when we are obsessed with total perfection. But they dare a million newer movie scores to tell PEARL BUCK's story with such lust, power, conviction and grace. If a modern artist dared to re-film this masterpiece, I warn them that they will never approach the flavor aroma that still emanates from the core of this story. Time will not diminish this effort, nor will it progress to improve its greatness.
