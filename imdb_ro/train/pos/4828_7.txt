Rupert Friend offers an interpretation, like Prince Albert, raising "Young Victoria" at unexpected levels. Is gorgeous. As we know, Queen Victoria fell into a dark depression, deep after the death of Prince Albert, and seeing Ruper Friend's eyes that I understood. The film does not lead us to death, but to an incident that might well cost our lives. An act of love. I thought, or I should say, he. I think what he felt was real. Nothing or no one approaches the delicacy and profundity of Friend's characterization. Emily Blunt is good, but I do not think Victoria was for a moment. No real sense of the period. It might not have been her fault, but her prince deserved the crown.
