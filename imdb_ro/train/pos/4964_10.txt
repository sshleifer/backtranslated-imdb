I really like this show! I've always liked Space Ghost's 1990 shows! This show was hilarious and I can not believe why Cartoon Network's Adult Animation would make such a fun show like this in the air. I hope they put this show on DVD or something. The show refers to Brak (from Space Ghost cartoon, SGCC and Cartoon Planet), who lives his daily life with his mother and dad and his best friend who likes to fall in a crowd, Zorak! My favorite episodes were those in which Zorak receives this very good voice, and then his voice does not give him any money Zorak has made him sing. Another episode I like is where Brak and Zorak did not finish their homework and then came back from Sunday to Friday and left and then came back the day the themes were invented and then -related to the presentation of themes did not exist! Another episode I like is where Brak's father and his close neighbor, the Thundercleese robot, continue to get into this crowd and then they're eaten by a gigantic worm. Another episode I liked was when Zorak made a tyrant and then a new guy took over. I also like many of the other episodes! One thing that never makes me laugh is when Zorak is beaten, beaten and clogged!
