This is such a big movie, Call Me Anna, because it shows how a person has suffered for so long without knowing what happened to her. For Patty Duke to come out in the public eye and say that her story is a source of inspiration for those who suffer from this disease. I have a great respect for her as a person. The only thing I do not like is that I can not record it, I tried to look for it, but it was unsuccessful. Anyone know how to get it?
