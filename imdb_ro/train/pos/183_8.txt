Extraordinary comedy with Marian Davies (with William Haines). Young Peggy arrives at Hollywood to search for a story. Cameo shows "all the stars in MGM's sky" in the famous comic scene, plus a lot of epic films that make details of the scholar. Pic also captures David's famous impersonators, the most important sarcasms of the top stars of the day (Swanson is a beer!). "Peggy" even gets caught while meeting the famous star Marian Davies in tennis, turning his nose and comments, "Ohh, I do not like it!" My prince was perfect. Story, direction, acting a genuine charm and a necessity for all silent afficindados.
