This is one of Jackie's best films, which he has without Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao, has one of the best openings in any action movie and is doing so with Jackie showing some high-stacks quality. The only criticism is that the middle gets a bit slow, but it appears for a frantically lasting 25 minutes in the movie and the final credits show what a crazy jackie chan mad is just to keep us addicted to happy film
