I LOVE this show, it is sure to be a winner. Jessica Alba is doing a great job, it's time to have a girl who is not cutesy guy. All distribution is great and all episodes have good plots. Everything is well placed and thoughtful. Putting together had to take some time, because there was no one who was in a hurry to do something together. It's a GREAT performance altogether.
