This movie has a clear story, which is quite unusual for the genre. "Cats," "Phantom of the Opera," and other musicals by Andrew Lloyd Webber can be considered metaphorical because they use literary works as a frame. The story "Biarkan Bintang Menari" (BBM) even touches the core of human relations, especially the Indonesian people. Despite the fact that the film was based on a "supposed" story, it is actually a fantasy of the "baby" of Indonesian adults. The dance sequences are not perfect, however, the songs are the expression of the Indonesians. I think the choreographer should explore the Indonesian dance way, not complaining about the fact that the development of Indonesia's dance tends to be more Westernized. Dance sequences seem odd in some ways and not synchronized with songs and / or music. However, I still like this movie and consider it a new wave of Indonesian film genre, which I hope to improve in the future.
