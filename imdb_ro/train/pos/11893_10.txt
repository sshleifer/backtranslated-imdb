The next two seasons of this original series were less than gaps. In the last year, disastrous reshuffle has contributed to its short life span of three years. Perhaps if the card was fired after the first season, it would have won a cult following. Besides, the first season was really hilarious! Cute, smart, with a superb writing, was promising. The first year's excellent cheeses had the right ingredients - characters / actors, story, and so on. In addition, a comedy about a paparazzi reporter was original for the boot. Nora and her colleagues "photographers" during the visit, night after night, day after day for the exclusive. Many things do not make sense. As this show looked and another fav of me - Gross Pointe never "failed". If only the first seasons of Naked Truth and Grosse Pointe were released on DVD, please someone there ?!
