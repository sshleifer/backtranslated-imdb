79/100. Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers did not have any great movies together. Although this is not one of the best, it is an excellent music. There are some remarkable musical numbers, good support from Randolph Scott. Two notable appearances, Betty Grable and Lucille Ball make memorable early screen performances. Ball is especially good, and a blonde, too. "Facing Music and Dance" is one of the best musical duo numbers ever. Harriet Hilliard, better known as Harriet Nelson of "Ozzie and Harriet" plays Ginger Roger's sister. The base terrain is quite familiar, but with an exceptional distribution, it works. An excellent direction and score in art.
