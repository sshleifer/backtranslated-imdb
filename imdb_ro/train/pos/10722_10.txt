Spacecamp is one of the movies that kids love, and mom and dad can have fun too. Growing up in the 1980s I enjoyed this film, the plot and all the actors. I recently bought this movie on DVD, so when I have my kids, they will be able to have the same fun and watch this movie as I am. The plan is fun, a group of kids embark on a journey they never expected when they were broadcast in space by a speeding robot. They were at auh at first but when they realized they did not have enough oxygen to reverse the panic sinking in. Once they recovered enough oxygen from the space station they returned to the earth as better friends and a new respect for life.
