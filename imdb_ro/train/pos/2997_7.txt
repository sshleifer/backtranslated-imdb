William Powell is Philo Vance in The Kennel Murder Case, a 1933 film, also with Mary Astor, Paul Cavanagh, Eugene Palette, Helen Vinson and Ralph Morgan. A dog show in which Philo entered his captain Scottish terrier serves as a backdrop for a closed chamber mystery with too many suspects. The mystery is very clever, and the outcome so complicated and interesting. Because the talkies are still quite young, room work is a little static, but Michael Curtiz does a good job of action. The entire cast brings the movie a note. A lot of actors played Philo Vance, including Paul Lukas, Basil Rathbone, Wilford Hyde-White, Edmund Lowe, James Stephenson, Alan Curtis, Warren William and others. Powell played the most (five times) and is best for the role - very relaxed but serious at the same time. This was done before "The Thin Man" catapulted him to a big star - he spent about 12 years in the movie until then, starting his career on stage in 1912 at the age of 20. A remarkable man, a remarkable presence of the screen and a remarkable actor who lived nearly 92. We are so lucky to have his movies available on DVD and TCM today. "The Kennel Crime Case" is a wonderful story and a fun movie - do not miss it.
