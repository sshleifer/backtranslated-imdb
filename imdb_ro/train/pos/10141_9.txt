I was ready to deal with this episode, seeing that this Master does not really have horror movies under the belt, but this is easily the best episode of the season. good!! I do not know how he did it, but we have a real talent in this episode! And while you could see things coming from a mile as if wise, at least it was fun and managed to keep me engaged for 56 minutes, which was missing so far in this series. <br /> <br /> I liked the little one more, not a twist on the word, but just a little funny thing that he gets, like ever, the yellowish umbilicus. <br /> <br /> A very good effort. As I have said in other reviews, they are not real masters doing many of these episodes ... but someday they can become masters in the future.
