I have to say that this was not very interesting, but it talks about strange ways and ways to solve a mystery. A little too simple, Nancy Drew (Emma Roberts) uses IMDb ... that's fantastic! I really liked that part of the movie ... Corky (Josh Flitter) is extremely hilarious ... and Ned Nickerson (Max Thieriot) seemed really hopeless ... he should have been more angry with her for the way she treated her ... Okay, this movie is touring and fashion in disguise. Anyway, I recommend this movie, just for summer fun. Encore Nancy, just for fun. More teen spy movies by Emma Roberts .. Spymate ... do you remember? She gets good at this complicated detective work.
