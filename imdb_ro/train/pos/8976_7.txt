Starlift is a nice and exciting shot for all the musical stars that each studio has released during the Second World War. Gary Cooper, James Cagney, Doris Day, Gordon MacRae and Randolph Scott, and Gershwin brothers, Cole Porter, Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn, who provide music, are easy to shoot. And the plot is not even in the way. What plot there is the involvement of two Enlisted Air Forces, Dick Wesson and Ron Hagerthy, trying to meet the Starlet Janice Rule Warner Brothers using as a trick bill that both come from young Youngstown, Ohio and Hagerthy, Queen's dentist, and half from town. The scheme works too well because Louella Parsons soon puts an article in her column. Yeah, Louella is in the movie as well. He probably liked Warner Brothers or Jack Warner more than the other studio heads, because she also used this studio to release her Hollywood Hotel program that day. But the rest of the plot drew attention to the real efforts of life, in which Ruth Roman also plays to make his studio and others to perform at the foundations of the Air Force for soldiers and women going to Korea. Some of the names I mentioned and others sing and play at a show at the Travis Air Force Base, where many of this film was shot. A specialty number was shot for Phil Harris' talent to sing / narrate a ballad. Look at Stranger, I'm a Texas Ranger helped by Virginia Gibson, Frank Lovejoy and Gary Cooper. Yup, Cooper seemed to have had a very bright time when he joked his image. This is the oldest of the clues when you say I do not do it anymore, but they're not really because you do not have a studio system that has all these talents in the contract. It's about the disappearance of the old studio system that we can cry.
