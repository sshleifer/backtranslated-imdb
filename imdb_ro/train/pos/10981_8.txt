Hey now, indeed, TheatreX, found this while making films on the flea market, in a nearly nine-star state, and in the reading behind the box it was seen to be somewhat a "cult blow," so, of course, he came home with me. <br /> <br /> What a strange movie. Aunt and cousin of the former first lady, Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis, live in this 28-room home on Long Island (Suffolk Co.) and share the house with raccoons, cats, fleas (eyow!) And who knows what else. Suffolk Co. was everywhere at a time lived in dirt, and Jackie herself came to put things in order. Anyway, this is a weird pair, Big Edie and Little Edie ... Edie (daughter) always wears something overhead and dances, plays and gives a little attention to the camera, which rarely makes sense. Big Edie (mother, aged 79) seems to like to strip naked and while we find suggestions about what might seem fortunate to have it done with good taste (?) To the point where we are mercifully spared of it. These women speak, speak and speak, especially about the past, and make no sense except them. They live in absolute dirt, cats do business anywhere ("Watch the cat go to the bathroom behind my portrait") and a bedroom seems to be their center of operations. If I close my eyes and listen to the voice of the Great Edie, I remember very much my late aunt, who was from that part of the country and who had the accent Lawn Guyland. A scene has Little Edie putting on fleas repulsive, awesome, you can see all the cats scratching all the time so the place must have been infested. The box refers to these two women as "eccentric", and I would have to say that in this case it's just a "eulogy for tigers", but this movie is not without the moments in which you really feel something for them. This is equal to creepy, sad, and disgusting parts, but I could not stop watching once I started. This is not my "normal" type, but it seemed somewhat fascinating. It will not, however, be guaranteed for everyone.
