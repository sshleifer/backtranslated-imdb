This production of Oliver is able to show some layers of evil in the human soul. What makes the remarkable story is a brilliant bright invisible character that pierces this darkness while driving an innocent boy through the most serious hazards safely into the hands of his own relative. Yeah, although Oliver is going through the valley of the shadow of death, he's not afraid of it. A rod and a staff are there to caress it. Eventually, he is saved from the rubble of mankind. At the bottom is Fagin, the worst of the lot. Fagin wishes to repent his ways not only once, but twice, yet he refuses because he does not want to pay the price. Fagin is worse than Bill Sikes, because he raises small pockets that become killers. In the middle is Oliver. His innocence is dissatisfied, but also unwritten. The best is Nancy. Missing judgment, she ignores the violent nature of Bill Sikes from the deep need for love. However, unlike Fagin, at the probable cost of his own life, she repents of her sins by saving Oliver from Bill. Things are not as it seems. In my opinion, this quality is what makes art useful - unpredictability. I would give her a "10" movie, but the soundtrack and the atmosphere made for television in the 1970s distracted. Generally, a fine parable and a story perfectly suited to all the audience.
