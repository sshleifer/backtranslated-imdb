"Erendira" is a movie in Mexico that we rarely talk about. The film only exists in a low-quality VHS format. It's a shame that this movie did not get a DVD release. "Erendira" is stunning and wonderful with its realistic magical images. "Erendira" is based on a short story in the novel "100 Years of Loneliness". Erendira is constantly a dreamer and accidentally burns her grandmother's home. Her bad grandmother, played by Irene Papas, forces her to prostitute to pay the damages. The entire city receives a piece of Erendira, so to speak. Though the subject seems rough, the film does not exploit sexuality. It's done in a mature artistic manner. The film also has amazing costumes. Some of the more surrealistic aspects of the film that are most remarkable are the origami birds that turn into real birds and a golden orange with a diamond in the center. Erendira is an amazing film that even manages to throw in humor. This is definitely a movie that deserves a special version of DVD. As they said in Espanol, "Es muy muy bien !!! Excellente!
