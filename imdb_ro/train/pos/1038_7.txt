I liked the movie. I really liked most of the actors in it. But for me, Mrs. Davis's very poor attempt at an accent, and her rigid action does indeed make an otherwise convincing film very hard to follow. Seriously, if another modern actor would play the same role in the same style as Mrs. Davis, she would have laughed off the screen. I really thought he called it in. "Now if Myrna Loy or Ingrid Bergman were to play my wife, I would have liked it much more." I think I just do not take Bette Davis. I've always thought of her as an actor who "plays" no matter what role she is in. The possible exception is Now Voyager, I'm sure many of the other commentators will explain carefully (and I hope civilly) the detail of how I am wrong about this But I will continue to watch the movies I love, because I like stories / writing / support, but I will always think of different actresses who could have done a better job.
