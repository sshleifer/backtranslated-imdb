I just saw this movie, the opening night. Was awesome!! I'm a great fan of sports movies, and that's right there as one of my favorites. Dennis Quaid was great. (Oh, by the way, Mr. Quaid, if you read this ... my sister lives in Austin where you live ..... and she should have bought you a drink once ... they ... she ... she you've been standing up ... but he did not want to do it !: C) [not to believe it ...]) Anyway, it's a great movie. Everyone who likes a good sport movie should come out and see it! : C)
