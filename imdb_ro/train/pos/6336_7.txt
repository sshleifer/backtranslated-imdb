OK, so FX does not have a big budget. But this story is based on real events. Do not throw something together to make a couple of wealthy actors, even richer! Like most books that rely on books, there are some things that do not fit. Only a few people have said that this movie is based on real events, not a stutter, because most people think it is! This movie is in no way tied to TWISTER! Other than the two films are about tornadoes. For those of you who have problems with the science of tornadoes and storms in the movie, there are a few things to keep in mind ... The current "Twists Night" was June 3, 1980. So this movie was released at 16 after real events. Try to think how far the storm research has advanced at that moment. It happened in a bigger city; Grand Island, Nebraska is the third largest city in the state. Even if the movie names the city and says it's a small town.
