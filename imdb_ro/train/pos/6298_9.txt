Big fun. I went with 8 friends to watch this movie. We came to see something else, but after 10 minutes we were wondering what the heck we got at the moment jokes became funny and funny throughout the movie. In the first part, just keep asking about "malinski" and "bellini" (there are several examples of this language) and repeating the same jokes (with different twists), they become funnier and funnier. In search of this malinski, all the main characters are introduced in the first, even worse than the next. By the end of the movie, I did not even know the name of this movie because we did not have opening credits and we went to this angry view, but we certainly had fun. The house was loaded (about 250 people) and I think about half of them did not like the other half loved the film. If you like strange comic movies with a special dialogue, you will love it. Apart from Clooney This movie deserves much better than the 5.6 IMDB rating it has at the time when I write this, but when I saw more ppl, I'm sure it will go up. 7.0 is reasonable, I think I would give you 8 out of 10. (10 out of 10 after a few beers) <br /> <br />
