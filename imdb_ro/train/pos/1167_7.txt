Alain Delon visits the quick and safe revenge on the ruthless crime family that hired him as a man who struck her in Duccio Tessari's "Big Guns" thriller after accidentally killing his wife and child. Tessari and scriptwriters Roberto Gandus, Ugo Liberatore from "One minute to pray, a second to die," and Franco Verucci of "Ring of Death" take this shareholder about a career gunsmith for the crowd even up to the thread. Indeed, "Big Guns" is more predictable, but still qualifies as solid fun with many wild crimes and often suddenly. Alain Delon of "The Godson" is duly laconic because he methodically treats the deaths at the heads of crowd families who have refused to let him retire so that he can enjoy life with his son and daughter. Richard Conte of "Na≈üul" plays a Sicilian crime boss who wants to bury the coat with Delon's character, but his other associates want to kill the dead. Like most of the crime thrillers of the 1960s and 1970s, "Big Guns" subscribes to the cinematic morality that crime does not pay. Interestingly, the only person who has nothing to do with the murder of the hero's wife and son survives while another betrays the hero with extreme prejudices. Tessari is not losing a second in this 90-minute shot. Apart from the mother and the son who dies in a car bomb intended for the father, the worst thing that happens takes place in a car rescue yard when a hero's associate is crushed in a junked car. Apparently, "Big Guns" is a bloodless exit, but it has a large number of frames for a mafia-style melody in 1973. Only at the last moment our protagonist leaves the guard down and thus the opposite morality of the eye for an eye remains intact. Tessari treats some decent journeys and the death of a don in a train traveling through a train tunnel is as bloody as this violent thread. The photo and the compositions are excellent.
