In this horror movie, 50-year-old cold war paranoia, America in the Reagan era and high school films, Adam Arkin plays Tony, the star founder of Full Moon High in the 1950s. He and his father (Ed McMahon) I travel to Communist Romania and, while losing the streets one evening, is bitten by a werewolf. When he returns from the state, he can not control his animal wishes and goes into a killing ring. Frustrated, he runs out of town. Tens of years later, immortal Tony returns to town and re-enrolls in high school. He still can not control his transformations, and the people in the city and his friends realize he's not really human. Everything culminates during the football game from the schools. I was expecting it to be one of the "so bad is good" movies since the early 1980s. But I was surprised that the movie was actually funny. The award, including Kenneth Mars as a perverse coach, Pink Kelly as Tony's young flame, Demond Wilson as a bus driver, and Alan Arkin as a strange physician, go on with hilarious results. <br /> While watching this movie, I was amazed at how similar was writing and humor with "Family Guy." "Full Moon High" has the same attitude and is not taken seriously.
