This is a great movie for McCartney and Beatles fans! A splendid time is guaranteed for all. The audience (the stars of stars such as Nicholson, Cuzak, Michael Douglas) is, as always, amazing: from small children to old sixty militaries. They know the words of all the songs on the heart and some of them cry when Paul gets bored "yesterday", "all my lovers" and all the treasures in his catalog (which, except for John Lennon and Dylan, can claim such a repertoire?) There are two particularly exciting moments: - The double tribute to Lennon and Harrison, the first "here today" played solo (the title was included in the "Tug War" 1982 and was his best piece) , then "something" when Paul uses a ukulele. "Extending the long and flowing road," a key moment, when Paul's voice breaks, the tears of hearts that tour crew members have in front of the scene. I remember, in the early seventies, when people used to despise Paul, because he was not involved in politics, as was his former partner. They had to change their minds because Paul is a dedicated artist: "fame is great because it allows charity." The film presents various aspects of Paul's activities, an artist that is more than selfish.
