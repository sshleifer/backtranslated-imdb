Did he have a bad day? Dog postman's dog? Does the car not start? Did people get your nerves? Then refresh yourself with a delightful experience. Two women decide to fish their resources in response to an announcement for a one-month rental of a villa in Italy. Because of the financial circumstances, two other women join them. Two have happy lives; one is an elderly woman who prefers to live in the past; the fourth is a rich and beautiful woman entirely jaded by life. As the spell of the villa springs to its spirits, each grows in its own way and is exalted in its perspective. This also changes people in their lives who have visited them. As you let it know that the magic of the villa will stay with them ... and you will find that your change is changed for the better. A delightful, exciting movie!
