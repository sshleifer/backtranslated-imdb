What a delightful movie. Characters were not only lively, they were alive, reflecting real life and conflicts within a family. Each character brought a unique personality to the story that the audience could easily associate with someone they know in their own family or in a circle of close friends. The story has a true life stream that the spectator can assimilate and be part of drama, laughter and tears as the plot of the film develops. The script makes a good job of capturing the common emotions, actions and reactions of the characters in conflict, opinion and solving. It's not an epic, but it's a great movie to watch with your loved ones. A lot of knots knowing the head and moments "ahhh" to share and enjoy.
