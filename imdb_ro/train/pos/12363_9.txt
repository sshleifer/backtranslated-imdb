This Italian-French remake of the 1946 movie of the same name in 1946 gave rise to early heat and does not allow us to come into the air. The story relates to a high school student (Federico Pitzalis), who can not keep an eye on the young young mystery (interpreted by the Dutch phenomenon Maruschka Detmers) who lives next to school. One day, one follows, and his persistence is paid. There is only one problem: She is engaged in a perfect character (Riccardo De Torrebruna), who may or may not have committed a wild crime, and if she goes, she will probably be released with a slap on her wrist. Also, the young man is a bit funny in the head, and this is confirmed when we discover he saw the boy's father, a psychiatrist. Giulia's emotional instability is equal to her prodigious sexual desires. Hot, hot, hot, from the word, with beautiful views and performance from Detmers, who plays from scene to scene like a yo-yo (with the boy), with enough suspense to keep guessing up and even after the end. Available in variants with R and X (!).
