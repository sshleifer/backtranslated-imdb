I like to watch people who make breakdance, especially if they do it in the best scenes of this movie that takes you to a disco club called "Roxy". Especially during Christmas, because there is also a "Santa Claus". Even though this is an old movie and even if I recorded it on television, when the State Movie Archive showed this in the summer of 2004 on their own big screen, I went there to check out. It's much more enjoyable on the big screen than on the TV. Even if many people think this big screen look is a waste of money for the ticket, I do not agree with that and I think when I paid my ticket, I won the money, seeing it as it is on the screen great, especially seated in the first row of the cinema, an unforgettable experience and much better than just the video.
