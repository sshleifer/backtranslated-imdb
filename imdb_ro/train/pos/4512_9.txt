I saw this movie today and I have to say it was much better than I expected to be about a few hours before I see it. Personally, I had some prejudices because of language, but it completely changed my mind. The film was, in most cases, surprisingly good with great actor and actress performances. It was a story about a boy who had a dream and who did everything to get to him. This really touched me and a film that is based on a true story convinced me. A new school, a psychotherapist and a little boy who meets a new teacher, a little different from the others and the struggle for things, even if they do not seem to work. He showed how few things can make huge changes in many things and how the difference can sometimes cause difficult situations. I also think the actors' selections have done well. It was really sensible that you were a person who was watching the episodes like an outsider when they happened. Before I spoil this movie with praise, I have to admit that there were some things and situations that did not look and did not feel realistic ... as if the school principal beat Frits aka. Martin in front of the class at the end of the movie. He was really beaten, but the only thing that caused them was a blood coming from the nose when he compared this to the first battle in the beginning, when Frits had some stitches ... and I think each film has its own mistakes. let's say if one day I find this DVD somewhere in the store, it's sure I'm taking it with me.
