"Panic in Streets" is a rather small film unknown to director Elia Kazan and was made before his classical masterpieces such as "A Streetcar Named Desire", "On the Waterfront" and "East of Eden". Kazan has already won an Oscar in 1947, before the film, so it was completely unknown at the time. However, "Panic in Streets" is largely a movie that has gone under radar. The big thing about this movie is the Academy Award winning screenplay. It has a very good concept and its material tense thriller with a smell of murder / film-noir elements. The dialogue in the film is also absolutely magnificent and gives the film a sense of reality and credibility. The cast is quite known (especially when it was launched), but still has Zero Mostel and Jack Palance in one of their first film roles. Especially Palance impresses as a tough gangster boss with a very strong face. Still, the film draws a bit at certain points. The film starts very well, but after the movie starts slowing and does not always make the right decisions about the rhythm and the point of view of the story. Still, "Panic in the Streets" remains a perfect movie to watch, mainly because of his solid script and strong dialogue that makes the film a credible movie to watch. For fans of the thriller genre, this is a great movie to watch. <br /> <br /> 8/10
