Seeing "Moonstruck" after so many years is a reminder of how fun and fun this movie was when it first appeared. Who knew Cher could act? Who has ever heard of Olympia Dukakis? Nicholas Cage was the beginning of his career, and Vincent Gardenia and Danny Aiello were not known for their comic talent, nor was Norman Jewison the director. The only real note in this splendid work is "When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza, that's Amore," a song that is sung too many times in the movie (once is too much) and has continued to have a long life after death in popular music. <br /> <br /> Cher is - forgive me - sensational like Loretta Castorini, a widow who wants to be married and does not have to be in love with the groom. Aielo (Johny Cammareri) undertakes to offer, offering her pinkie ring as a replacement for an engagement ring, then moves to Sicily to be with his dying mother. He calls Loretta, seeing his estranged brother Ronny attend the wedding. Loretta faces Ronny and falls in love with him quickly. Meanwhile, her father (Vincent Gardenia) deceives her mother (Olympia Dukakis), which Loretta accidentally discovers when Ronny invites her to the Metropolitan Opera. Everything ultimately works inevitably in such films. Meanwhile, all the actors pay off, and the audience enjoys themselves. In its own way, "Moonstruck" is how Hollywood was the best: Destroying entertainment without social importance. Had he lost only "That's Amore" along the way, it would have been perfect.
