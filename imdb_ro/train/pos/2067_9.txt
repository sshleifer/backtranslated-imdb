Although it is universally acknowledged that the fearful bond was heavily influenced by the Kolchak episode. They were, they are, they will be, no matter if this makes it a rip-off or homage, is a totally controversial point. As a great fan of the two series, I subscribe to this belief, though less charitable I can not do. James Whitmore was brave enough to take on the task of conducting such a difficult episode, the invisible elephants and the gorilla costumes sound like a recipe for disaster, but he draws it with style, the teaser being an absolute gem. Lance Guest does an extraordinary job of making a credible character from Kyle Lang, and Jack Rader sees threats like Ed Meecham. Forget about the dubious originality of the Fearful Symphony and enjoy it as a deeply satisfying X file.
