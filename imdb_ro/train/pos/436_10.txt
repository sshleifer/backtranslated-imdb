I loved this movie absolutely. I'm not even sure what this particular about, but I think it was great and it should be available for DVD. The women were strangers and yet they did quite well to spend the time spent in Villa in Italy. The actors, in my opinion, have done an excellent job. Characters were so different and yet intelligent that they made it work. There is humor, drama and relationship problems in a timely manner. This requires 10 lines, but I can not think of anything else to say, so I will revolt until I get 10 rows. Sorry about that. What else can I say it's been a long time since I last saw it. I look forward to seeing it again, but it is not available.
