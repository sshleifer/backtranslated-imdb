I saw "Fever Pitch" a kind of crash; play on the plane that was going to Europe. In fact, it was not bad at all. Ben (Jimmy Fallon) is world # 1 Red Sox fan, but his relationship with Lindsay Meeks (Drew Barrymore) can defeat him. The film is a quite interesting look at how world events can affect peoples' relationships. It's especially the opening of the eyes now that Red Sox has ended its cancellation for 80 years. I think these kinds of things happen all the time and we do not have the tendency to notice them. Not very bad. Another movie that has an unusual relationship with baseball is the "Frequency" of 2000. Check them both out.
