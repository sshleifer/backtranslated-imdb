Let me start by saying that at the age of 34 I was a widow. I was devastated because he was not sick - he died unexpectedly from a coronary - his carotids exploded - died behind our house. There was a lot of speculation on the part of the police, because he fell on something and was beating his head inside. I was a murder suspect until the autopsy returned. <br /> <br /> My children were as traumatized as me, so they are in love with a good father like him. I had three young children, no education, no financial support. I took it very, very hard. <br /> <br /> Within two years, my Indians attacked me verbally, physically, emotionally and spiritily, calling me dissatisfied with the children and putting on masks and showing people what they wanted to see, do not show my pain during the holidays ... No one stood up for me and my choice to stay on a vacation except, of course, the pain therapist I had seen, who advised me to follow my heart and the soul. My in-laws have failed! FOREVER changed my relationship with them and never returned for a holiday. This is just an example of how my pain has not been respected! My husband (new) saw me disappeared talking about the trauma when I shared my soul. I crash, I can not breathe, hyperventilate, and generally I'm dead for a few days if I even try to convey the hidden pain. <br /> <br /> Now about this movie ... Today, my soul has been moved, my heart broken. My fears and pains reappeared from the true demons this film poses; how somebody is saddened in comparison with how others are waiting for us and the demons inside. Adam Sandler has perfectly interpreted the terrible agony you face, overcame, and especially work in your own time! This movie has revealed all the pain I've been trying to do over the years. See, when something hurts your soul so deeply, so profoundly that statements are all that comes from your mouth in moments of thought, you can not do without wanting to die and go through life in a state of death. The Bible has a scripture in Romans 8:26, to which I cling, that when my mouth and my soul do not know what to pray, the Holy Spirit of God bears that agony at God's feet - - I do not have to talk. Sandler portrayed this to perfection! <br /> <br /> There is a scene where he was shot in court for mental health purposes, and he returns to his / her laws --- and tells them the amazing truths he / she has possessed, per se, that it can not be overcome. It's a powerful and powerful performance. I started dating and I had a difficult time after meeting in the salons to get out of the theater feeling my legs too weak to do that. My son was with me and saw it from my first hand, my exact movements, trying to keep it together; a lesson for him, the youngest of me, who remembers little of his father. It's been 13 years for me but this movie brought me back when I lost my ties forever when they asked for a mask on my emotions and surrender to my desires instead of my own respect. <br /> <br /> I write this, so if you're a griever, you're ready for this movie, but I highly recommend it in the 1000-star performance Sandler gave. <br /> <br /> If you are not yet a griever, please take a lesson from his movie and just listen and accept people's choices in their pain, allowing them to find peace in their time! Sometimes the soul can not utter words to convey our pain. <br /> <br /> Go to see this movie with tissues and not without getting ready to take it ... in your soul!
