I saw this movie back after I ordered my friend, who is a great fan of Dominic Monaghan. The movie itself was very interesting, although it had its positive points, which for me was Donnie Darko's "wtf" type? factor after the movie is over. Of course, positives also come with negative points. For me, the young guy in the movie was incredibly good, and Dominic Monaghan did a good job. Unfortunately, I do not have this opinion about Daniel Burke, who played Lonnie. This could be just me, and I do not pretend to be a serious critic in the way I do not find myself skilled enough, but he did not seem convincing as an actor. But maybe it's even more striking then, because although I'm not a critic, that draws my attention. In conclusion, everywhere I think it's definitely a movie worth watching. It's interesting, confusing and you should have seen it.
