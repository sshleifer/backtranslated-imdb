If you like the movie, do not miss this. If you prefer an action, a horror or a love story, then you'll be wondering what's going on. Everybody is stuck in a gangster movie. And what is happening is a transcendental crime. There are few similar films. No doubt he will see a limited release and will be hard to find. But the search will be worth it. If you want to study a mile as a potential symbol, then this is really a study film. You can not see it once. If you never see what's going on. Dark City is better. Joe Vrs. The volcano is more fun. But the time of the mad dog could turn the gangster crowd into symbolism. . or at least think twice before shooting again.
