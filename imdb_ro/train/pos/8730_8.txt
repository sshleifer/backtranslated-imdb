Many of the American people would say ... What ??? to my opening comment. Yes, I know that my comparison is undoubtedly an insult to Master Akiro Kurosawa's fans, but if you look at this movie, my commentary is correct. We have the peasant going to the town looking for help against a locust troop who wants to steal the harvest from the village. The big difference is how he told her. Our samurai, a band of circus interpreters, as in the original, are a very complex mix of personalities, but ultimately they are what the village needs, Heroes. You look back at this incredible movie (Seven Samurai, obviously) and find other movies that stole the story and tried to get the same magic effect as Akira Kurosawa's Masterpiece. A tip is the 13th Warrior with Antonio Banderas, Michael Crichton copied the story to write the best seller, but he did not find the third leg of the cat.
