While attempting to establish public empathy with Jake Roedel (Tobey Maguire), directors slander North and Jayhawkers. Missouri has never withdrawn from the Union, and the Union Army has not been an invasive force. The Sudanese fought for State Rights: the right to have slaves, to choose scary laws and judges, and to use a political system of waste. There's nothing noble about that. The Missouri could have traveled slightly eastward and joined the Confederate Army. It seems to me that the story has nothing to do with ambiguity. When Jake leaves Bushwhackers, not because he has seen an error in his path, he certainly does not give the virtues of the cause of abolition.
