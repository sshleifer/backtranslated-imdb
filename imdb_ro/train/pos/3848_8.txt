Gerard is a rather nourishing writer. He is also a homosexual and a Catholic susceptible to Catholic guilt and to something clairvoyant, or so it seems. On a trip to Flushing, he is "seduced" by Christine. When he discovers that Christine's new boyfriend is a bit of tough commerce, he was fancy by far, he decides to stay around. After all, forced heterosexuality has compensations. Then he realizes that Christine's three husbands have died violently dead. Christine killed them and is he or his friend, Herman, who will be the "fourth man"? Verhoeven's overheated melodrama is a delicious combination of Hitchcock and David Lynch, full of OTT eroticism and religious imagery and a pile of red. Much of the time seems and feels like a dream and we can never be sure that what we see is real or a fantasy of Gerard's imagination. The fun is finding it. Also, the fact that Christine is an infinitely more pleasant character that neither Gerard, nor the most ardent Herman, means we do not like to miss any of the men above her. In fact, it's fair to say that Gerard's coming can not come soon. Also superb performances from Jeroen Krabbe and Renee Soutendijk and Verhoeven's best film, to the fantastic subversive "Starship Troopers" song.
