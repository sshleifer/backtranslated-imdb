I liked! What do not you like? - Do you have your suburbia, you have a zombie, have family problems, have your social dilemma, have you gotten a single retro-style 1950s? Whether it's the top crust of the next table. You could not ask for more. The distribution is superb. Carrie Ann Moss is an absolute perfection as a homewalker for social climbing. It is both bad and conspiratorial crime. Every man's dream. K'sun is really great as the son just trying to be as normal as possible in this nightmare existence, and succeeding in some way. It's a real screen presence. Very photogenic and natural. Without naming everything, the rest of the camp is wonderful. Henry Czerny plays a suspect policeman, with stifled instincts and a little noise, as if he were his everyday person. Billy Connolly is delightful like Fido. A good actor: I wish he played the lead role in "Braveheart," with director Gibson. My feeling is that William Wallace would have been closer to the real character. Its Fido is content but accessible. A pleasant touch. In short, a wonderful and wonderful satirical insight into morals, values, social meanings, feelings, growth, coping in unsafe moments and compensatory adjustments to impossible conditions. A real show of reality.
