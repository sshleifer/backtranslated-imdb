What an absolutely amazing movie if you have 2.5 hours to kill, look at it, you will not regret, it's too fun! Rajnikanth bears the film on his shoulders and, although there is nothing else but him, I still liked it. Music by A.R.Rehman takes time to grow up on you, but after you have heard it a few times, you even start to like it.
