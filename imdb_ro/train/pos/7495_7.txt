Dwight Frye steals this film as a crazy young man (who seems to be mentally handicapped) blaming himself for vampire crime, especially when he reveals his love for bats who like to hit him and give him give friends who do not give gifts! Besides all this, there is a story of fun mysteries involving the killing mentioned above. Underestimated.
