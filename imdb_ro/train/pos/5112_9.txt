This movie has everything, action, fighting, dancing, bull, music, beautiful girls. This film is an authentic look at Middle America. Believe me, I was there in 1980. A lot of oil money, a lot of women and a lot of hardworking tonics. Too bad they all left now. The film is essentially just another boy meets with the girl, the boy loses his girl, the boy becomes a girl, but he is redeemed by actors and music. There is absolutely no movie with any better music than this movie, and that includes the American Graffiti. It's a movie that I always watch and never get tired of. Every time I look at her, I'm young again and it's time to get out of tonky. The only reason I gave her a 9 is that you can not rate a movie at zero, I do not think you should miss a 10.
