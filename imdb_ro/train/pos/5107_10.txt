What went over the soundtrack of the '80s. I imagine John Travolta sang a few songs, but watching the film seems to personify everything that was the cheese of the 80s. Obviously, films based on mechanical bulls, bartenders and immature relationships were in style. The best was his bad accent in Texas. Compare this with Friday Night Lights.I suggest watching Cocktail and Crazy News to really start getting into dumbing down the movie. Also, as a side note made in America with Ted Danson and Whoopie Goldberg is a great movie. I was so shocked that I realized I had never seen it. Another strange movie of this kind should include Cadillac Man with Robin Williams. Just remember that all these great stars have played great roles in these CHEESY movies .. Tom Cruise, Richard Pryor, Robin Williams and John Travolta
