For me, this review may contain spoilers, but I like to watch movies with NO idea what will happen, so I think many of the other reviews in this movie contain spoilers! I have watched this movie again and I have to reiterate that it has the best result for any movie. Ever. Ever. Ever. The actual translation, "Butting Butterflies", is not strangely used as a translated title. I suppose they believed that most Americans would not know what Chaos theory is (except for those who have seen or read "Jurassic Park"). The film is based on the theory of chaos and how a small event can affect the outcome of seemingly unrelated events that all lead to an event. The film is a whirlwind of wonderful cause and effect, as we follow the chain of chaos while interconnecting between several characters (about 20?). In a way, the conclusion seems inevitable in spite of this, but if you think about it, it is a perfect end. Think of yourself, "what else do you have to say"? It is, at the same time, an extremely courageous ending. Too bad we have to go abroad for a precious stone like this, but such an end would never go out of Hollywood. <br /> <br />
