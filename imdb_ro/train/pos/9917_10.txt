This is the most confrontational documentary I've ever seen. It was a simple and breathtaking vision of a beautiful idea. Based on photos of hidden industrial landscapes centered around China's modern industrial growth, Edward Burtynsky brings to life problems we chose to ignore the easier. Without political parties, this film is neutral the moving image of the realities our Western societies choose not to educate - the by-products of economic growth, the externality paid by the citizens of the less developed communities, the source of our comfort and the waste of the lifestyle of consumers. /> <br /> Amazing, heart-breaking, impossible to ignore. This is a challenging journey, but it is worth taking - please do not remain ignorant and see at least these pictures of the truth without feeling the pressure to take a stand in front of these issues. 10/10 safe!
