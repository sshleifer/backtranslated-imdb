I looked at this movie waiting for what I have: good cowboy stuff. What really surprised me was the fact that Kurt Russell did such a wonderful job with an extremely limited role. Imagine trying to act in accordance with these two restrictions: you have almost no dialogue, and since you play a hardass, military robot, you are not allowed to show emotions using facial expressions! Howz? Like asking a diva to make a great deal while she was swallowed and embedded. Despite being verbally and expressively mutilated, Russell makes an incredible characterization. His robot becomes a man, despite his constraints. A great job! As usual, Jason Isaacs assures that he will fall into history as a great portarist of the perfect bastards - the one you would love to see and split. Connie Nielsen was sweet, soft, motherly and gorgeous. I do not know how much the impression is based on her acting and how much physical beauty, but it was hard to take your eyes off her. Unfortunately, Gary Busey's role was too small and limited. <br /> <br /> Much of the plot is quite standard, with a lot of weaknesses, but having a sense of comic book, I do not understand what's wrong with a few weaknesses. By the end of the story, the good guy wins, and the appreciative audience receives a lot of emotional satisfaction. Yes! What kind of feeb who thinks Russell did not do a good job of acting is the same kind of feeb who missed the whole point.
