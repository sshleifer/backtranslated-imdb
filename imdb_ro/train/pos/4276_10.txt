At first glance, who is singing there seems to be an absurd and excellent comedy? with one type of unusual, quiet and slow movement: what a mistake! <br /> <br /> Beginning with two singers on a desert landscape, then a bus and a bunch of wonderful actors, hid a gem! The folded story and a false rhythm induce you to think, yes, it is comic, but it lets you guess it will be a gentle film. <br /> <br /> Not at all: very funny instant, subtle cynically subtle to others, his development surprises the whole story? Very ingeniously and intelligently presented, all the characters are important, and the actors give them full life. And what is amazing is based on a profound observation, a great mastery of camera work and it has great significance and in fact everything, the general direction and the way the details are presented, makes you forget that it is a movie : It's like looking at a good human society you still do not know, shot by a friend behind a room <br /> <br /> And you are the one behind him. It's simple and simply exceptional! Do not get me wrong; in any case it would not mean scenario, image quality, the musical score has a kind of amateur, no, no! It's a great art! <br /> <br /> Because it flows like a river? From the top of the mountain to the sea, with all sorts of lands and pavilions that a true river will make on its journey to the sea? from a small thing to a mainstream. This metaphorical image I've used is the best way I can find to explain all the charm that Who's singing there. For me, again, I'm taking the hammer: it's just an extraordinary ... Did I see that it was the director who made the Chat Blanc / Chat Noir, which I know is famous? But, as I have not seen it yet, I had no idea about this gentleman. Other commentators have written ditirambic comments on this movie, I agree totally! <br /> <br /> European Eastern Cinema is not well known because it is rarely translated, but I'm lucky to have a copy in the original language with good English subtitles. All in all: Deep, delicious and exceptional ... <br /> <br /> For fast and bare explosions and exceptional special effects, avoid at all costs, it can be too subtle and good for you! > <br /> But if you are interested in different genres and / or classics, I think you will not regret this, and if you buy, it will have a good company in your personal dvd library, less so than big names, such as Billy Wilder, Lubitsch or Sacha Guitry, among some of my favorite directors. At least for this movie! *** A movie is never very good if the camera is not an eye in the head of a poet Orson Welles ***
