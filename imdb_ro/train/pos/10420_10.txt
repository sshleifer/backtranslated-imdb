The Great Caruso displays the unique talents of Mario Lanza. He has a great capacity for acting and is in the top band as a lyrical interpreter, accompanied by Dorothy Kirsten, soprano of the Metropolitan Opera. Indeed, I dare to say that he plays better songs than Caruso (checks A'Vuchella from Tosti and La Danza from Rossini). MGM's art and music departments have also done a good job. This movie might be perfect if it is not for the strange presence of Ann Blyth; we see that she is trying to do her best, dressed in the style of the fifties in scenes just before 1920 - unforgivable. Lanza deserved a better lady, and Blyth should stay on less demanding productions. You also notice that Ms. Kirsten plays most of the opera duets of the Lanza film, giving the wrong idea that Caruso had a sort of permanent soprano.
