saw this in preview - a great movie - wonderful features - clever and intelligent dialogue - the actors were fantastic - Peter Falk will be an Oscar - Paul Reiser was enchanted - the photo was wonderful Reiser was in the theater when I saw the movie, and he related about making the film - it was a long dream for him to write a semi-autobiographical story about the relationship between sons and fathers, and more precisely between himself and his father - this was done in a dramatic and fun fashion - support casting was well-chosen and gave the film a sense of family-I recommend this movie to anyone who is miss to see the dramatic drama and wonderful performances
