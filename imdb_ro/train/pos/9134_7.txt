The "Purple Rain" was never the sake of criticism, it is a classic cult - and deserves to be. If you are a fan of the prince, this is for you. The main plot is the prince seeing his parents abusively in himself and falling in love with a girl. Do you think this movie is not just singing and dancing. There are many intense and exciting scenes. Sometimes it disables fun, but when it works, it really works. Very hit and miss no one. No one can really act in the movie. Everyone is one of the parts of Prince acting as "Time" and "Vanity 6". Still, it adds a charm to the movie. When Prince is on the screen, he lights it up and it's fun to see him at his commercial peak. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, go and see this if you love the prince like me. If you're not a fan, it'll make you one.
