When I heard that Patrick Swayze was finally returning to his acting career with KING SOLOMON's mind, I was very excited. I was expecting a great Indiana Jones action adventure. What I received was a 4-hour epic (with commercials) that was very slow. The second and third hour could have been abandoned altogether and the story would not have suffered for her. The end was good (not spoilers here), but we still needed more. Well, all he can do is prey Swayze to make "RoadHouse 2" so he can get back to the kind of action that made him famous. Until now, if King Solomon's mine miners did not read the book or you did not see the 1985 version with Richard Chamberlain and Sharon Stone, which is also not very good, but the only hour and forty minutes of your life went instead 4 hours.
