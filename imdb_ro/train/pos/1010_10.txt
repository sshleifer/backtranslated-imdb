I like this show! Every time I watch an episode, I repeat that line and I remember how good a show is. I am a fantastic sci-fi fan and this show has reason to be the most important science show (fiction?) From film / TV history. There are so many theories in this show about the universe where I could start a religion. It's amazing, season after season, the show gets better and better. I have been a fan of MacGyver since I was 5 years old (19 years old) and it seems so ironic to me that my favorite TV shows always star Richard Dean Anderson. It is also interesting how each character is virtually opposed to the other. Back when I first saw Stargate, I liked it instantly and considered it one of my favorite SF movies, then I heard the TV show will change from him I was very excited but did not have time the show until the fifth season was almost over. Although, I am disappointed to hear that Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin wanted to make a movie trilogy, but the studio preferred the series. <br /> <br /> He told me he was doing well. Maybe even better. This show is amazing and I hope it will never die. Atlantis here we come!
