The undoubted benefit of this film is the performance of Peter O'Toole. In his turn, wild comic and terribly terribly tragic. Does anyone do better than O'Toole? I do not think. What a wonderful story a man has! The story is strange and quite disturbing and emotionally intense in parts (especially to the end), but it is also strange touches and succeeds on many levels. However, I felt that the film was spinning around Peter O'Toole's bright performance and I'm sure I would not have enjoyed even half if it was not in him.
