I've been to this look several times, since I realized it was a great, dated, dated comedy. Well, it's a romantic comedy and maybe a little dated. However, it is not too sentimental, touching as it happens on office politics, adultery and loneliness. Do you think you know exactly where things are going, but there is an element of unpredictability that keeps your interest, and not everything is proven as you expected. But there is enough intelligence and charm to achieve the most innocent cynic. If you meet someone who does not like this movie, consider seriously how well you want them to know.
