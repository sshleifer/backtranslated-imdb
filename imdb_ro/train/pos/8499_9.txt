A funny East-West movie influenced by the closure of GM Flint, Michigan in the 1980s and the growth and integration of Japanese manufacturers in the United States. Located in West Pennsylvania, it offers great performances by Michael Keaton, Gedde Watanabe and George Wendt. Stevie Ray Vaughan's blues legend music.
