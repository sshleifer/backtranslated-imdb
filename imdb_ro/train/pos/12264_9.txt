If you have a close and long relationship with the Tintin world .... do yourself a favor and watch this beautiful documentary about Hergé and his life creating Tintin. It is so brilliant and a very cold production. The whole background story about Hergé and the people and also many different situations in which he was influenced by good and evil is amazing. There is a very fine and obvious connection between comic books and just that. I'm definitely going to be in my basement to get the Tintin albums again. Also, the movie itself is very well said and has great ambient sound to. I really hope that people will find it as exciting as me!
