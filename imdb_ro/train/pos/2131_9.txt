This is a movie that improves every time I see it. There are so many nuances in this respect. William Tracey, like Pepi, is a pleasure, bringing a comical relief. Joseph Schildkraut as Vadas, is the only "villian" in the movie, and his fat charms are used here. Frank Morgan, he is delightful as the owner of the title store, Mr Matuschek, and his familiar way is well used here. I liked Felix Bressart's performance more like Pirovitch. Very credible in every aspect of his role. The two chances are the same, with Margaret Sullivan doing a remarkable job of portraying a slightly desperate, neurotic, but charming and appealing woman. <br /> This movie belongs to Jimmy Stewart. The film is presented from its point of view, with the action that rotates around it. Mister. Stewart is more than the task of wearing the movie, with amazing performance that uses a wide range of emotions. Just watch Stewart when he was fired from work because of a misunderstanding. He is able to convey the shock, anger, fear and embarrassment that causes such an event so traumatically so. In my opinion, James Stewart is undoubtedly the greatest film actor in the history of the environment. There is no one else who has ever been captured on the film, who can transmit so much what he feels to an audience. When he made this film, he still had the bulk of his career before him, yet he is the master of his profession. This is one of the best Jimmy Stewarts movies and also one of the nicest and most enjoyable romantic comedies you will find. I highly recommend this movie, especially for those who appreciate Stewart's work.
