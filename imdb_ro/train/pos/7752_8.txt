The bartender just wanted to make a movie because he wanted it. Just as simple as this, and succeeded. Not only for his purpose but also for making a wonderful, especially visual, film. He knows how to use pans, slow sequences, pictures, crane images, etc. in a beautiful and smooth way. This gives the film a very relaxing feeling. The story relates to the lives of 8 very different characters, who have nothing in common except one thing: a party to which everyone is involved; the turnpoint of this movie. The beauty of this image is not the question of how the characters have an effect on the others (compared to a similar movie, better than Magnolia). I just do not think this was the idea of ​​the Bartender. Beauty is in the different details of the experiences people encounter, which makes them or their lives destroyed. The bartender is very successful in telling those stories describing few experiences. He knows people ..... and Antwerp. The soundtrack of the film is also excellent, but it is not a surprise, as we know that the Bartender is also a successful composer and musician with the dEUS band. Music is sometimes hot and at the same time relaxing, which contributes to the smooth, sunny feeling of the film. Besides, we hear pop / rock funky songs that give some scenes the power they need. There's only one flaw, and that's the last half an hour. Was it the operating time that was breaking me? Or were not the latest fresh and accurate scenes up until then? I can not figure it out ... Everything is a beautiful, sunny film that raises the Belgian cinema. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ b> (The breeze flowing through a girl's hair in a sunny afternoon making her even more beautiful is the fresh breeze that makes you relax when you wake up in a busy party when someone open the door, is the breeze that carries the fragrance of a beautiful girl sitting next to you in the park, which you just met a week ago, is the breeze .....) <br /> <br />
