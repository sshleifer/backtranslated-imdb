This movie uses cinema fantastically, the depth of the room captures each character. Denzel Washington and Kevin Kline performed wonderful performances, although Washingtons did not die in certain scenes. How is this movie forgotten? unable to rent and rent lately threatens to be lost forever. a worrying idea. Attenborough at its best in Ghandi, this piece masters what it should in movies like these, without worrying to win the audience rather a cry of freedom in the SOUT african apartheid. Although criticized for biased nature, the film is faithful to Donald Woods's book and faithful to the message intended to express the world. you and peace
