If you have any idea about Jane Austen's production, you will now repeat the same in each of his novels: marriage, marriage, and marriage! In my opinion, all the films made in her novels are a bit boring, but I like Austen's characters, because they all have a certain personality and typical words they like to repeat, as well as in Emma. The thing that makes Emma good is Gwyneth Paltrow, he is very good at his lead role. Also, the fact that each of the characters in the film does not seem to be able to think anything other than to get a good partner and soon married makes the movie hilarious.
