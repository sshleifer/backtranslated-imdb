A change in Outlook is necessary to enjoy modern British films, one that in a way allows them to be seen in their own right and in their own qualities, rather than by the criteria that American films are judged. Britfilm must try hard to be stony and it's hard to do it, but in the warmth of British movies can master otherwise overwhelming competitor. <br /> <br /> Their film does not fail in its content, but in itself attaches to its predecessor, allowing it to be easily seen as a work of the star and the director, somewhere at the end of their ties. It's a few decades later, learning Gregory and this time with two girls in his mind. He teaches school to stop human rights violations. When the students he fired abuses find in the middle of them he has to face if he is just talking. <br /> <br /> This is a subversive movie in the fact that it is not the ordinary world of any American movie that you expect to do whatever it does, but a naive boy who can still put everything on the line for principles. May be. There is certainly no protest, being too hot. If the US film may seem realistic, as these are British urban movies and pebbles, this and others in recent years - those who do not try to fit America for visceral hard feelings - are real because British humor reveals truths.
