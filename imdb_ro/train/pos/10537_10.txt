This movie was very funny, I was not able to smile when watching this and I already saw it twice in a 2 day period! The film is uniquely distinctive in its humor and pictures, both of which are marvelous and parallel to Natali's other cinematographic stones, Cube and Cypher. I became a huge fan of Vincenzo Natali from watching Cypher and everything he did is very exciting. The likes of Dave and Andrew, portrayed by David Hewlett and Andrew Miller (co-writer of the story), are a very enjoyable film about this film, actors he loves. Also, there are wonderful X-Box Dead or Alive battles (you even see Dave playing Halo at one point) and Andrew's guitar solo among many other things. All in a great movie about friendship. You have to see this!
