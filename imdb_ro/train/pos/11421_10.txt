I do not know what the previous reviewer had seen, but I think it's about reviews, personal taste. Lost in this film was the depth, a very profound film, many layers of emotion, which affects. The sub-current of love hidden from subjection to the beliefs of society, the taboos of times and class, racial relations are not in a very good state of equality, guilt, desire, hatred, confusion, very dark emotion, I thought under the skin you would you're going to make the movie, a film that flows, not slowly, as you said before, to release yourself into the flow of the movie, the emotions will show up, the characters reveal their flaws, their ugly, excellent and even cruel interiors!
