This movie is truly authentic and random. It's very hard to find movies like that in Hollywood movies. I really enjoy watching this movie, bought my DVD this week and watched it 4 times. I like Paz's spanglish accent, she's really cute like her. And her acting and Morgan's are so fun and natural. My movie taste may be really different from others, but I have to say that I really love this movie, it's just the best! <br /> <br /> I learned a little more about life in this movie (well, or at least the life of the US) ... life is really random ... Sometimes meet someone, go through your life and be your coincident friends, and u do not spend so much time with them, perhaps only a while, but u rejoice that "in time" with them, and then u and they will never meet again, but u are together is really unforgettable. Keep those moments in your mind as grateful and beautiful memories ... This movie could be cheap at the price, but its meanings are not totally cheap. Rarely I can learn some of the movies, but this is an exception.
