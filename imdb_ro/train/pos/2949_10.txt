This is the funniest aspect I've ever seen and I think it's the funniest thing I'll ever see. If you do not feel like laughing at absolute adoption, then it is not just a cup of tea. But, honestly, I do not know anyone who saw this thing that she did not like. It's 17 years later and my friends and I still quote everything from Goonie Goo Goo to the Fart Game, Aunt Bunnie to the Ice Cream Man, Ralph and Ed to Get Out! There are just as many individual and collective hobbyist collections here, if, if you have not honestly seen this movie, you are missing out on one of the best stand-ups ever. Take any of Robin Williams, Damon Wayans, Dice, George Carlin or even the greatest ones like Richard Pryor or Red Foxx and that will overcome it. I do not know how and where Murphy took part of his material, but it works. That's what's coming. It's funny like hell. Could you imagine how this show must have shocked people who were accustomed to Eddie making buckwheat and Mr. Rogers and so on SNL? If you listen to the audience when they create their first joke or when they say the word F for the first time, they are in full shock. The first time he says the word F when he skits about Mr. T being a homosexual. "Hey boy, hey boy, you look very cute in her jeans Now come here, and f ** me up the ass!" The crowd bursts into the roar of laughter. No one expected the dirty mouth he had unleashed. But the results were great. I have never been mocked with an unusual comedy, as I was in this stand-up. In fact, the next time my stomach suffered so much of laughter was not until 1999 when I saw SOUTH PARK: MORE AND UNCUT. This comedy was raw and unapologetic and went to the jugular, just like DELIRIOUS. I do not think it's possible to watch this piece of comic history and not to laugh. It's almost twenty years later and it's still the funniest thing on the video. "I took your fishing kids last week, and I put the worm on the hook and the kids put the pole back into the boat and cut their heads in the water for two minutes Gus, normal children do not shit like that Gus, then they started to move their heads around so and m **** f ***** with fish. Then they looked at each other and they said Goonie Goo Goo I said you can believe that's it ?! <br /> <br /> See it again and be ready to laugh your ass <br /> <br /> 10 of 10
