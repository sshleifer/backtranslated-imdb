I think this movie is a very funny film and one of the best films "National Lampoon's" also has a very attractive spoofing title, which essentially summarizes what the whole movie is about .... Men In White !!!! The story is a spoof of many movies, including a Will Smith movie, as you could have guessed, "Men In Black". I will not end, but it has a very good ending, it's very funny (Leslie Nielsen's humor) from start to finish, especially near the beginning, when you're on the street collecting garbage cans. They also have a pretty cool pickup truck (truck collecting trash) in that scene. The act is not gorgeous, in fact, it's not very good, but that's what makes the movie funny, it's a comedy, it's weak! I like the story line, partly because it's touched so far and partly because it's interesting to see how subtle (or un-subtle) it is to rip all the other movies. I'm a big fan of some inappropriate movies, but I'm a fan of real things, and with these movies it's hard to decide what's best, the movie is mainly deployed (mentioned above in this review) or the real movie is, but even when you actually make a spoof of comedy movies actually makes it even harder, but this movie does it successfully. The two men are so funny that it reminds me of a UK TV show called "Little Britain". This film is a must for your collection and is one of the best, funniest, funniest, best stories, the National Lampoon movie so far!
