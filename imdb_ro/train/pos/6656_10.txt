This movie is simply wonderful. It was a very delicate matter and the movie was superb. This film did not create any controversy in India (as far as I know), and its advertising was also low. First of all, I thought this movie would be simply a waste of time because most Indian directors and producers changed the theme even though they are very sensitive and adds a love story to the original story and destroy everything ... most Indian viewers would agree on this subject if you remember Ashoka, Mangal Pandey, LOC etc. <br /> <br /> There were so many movies in India that would have become a milestone or mega blows if the side of the love story would not have added uselessly. But his treatment is quite similar to that of the Pinjar movie (also a watch you have to watch). If it matters, I would like to thank Anil Kapoor (producer) and Firoz Abbas Khan (director) for making such a great movie.
