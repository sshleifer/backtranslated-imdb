The woman in black is fantastic in all aspects. It's scary, suspense and so realistic that you can actually see it happen in real life. I first saw this on TV in 1989 and, with all the lights turned off and the volume that appeared, was probably the weirdest experience of my whole life. I managed to get a copy and now I assure myself that I will take it out of every Halloween and show the family members who are less suspect who have no idea what to do, and all I can do is laugh at joy. As for the movie, start with a young attorney named Arthur Kipps, who is appointed by his firm to go to Cryptin Gifford Marketplace to resolve the documents of a recent deceased client - Mrs. Alice Drablow. <br /> <br /> This film begins as a solid and exciting ghost story. But then, Arthur takes part in the funeral, and from that scene we do not feel safe. We are always at the edge and bite our nails, and this happens in the next hour to the final, thrilling final. A warning to all new viewers: do not look at yourself. ..
