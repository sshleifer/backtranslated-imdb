How to Lose Friends & Alienated People are in all honesty one of the best comedies we've seen this year along with Paneapple Express and Step Brothers. It's not one of those "gross" comedies, which rely heavily on jokes and humming of the toilet, but it moves in an arduous rhythm and you'll be easily attached to the narrative that's unfolding. Simon Pegg goes crazy in his coffin with his hilarious portrait of a fish character, and quickly detaches himself from the tripod in which he was part of England (the other two being Nick Frost and Edgar Wright). Getting started at the top of the Hollywood food chain is hard to do, as we can see clearly with Pegg, his first jab at the lead role was David Schwimmer's Run Run Fatboy Run comedy, but he received hot reviews from critics and the public alike. The second attempt is this movie, it received quite positive reviews from the majority, but it was a box-office flop. I, because one has not yet lost his confidence in him and will be there whenever he wants to take the third blow for glory. Other characters were well cast from Jeff Bridges to Danny Huston and Gillian Anderson. Surprisingly, Kirsten Dunst, in my opinion, did well in this film as a love angle to Pegg's character, however, the spark I saw in Interview with the Vampire is still lost. It has to find it quickly, or suffer the consequences of the loss of forever in the "rom-com" country.
