I can understand why some people like this movie, and why some people do not. For me, though, I really like it, even if I noticed some good bits and not such impressive bits. The animation was really great, like Charlie's dream. The characters were a mixed bag, the best being Anne-Marie, expressed by the young Judith Barsi. (I was physically ill when I read what happened to her) Carface is also a very convincing character, especially expressed by the wonderful Vic Tayback (I especially liked "Morons are surrounded by monsters") and together with Rasputin and Warren T.Rat is probably the most memorable of all Don Bluth characters. Charlie and Itchy did not have the same glimpse, but I loved King Gator and his song. Some of the movies are very haunting, such as Annabelle's "You Can Never Come Back" which still scares me. Unfortunately, there were some bits I did not like so much. The story had the tendency to become clumsy and nefocused, but Disney's Black Cauldron suffered from the same problem. There were also some dark scenes, that little children would be upset, but the end is very moving. However, the biggest flaw was the gentle songs and how they were sung. None of them, in particular, comes out except "Let's do music together" and "Love survives," and Burt Reynolds can not sing, and Dom DeLuise has performed much better. Overall, a watchable movie that could have been more, but it is certainly memorable, and I would certainly see it again. 7/10. Bethany Cox
