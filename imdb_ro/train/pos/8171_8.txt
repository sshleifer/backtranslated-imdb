I realized that this review would make me bother with the film critics expert patrolling this site, but I will defend this film. The dentist is actually a very good movie. The actress is not always of prime importance, but the emotions are good and the story is good. Plus you see Linda Hoffman's boobs. Not that I am an expert in this field, but the direction looks good and the intrigue makes sense. Corbin makes a great dentist creepy. The dentist does what you do with sharks ... ish. Obviously, he had a rather limited budget, but they did well with what they could, and they developed well the characters (the ones that matter).
