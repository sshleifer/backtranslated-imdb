Other commentators have summed up this noir movie well. I just wanted to add to "Whew!" comment on a commentator made about Elisha Cook's episode, obviously coking. This was a doozy, I have to say. Cook deserved an appreciation for his frenetic performance. A bit of the trivia that they claim: Cook appeared as a waiter in the 1941 movie, Barbara Stanwyck, "Ball of Fire". She was a waitress in the nightclub where Barbara sang, and the legendary drummer Gene Krupa pours the most energetic. Is it too much to suggest that Cook's splash drum in the later film, Phantom Lady, was very inspired by Krupa's work, as Cook noticed 3 years ago? <br /> <br /> If you look at Krupa in Ball of Fire, I think you will notice some similar body movements. We hope, of course, that He was not influenced by any medicine at that time!
