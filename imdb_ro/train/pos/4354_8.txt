I saw this film back at the 2005 Palm Springs International Festival and from the 14 films I saw there I would have ranked fourth. The 900+ Theater was full and eventually received a standing ovation. This was the classic Peter Falk if you are a Falk fan and you showed a lot of chemistry between the characters of Peter Falk and Paul Reiser. The title of the film seemed long and too strange. I'm surprised that this did not make the general release. This was much better than most of the garbage that major studios threw on you. Maybe too adults in the sense that it was targeted at the child's boomer and senior audience. A lot of people might refer to the situations in this movie. This will probably enjoy a revival of years like this now when people look back at this film and consider it a kind of jewel. I would rate this 8.0 to 8.5 on a scale of 10 and I certainly recommend it.
