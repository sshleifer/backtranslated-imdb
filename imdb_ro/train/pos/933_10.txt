I saw this movie in the sixth grade around Christmas Time and I was very excited to see it and when I heard that George C. Scott was in it, I was very excited because I love George C. Scott! When I and my class watched this movie, I was really in it, and when it was over, I was really impressed, I thought it was completely fabulous! This is the best version of Charles Dickens's classic novel, which I have seen so far! George C. Scott's performance as Scrooge is something else, I thought he was the perfect choice, he was Scrooge, he's definitely Scrooge! I saw two different versions of a Carol Christmas, the other one is with Patrick Stewart, but this is the best! <br /> <br /> What is really wonderful about this is the act, I thought the actors were fabulous, they were all spirits, Tiny Tim, Bob Cratchit, they all could not find anyone better than they had made the parts! But the best part of the movie was George C. Scott! When I saw him, I thought he was the absolute best! He's definitely Ebenezer Scrooge, I do not think he could find someone better! I do not think he could find someone better to replace someone in the movie! <br /> <br /> This movie is probably the definitive adaptation of the film by Charles Dickens, and I think you will agree, you will think this movie is fabulous! Probably I have to buy this movie on DVD, because I thought it was completely fabulous! I fully recommend seeing this masterpiece! This is the best version of a Christmas Carol, period. <br /> <br />
