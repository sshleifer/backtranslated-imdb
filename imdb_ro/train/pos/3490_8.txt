This movie was pretty good. The actor was great and there were some very good actors, such as Buchholz and Roger Moore. This movie is full of surprises. It sometimes confuses ... yes, but the twists and turns of the plot always keep you in suspense. The only thing this movie had too much was the explosion of the cars.
