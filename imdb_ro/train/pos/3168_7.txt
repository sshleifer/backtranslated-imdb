This is a nice and sad story about cultural differences. Kyoko is a beautiful Japanese woman who ran to California to escape a relationship in Japan. Ken is a Japanese American manual worker with rock and roll aspirations but little concrete to offer a potential partner. Kyoko "marries" Ken to be able to stay permanently in the US, realizing that although they will live together until they get a green card, marriage will be in their name. It soon turns out that the parties are not on the same wavelength - or perhaps in the same "time zone", hence the title of the film. As an immigration lawyer, I saw that such "arrangements" take their own life, so I was delighted to see how well the director developed the dramatic possibilities of this situation.
