As Rockstar: INXS - and, indeed, the sequel, Rockstar: Supernova - are Paul Mirkovich, Rafael Moreira, Jim McGorman, Nate Morton and Sasha Krivtsov, as well documented by previous posters. Do not know who I am? These are wonderful and tight music bands, whose music and talent have made this show more than a sad American Idol clone. Remember Night of "Strings"? It was musical precision and perfection if I ever saw it. Suzie McNeil, an epic performance of Queen's "Bohemian Rhapsody", Ty Taylor's memorable cover for "You Can not Always Get ...", JD Fortune singing Suspicious Minds. The common name here is the awesome band of the house. As well as INXS were in the prime, they are unfortunately a shadow of their former self, although JD's live performance inspired a new life in their music, this show is about HB. Producer Memo: Season Three (if we are blessed to happen) should be Rockstar: House Band. Get the boys a good singer and they're going.
