Broadway and director-director John Cassavetes (from Rosemary's Baby) create a masterpiece with this film from 1977. It's about Genre Rowlands, John Cassavetes, Ben Gazzara, Joan Blondell, Paul Stewart, Zohra Lampert, Laura Johnson and Peter Falk. Movie Premise: An aging stage and film actress (Gow Rowlands) reevaluates their lives after an obsessed fan dies in a car accident trying to get an autograph. The film has a slow pace and a dark, frightening, frightening quality. He has a cinematic look for 60 years and even reminded me of Polanski's rosary child without supernatural horror. The fears here are those that every actress is successful - aging and becoming unnecessary in her career. Moreover, she feels that she has lived a life without real spirituality, humanity and merit. She lived only for her career - she has no children, she does not do charity, etc. The gradual disintegration of her personality is the flesh of this film. Crumbles. He's in a crisis. Genre Rowlands really enters the tormented psyche of the character and acts pretty well. She is a great actress and the film of the 70's is a refreshing contrast with the often violent films of the period and with the films of disaster or adventure thrillers. It's a movie with a lot of deep emotions, but it has a cold and cynical feeling, as if Cassavetes criticized 70th generation movies and actors. Whether that film is a product of the '70s, which was itself cynical in many ways - the deception of Nixon, Watergate, Vietnam, etc. Although the production values ​​are not high and this film is not well known, with funny states. Kudos to the underestimated and late Cassavetes who died in the late 1980s.
