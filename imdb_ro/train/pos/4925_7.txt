A clean condition against time - it is ascertained that a murdered John Doe has pneumonic plague, so while the Sanitary Authority and the NOPD are fighting with everyone and others trying to find their contacts on the waterfront, criminals believe the heat is due to the infected cousin of the victim dealing with them. <br /> <br /> This movie is available free of charge from the Internet Archive and is worth downloading. A lot of movies have been filmed in authentic New Orleans locations, which makes it interesting to analyze what's at present in detail, though for me it seems to be under-exposed, even for noir - maybe mobile lighting they were what they are. There is also a lot of background noise location, which is easy to distract - car horns in the love scene, anyone? There are a lot of unsurpassed artists in crowd scenes, and this can explain why the rhythm of the movie is easy to start at first - not much chance of resuming or reforming, although the chase end deserves to be suspended. There are not many mistakes with the actors who lead: Jack Palance is really scary as a smart and intelligent psychopath - the scene in which he cares and threatens the sick cousin is terrible, while Widmark, as is often the case, spreads the right angry of man on a mission to a credible level - most of the time. <br /> <br /> Someone should remake this - neither supernatural nor mystical, no special FX, just a good thread full of character conflict, and a topical theme. Another commentator mentioned writer John Kennedy O'Toole, and this is on the spot with the number of weird New Orleans types peppering this dark, underwear, anti-clock watch. There is even a cat newspaper vendor. <br /> <br /> "What community do you think you live in the Middle Ages?"
