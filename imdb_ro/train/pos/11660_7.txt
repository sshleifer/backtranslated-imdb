A beautiful piece of cinema for children buried in a world of archaic Celticism. Establishing the story around Kels's famous book, which was believed to have been encircled by monks on the small island of Iona, off the west coast of Scotland. Tells the story of a young apostate disciple who goes out in the woods, looking for Crom-Cruic, the fierce fierce executioner of pagan mythology. Hoping to recover a lost artifact. The true beauty movie is in his animation. Cell shaded in a luminous style and inspired by profound complexity, resulting in a look that seems less straightforward. Deriving much of the artistic style of the Samurai Jack series, the "Genius" cartoon series, for the brilliant use of markings and the depth of the background, Kels's Secret creates a consistent Celtic affectional world that lives under the shadow of the Viking invasion. History may be extremely inaccurate, and the modes of life presented are unrealistic, but these facts are absolutely irrelevant, because the film is set in a world of fantasy and Celtic-revivalist mysticism. The girl in the woods is a great addition and, in my opinion, makes the picture as it is, as it moves from branch to branch. Appearing and disappearing as a mysterious nymph, with similarities to the legendary Cheshire cats in Alice and Wonderland. The secret of Kels is an absolute treatment. For all genres, all ages, it's a wonderful piece of family cinema. Do not expect to be wonderful, but pleasantly impressed!
