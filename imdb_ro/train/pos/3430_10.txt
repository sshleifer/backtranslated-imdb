I caught this at screening at the Sundance Film Festival and was in Awe over the absolute power this movie has. It is an examination of the psychological effects on our courageous soldiers who join the army in the hope that they will protect and serve our country with honor, and that we will be taken care of by our government for that. The film details the psychological changes that take place in the boot camp as the soldiers are turned into "killers for their country" and put into war and after the effects after returning home. It also describes the effect that killing has on the human psyche. He pays tribute to soldiers and never criticizes soldiers as opposed to other films, but criticizes a system that is not prepared and does not care for all the physical and psychological needs of returning veterans. This movie is powerful, moving, emotional and provocative. It's a call to arms to support our troops not only by buying stickers and parades, but also by listening to them and by supporting a change in how their health and welfare are treated after the kill. <br /> <br /> The best film of the Festival so far **** / ****
