This is by far my favorite movie of all time. This is mainly due to the fact that she is not afraid to multiply on politically very incorrect topics (such as spanking and subjugating women) that other mass movies are too timid to touch. Nothing seems to be within the limits of this film, as the director freely develops the story without any concern to the spectator's offense. However, I do not think anything was done here just for the value of shock or to offend anyone. Sean Young turns into an excellent and courageous performance. The most important current actresses would not have taken over this role or would have requested major scenario changes before accepting them. The other casting members do a good job. Did you notice that this movie did not appear on a pay cable because a short deadline was given a year after it hit the theaters? Have you ever wondered why? The obvious reason is that it does not match the political atmosphere of today. It seems quite ironic to me that some premium channels are now receiving softcore pornography (which is getting closer to hardcore porn) but will not wear a mainstream movie such as Love Crimes. Unfortunately, even if this film is only 11 years old, it probably could not be done today
