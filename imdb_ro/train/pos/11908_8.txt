This movie plays very well with an audience. Especially when it starts chasing. In addition, Trevor Howard, with his clever smart intelligence and Jean Simmons, with his innocent behavior and piercing eyes are wonderful together. The film begins as a psychological drama, but after killing she meets in a thriller of chase as the two head their head toward the border. Some may think that pursuit is useless, but in fact search is essential because it helps to remove the mind of the character Jean Simmons by removing him from the oppressive household plus helping him bring the real killer - who is suddenly put into such a because he has to finish his job. The murderer rightly believed that once the Simmons character was arrested, he would have been left aside. And it is true that her lack of control in the household - as well as the evidence indicating her way - could not have come out of the murder charge. The resulting trace helps to remove the truth. This is a fun movie. Find him if you can find him.
