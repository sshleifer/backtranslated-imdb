Writer / director John Hughes covered all bases (as usual) with this funny movie "Sunday afternoon". "Curly Sue" is a sweet, early, orphaned, carefree "Bill" from the beginning. The couple lives their intelligence as they travel to the United States of America. Fate matches them with a "very cute" yuppie attorney, and the rest is predictable. Children will love this movie, as I can relate to the heroine played by Alisan Poter, who was 9 years old (who became "your run" of the Pepsi commercial). The character should be about 6 or 7 years old because he is invited to think about going to school. Some of her vocabulary suggests she is every day for 9 years or more. Similar to "Home Alone", there are lots of hat and small fists big fat fat men. Again, this is the "formulas" of film making, targeting a young audience. Fun and heart. Do not look for surprises, but be ready to throw a tear or two.
