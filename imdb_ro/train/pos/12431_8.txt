Okay, honestly, I saw the previews for this movie and I thought about what the producers think? Hutton, Jolie and Duchovni? How could the monotonous actor compete with Jolie's natural power on the screen? But surprisingly, the two of them had a kind of chemistry that showed intense care without a kiss. Even David's humor matched Jolie's spark and fire. As far as Hutton is concerned, he played the psyche very well, in contrast to David's deliberate delivery of life-threatening situations. Generally, I was very impressed with writing and developing characters. I gave her 8 stars.
