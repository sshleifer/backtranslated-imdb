The comic stripter between William Powell and Jean Arthur is the culmination of this mystery of murder, which has one of the most bizarre and unlikely plots ever. Powell is probably the smartest detective of the 1930s, and Arthur has a single voice that often seems to be a succession of small bells. I'm extremely fun to look at, so take a bump of plot with a grain of salt and enjoy just seeing how it unfolds. Eric Blore also has a series of comics as Powell's butler. Powell's contract with MGM included a clause that allowed him to rebut that he had been loaned to another studio, but he wanted to work again with Arthur and liked the script, so he was eager to accept the mission. They worked together in two Paramount films from 1929, the Canary Crime Case, and the Greene Crime Case, both in the Philo Vance series.
