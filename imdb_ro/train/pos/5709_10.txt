Made in 1931, this foreign film should be seen and enjoyed more often. We were opening in a small quiet village in France, scanning the roofs of the sleeping citizens. Then I heard something that seemed to be a party. In investigating the turbulence, two neighboring men are told about two men, alleged friends, who chose two lottery numbers. Our star in the picture has his number and his friend. When he asks his friend, he would divide half of the dough, if his ticket is the winning number, his friend promptly says no. In fact, H.E. double hockey no! is how he works in this sense. When our man discovers that he has the winning ticket and has been lost without his own fault, he is frenetic. Everyone is alone, looking for this ticket, in a sort of precursor to the "Great Race". Even though this is a flashback, I've been in the knots all the time and I'm mad at every little thing in this movie for cash-in-the-bank money. Watch Le Million today!
