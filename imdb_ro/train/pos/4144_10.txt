For a while I was caught in the trap where I woke up looking at independent and foreign movies and I lied that I liked it. Fatty Drives Bus is the exception. Is the truth. It's the best "bad" movie ever. "Badness" in this movie seems to come naturally. Halfway through the opening monologue of Satan, the word "Hell" appears at the bottom of the screen. The glamorous bridget is a man unrestrained in a wig and a store dress. It takes the eccentric couple who continues to try to kill each other FOREVER to walk the stairs. Jesus goes to a funk sound. Anyway, Fatty gives the impression that someone has lost their mandate to advise a senior movie project. But it is sincerity how bad it is that it does so wonderful. You have the impression that the producers knew it would be bad, but it never forced it. Never be duplicated, Fatty offers. Highly recommended.
