Sung as Steve Biko's story - he played excellently by Denzel Washington, as you'd expect - it was actually more of Donald Woods's story, played by Kevin Kline. This was undoubtedly Kline as a serious actor and he was surprisingly good in the role. Attenborough gave you that direction you would expect, and the often spectacular casts of the masses were just like he can get over. The rest of the distribution was competent enough and did a good job, which ends up as a sad sad story of a South Africa that is not anywhere near the distant past.
