This is easily the most underrated movie in the Brooks cannon. Sure, its defect. It does not provide a realistic view of homelessness (as Citizen Kane gave a realistic picture of salon singers, or Titanic gave a realistic picture to the Italians you call). Many of the jokes have fallen. But, however, this film is very appealing in a way that many comedies are not, and it's impressive to draw a story about some of the most angry members of society. He's not King Fisher, but he's not shit too. My only complaint is that Brooks would have to throw someone in the head (I love Mel as a director and writer, not as a lead).
