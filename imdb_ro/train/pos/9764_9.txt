I saw this movie at theaters when I was about 6 or 7 years old. I liked it then and I recently came to have a VHS version. <br /> <br /> My 4 and 6 year olds love this movie and ask again and again to look at it. <br /> <br /> I was glad to see him again. Although I must admit it is not as good on a small TV. I do not have bigger kids, so I do not know what she thinks. <br /> <br /> The songs are very cute. My daughter continues to sing them always. I hope this will help you.
