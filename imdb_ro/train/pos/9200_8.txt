I have read countless posts about this game being so similar to Max Payne when I first played it when I thought it was a strange arcade game with the desire to break the Max Payne style (not just the bullet bullet) . So when I played it for several hours I realized how fun it is! and how different from "Max Payne", yes, the bullet time is a bit similar but I think it fits differently to the game style. This game is a non-stop action - a combination of a shoot'em and a battle up, so fun, as a big fan of Max Payne, I have to say that the DTR story is not close to the greatness of Max Payne, the graphics are a bit medium and some of the levels look the same, but if you want a little more of that "bullet-time" you should definitely have this game.
