A good effort for an Australian show. which is probably not surprising, seeing it seems somewhat a revival of quality Aussie drama. dare to compare this show with the glow of my love? Not. but it reminds us of our secret early life. the song is great, gibney works on her magic in the first two episodes that I've seen, the British distribution is also strong, especially callum and lizzie characters. but abes forsythe may be the saving light (not that it needs saving) if this show is to get another season. I was not a fan of his performance in the wonderful miniature series of years ago, but he was great as an ever greener echo. also good to see Brooke Satchwell again. leaves the hope that the show continues to improve with each episode.
