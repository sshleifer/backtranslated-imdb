I'm not saying that just like a Chris Rock fan, I say this as a person who had little expectations coming into this movie and turned out to be wrong. The first flaw was that everything was over that everyone saw coming. The second error was that we found that the chemistry between Queen King and Chris Rock seemed fake. Finally, acting in this movie was sub-par, with the best actor being Regina King and the worst being Mark Addy. but I saw the past of the defect and I saw a solid comedy. In a heads-up scenario, watch out for the sky can expect in return, it's better. So for all fans of Chris Rock, REALLY HERE, you'll enjoy. He has a good stand-up in this movie. Overall: 7 out of 10
