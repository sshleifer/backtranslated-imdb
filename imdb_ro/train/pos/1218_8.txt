This cartoon was odd, but the story was actually less deep and emotional than other cartoons. We have a girl in a low self-esteem camp and hardly any other friends except a brother and sister who are just miserable as she is. She gets to the lowest point, and when she comes she does literally a pact with a devil demon. I found this film to be very real to life, and when things can not be worse, the girl sees what she has done, feels remastered and then changes and then helps this dark creature, the mystic to learn the human quality of love. Gemini improves too much by helping small bears and then receiving a sense of value in itself. A very positive message for children, although some elements of the movie were strange, was and still is a pretty good film. Stephen Bishop's music (Tootsie songs) made the movie even better
