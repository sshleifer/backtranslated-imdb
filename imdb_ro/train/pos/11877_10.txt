Directed by Brian De Palma and written by Oliver Stone, "Scarface" is a movie that will not be forgotten. A Cuban refugee named Tony Montana (Pacino) comes to America for the American dream. Montana then becomes "king" in the drug world, as he unleashes the Miami, Florida murder empire. This gangster movie is very violent, and some scenes are unpleasant to watch. This film has about 180 words F and has almost three hours. This movie is fun and you will never get bored. You enjoy the Lord of the drugs and, in some scenes, find that Montana is not as bad as other Lords of Crime. This is a masterpiece and I recommend you see this. You will not be disappointed. 9/10
