This is an excellent thriller, fast-paced by Wes Craven (Nightmare on Elm Street), which for 85 minutes leaves the supernatural aside and presents with something even more terrifying - the evil of human beings. We are more likely to meet Jackson Rippner's benign evil than Freddy Kruger, and Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins) does a great job of presenting a sociable killer, friendly and even charismatic. The performances of Murphy and Rachel McAdams (Claire from The Wedding Crashers) are great. Most of the film takes place at a very intimate level between two people, their eyes, their faces. It is action on a small scale, not a broad sweep of the cloth, and is no less convincing about these limitations. Cinema is nothing special, of course it can only be done with a camera within the limits of a passenger jet, but the dialogue is excellent, the story stretched out. There is no distraction, no subplot does not confuse the problem that is at the center of a battle between the main characters. By keeping his attention and avoiding distractions, Wes Craven is able to take what is a very minimal plot and turn it into an exciting, thrilling action thriller.
