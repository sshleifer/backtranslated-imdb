I really enjoyed this movie because there was a real sincerity in acting. The writing was top-notch. James Arness is a great actor and showed her here. Brian Keith was too old to be Davy Crockett and maybe somebody really play Davy but Fess Parker? Another great actor in this movement was Raul Julia, who brought deeper into Santa Anna, a vain and complex person who drove Mexico through turbulent times. While some might think that the movie was slow, he captured the battle as he unfolded, a lot of tedium followed by a few terrible horror hours. <br /> <br /> What impressed me most about this movie is that it has made you think of a cause and how some people are willing to die for what they believe in. On this day and age, when no one means anything, I found it refreshing I think there was a time when people died for freedom no matter how you can feel about the politics of the weather.
