I do not know whether it's a sitcom or not, but I agree that this is one of the biggest TV shows ever. It's great that this show is still running. And I love Michelle. He's cute in episodes when he was a kid and he talked and sometimes said something funny. Aw. This performance refers to children and adolescents and ... well, families while struggling through hard times and trying to work as a family. I do not know who would ever do the opportunity to watch the show with someone. <br /> <br /> I love the episode when I think her name is DD .. Bigger girl accidentally stole a blouse and learned a lesson about theft. It was a big episode. An example of this TV show that the family is working as a family. <br /> <br /> We recommend this show to everyone.
