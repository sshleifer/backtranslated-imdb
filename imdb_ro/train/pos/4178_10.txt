This film is a true reflection of Australian inventiveness, which has been forced to make this country what it is in the last 200 years. It is not pompous that the British, not the Gung-Ho as the Americans. If one of these countries had tried what this crew did, it would have failed. Either because of ignorance in the British side, or too much faith in the superior power of the American side. True "true" (ie, non-importers) are the only ones who can excel in modern military conflicts because they have had to improvise their majority of adult life. Look at examples like Gallipoli; Paschendale; Tobruk; New Guinea and Vietnam.
