Did you know that Anthony Kiedis (Red Hot Chili Peppers singer) father is in this movie. Blackie Dammit, he's Anthony's father. I noticed this after reading Anthony's autobiography about Scar Tissue and I saw a picture of his father. I thought, "Well, this guy looks like the guy in the movie I saw in the 1980s. Then I read more and told me that his dad was an actor who had some small roles. on the net, I realized he was really his father in the movie. It's funny, because nowhere in the book does he mention that he's in this movie, maybe his son was ashamed of his father's job in this movie, but it does not need to think that his father, Blackie, did a great job in the show.
