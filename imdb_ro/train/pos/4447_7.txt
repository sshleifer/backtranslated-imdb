Barbara Stanwyck gives this saddler, Douglas Sirk, universal soap, just the blow he needs. It's not as memorable as Sirk's later melodies, it's easy to see watching "All I Desire," where Sirk is artistically heading for the next few years. Stanwyck is a showgirl who returns to her family in smalltown, USA, after leaving them a decade earlier. Her family and community have mixed emotions about the shocking comeback. Some of the cinemas are stunning, and Stanwyck is heavy nails and really offers a movie of energy. Overall, a pretty good show.
