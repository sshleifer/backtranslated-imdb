This film focuses mainly on human relationships and the interaction between them. The main character is an old woman who, at the twilight of her life, begins a journey into her past, analyzing how she lived her life. This journey is precipitated by the economic crisis of his son and his intentions to put him in a nursing home. It's a very honest look at some of the issues we all ask at some point in life, and there are many secondary ideas to discuss in this movie, such as family inheritance, real love, marriage, or destiny. although this type of melodrama is nothing new, it can be useful to watch it with family members to discuss some ideas. There is a good performance by actors and the characters are very credible, but due to time, some characters may not be fully developed. I really recommend this movie for a quiet afternoon on Saturday.
