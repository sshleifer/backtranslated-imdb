I saw this when I was 17 years old and I have not seen her since. "CBS Late Movie" used it to show it on a regular basis at some point. I remember how sad and upsetting it was, I really got sick in my stomach. The effects were not what they are today, but yet she gave the feeling of being alone in Amazon, after having lost both parents and looked for a way out very well. I remember most of the garbage and worms, so real they were, they eat the flesh. It's a dark film that was the controversial subject at the time, though it's probably been dramatically edited for television. I would like to remember more details and if I have the opportunity to see again, I can comment more. I've been looking for this for years. I think he might have been shown at CBS under another title. I have no idea if it was ever released on the video.
