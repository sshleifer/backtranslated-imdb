In seemingly endless search to find well-done and well-done horror films, it is very rare to find one that just comes from a distance almost to hit the mark. Needless to say, I was very pleasantly surprised when I came across "Burned" on a cable network in the US while I flipping through channels. The premise is quite simple. In 1692, young Ann Putnam (Swift) is the most vocal witness against the alleged witch, rejecting unfounded accusations against anyone who gains dissatisfaction. Her handling for her own purposes is Reverend Parris (Peters), who also serves as the guide of the court in matters related to witchcraft and Satanism. Things get complicated when Ann begins to accuse the members of Goode's witchcraft. Salem (since 1980), Loreen Graham (also played by Swift) begins to have unusual visions shortly before visiting the Salem Witch Museum. A strange man in the seventeenth century coat attempts to accommodate the building there. He continues to cross it, while strange phenomena begin to involve it more and more. Soon, she seems to be possessed by the spirit of Ann Putnam. Unfortunately, the subsequent description becomes more involved and would give too much. Although the film is not action-oriented and would probably be of little interest to many viewers, performance is good, and the seventeenth-century dialogue used in many film retrospective films seems very convincing. Production values ​​are solid, with the possible exception of some of the special effects. In a note, the film's technical advisor was Laurie Cabot, Salem's official wizard. Visitors who appreciate a well-done, atmospheric, but undervalued horror film can appreciate this. Writer / director, Bert I. Gordon, has had a long career in horror and science fiction and is best known for his work on a series of "big bug" films and similar works earlier.
