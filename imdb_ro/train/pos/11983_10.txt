This show has a great story! It is very credible! A man's wife dies and can not care for his children, so he calls his brother, his best friend, and many others come later in the show. Like Rebeecca Donaldson, the loving but powerful dog, Comet, Nikki and Alex, you can find yourself (I do not want to spoil it for you) and convince Kimmy Gibler! (Sidekick by DJ), but the kids are wonderful as well. This is Mary Kate and Ashley took off first! And you also know Candace Cameron Bure from shows like St.Elsewere Punky Brewster and that's so corrupt! Jodie Sweetin plays Steph, the child in the middle of love, who feels left out. Indeed this is a very good show!
