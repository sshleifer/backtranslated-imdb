This movie is a remake of two movies that were much better. The last one, Heaven Can Wait, was great, I suggest you see this. This is not so great. The last third of the movie is not that bad, and Chris Rock begins to show some of the comic fun that took him to where he is today. However, I do not know what happened to the first two parts of this movie. It plays like a very bad movie "B", where people sound like they are in a bad TV. Situations are forced and it's as if they're trying to make the story in order to start the real movie. Everything looks real fake and editing is just bad. I do not know how to release this movie like that. However, the last part is not bad, so wait for the video and see it later.
