Christopher Smith is an obvious horror fan and this is clarified in his debut debut debut "Creep". "Creep", though slightly weak of information, proves to be a true classic. A bit less glossy than the recent US horrors (Amityville Horror remake, House of Wax Remodelage), this dark and terrible story follows Kate (Franka Potente) through the labyrinth of underground tunnels and stops the railways like her and others along the way, try to run away from a killer attacker. Although some bad reviews have made this movie, I really think that on a tight budget and for a UK production from the first time director Smith, "Creep" really does not give his name. It provides a quick red action more or less from the beginning, sometimes too fast, because the story is irregular in some areas but with a perfect location and the best character - reaction at the end I have seen for some time , "Creep" offers some scenes that are surely the nightmares.
