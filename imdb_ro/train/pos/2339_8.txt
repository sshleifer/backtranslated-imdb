I like this show. Now, I'm not a big fan of many science fiction shows, so if there were no resemblance to them, I did not notice. I like the quality of the cinema story. I really love the love story even though, as I enjoy it, I wonder in the mind's mind how fast that part of the story can develop when Ned can not touch Chuck or anything else ... well, you know . I really like Chuck, I do not find myself annoying and generally hate characters too sweet, beautiful and perfect. I really like the narrator's voice, even if it bothers one of my family members and does not look like some Walgreens commercials. I might be in touch with all the other things about Ned's situation and about the way the writers will approach it in the future, but rather look at me and wait and see what story the writers write.
