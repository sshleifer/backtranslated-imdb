It took us a few episodes to enter "Dark Angel" as a story and a series, since we move from Soprani, a very different mentality framework. But once we got to the taste of the show, we were very fast. It is a shame that the series ended only when it began to go well into the excellent category: Dark Angelwas much more than the average TV series. It hits the bottom and the stones to the extent that the action goes, but the interactions of the characters and the reactions of society to "mutants" remind us of the constant prejudices we face (and do) every day. This story is set in the future to maintain survival and prevent the anti-discrimination message from being transmitted to us (that is why it does not destroy the "fun" of those who do not like to be presented during entertainment), but each event and human / society interaction remains relevant present. We all make judgments, we are confronted with our own prejudices, but ultimately, the question of lies: stay back and close your mind to it, or raise and do something about it? For those who have no choice but to fight for survival or justice, this series empowers them. For those who have never had to deal with this question, this series "sneaks" into that message as a pure action entertainment. It is much better done and well written than most TV series; I am very disappointed that it was over before he could make a big blow.
