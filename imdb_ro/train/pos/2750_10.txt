This is the type of film that the US does not. That's why people rent out foreign movies. It's a wonderful story about how a person, even if he is retarded, can make a person find a reason in an empty life. Everyone can learn from Georges. It also shows how people who are mentally challenged suffer in their lives and show them in a very realistic way (I think). Like a classic in foreign movies, this movie has a bitter end, but that's just a better movie.
