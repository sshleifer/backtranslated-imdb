"The Murder College Girl" is my first acquaintance with Edgar Wallace's written work? and, in general, my first real acquaintance with "Krimi" movies in general? and I can say I'm moderately impressed. This is very fun, though I would never have expected it to be so ??? fool! The film has an emotionally and nicely complicated plot with a healthy dose of humor, flamboyant overturnings and quite inventive killings. Are there some bad James Bond types? who is always in the shadows and in front of a large monitor - recruits prisoners to kill certain girls at a specific college with a new type of poisoning. There is also a wicked monk with a whip, dressed as a KKK Communist member who escapes the remaining characters, as well as the teachers who are too curious, as well as a police commissioner who continues to solve the case with a psychological approach. Seriously, if I knew earlier that these Krimi movies were so colorful and crazy, I'd already bought a full collection of them. The baggery park actually generates more questions than answers in the end, and the overload of comic gimmicks in Scotland Yard Inspector Higgins's account is sometimes a little too swallowing, but I do not care because it was an entertainment sublime. Even the funky 60 soundtrack has stuck in my head for a long time. It's like a version on Italian Giallo, but with slapstick elements.
