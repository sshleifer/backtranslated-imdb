I do not think I could have enjoyed more, though some things were disturbing. I will not say what, if you have not seen him ... you will have to find out yourself. In any case, what movie can you miss out on the dog of Robert Downey Jr.? In all, the plot has been developed enough. Nothing seemed too hasty, because such films tend to be. The characters were similar, and there were lots of hilarious scenes in it. The whole idea is that the story is very well related, although some aspects may be unsatisfactory ... according to opinion. But, as I said before, it's hard not to love any movie with Robert Downey Jr.
