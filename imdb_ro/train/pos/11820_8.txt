Hey, if I tell you to compare The Dark Knight with an 18 year-old comic film rated at 5.9, will you call me crazy? Just to get your attention. Everyday I meet people complaining that there are no good movies that seem to know only the latest successes. It's never a bad thing to look for and explore old films, especially those with good artistic values. Dick Tracy is one of those that can not be easily overcome from a technological point of view. Negative reviews mainly complained about DT's "tangled" story. But it seems to me that the story is pretty clear and I have no problem behind it. I have not seen comic books, but I'm not a huge American fan of comics, but I appreciate the top performances and performances. Perhaps the expectations of most people were too much about the story he was talking about. But if you see a movie that along with Madonna and Warren Beatty, what do you expect. I had some scratches on my head and I can not forget, did I really see the same movie? The role of the title, though not as competent as it sounds, was able to pull it and bring the audience's charm. Madonna was less expressive than "breathless" in her seductive role, but added a lot of fun to the story. Al Pacino was fun and wonderful for himself. He seems to have enough boldness to go sarcastically to his successful roles. We can see a hybrid of Scarface, Michael Corleone, Adolf Hitler and Robert De Niro that pierce our stomach to make us laugh. And thanks a lot for make-ups. <br /> <br /> For me it is not bad at all. Surrealist feeling conquered me.
