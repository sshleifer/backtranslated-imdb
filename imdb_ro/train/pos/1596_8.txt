Although Cher and Cage are the focal points of this story, Gardenia and Dukakis are good counterparts for them - here is where Loretta and Ronny will be 50 years old - still in love. The whole castle makes a beautiful job from Aiello to John Mahoney - it shows a real piece of life. Although I've seen this a long time ago, I'm glad she eventually catapulted Cage to where she was recognized in Hollywood for her talent. From music to stage from opera to kitchen table arguments - this is a really fun movie.
