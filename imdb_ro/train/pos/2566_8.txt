Any film that deals with the bigotry in a positive way is a movie that should still be seen by the current audience, because the message and moral of the story will always be relevant as long as we have a world full of bigotry. /> Besides, the movie is really an old-fashioned love story .. boy meets girl .. boys lose girl ... boy gets girl back .... The weakest role goes to Kent Smith as Lt General Webster (Riccardo Montalban is a close second) ... my question would be how he ever came to be a general of 3 stars ... the character is so sad in his wife's presence and his military subordinates, he shows no respect. <br /> <br /> Brando's southern accent is a bit upset, and some scenes have a few holes, but overall I enjoy the film whenever I see. The red buttons are wonderful ... I always like to see comedians in dramatic roles ... as in Button's case, often a comedian can better treat a person's tragedy than a more racist actor tradition.
