This movie ran completely around the original Dolemite. She had everything she did a great movie ... except real actors. (Ernie Hudson could not do it alone and you know that!) I admit I killed my first video of this movie and I'm going to buy the DVD version as soon as possible! This movie has so many appealing lines is pitiful! I am embarrassed to say that I know the thematic song back and forth! I like Jimmy Lynch's character to death and should have won the Best Supporting Actor Award in Blaxploitation, but the Oscars have NEVER been prepared for it! This is a random movie made up of scary police, breasts, chases, bad editing and, of course, martial arts. (Being in the '70s and saying that everyone knows a kind of martial arts). I think this movie should be restored and shown one night in the middle of a marathon in the local theaters!
