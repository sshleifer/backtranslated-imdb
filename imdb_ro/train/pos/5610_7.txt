Roman Polanski proudly directs this kind of variation on the same subject as repulsion. I do not realize there is an honest film that is not capable of recognizing the excellent director of Le Locataire, but both parts of his dyptic may not be fully satisfactory for most people, including me. Polanski is very good at making us feel the inner torture of his characters (Deneuve in Repulsion and himself in Le Locataire), starting from a lack of self-assurance that will soon become awake in psychological anxiety in the latter blooming in a state of irreversible physical harm. The common feature for characters and the public is indeed different from the fear and tension of horror films, because there is no tangible supernatural element here. While horror films allow a kind of catharsis (either inexpensive or elaborate), Polanski sadistically tortures us and if in his last opposite dark humor is permanent, we are mostly on our nerves, unlike the edge of our seats. Suspicion, horror, all these are issues to play with the public's expectations (alternatively, to fool them and to do them), not literally with people's nerves. In my book, Rosemary's baby is a much greater achievement, because pure paranoia and simple rationality are in a constant struggle: the story is about a couple moving in a strange apartment while we are forced to identify with a single character. What's more, if the elements of fantasy are all in the mind of the hero, the situation is very uncomfortable, because we, the viewers, are obliged to judge it, to reject it while we were amazingly attracted ("nude paint" .
