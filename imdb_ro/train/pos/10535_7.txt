the only word that summarizes this movie is weird. it is a story of joy through an existential concept. bouncy (more than one) and a bit nutty. I would not call a grandiose and unforgettable cinema and it does not seem as memorable as the first cube movie, but it's a good drop of a fluff that can be seen on a Sunday morning. acting from respectable to annoying sometimes, but I think it is how it was to be written. made as a serious movie, could have been great or maybe very well entered a pre-tensioned state. a bit like the "matrix" encounters the "head" encounters "human nature." 6.8 out of ten
