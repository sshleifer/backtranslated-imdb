Passionate, dramatic, riveted like the Flamenco itself, the movie is simply amazing. It is put on immortal music Bizet. Original music is written and interpreted by one of the classical guitarists, Flamenco's modern style leader, Paco de Lucia, who plays a musician with the same name. The legendary flamenco dancer and choreographer Antonio Gades has written and choreographed this fabulous version of the famous Georges Bizet / Prosper Mérimée novella / opera. He plays a leading character, Antonio, the famous dancer / choreographer, who works on resuming the Flamenco-style Carmen's tale that combines dances with the song and the rhythm of hand comfort, and has a highly loaded level of dynamics that endears enormously for viewers. /> <br /> Cristina Hoyos, brilliant and graceful, whose technical excellence fits into the elegant art of her dance, shines in her supporting role. Hoyos was the first dancer in Gades 'twenty years (1968-1988) and was the protagonist of three films that Carlos Saura made of Gades' three spectacles: "Bodas de Sangre" (1978) , "Carmen" 1983) and "El Amor Brujo" (1985). Gorgeous Laura del Sol is a young dancer called Carmen in which Antony sees at first sight another Carmen, which was immortalized by two French, the writer Prosper Mérimée in his most famous novella written in 1846 that inspired George's famous surgery Bizet, Opéra-Comique version of 1875. As in opera and novel, Carmen in Saura's film is desirable and deadly, the last fatal female to be free from anything else. He could not tolerate the possessive love of any man and would prefer death to obedience. There are about 50 adaptations of the movie to the story and to the opera on screen, and equally different, all share the only possible tragic end. The Saura / Gades movie is unique as being the most sensual and truly Spanish. I fell in love with her from the first time I saw her twenty years ago, and it's as special and beautiful as it was today. Highly recommended.
