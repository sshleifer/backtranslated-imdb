I was very happy with "Revolution will not be televised." She once again gave me a positive feeling about the power of people to decide for themselves how they want to be governed. It is regrettable that in Venezuela twenty percent of wealthy citizens made all decisions for eighty percent of the poor for decades, if not for centuries. However, when their blow failed; after the Interim Government dissolved the Supreme Court, the Constitution and the Ombudsman, as well as the electoral bodies and all civil rights, no one took the plotters behind a barn somewhere and shot them. They did not even go to jail. Major plotters live in Florida, continuing. And their protection was the "Bolivarian Constitution" adopted by a large majority of the Venezuelan people. Not only history is bite. Democracy can give you a stake if you let it go. And in Venezuela it's lost.
