I'm a big fan of Simon Pegg and I've seen a lot of movies so far and none of them has stopped laughing at me. He did not do how to lose friends and Alienate People. This movie is basically about a good man like pissing people off. However, he has a set of inborn ethics that prevents him from doing things that might make him known. But ultimately he gets to do them, the culture of life. The film is well-toned with humor, romance, good action and also a little dance tour. It's one of those movies where you can be happy when it's over.
