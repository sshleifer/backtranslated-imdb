Little Brit British budget melodrama focuses on a girl who wants to be a star, it becomes one and then finds everything too much. A good distribution and a sense of time and place can not hide the fact that we were all here before. Several scenes are a bit hysterical and O'Connor's voice sounds like Mini Mouse! He disappeared out of sight right after making this movie - so life can imitate art! You have to see if you want to see a Star Born punk version.
