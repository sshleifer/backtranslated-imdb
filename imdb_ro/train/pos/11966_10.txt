This is an excellent series. You'll laugh, you'll cry, these wonderful people will be part of your family. The way this family takes care of each other and helps each other through their crisis is a very good example of how we should live our lives. There are many good things I do and a lot of bad choices, but they never return to the family, they work through problems. Michelle, the youngest daughter, is the nicest thing I've ever seen. Stephanie, the middle-aged daughter, suffers from Middle Child Syndrome and with the help of ALL in the family is better. DJ, the oldest daughter, grows up if his father wants to happen or not. One thing that everyone shares is missing my mother. Danny (dad), Joey and Uncle Jesse love so much on these kids and it's obvious in every episode.
