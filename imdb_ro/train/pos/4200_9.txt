Samuel Fuller's Pickup on South Street is abnormal: a "red scary" movie, lacking hysteria, in which the Communist threat is nothing but McGuffin that ignites the plot. Pickpocket Richard Widmark relieves Jean Peters from her wallet with a microfilm tape; without knowing any of them, it contains vital secrets for the Cold War. Peters, as it happens, has been overseen by FBI agents who are as steadfast as robbery as the man who runs her, a lazy commission, Richard Kiley. In an attempt to recover the precious film, both sides regained the help of Thelma Ritter, an old jerk that is always in his ear and wants to sell what he hears. Fuller pulls out of an opulent palette of tempo and tonalities in the story, which becomes a race against the clock of escalated brutality. From the subway to the seashore, its summer Manhattan has a sweaty glow, which is almost pungent. The scenes of love between Peters and Widmark become an unstable mix between the tumultuous and the auction and are recorded at "Again," a song by Ida Lupino in Road House, also with Widmark. Peace weakens for Ritter's well written and played script - among the weirdest vases of all kinds, and a sort of oasis of wonder in a filthy film of sentimentality. This is the only work of writer / director Fuller in the strictest boundaries of the noir cycle; his subsequent explorations of American pathology (The Crimson Kimono, Kiss Naked, US Underworld) never led to a synthesis as satisfying as Pickup on South Street.
