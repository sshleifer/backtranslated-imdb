This film deals with Derry's atrocity, 30 years ago, known as Blood Sunday. The film is well researched, acted and directed. It is just as close to the truth as we get through the outcome of the Saville survey. The film puts atrocities in the context of time. It also shows the savage soldiers on the day of atrocities. Also the white spiritis, which was the Widgery Court, was also treated. Generally, this is a great drama that moves and is shocking. When the Saville report appears, watch this movie again to see how close the truth is.
