A young woman who has survived as a prostitute. An inexpensive hustler who wants to get the big score. They meet each other in Thailand. Perhaps the opening titles will be a violent film, but it's also a love story with two people in their struggle to get the money for a better life. This movie feels like an essay sometimes because of its image changes, but at the same time refreshing. This story is about Eros and Thanatos. "It's not an original joke, but it's good to say," says a character and applies also to this: we've seen the story, but we see it. Thailand appears in hot tones, photography going from a colorful place to a multicolored place. And it captures the city like a cage of these imperfect people. There is also good use of music to achieve the action.
