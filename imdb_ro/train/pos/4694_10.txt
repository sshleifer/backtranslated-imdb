If a fan of Airplane type movies this is a must see! In the 1920s and 30s, Johnny Dangerous has not only great actors but also wonderful lines. "knock the wall, beat the wall and beat the wall @ @ $% # @ $". "You do not have to tell me on a johnny hook" or "It sounds like Johnnys getting put up." It's definitely a spoof of James Cagney's old movies and reports them a lot. There is an extraordinary scene when Jhonnys walks down to death and has a priest set up to escape. Listen carefully to the false readings of the priests, quite funny. Another extraordinary scene is when Dom Delauise plays the Pope. Follow his reaction to Johnny after advising the Pope, he said very much without making a sound. I recommend this movie to all those who love to laugh or are old film.
