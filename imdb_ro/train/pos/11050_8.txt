Well, magic works in mysterious ways. This film about four prisoners, trying to escape with the spells, written by another prisoner centuries ago, was a super-occult thriller with a surprising end and a lot of suspense. Even if it had something of theater (almost everything is happening in the cell), it was never boring and it was acting very well. In the "Cube" tradition, you felt trapped with Characters, and even if they were criminals, you developed some sympathy with some of them, just to change your mind through the overturning of the story. Some happenings caught you on guard and the air has always been a touch of madness. The whole intense and fun and I did not expect anything (a friend hired her) was a positive surprise!
