"The Brak Show" is good. Probably not at the same level as "Aqua Teen Hunger" or "Space Ghost Coast to Coast", but it certainly has many brilliant moments. In essence, Zorak and Brak live with normal life and go to school, living in a 50-story sitcom style. The humor and animation of this show is very much like "Aqua Teen Hunger" (and in one episode you could see Meatwad) with bizarre situations and strange characters. But it's good, they have funny parts. Some songs are great, others not much, but I like this show. The funniest character is Brak's father. (who is a man, no one knows why)
