Yes, Be My Love was the dawn of Mario Lanza to fame and is still popular today. His voice was strong and steady, so strong that MGM decided to use it in The Great Caruso. Lanza himself thought it was Caruso's reincarnation. After reading the book of Kostelanitz, who wrote a biography of Lanza, he explains that constant practice and vocal lessons became the visionary Caruso at Lanza. There is no doubt that Lanza did a great job in the story, but the story is not entirely true; blame Hollywood! I've been practicing singing songs for a few years now, and I've done pretty well until I lost my voice because of emphysema / asthma ten years ago. Reaching the high note of my love is not easy; but beautiful!
