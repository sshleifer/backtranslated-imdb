This movie is amazingly beautiful. Goldsworthy's art truly benefits from the film environment, as you can see art at its finest, moving, changing and flowering. I recommend this movie to everyone. I can not think of anything else about it. It's just a kind of movie you have to see, because it's so visible and it lets me get really revived when I leave the theater.
