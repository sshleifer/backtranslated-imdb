Of course, through any standard of criticism of the film, Soldier is indeed a very poor film. Kurt Russell is a super-powerful futurist from birth to kill, but then became obsolete after being upgraded by a bunch of super soldiers in a strange rupture that looks pretty much like a Gladiator-free contest. /> Abandoned on a junk planet, he is friends with a naff native hippie community who teaches him about gardening, family life and breasts. Kurt is not talking too much. Eventually, the really super soldiers come back and kill her on the hips, shooting them back while running. Kurt gets angry and kills everyone. A planet becomes total. End. If the Academy does not start a new category for "the best explosion," Soldier will not win any prize. However, as ridiculous, it is a pleasant experience. Military hardware is the best since foreigners (especially APCs) and 90 minutes do not wait well. Please note that the mark below is just a guide. Knock five points off if you plan to take it seriously and one more discount if you do not like miniguns. 7 out of 10
