The closest I ever came to see was that it was a clip presented at an exhibition of Gerard Philippe in Paris two years ago. I had no interest in the remake and just after I was able to recover the original for more than half a century after it was done, I can only conclude that the inept fences were intentional, putting a lot of target older. Hollywood has made realistic sword struggles since the 1930s, when the greatest of them, Vasil Rathbone, passed the sheets with Errol Flynn and others, so the technique was available and thus left only satire. After a while you do not notice and enjoy the dialogue of Henri Jeanson, which reminds of Prisoner Of Zenda, both versions. Gerard Philippe certainly had a presence to play a role like this, and Gina Lollabrigida was probably better than Martine Carol, the other obvious candidate at the time. The printer I saw was particularly bad, and at one point it completely disintegrated, so a DVD version could make it bigger.
