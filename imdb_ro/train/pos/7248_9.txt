When I saw the Exterminators of the year 3000 the first time, I had no expectations for that movie. Though it was not as bad as me. It's a kind of Italian version of the Roadwarrior cast, which is almost famous in Italy, including Venantino Venantini. Behind this story is Elisa Briganti and Dardano Sacchetti, also responsible for the story of those who eat zombie meat. You can also see other links to Italian horror movies: Luca Venantini plays Tommy and you can see the child in Paura nella citta dei morti viventi like John Robbins and the apocalypse Cannibal as the role of Brother Maria. Pretty funny film with some dull.
