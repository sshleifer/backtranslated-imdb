When "Good Times" premiered in 1974, it was one of the first black family sitcoms. She focused on the Evans family in Chicago, facing poverty, and their struggles to end. Most of the early episodes focused on parents, James and Florida Evans, and on their struggle to secure the family. John Amos and Esther Rolle were the best part of the show. They were great actors and they had a great chemistry like James and Florida Evans. They had three children: J.J., Thelma and Michael. J.J. was the teenager who followed the skirt, but it was good, which faced the lack of subtlety with artistic talent. Thelma was an attractive and enlightened girl who lived constantly with J.J. Michael was a wonderful child who was well educated on social issues and was meant to become a lawyer. In 1976, the producers made a huge mistake by burning John Amos, literally killing his character. This really changed focus, and not for the good I could add. The performances began to focus more on J.J. and his buffoon-like behavior, which angered black spectators, as well as Esther Rolle's role-playing series, which left after the next season. Instead of a show that focused on African-American key issues that existed in society at the time, the audience received shows that were overloaded with a skirt and fat joke. Once Esther Rolle left, the quality of the show suffered even more. Although it was still to be watched, it was not an extraordinary show I once saw. Although Esther Rolle returned for the 1978 season, it became obvious that the show took place in the last stage. All the heads were tied during the season and the show disappeared quietly from the air. The first three seasons: A. The last three seasons: C +.
