For those who like the mysteries of the occupied crimes, this is certainly the one to be seen because it is full of interesting and suspicious characters, most of them rich in Long Island social categories. As a star detective, William Powell is alternately starchy and inspired, sometimes behaving as if he and his costume went to the cleaners and pressed together. Mary Astor is very wonderful here. <br /> <br /> Powell made a career to play the lead character, Philo Vance, in a series of films made in several studios for many years. Between these films he evolved into a romantic walk, to some extent, sometimes even escalating gangster roles to gentlemen. He was already middle-aged, was stuck in some career path until the time he came. Like many talkies, it seemed like time had come and gone, that it was good for early movies in the period of banning depression, but that with the passage of time, it was too mature and dandyish to endure. The crime killing case, directed by Michael Curtiz, neglected by murder, is one of the last "old Powells," while the next year is the first of the new, The Thin Man, the success of which would catapult the leaders in the Hollywood stratosphere. In the Kennel we can see the movies still in a rigid, ritualized pattern, because the room does not move too much, with the act, as the presentation, tending to the theater. There is no harm in this approach, however, which has its charms. It gives the film a baroque quality.
