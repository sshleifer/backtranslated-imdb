I looked at this movie with the eyes of my child, and I was not disappointed. The story is well-known, an abandoned orphan must be brought to its parents by an improbable trio (mother tiger - sabertooth and lazy animal) ... And I do not want to forget to mention the incredibly furious little Hazenut animal. This made me laugh a lot in the whole picture. In short: it works, it's fun and is a must-see with your kids (they'll love it).
