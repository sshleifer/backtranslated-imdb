Intelligence about plotting is as easy as feathering. But the advantage is the classical refusal of the boys and girls we got used to in "The Gay Divorcee" and "Top Hat" is now absent. Instead of the typical accidental knowledge, the duo duo is formerly Bake Baker and Sherry Martin, who are still in love with their dance days. Of course, being a musician in the 1930s, there are problems of misunderstanding, classical courtyard, and the slight irritation of a soda bicarbonate audition costing something Ginger something special. And then, in the great tradition of diminishing finances, there is nothing better for the best Hollywood entertainers than for a show. Irving Berlin's charming numbers are sprinkled during the show. Top hats and evening dresses are saved to the end, which remains a refreshing change. Fred and Ginger are back to charm the world ... and navy charm. Everyone and everything is once again so enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Pure classic silliness at the best. But with Astaire and Rogers, we know it must work. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8.25 / 10
