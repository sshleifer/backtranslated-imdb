Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega are the wrong pair entering the car and making efforts according to the needs of one or the other. Morgan Freeman is a gorgeous man who binds to one and all, while Paz Vega is the cashier behind the "10 Items or Less" check line, intimidating clients and bored of mind. Together they explore, discover and learn from each other. To do this, of course, they must be vulnerable, interested in change, and have a sense of humor, which they both have. I want this movie to be realistic, I would like this kind of story to happen more often, I would like to go to the movies to realize that we can really connect with each other, even if we come from the mediums very different. The message of the film is based on the open heart and makes us wonder about the possibility of another world where we meet from there - a world in which peace could be a possibility.
