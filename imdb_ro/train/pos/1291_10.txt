This is a good movie. Something fun about watching money can be breathed at a higher rate, especially from the point of view of a child. Take it for what it is, a fun little movie about a child's dream and what a child can do with a million dollars. She does not like it, do not look at her. They make movies for observers, not people who have nothing better to do than complain in their lives.
