Years ago, I found a copy of this movie for a bunch or two. In many ways, this is quite right, as when it was done again in 1933, it was really a cheap film made by Majestic's "poverty" studio. However, while the movie is rather derivative, it is still quite worth watching and offers some surprises. The story is very, very familiar, like in a German city, people are angry because of recent deaths that seem vampire work! Adding to this familiarity is Dwight Frye. Renfield played in Dracula, and here he is very, very similar - though he plays a much more harmless freak. In this case, he is obsessed with his bats and people begin to blame him for death. The film does a good job of offering some "red herrings" (ie false leads) and while not taking a genius to discover that Frye can not be responsible, WHO and why are they interesting and make it very different from the film medium horror. In addition, while production did not have much money to talk to, he still had some good actors of the day - Lionel Atwill and Melvin Douglas - and also used Universal Studios at night (when they were filmed for the second day). As a result, the film looks pretty good overall, though I thought that, as usual, Fay Wray was terrible - she thought she did not hijack the film. I saw her in more films than most of IMDb and I saw her characters have no depth - she always seems to be expressed as "the laughing lady" and offers a little nine in each movie. <br /> <br /> Generally, for fans of old horror movies, this is great and worth seeing. For people who are not fans of the genre, it's probably quite easy.
