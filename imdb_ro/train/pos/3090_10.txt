I'm so upset that ABC is giving up another show that has the chance to be a true winner. This show is so good, writing and the story were great, a real original idea for a show instead of another boring reality show. Casting was spectacular! Not only were the characters and right actors, but they are a very talented set of actors. The concept and idea are indeed a new and exciting idea for a TV show, many of us share this whole idea of ​​"connections." I really like the characters of Steven, Laura, Whitney and Damien. But to be honest, there is not a person connected to this show I did not like, even for those that were just for a few episodes (for example, Sheri Appleby). The actors and characters are so easy to enjoy and so talented! I would like ABC to have given more chance to this show and not to interrupt the show half way. It was also not published enough. Really unjust! all!!. This show has shown a great promise. I will let ABC know how I feel and I will continue to send emails to keep this show alive. Please join me, I know we can do that. He worked for Jerico. (By the way of episode 13, I want the last show!). Support this show and send emails to ABC, we can do that! This show is well worth it!
