Perhaps Disney was hoping for another Mary Poppins, but this is a very different story and while Angela is delightful, she was a very different performer to the great Julie Andrews. After saying that Lansbury is perfectly expressed and offers magical performance. There is something deliciously thin about her character and she is given wonderful support by David Tomlinson. Tomilinson can wear a song, but she's definitely not a lot like a singer. It does not matter that he was such a talented actor you just noticed. There are some great cameoes from many old-fashioned stars such as Roddy McDowel, who offers a winning and much-loved Tessie OShea performance that does little, but it's nice to see the old gal again. It's also great to see Sam Jaffe and British television star Bruce Forsythe in small roles. The score contains some beautiful songs, especially "The sunny sea" and "The epoch of not believing". The large Portabello Road stretches to the limit, but has a very large theatricality. The effects show today a little clich√©, but the scene with the German invaders being attacked by the wildest army in the film is quite impressive. Children are not as annoying as other films, but they struggle to understand what the youngest boy says. I liked the march of the home army. The home guard was very important for the UK and this is a warm tribute. The animation is delightful, much better than Pixar, which I find grotesque. A happy happy film and a wonder of it did not happen on stage.
