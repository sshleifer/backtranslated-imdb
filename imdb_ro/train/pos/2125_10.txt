This, despite the fact that it was not the original - began life as a play in Central Europe - has overturned a few incarnations that followed (MGM's own remake with epic songs in The Good Old Summertime, Broadway She Loves Me, in Paris a few years ago) and the definitive version and the one everyone must overcome. Several previous commentators have identified the factors that have contributed to the success and the memorable and last but not least the dominant fashion in the 30s and 40s of Hollywood to pay special attention to the attention and detail of the ensemble's play, and not just two, as it happens often today - eliminating Ugarte, Ferrari, Renault etc. in Casablanca and yes, you'd still have had Rick and Ilsa and Viktor Lazslo but would have frozen without the rich cake mix below. Jimmy Stewart and Maggie Sullavan were both ideal and irreplaceable leaders, but how brilliant they are when their performances are reflected in those of Frank Morgan, Felix Bressart, Joseph Schildkraut and Sara Haden by Andy Hardy. Okay, maybe they were less naive, even innocent, at that Jurassic age, but how many authentic film lovers scattered, cheated and sexed in front of you are returning in those days of Stories, Style, Slickness and Skill and play in great movies like this one. By far, the best thing about this technological age is not CSI, but DVD, which can, at the same time, make these classics available for nostalgia and show the Matrix strange how the big boys did.
