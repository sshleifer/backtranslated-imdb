Daniel Day Lewis on the left of my leg gives us one of the best performances ever made by an actor. He is brilliant as Christy Brown, a man who has cerebral palsy, who then learned to write and paint with his left foot. An Oscar well deserved for him and Brenda Fricker, who plays the loving mother. Hugh O'Conner is great as the young Christy Brown and Ray McAnally are wonderful as the father. It's worth watching the great performance.
