The FBI's history, as told by Stewart's agent through flashbacks, has been interwoven with the story of his personal life. Stewart and Miles (as his wife) are pretty good, just like Hamilton as a serious agent. The problem is that the episodic nature of the story makes it difficult to engage. It's like watching fragments and dozen different movie pieces, as we see who is throwing gangsters. Some of the episodes are too long, some too short, and others look out of place (Stewart's daughter's school sequence). On the whole, it goes too much. However, it deserves to look at its beautiful production values.
