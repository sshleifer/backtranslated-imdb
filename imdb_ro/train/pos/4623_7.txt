Despite its pretty glorious title, this is a teenage gentle drama. If you're not an old coil, you'll probably be pleased. However, it is not so good to develop characters or situations without problems. When you see it, you will have the feeling that you ran back and forth in the kitchen, even if you stood down and saw it all the time. This is one of those movies that matter a lot in what your characters like and are quite appealing. Jennifer Connelly is the villain of many, I know, but I always liked the darkest Maddie Corman. Adolescents receive most of the screen time without too much intrusion from the big ones. Is it just me or most young men looking so great?
