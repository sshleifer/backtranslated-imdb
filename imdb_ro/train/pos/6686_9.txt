This movie was a brilliant concept. It was original, intelligent writing and highly appreciated for those of us who are not really "conforcionist" of filming. Do not misunderstand me - there are some great movies that are of great interest, but when you move to watch a movie based on "all the others follow it" - you know you're either a tween or you do not really have an opinion. This has had a wonderful subtle humor - despite the fact that most people would probably only look at it. The actors portrayed their characters with aplomb and I thought there was a more personal personality in this film. Appeals for children as well as for adults. Esp. nice to find a good movie that is not filled with sexual and innocuous drug references! A great movie, which should not be neglected on the basis of public consumption. This is a necessity to buy.
