Othello, Shakespearen's classic story of love, treason, lies and tragedy. I remember studying this story in high school, actually, I found Othello probably a favorite story of Shakespeare, because of how fascinating it was that Shakespeare captured the feeling of friendship, love, and racism. I mean, when you're studying this story, you could come across so many philosophies about why Othello became mad with jealousy in the blink of an eye. But later on for my report I also watched this version of Othello and I have to say that he was absolutely brilliant. Lawerance and Kenneth just capture the story so well and I understand it's dark. Othello is the great time soldier in his city, he is loved by everyone, including the king. But when the King finds out that Othello has fled with his daughter, Desdemona, the king is angry, but except for the case. Othello is welcomed in the city and makes his best friend, Cassio, his side man instead of Iago, who stood by Othello. Because of his stupid jealousy, he is in revenge. Even claiming to be Othello's best friend, he just suggests that Othello that Desdemona beats Cassio, does not say that I am, just makes Othello believe he is going. Othello is crazy and has no plans for Desdemona or Cassio, and Iago is more than happy to help. Othello is an incredible story, I recommend you to read it. It's an incredible story that keeps you after reading it. Also, the movie at Othello is great, and again, I recommend it, captured the story perfectly and has a great tear-jerker feel or just shocked by what's going on between Othello and Desdemona, how fast he thinks his true love will betray him. This is a great movie, great action, good sets and good direction, so Shakespeare meant when writing the story.
