Before seeing Show People, my silent comedy was essentially a slapstick, and just a slapstick. I did not imagine how the screen comedy could be possible, without much reliance on the spoken word or on numerous awards. But this master film proved wrong to me. Davies, in my opinion, was probably the greatest comedian actress before Lucille Ball. I mention Lucy first of all because Davies's manners and facial expressions reminded me of it until I wonder if Davies was one of Ball's primary influences. This comes from a 21-year old who has never seen a silent comedy and I have to say that no matter how much of the time-specific references you get (I do not seem), you will not be bored of this movie. You'll probably laugh more than you would on most talkie talks. This is not only my favorite silent comedy, but easy among my ten favorite comedies of all time.
