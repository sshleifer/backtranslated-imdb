I liked this movie. Great story and actors and sets of good movies. She told the story in a way I can easily understand and pay attention without falling asleep. I'd like to know where I can get the soundtrack. I can not find her anywhere. Send me an email if you know where to get the soundtrack. Apart from not being able to find the soundtrack, I thought the movie was fascinating. Swayze did a great job. I think this is one of his best works. His past films were OK, but that really told a story about a change. This will come down in history as one of the best ever featured TV films. Congratulations to the producers and writers of such a work.
