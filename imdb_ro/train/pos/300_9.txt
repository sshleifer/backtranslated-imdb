The various Bogdanovici and Gazzaras scattered through distribution and crew "Everybody laughs" is very much a family business. If you add that B. Ghazzara and Miss A. Hepburn had a short but passionate adventure in a previous picture, almost a private film made for the joy of the participants and the entertainment of a wider audience to be just an auxiliary consideration. If all of these will delight in self-esteem, you will be glad to hear that Mr. Bogdanovich sails clearly from that special danger and offers a sweet and rather innocent "I love NY" paean, which is also an altar to us we can worship the eternal beauty of former Miss Hepburn. Do not make a mistake, this is her picture. Sir, Gazzara recognizes her most in all their scenes together. Planning a detective agency is too personally involved in the affairs of its clients - it is of minimal importance, it is the performance of the two leaders that dominate the film. Mr Bogdanovich's triumph is how his room seems to love his actors, from "Targets" onwards. There is a glamor in relation to each of his films, which only special artists can coax from an inanimate piece of optical equipment. of this love. Further insights into his work can be obtained by reading the collections published in his essays about stars and directors, mainly, "Who the hell is in it?", Recently left in the UK bookstores. The soundtrack at "Everybody Laughs" ranges from Louis Armstrong's New York concert, from 1947, to Sinatra, to the Latin Country, eclectic as the city he portrays. Her grandfather's image "Boy B" was certainly scary, because that's the nature of the film business, but it is also certain that one day will be restored and when the day will come "Everybody laughs" they will be recognized for the beautiful work that is.
