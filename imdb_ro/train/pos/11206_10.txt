I did not see this movie! At least not entirely. I saw some hunting clips that left me gagging to see everything. A single sequence remains in my memory to this day. A spacecraft (which looks very convincingly) orbits the dark side of the moon. The pilot releases a flash device to capture the hidden surface beneath it. The moon flashes in visibility. . . . and for a few seconds there is. The parallel squares could be .. then the light fades and the short light of ... what ... has passed and it is time for the spaceship to return to Earth. Wonderful. I've seen other clips, but LOVE would get the movie completely.
