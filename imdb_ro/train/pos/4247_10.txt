The MISSOURI woman arrives in New York, knowing exactly what she wants: to get something solid through the marriage of a millionaire - without losing her virginity. With her beautiful eyes, she catches the eye of a playboy son of a tycoon, but by preserving her true virtue, will she discover true love? Jean Harlow jumps into this wonderful comedy. With her platinum hair and gorgeous princes, she is blind. But her beauty must not hide the fact that she was also a very good actress. . She has rightly won her place right at the top of the Hollywood Pantheon. An excellent distribution gives Harlow a fine support: Lionel Barrymore as an old wise old wizard, wise at Harlow's paths; the beautiful Franchot Tone as a son, hit by love; Patsy Kelly, steals her scenes as Harlow's host; the debonair Alan Mowbray, as a good English lord; Elder Clara Blandick as Secretary of Barrymore; Hale Hamilton, as a rich man with an eye for ladies; the muscular Nat Pendleton, as a lifeguard, catching Kelly's flutter; and Lewis Stone, unforgettable in a small role as a businessman has gone bankrupt. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that this film was produced shortly after the Hollywood Production Code was established. A comparison with a redheaded woman, made two years earlier, would be fascinating - in which Harlow's character follows the same heads but uses very different means.
