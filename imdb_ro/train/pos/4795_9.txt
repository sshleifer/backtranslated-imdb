Whenever I hear a wanted movie, because she does not have sex, violence, bad language, special effects and so on, bs.s. the detector goes out. Typically, a movie like this is sentimental, giving people who want nothing to surprise them, but to say how superior we are to us. So when David Lynch's story "THE STRAIGHT STORY" began to get such reviews, I was worried, especially because I was not a fan of the other "uplifting" story, ELEPHANT. For all the amazing pictures and good action in this movie, I seemed more interested in preaching than inspiring. I do not have to worry. STORY STRAIGHT is a honest honest, not a sweet one. Most of these are due to the fact that Lynch and writers John Roach and Mary Sweeney simply say it for the most part. There are some homies from Straight that I could have done without, and grain crops are harvested a bit too much, but these are just noises. There is no hard message, no sentimental strings to rip our emotions and no condescension to us and its characters. Instead, they depend on the story to build their own power, and so it happens, through the final scene, we are really moving. Of course, the distribution of Richard Farnsworth adds the realism of this part. He is indeed someone who seems to have lived a lot but still persevere and, except for homilies, the desire he has to bring with his brother does not seem too sentimental, because you can feel here that someone who lived too long and seen too much to be driven by anger for a long time. And he knows his time is leaking, so he wants to make peace, not only with his brother, but also with his life. Sissy Spacek also does a fine, unparalleled work as Straight's daughter. And although I'm a city and a suburban boy, the Iowa and Wisconsin scenery is beautifully shot, which makes me at least visit her one day.
