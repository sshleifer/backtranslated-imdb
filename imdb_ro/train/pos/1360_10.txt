This is one of your favorite movies over time. The character of Parker Posey is fun, and the librarian's motive will not be lost to someone who has ever worked in the book and stack world. If you are a student at the library, RENT THIS. Then buy the poster and hang it on the wall. The soundtrack is highly recommended. I have shown this film more to the friends of the library than any other - all of them fall in love with it.
