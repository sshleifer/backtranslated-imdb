A strange role for Eddie Murphy to get to his career high. While there is a lot of character "Eddie Murphy", he plays a really decent person. The rest of the cast is good, especially the wonderful Charlotte Lewis. The beauty and serenity of her character made the film's tone become too much Murphy.
