This is one of those movies / pilot that, if you know BattleStar Galactica, helps, but it is not necessary. What makes this even more credible for a story than for BSG is that this is not something so far in the future. It is so deep that it is quite surprising that it was not released theatrically. Leaders could not have been better chosen in such experienced and talented actors. Eric Stoltz is gorgeous as the father who will do anything to reunite with his daughter, however real or not, and will do it no matter what the cost. Paula Malcomson of fame "Deadwood" is wonderful and his wife. You are not sure of its reasons whether it's love, money or both, but this makes this pilot even more exciting. I see a star in Zoe's accomplishment, played by Alessandra Torresani, relatively unknown and her performance. Esai Morales is wonderful in his desire to see his boyfriend again, and how wrong is even to consider what he wants more than his moral objections. I did not think it would be a good idea when it was announced, but only from the pilot I am delighted to see how I reached the BSG scenario. It's great to see Adama as a child that is already affected and influenced by the different types of robots that are beginning to get into life at this stage. I just hope they can keep the stories so we can even understand how humanoid-type robots have received. This is an almost perfect pilot and I hope I can keep up with the fantastic story. Even the visual effects are better than most trash you see on the big screen. If you have not reached BSG, at least try this and bet you have become a fan and you will want to see how the BSG story has appeared.
