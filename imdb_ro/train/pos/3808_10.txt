I voted this at 10 out of 10 just because it is the best animated story that I have been able to see for some time. The animation is amazing. The artwork behind each landscape was beautiful. From color to lighting up to the unusual art rate. I was surprised. Going beyond the beauty of the screen, you are immersed in a story that is timeless and fresh at once. Character development is short, but these contact moments are exactly what is needed to persuade the viewer about what and why and where the character came to where he is. I'm impressed with the whole business, and I think we need to see for the whole family.
