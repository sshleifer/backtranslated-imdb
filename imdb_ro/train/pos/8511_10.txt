This film reinvents the term "Springumentary Spring". Hans, the fat group of the group, shows his talents as Chris Farley's generations. Johnny Kansas, "King of the $ 1 Bet", shows he is no longer in Kansas by stagnating stakes. Kyle's laugh is really infected, and she also offers a pretty lady lady (as is Matt). The dwarves, while having moments, did not do justice to the Mexican hat dance, as it deserves. And finally, we have our protagonist, Ed. He gives hope to all who stutter, stops, crawls, complains, and still seeks somebody special. And this hope is a small place called Cabo San Lucas. While this blockbuster just missed the theaters, this is a necessity to rent because we can refer to one of these Spring Breakumentarions.
