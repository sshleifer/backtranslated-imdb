Although she had the trouble to hit the festival circuit here in Austin (SXSW Film), just as I was tired of things like Shakespeare in Love and Elizabeth, this film deserves an audience. A look inside the show "Scottish game" as actors called "Macbeth" when it produces it to avoid the curse, it is a clear, effective and elegant treatment of betrayal that faces the band. With a wonderful evocative score, and showing and calling much better than his little budget would suggest, this is a quiet, not world-class but absolutely satisfying jewel.
