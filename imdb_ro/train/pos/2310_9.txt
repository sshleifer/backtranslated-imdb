I was so surprised at how great The Man In The Moon really was. I mean, at first I would have expected a camouflable and predictable movie, but I decided to leave it aside when I was watching. Well, when it's over, amazed (mainly in tears), how great was The Man In The Moon. This movie is so fun and is so conscious of the tone and a fabulous film. The actor was great in particular by Reece Witherspoon (who was so cute and loved) and everyone else. There was nothing that really bothered me, I felt the end quite predictable, but very well done to that. I also felt some things to be simple or as if it were done but still a great movie. Overwhelm I have to say that I do not have much to say about this movie, not that it's bad, it's just a movie that likes it or not. I recommend it to anyone and everyone, even if you do not like this kind of movies, it's still a nice movie. <br /> <br /> 8.7 out of 10 stars
