Eventually I came to see the infamous "Ice Age". Besides the fact that I was not as funny as I hoped after seeing the brilliant, I can not say anything about it. Sure, it's not as glamorous as a Disney production (besides, it's Fox's first attempt at a complete CG movie), but it has a huge heart and on some occasions (like the look in Manfred's eyes after seeing the sad past) I woke up at the edge of the tears. But when they reunited the child with his father, I could not keep them anymore. A movie that has no trouble walking on the thin sappy line and clich√© and manages to bring more than the best of it; the end result being one of the most attractive animated creations I've ever seen. Funny-looking characters that grow fast on you (and excellent voice talents) and many memorable scenes, especially from Scrat, make the film more than enough to let go. Plus the Dodo scene, which is my favorite personal scene since 2002. <br /> <br /> I honestly do not get it, but for some reason, it really looks like the CG animation will take your hand in the future. But if it means there will be more movies like this one (and who can forget Pixar's creations) then I do not bother, at least for the moment. 9/10
