In fact, this movie has silly moments in both the plague and Joe Pesci and children, and is much worse than other MJ films such as The Wiz, Captain Eo and Ghosts. But, as a young fan of Michael Jackson for almost eleven years, (Yes, that's half my life, boys!), I can not complain much about it. I just see this great guy and listening to his wonderful music is a trip to Heaven for me. But like a movie, it's not good at all, and I'm afraid it will get a much smaller note for me if my dear Mike would not have been the one who played it. But since no one, except Mike, is the one from the moon, he has to get 7 out of 10 from me.
