I'm a huge fan of Jane Austen, and besides being a feature film (a true fan wants to see as little as possible and which can only be done in a mini-series) it was great. Gwyneth Paltrow really surprises the rich little girl, but without intention, but Jeremy Northam IS, Mr. Knightly, with poetry and nobility. I was not delighted with Ewan McGregor, though I really like an actor, but I did not feel he broke the movie at all. As I said, as a fan of Jane Austen there were things I wanted to see included, but that would do much more than was allowed for a feature film and how I felt they really encapsulated story well. I have seen every adaptation of this book and I felt it was the best!
