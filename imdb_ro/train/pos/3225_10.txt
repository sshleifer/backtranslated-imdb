When we rented this movie to watch it, I knew it would not be a movie of mind. Instead, I thought about it as a mistrust of the reality that someone would have a serious fight. And you know what worked. Kurt Russel did what, although it was a remarkable role in showing the emotional soldier that he was. I recommend this movie if you are with boys and want to watch a good action movie.
