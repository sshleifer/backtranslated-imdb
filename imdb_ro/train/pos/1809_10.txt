All dogs go to Heaven is the hottest animated film to have dogs in 1989. Previously Don Bluth The Land Before Time (1988) has become a success. Dogs are as cute as small mice. I want to hug them when they're cute. Where was I? Oh yes. His animation is beautiful, the characters are wonderful when they are perfectly expressed and the songs are nice and touching. It was opened on November 17, 1989 the same date as Little Mermaid produced by the Walt Disney Feature animation. The part where Charlie was killed by Carface was so unforgivable. Carface is so important because she wanted to kill Charlie. To be ashamed! The song "Survive Love" by Irene Cara and Freddie Jackson was so beautiful. All dogs go to heaven is the best animated movie ever.
