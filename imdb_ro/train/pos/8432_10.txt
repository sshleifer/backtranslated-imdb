I did not read anything about the movie before it happened, by accident, on the last Saturday night. And then, as I watched her, I felt the misery of Lena and Boesman in my bones. I was so captivated by the acting, the tune and the filming we just listened to in the dialogues. My husband fell asleep immediately after we slept and was sleepless under the impact of the movie. I wanted to just wake him up to say, "If I ever voted for an Oscar nomination, it would be for these two actors." I decided to wait until the next day. Then I read more about the IMDb movie and it was sad to find out that Mr. Berry died before the release of the film and that he probably did not see the latest version of his brilliant masterpiece. I still want to tell him that for me his film was a true independent film in his concept and spirit. Actors must be praised not only for their brilliant performance but also for accepting a brilliant part, without, of course, showing the true image of human depression. Sad, but painful.
