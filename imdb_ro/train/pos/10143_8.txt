This was a superb episode, one of the best in both seasons. Horror right for a change, with a story that is well above average MOH episodes, if there is such a thing. A man's wife is nearly burnt in a tragic car he was driving. His airbag worked, he did not. It is burned beyond recognition (great btw makeup), and did not give a great chance to live without a full graft. But even in the coma, she continues to die, but again brought up with modern technology, and when she dies for a few minutes, her ghost appears to be a very revengeful spirit. The meat, of course, results as well as some extremely violent crimes and also some extremely sexy scenes. What else can you ask, could you ask? Well, not too much, because this child has everything, and a very satirical end, which should leave a smile on most of the spectators. I just liked the direction of Rob Schmidt (Wrong Turn), he has a great horror talent. Excellent episode, this is one I'm sure to buy.
