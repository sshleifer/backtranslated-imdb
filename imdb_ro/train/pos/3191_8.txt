Director Edward Sedgwick, an old visual comedy man, successfully drives this Hal Ro Roach Road Show, which offers a quick and moving scenario and excellent casting using a large number of reliable Roach interpreters. Although the movie was originally built as a vehicle for Patsy Kelly, Jack Haley plays Joe Jenkins, a young Kansan who sells his car repair and travel to Hollywood, where he tries to screen for the little girl he loves - Cecilia (Rosina Lawrence). Sedgwick, who prefers to use the entire MGM studio as a set, does it here because Cecilia, always ready for an audition, is treated by a paramour, movie star Rinaldo Lopez (Mischa Auer), acting behind the scenes of course, a musical comedy with a masterpiece from Broadway, Lyda Roberti. Laurel and Hardy offer plenty of pleasant interludes, including the best known skittles involving a tiny harmonic, and look at fine towers like Joyce Compton, Russell Hicks and Walter Long. In balance, we must give the bows to Mischa Auer, who clearly steal the image of a star of emotional film, a role that he largely creates, and the director for his clever homage to Busby Berkeley's glasses of viewing .
