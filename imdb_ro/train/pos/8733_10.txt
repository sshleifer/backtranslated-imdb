When I bought my Toy Story movie tape when it came out of the video after it was released in theaters, I saw a trailer for that, which Toy Story creators said. As soon as I saw that I knew this would be a good trait! I was right! Bug Life, like Toy Story, is a wonderful story, great characters and an extraordinary animation. My favorite characters are Dim the Beetle of Rinocer expressed by Brad Garrett and Hemlich the Caterpillar, expressed by the late Pixar Storyman Joe Ranft. My favorite scene is when the Slim stick (David Hyde Pierce) raises Hemlich trying to distract Bird and Hemlich's attention like you. Early Bird. How about a nice tasting worm on a stick and Slim, how am I going to catch! I'm going to see! I just died laughing at that scene. Being a big fan of insects, I think Bug's Life is my favorite Pixar, even though I know a lot of people find it the worst Pixar ever! I do not know how you could hate a Pixar movie! I think there are great movies! Good job PIXAR!
