this is a great movie! I saw the first movie when it came out. I've just seen this movie again and still got back to my memory. A lot of movies we watched when we were younger did not seem to hold on to them later in life. The film is, in fact, a great example of the type of films made at that time. Keaton is the best, all the actors actually did a really good job and Ron Howard was very good to let the story push the film instead of forcing it. The pace of the movie is fast, with a few slow spots and seeing the cars of the '80s is too funny. Being in the '80s, I liked to see the nasty beast again. The film is a great movie for comedy lovers and movie lovers in the 1980s.
