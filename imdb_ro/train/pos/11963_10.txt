"Scoop" is easily Woody Allen's most funny film in the year 2000. Allen, though looking at his age, is at the top of his game as a magician Sidney Waterman. Its unique traits and behavior are hilarious. Do not let the critics contradict your opinion. "Scoop" is a top "Woody-Lite" image. <br /> <br /> The classical music score is an excellent compliment to the action on the screen. Scarlett Johanson looks great in the swimsuit. Jackman's all right. Cinema shines. "Scoop" is a great escapist fare from start to finish. The last film of the film deserves the admission price.
