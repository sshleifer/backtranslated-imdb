This movie is great. As is often the case, it is indeed very realistic and sometimes brutal, but, unlike other people, I do not quite think it is depressing, negative, or abolishing Austria as a protofascist society. On the contrary: Although there are really some very heavy scenes in HUNDSTAGE and some characters have to be called very bad people, at the same time you are watching the love, beauty and humor in Ulrich Seidls' film. And that's what HUNDSTAGE has distinguished me from other films that try to show the lives of "ordinary people" in an intense, realistic way; their urge, their desires, their dark faces: Seidl never attempts to prove that the lives of working class men are garbage! In my view, viewers who come to this conclusion seem to be very afraid to admit that almost no one is as "clean" and "normal" as we would like other people to believe. And every living person has dark and often depressing parts. The most beautiful scene: the old Viennese man, seeing his old girl dancing the "Oriental way", as he calls it. I think everyone who finds this ugly scene does not have a sense of beauty and should wonder what it is, that is protofascist: HUNDSTAGE characters or viewers who are deactivated by the body of a 70-year-old woman dancing with all her charm for her boyfriend.
