This was one of those movies I probably would never have taken on the shelf but came IFC one day and I said - Eric Stolz, William Forsythe ... why not? If I had changed the channel, I would have really missed a treasure. <br /> <br /> The topic is depressing - the young paralyzed author in the suicide crash is getting sick in the lower class rehabilitation center. It would have been so easy and tempting to do this as a tear-juggler. But this is not because it was written by Neal Jimenez after he himself was paralyzed accidentally. No happiness from Hollywood here. All patients in the department come from different backgrounds but have a sense of helplessness, to be at the mercy of others. Stolz is very good as a "single wolf" guy, forced into an embarrassing dependence on his girlfriend (Helen Hunt); Wesley Snipes is good as a former female man whose family breaks down; but William Forsythe takes the cake as a tough guy, determined to make someone pay for his independence. Watch this movie.
