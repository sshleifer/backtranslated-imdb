What I expected was a too stereotypical portrayal of a crazy sportsman and a stellar, equally lax stereotypical representation of the hat that still loves him while he was the second banana to his overly zealous support for his favorite sports team . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What I have: an equal story in which both the man and the grown man admit - for themselves and for each of them - that everyone has passions in their lives, but each can forgive the other to save the love they share <br /> <br /> It sounds sappy but with non-stop humor and terrible performances this story works! Barrymore is the classic Barrymore: that perfect blend of sweet, strong and adorable. We expect this and she gave it. But Fallon is a nice surprise in this movie. It brings the role of the perfect blend of sports nuts combined with appreciation for normal things in life, such as caring for children and his girlfriend. Fallon gives his lines with subtle perfection. He can care ("You just ran in the field for me!") And, in the same move, be blinded by his love for Red Sox ("How did you feel the grass? Very spongy?") At the same time. Fallon's show made the movie. We hope that this film marks the beginning of a better film career for Fallon, something beyond the superficial humor of sophomors typical of SNL alums (that is, Will Ferrell). In short, a movie that may have fallen victim to male stereotypical characters. feminine have grown above this limitation and have provided non-stop humorous lines, most of which are delivered with flashy subtlety by Fallon. Hey, I saw that with my wife - not a baseball fan - and he loved her as much as I did. It's neither "Guy Flick" nor "Flick Flick". It's a wonderful laughing move. Go see!
