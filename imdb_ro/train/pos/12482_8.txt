I've only been reading good things about this movie and finally I had the opportunity to watch it last night and it was all I expected to be even more. This is how it should be a horror film proper. I think the reason was so scary it was because he was so realistic. The scary sound score was perfect for setting a dark atmosphere. I liked the dramatic opening scene and I enjoyed the way the rest of the movie stayed. It was very easy to watch and understand, unlike some movies that are too complicated. very good. I'd love to see more horror movies like this. This is easily one of my favorites. A realistic thunder and a lightning storm would have created a pleasant atmosphere for this film. Then, then that had all the elements a good film horror needs. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who can appreciate a good scary movie that does not shoot any punches. I will be adding it to my DVD collection some special exciting features.
