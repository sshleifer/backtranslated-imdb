For those who do not know the theme that Kusturica continues to intermittently explore in his films - the Western assault on traditional Serbian values ​​- it will be impossible to understand his stories. This theme continues, expressed by the fantasy and scandalous comedy as a vehicle, is one that Kusturica chose to mandate. Since his fantastic work and the Underground of Magnum Opus, Kusturica's films, "Black Cat of White Cats", "Life is a Miracle," and recently with "Promise Me This," his carnival style emphasizes the "Westernization" of the Balkan culture, ambivalent arrival and attack on traditional idioms. In the case of "Promise Me This", the paradoxical world of urban space (space) and space (traditional idiom) are in contrast. The world of the city reflects the Western attributes that have set space and time; organized crime, sexual exploitation, a broken sense of identity, and a vehement disregard for traditional values ​​- as expressed by the young child - the villager. The end of the film still exemplifies this notion as we observe a funeral table and wedding on a dirty road with a unique meaning. I'm in a coarse collision; Accordingly, the wedding, which represents the rescue line and the pulse of the village, that is, the traditional values, is about to collide with funerary dungeons, exemplifying the death of tradition in this context. However, Kusturica examines this theme with its unique, stylistic singularity. With its scandalous and flamboyant style, serving as a vehicle in its portrayal.
