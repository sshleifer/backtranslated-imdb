First of all, I have never been scared of this understated jewelry as a child ("Little Mermaid" on the other hand ...). Just as my title says it was one of my childhood favors, which I still love as a teenager. It is a beautiful and bitter film about an improper German shepherd named Charlie (fantastically expressed by Burt Reynolds) who is murdered by his boss / partner in crime (is the name ha, ha is Carface). Charlie is sent directly to heaven because "all dogs go to heaven because, unlike humans, dogs are naturally good and loyal and good." Chalie is sent back to Earth because he ended his life where he got worse with his best friend, Itchy and a little orphaned girl, Anne-Marie. I have always looked at this as a child, and sometimes I keep track of it. Anyway, it's a nice sweet film, as I said earlier, which could leave a tear in the eye ...
