I forgot how big this movie was until I came across it as I watched the garage. It's a strange biology of Michael Jackson, a collection of musical winemaking and a story about a super hero struggling to save some young children. Eggplants are good (especially Speed ​​Demon), but the best part of this movie is the superhero segment, in which Michael Jackson turns into a car, a robot and eventually a spacecraft (and is equally strange). Joe Pesci is hilarious and has pretty interesting pictures and great music to have fun all the time! True Gem is, however, the incredible "Smooth Criminal" movie, which makes the movie worthwhile to hold only that part!
