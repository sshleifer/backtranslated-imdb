I'm ashamed to say that I missed Mom when it was in the theater. I saw her this evening on DVD. I gave him a vote of 10, one of the few that I gave here. This independent English film is filmed with great care and quality. It has always attracted me. The story, humorous and purely human, is sincere and absolutely absorbing, thanks to the act of Anne Reid, Daniel Craig and Cathryn Bradshaw. The cinema is amazing. The point is connected to the intrigue. The story is epic, brilliant by writer Hanif Kureishi in worldly lives. This story addresses the big problems with the subtlety of an impressionist painting. And some of these big issues are very controversial, which probably explains the lack of prizes won, despite numerous nominations. It's just one of my favorite movies.
