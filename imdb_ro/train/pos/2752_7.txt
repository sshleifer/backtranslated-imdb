Although the plot of "Eighth Day" seems to have been done many times, the film still has much of the spark, mystery and symbolism of Jaco Van Dormal's first film. Although not as good as "Toto the Hero," which will always remain on my favorite list, the film still leaves us a lot of emotions. Daniel Auteil, in 2001, "The Closet", without aroma, ceases to play, fearing to defeat (with justice, the role could easily be destroyed if the actor was too dramatic). However, I felt that the play needed a bit more realism for her, focusing more on the character itself than the mere growth of the character. Do not walk in this movie waiting for the dark humor and the unexpected upsurge you've received from "This Hero" because you will be disappointed. Still, the film continues to function as a decent, if not stupid film
