This is a remarkable remake (4 hours) of Rider Haggard's story, with a regular addition woman and a foreign subplot with Russian soldiers looking for a "power stone" buried together with King Solomon's treasure. He is very well shot, giving a lively feeling of wide open spaces in Africa, and acted very well. Patrick Swayze is an excellent Alan Quatermain, and Allison Doody is appealing to Elizabeth Maitland, who hires Quatermain to save his father. Sided Onyulo as Umbopa, Gavin Hood as McNabb and the leader of the Russian soldiers (who are not named in the IMDb list) are also memorable. Because Hollywood can only leave a good story when it adapts it, it is well said and, except that it is too long, I liked it. 6/10.
