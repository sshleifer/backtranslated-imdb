Jimmy Stewart and Anthony Mann have collaborated to make some of the best westerns ever made and this is one of the best. The real star of the film is, however, the spectacular Canadian rock that serves as background for the story. Some of the best cinemas ever made in the history of the film. In all the five Westerns that Stewart and Mann did together, the supporting roles were perfectly expressed. No exception here, even to parts that might have only a few lines, the characters are engraved with these lines. Stewart is a single wicked cynic in this film, whose only true friend is sidekick Walter Brennan. It is Brennan's death in the hands of the wicked who make him want to eventually release the golden accord from the bad boys and redeem himself incidentally in this process. John McIntire is the head of the play and he was an undervalued actor with a wide range. He could play excited by the old coders, authoritative figures and, in this case, a particularly ugly and hard-faced offender. <br /> <br /> One of the best western ever.
