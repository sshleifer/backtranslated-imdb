I think this movie got a low rating because it was judged by the worst moments. There is a joke of diarrhea and an embarrassing scene of scratches, but besides, there are actually a few moments that made me laugh out loud. Jason Lee plays an extraordinarily subtle comedy in this movie, and Julia Stiles manages to be pretty funny. Apart from the fact that this movie behaves like the most romantic comedies, after about 40 minutes when you know how it will end. (Which is better than most, where you already know after +/- 5 minutes). Anyway, better movies to watch, but certainly not the worst choice ... Good luck
