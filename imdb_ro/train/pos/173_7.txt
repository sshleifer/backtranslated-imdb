In fact, Goldie Hawn is from Washington (Takoma Park, Maryland), but I can handle it. This is a kind of Mr. Smith who goes to the movie type in Washington, with some variations but with the same premise. I recorded this film a few years ago, because I had a huge passion for Goldie Hawn. The story is interesting, but it's unlikely that a waitress will get an important job in the government just because he saved the life of a big shot. I made myself laugh and upset at the same time. I was laughing because some of the situations she was in were so ridiculous that I had to laugh. (POSIBIL SPOILER AHEAD). I was angry at believing that our government would set up an average citizen in the way it was set up. And the speech he made at the end ... beautiful. Too bad that many people have no courage like this in real life.
