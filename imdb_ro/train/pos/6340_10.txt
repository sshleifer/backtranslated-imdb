First, an explanation of what makes a great movie for me. The excitement of not knowing what will happen next will make me enjoy a movie the first time I watch it (case en point: Twister). There are also other things that come in a tremendous extraordinary vision, such as good humor (John Candy in Uncle Buck and The Great Outdoors), a good good-quality plot (Madeline and Matilda), MAN's imaginative story) and good music (again all Star Wars episodes, Wizard of Oz, Sound of Music). What makes me watch a movie at least six times in the theater and buy a DVD or VHS tape? Characters. That's what I said Cindy Lou Cine and The Grinch. Excellent performance Taylor Momsen and Jim Carrey. The rest of the cast was very good, especially Jeffery Tambor, Bill Irwin, Molly Shannon, Christine Baranski and Josh Ryan Evans. But every scene with Cindy and The Grinch-together is great and very funny and / or unimaginable. Cindy Lou is my favorite character in this film and the most convincing reason why the movie is better than the cartoon. Grinch has a strong plot, good conflicts and a very good theme (I can not start because I do not want to ruin it). Jim Carrey was very funny like The Grinch - especially when he interacted with Cindy. And the music! Wow! Excellent music by James Horner. I liked the selection of instruments and compositions. Good work Jim Carrey - I did not know you could sing. Taylor Momsen! Wow! Your voice is enough reason to see the movie at least once. On solo - Where are you Christmas - is your voice as big as it sounds? Sounds like an F #? This is an obscene range for a 7-year-old (obscene marked in the best possible way). Good job. This is the best performance by a child I've ever heard in a movie (Taylor beat the children from Von Trapp - she's not a small girl!). And now the actors. Jim Carrey was great, funny, and surprisingly very sensitive (this was really shown in his scenes with Taylor Momsen). Taylor Momsen, unspoken expressions (one of the secrets of a good performance) are very strong - she really becomes Cindy Lou Cine. And when he makes a dialogue, he is even stronger. <br /> <br /> ******************************** danger: alert spoiler ****** *************** *************************** ********* **************************************** <br /> <br /> Examples: expression when she sees for the first time The Grinch. This is a classic quote ("You are the one" and then filled in with the Grinch line "yes da da THE GRINCH", after which it sorts and then is saved by The Grinch.) "Thank you for salvation" quoted and the subsequent answer by The Grinch was also very good. My favorite part of the movie is when Cindy invites The Grinch to be Holiday Cheermeister. At least Taylor Momsen keeps Jim Carrey in this place and I hope we see Taylor Momsen in more movies, all that was great about this movie (except for the legs and the nose).
