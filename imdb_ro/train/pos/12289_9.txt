First of all, I would like to point out that I have not read the book, so there was no chance I would be disappointed with this. The powerful defect I saw was historical details, with more cars, trains, clothes, and more. I think they do not belong then. <br /> <br /> *** Possible spoiler ***** <br /> <br /> The technical aspect of the movie is fine, you do not have to boast. But the act, I think, was great. I have no experience in acting, yet I can not believe in the way people can consider this terrible! They may have seen only two movies (ever) and the other must have been really good! I felt very pleasing to Jeremy Irons and I really understood his character, someone who cut the social ladder with hard work, fight against those who would take his life from him, only he involves so much in this struggle, he does not realize that reason is no longer with him and reaches a beaten, disappointed man. The irony has done so credible, I felt with character, despite its brutality. After Jeremy Irons, Winona Ryder is also wonderful as a young romantic woman who is attracted to the revolutionary ideals of her boyfriend (Banderas, had a sub-developed role, I think), and Glenn Close was also very good . Meryl Streep had an average performance, it was not bad, not just the standards of the other actors. Beware of Miguel Guilherme, a beautiful Portuguese actor, between so many stars. In contrast to today's films, here are just interpretations, only people matter, but at the same time it is not a pretentious film, too worried trying to be intellectual. The best proof I liked it, I write a review 7 years later.
