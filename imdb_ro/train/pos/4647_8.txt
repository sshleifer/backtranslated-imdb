It takes a very special character to make a film so miserable, charming, disgusting and repellent, but do it in a way that makes it brilliant and the quintessence of personal cinematic release. Crispin Glover, in all his antics and predispositions "there", has really made something unique. In a world that has become extremely partisan, this film seems to evade the standard lines of creativity and art and scare all of them effectively. Just in front of the bat, the film is based on a rather remote paradigm (if there is a pattern) and originally forms Shirley Temple in front of a swastika and naked women a man with paralysis brain. These are shocking things, but if you had the opportunity for Q & A sessions after the projections, it clearly opens a bag of worms that lets you wonder if it's art or just the smallest common denominator. In any form, you feel the tremor that this movie will eventually cause. It will never be accepted, not even by the supposed supporters of the world who talk boringly about the human condition. Maybe you do not like it, but it's definitely something worth watching.
