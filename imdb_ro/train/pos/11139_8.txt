Over time, dreams like this are made by a naive wizard (JON VOIGT) and a con-man driver (DUSTIN HOFFMAN), who will soon create a friendship based on basic survival skills. A bold movie for his time and a prime example of this type of sculpted landscape explored in the more graphic films of the 1960s. The symbolic of the "end of innocence" in American films, since it was the only X movie to win the best Oscar. JON VOIGT is the one who came to the big city waiting for women to find an easy way to make money when they struggle over his body, but soon he finds that the city is a cool place without a welcome mat for him. Together with a cute connoisseur (DUSTIN HOFFMAN), he goes through a series of serio-comic adventures that leave him disillusioned and bitter, ready to leave the boundaries of a cold plate for the promised sun in Florida, "Ratzo" dreams of living. But even in this final search, the two are defeated. John Schlesinger fine-tuned Waldo Salt's brilliant screenplay, and John Barry's "Cowboy at Night" adds the moments of search and despair. Summary: A true American classic who honestly faces a bold and bold subject to show the underground of certain aspects of city life.
