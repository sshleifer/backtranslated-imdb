Gómez Pereira is responsible for some of the most desperate comedies of the latest Spanish cinema (just take a look at the curriculum vitae) so I did not expect that from "Cosas Que Hacen ..." ... In fact , I do not know why in the world I decided to pursue it. Anyway, I just did ... And a surprise. It seems Gómez Pereira has matured and is now able to make a good movie. It's the last thing that deals with the mid-life crisis, disappointment and looking for a second chance after you've destroyed everything. The last half hour of the movie (the most dramatic) is the best part, and it's worth watching the movie. We also have the lead role of Eduard Fernandez, and I think he is the best actor in his generation (by far). My rate: 7/10
