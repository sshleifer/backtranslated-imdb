This is a pretty boring movie. Good-shot with realistic performance, especially a good one from Depardieu as a bad boy and boy, with realistic locations and connotations of art-houses everywhere, fails because the director does not take any stand, stand or critical comment on which it stipulates. One of France's summer and regular partners for the films with Depardieu - I think they've done 7 together - Pialat fails to get involved. It seems to be a treaty about why women fall for the bad guy who will do harm when he has a thoughtful friend and a good husband. Isabelle Hupert, who plays a nonchalant philanthropist, offers oprobium answers like "I do not know"; "I love my arms"; "I love her way of making love" to her inquisitive husband, who tries to hit her out of the house, but pale and reconsidered because ... I suppose he loves her. So, he accepts and hopes for what? That she will wake up one day and come to her senses. Things like this are not answered in Piatat's docu-drama style, with long speeches and even longer lengths that do not add up. I know the answers are not added, but please take a position. Jules et Jim, that's not it. The last shot as cold as the movie we just watched is a headache and headache just for the most forgiving.
