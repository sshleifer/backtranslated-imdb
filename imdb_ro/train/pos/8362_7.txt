The updated version of a story that had been turned into a movie in 1938 in England (Return of the Frog) on ​​police pursuit of a criminal killer known as a frog because of a frog such as wakefulness (bulging eyes) bar. <br /> <br /> One of Wallace's best movies from the 1960s is a bit of solid entertainment. Clearly influenced by (or influenced) by the restoration of Dr Mabuse's films, the Frog seems to be more a super villain than a master thief. Though it's not the best of Wallace movies, it's worth a look. It would be an interesting double feature with the previous excellent movie. <br /> <br /> Between 6 and 7 out of 10.
