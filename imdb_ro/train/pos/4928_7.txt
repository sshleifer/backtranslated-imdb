Given its launching time, the story that unleashes in 1950, "panic in the street" was a surprise. The corpse of a mysterious illegal immigrant is found and is lost like no one until a further examination by a public health inspector who claims the body carries a stump of bubonic plague. However, with the current drama in the world today, this strangely helps this movie to appear credible today to viewers. Distribution and crew are perfect. Richard Widmark, in his first role, following his performance in Night and Town, Jack Palance, in his debut film, which is also starring in the film, is Paul Douglas and a young Barbara Bel Geddes and rather cute). A whole number of uncreated, unprofessional actors (typical of Kazan) complete the remaining slots. Elia Kazan directs Joe MacDonald's films (he will later work with Richard Widmark again in 1953, much better "Pickup on South Street") and great Alfred Newman scores. Almost everyone involved here did a better job, "Panic in Streets" is still a rewarding hour, however. Especially for the film-noir enthusiast.
