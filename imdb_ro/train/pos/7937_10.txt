I thought the movie "I do not do it" was fantastic. In the past, I watched Rob Estes on "Suddenly Susan" and "Melrose Place" and Josie Bissett on "Melrose Place" and liked to see them again in "I Do Not Do". They have a great chemistry together (they think they are married in real life helps this!) - in the film they are widowed with children and careers and fall in love and try to combine their chaotic families already occupied without leaving the ball. Of course they are hindered, but they keep it together, which means working and raising a family. So many people talked about this movie - all good! - and the movie left us to want more. This would make a great series - appealing to many ages! - it would be so beautiful to see a real life on earth a family show that shows the reality of so many lives today - instead of the so-called "Reality TV" that all posts overwhelm us these days. Somebody tells people at ABC Family that they have the beginning of a new series here!
