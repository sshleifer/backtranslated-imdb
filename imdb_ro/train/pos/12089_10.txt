The Barbara Steele-dominated movie with barber hair was seen when I was seven or eight, and I created permanent images of vampire men and women who were hunting a castle looking for blood. Steele is an icon of horror movies and glittering beauty, and the visions of Romero's premature death, GOD'S LIVE DAY, unite them in my mind. the link between this film and THE HAUNTING, which is intelligent but ambiguous about the forces present. LA DANZA MACABRE is a b-movie unqualified, dare to fall in love with Barbara Steele and suffer the consequences. There is no draw of Claire Bloom. Comparisons with HAUNTING are superficial. And no, this movie MUST NOT be remodeled. Not only is it a product of the sixties, but the high percentage of Hollywood-free Christians can not understand MACABRE's formula for terror. This formula is based on an imperative factor: GOOD WRITING. Classics like CASTLE and Corman's Poe with R. Matheson and OUT OF THE PAST at Tourneur have a strong writing community. It's simple. Take a real writer like Richard Matheson or Steve McQuarrie and let them plot in the cinematic misery of today. Besides, allow Hollywood to try out an original material for a change and to stop exploiting the obviously superior product of the past.
