I really enjoyed this movie. I read some of the other comments and, although I pity those who did not understand it, I agree with some critics. Which, strangely, makes me more like this movie. I accept that they have a pretty nice cast to remake a smart movie for the general public, but it has so many levels and it's still great to watch. I also love movies like this that cause so many debates, theories, possible endings and hidden subtexts. Congratulations Mr.Crowe, definitely in my Top Ten. <br /> <br /> He saw this when he first came out as I returned to Mexico, it was late at night, and I had to go back to my hotel and have a major paranoid journey! Where does dream and reality begin?
