Unfortunately, 8 simple rules, because I gave my teenage daughter, was the last sitcom John Ritter worked after his tragic death in 2003. He was one of my favorite actors. He had everything, a comedy (who can watch him in the company of Three), but he was also an excellent dramatic actor (It was worth watching your TV movie). and Martin) John was STATE, he was very reason why I was attracted to the first show, and it was the perfect comedy delivery that was able to crack me every time. <br /> <br /> I liked how the show was not entirely sugar-sweet (just as much as I liked the Cosby Show, come on, they were too cute with each other) brilliantly represented the typical dynamics of the family. She was quite realistic with all the brothers' rivalry and the suicide of her parents, but they were still funny. A lot of American sitcoms are trying to fill the programs entirely with morals and not, and this show did not do that. Yes, there have been some, such as addressing important issues such as drugs and aggression, but they have not been anything but a fun comedy. The way they wrote John's death in the show was made brilliant, I still cry like a child every time I see. You felt how excited the emotions were during those incredibly heavy episodes. I'm sad that the show has been canceled, I'm still glad to watch you play and I'm not tired of it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> John Ritter will always be remembered because you hilariously imagine this protector father who would rather close his daughters in their room than meet a boy = ) Here Rock Ritter!
