This very derivative film will be fun for those who have not seen some of the more obscure anime movies. I liked most of it, especially after the opening hours quite full of the museum (although the pre-title sequence is very fun and includes some of the best animation bits). James Garner as commander and Leonard Nimoy as king offer impressive performances.
