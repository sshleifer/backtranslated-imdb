This movie is very interesting. I've seen it twice and it seems Glover has hit the nail on his head with what he pretends to achieve. I can refer to the indignation that the director clearly expresses against the current bodily disorder, which is an aggression in every media center, and the things about which we, as a culture, must not "think". Exclusion expressed by Glover through the "scandalous" elements in films is so clear in visceral aggression and beautiful in poetic potency. I'm glad to see this movie and it's even clearer that Glover is interested in something, the second part of what will be a trilogy. Is OK! ALL IS WELL. See that too. People who reject this film as "carefree" or "pretentious" really lose the boat. This is a smart movie. If you can see it with his live show, he's going ahead with his books, which is also very scary. The way you enter his mentality is indeed something. You will have an experience!
