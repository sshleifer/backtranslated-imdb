I wanted to see this for the longest time, James Merendino is a great director. SLC Punk is one of my favorite movies, and in the first ten minutes of this movie I thought it was a great pursuit afterwards, but it starts shooting. The action and the direction were wonderful. In fact, everything in the movie seemed to run, except for the script. Sometimes the only thing that kept my attention was that she was the most beautiful woman in the world, Claire Forlani. This movie was good, but I expected more. Look for great cameos by Chi McBride and Chris McDonald.
