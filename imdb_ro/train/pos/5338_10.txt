If I go see a porn movie, I prefer to have a kind of plot and dialogue in the descent. Behind the bedroom doors is one of the few that I have encountered with those attributes. The new girl joins the nature of the neighbor's human nature and the weaknesses of the seduction and the sex in question. Chelsea Blue, (that is, Brooke LaVelle) is the actress of choice to play the role of the blackmailer and play a magnificent role. Chelsea Blue is a very talented and extremely beautiful actress. The movie gets a total of 10, just because it's in it. Her film partner, Monique Alexander, is a definite box. The two should do more together. In this film, however, Monique, who plays Gigi, does not have much to do or say. It's too bad. Looks like she has more talent to share. I like the girl who was the next (possible) DA's wife. I forgot her name, but she looks pretty good and not a bad actress. Nicole Sheridan ... I'm still trying to figure out what they are so excited about some people. It is obvious that parts of it bought a paid one. What's good, but is it finished? I'm sorry, but come on! I'm afraid her performance would have dropped the rating one, except for Chelsea's talent and beauty, which has priority over any negative. Generally, this movie is a good one.
