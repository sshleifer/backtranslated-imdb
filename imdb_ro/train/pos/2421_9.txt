You should not take what I will say easily. I've seen many, many movies and I've seen them a lot in the press. So when I tell you that this movie has the most amusing scene I've ever seen in a movie, you could listen to me. There is a multitude of opinions on what makes this stupid film INCREDIBLY as fun as it is. And to those who just did not, well, I can not blame them too much. The scene I'm talking about comes about 30 minutes and involves a dead convict linked to John Candy. So far, I found the bad, confusing film and started to lose. When this scene came, I laughed so loudly, I shed my pants. No movie has ever done that to me. When the project started, "Going Berserk" was supposed to be SCTV. I remember it was announced. Over time, the song was banished by John Candy, Joe Flaherty & Eugene Levy. There must also have been a change of regime to Universal while she was shot because, after release, she was shown in nearly ten theaters. When I looked at the second time, I listened to the thematic song (which, in fact, shows how incomprehensible the plot is), relaxed my logical nerve and realized what was going on. In addition to the aforementioned routine, "Going Berserk" has many other hilarious scenes to recommend it. This is almost a shot of 3 Stooges, except it is much more fun. Director David Steinberg has a clear sync and probably laughed. As for Candy, who is essentially responsible here, NEVER was more fun. With all the scene devices and explanatory scenes thrown out of the window, he runs absolutely wild. Flaherty and Levy follow him effortlessly. There is a plot, but it's a plot like "Animal House" had a plot, and yes, the scenario is uneven, and a bit slower to get started. Once you know this, however, you can appreciate the madness of the SCTV style. It's bad, but it's stupid and you have to remember when you see it. See it and discover for yourself if it has the funniest scene of all time.
