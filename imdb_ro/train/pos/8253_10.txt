This is the first movie I've seen in the past year! It's incredibly amazing, incredibly original, incredibly great (they've gone to this incredibly awesome aspect on the Technicolor screen that's great to look at) and actually has depth in character and in what it says about society. It is a truly intelligent satire that finds everything from national security to racial problems while at the same time letting you laugh and realize how much the world lives in fear. Carrie Anne Moss turns into a comedy show I have never imagined coming from her! She's cute, funny and sexy! Billy Connolly is great as Fido, who can only eat and die! And Dylan Baker as a father is priceless. In fact, all distribution is perfect. Henry Czerny as the bad guy, Tim Blake Nelson as a neighbor with her hot girlfriend of sexy zombie (get the idea now?) Funny, though provocative and yet stunning! Go and see this movie! It's like you've never seen before.
