I look at this page and I find it disheartening that I have to listen to someone who comes back and embarks on a real classic. Sure, I agree to let everyone have their opinion, but here is mine: This film should not be missed by any classical horror observer, and many viewers around the world should be seen. Sure, he lost some of his flair and magnificence with his age, especially in the current world of CGI effects, but that's not the reason you should like it. You should like it because it's actually a scary movie, even for current standards. It's a general agility that will drag you as much as the original audience, so I do not miss a classic if you did not give it a chance. Look at her, but not with a critical attitude. Watch him have fun, as he was originally intended.
