Again Stacy Peralta is true first of all for those who have lived the story. Allowing those involved in the genesis of the big surf to tell us their story, how it felt and what they believed, you got the feeling that you were there. The film takes you from the fifties to the next, focusing on three main architects who contribute to the development and development of sport. Candid "home movie," such as self-directed films and their contemporaries will take you further into their world. The layers of music, culture, technical information, a clear view of the participant's athleticism and fabulous images of large waves give you an overview of this aspect of navigation. <br /> <br /> Very worthy to be watched.
