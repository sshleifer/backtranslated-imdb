Stephen King was raised on movies like this one. Movies like this and "Jeepers Creepers" are "backsliding" to the best one-day horror movie classes. These are meant to be fun, cheap and hopefully be: some good scares. Anyone seeking a theory on the human condition should move on to this feature of the creature, because that's all ... all this will be anytime. <br /> <br /> Do not stop what has already been considered garbage. - Good, fun, garbage! If you like this, I recommend "Jeepers Creepers" Jeepers Creepers 2 "30 Days Night" "Scarecrow" ('88) Terror '' Death Proof '' and 'Halloween III: Season of the Witch'
