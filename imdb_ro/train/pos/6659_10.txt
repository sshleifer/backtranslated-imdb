She needs the courage to make a film about Gandhi in India, in which she is not shown as a man who could not do any harm. This movie shows how Mahatma has failed to be a decent father (at least in the eyes of his son). <br /> <br /> The performances are extraordinary, the cinema is fantastic, the fabulous direction, but the love of the movie. If we intend to make this movie without box-office quizzes, which implies here, then a brilliant attempt, but if the producers expected this to be a commercial success, then the fate of the film was condemned the day they had chose this subject. 20 years from now, this film will be remembered for the brilliant portrayal of Harilal by Akshaye Khanna. He deserves an Oscar nomination for this ... And, frankly, it's not the only performance that deserves applause, Shefali Chhaya is also terrible. <br /> <br /> Watch the scene where Harilal hears about his father's death.No dialogs, Do not cry, but a great shot by Khanna.Its one of the most beautiful scenes ever shot in the history of Cinema Gandhi, My Father is not at all an exciting movie theater, but yes, its excellent cinema and a viewing.
