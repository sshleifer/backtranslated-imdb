This movie was incredible. I would recommend it to anyone, much better than what I had already anticipated. It was certainly a spectacular movie. It's an amazing story, with amazing actors and creators. Surely another great movie with Denzel Washington. (he should not be surprised) Derek Luke did a wonderful job.
