as usual, I always like to read "ugly" comments about any given film. especially one that I would like to comment on. and is not so much a point-counterpoint business deal; I like to see what people say on flipside. However, I want to deal with one thing. many people who hated him called it "beautiful but shallow" to paraphrase, some going so far as to say that the desire of the norm and yet the inability to help his brother was a mundane plot at best. > I would like to disagree. <br /> <br /> As a brother of a brother who has a similar dysfunction, I can refer. every day, you see abused ones alone, knowing only that their current path will inevitably lead them to self-destruction. and it is not about the specifics of what they did when; how or why paul has decided to get involved in gambling and to associate with the people discussed; is really more how they are connected by cable. on the one hand, are the real geniuses, and on the other hand, painfully self-destructive (there are very many like people like Howard Hughes - the same forces that lead them are the same forces that destroy them) and you always see this thing, you know that, and what's worse, you realize you can not do anything about it. For Norman Maclean, a river that passes through him was probably a way of finding a response to the reason the tragedy had to occur and who was to blame. in the end, nobody is and often there is no reason. but it takes many personal sufferings to truly reach this achievement. sometimes it takes a lifetime. and sometimes it never comes at all.
