In 1970, after an absence of five years, Kurosawa did what would be his first colorful film. Dodes' Ka-Den is a movie that focuses around many stories that intersect in a small Tokyo brick. The title comes from the sound of a mentally retarded boy who imagines he is operating a train. We start to know more people in the small community, the two drunkards who change their wives because they are not happy with what they have. The old man who is the city center, who helps a thief who tries to rob him. The very poor father and son who can never afford a house, so he imagines himself. By the end of the movie, the stories come out, some are happy, some sad. Since this was Kurosawa's first color film, you can see that he uses it to his advantage and looks. Maybe too much. This movie goes in many different directions and it's hard to settle in and get into it. But do not misunderstand me, Dodes' Ka-Den can not be the best Kurosawa, but comes from the greatest director of all time, is far better than 99% of today's films.
