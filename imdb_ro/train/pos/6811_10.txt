Although I generally do not like remakes believing that remakes are time-wasting; this film is an exception. I did not know until now until I read the previous comment that it was a remake, so my opinion is just about the real movie and not a comparison. The story and the way it is written is no question: it is Capote. There is no need for more words. The song by Anthony Edwards and Eric Roberts is great. I have seen some movies with them, each in one or the other. I was sure they were good actors, and in Eric's case I always wondered why his sister is the best known star and not her brother. This time, this certainty is raised to the fact, no doubt. His game, as well as Mr. Edwards' play, is clearly the top of all professions. We recommend that this movie be on the first 50 movies to view and store on your DVDs.
