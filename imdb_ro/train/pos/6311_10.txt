This movie is very hilarious and has a great compilation of actors such as William H. Macy, who have always made such roles, perhaps the most representative, Fargo; and George Clooney, who is a very good actor showing his comedian work in Cohen Brothers' movie, "O brother, where are you?" which turns out to be one of my favorite movies ever! But it was hard to find "Welcome to Collinwood," here in Mexico. My town has no good places to buy some good movies. I tried to buy it at Blockbuster, but I do not know it after the original name, so maybe it will be easy to find if I have the name they gave in Mexico, does anyone do it? Do not you remember! Luck.
