This is one of Jodie Foster's best movies there and has been largely ignored because of the widespread view of the public as a teenage film about it. She has great shows, especially a battle scene between Jodie and her mother, convinced by a compelling Sally Kellerman. The three girls who play Jodie's friends are somehow amateurish, but I think they are worth seeing.
