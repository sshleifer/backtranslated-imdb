Bell Book and Candle was released in December 1958 and includes James Stewart, Kim Novak and Jack Lemmon. and Ernie Kovaks. This movie had James Stewart and Kim Novak in the second pair on the screen (after the classic Vertigo by Alfred Hitchcock, released at the beginning of the same year). This was Stewart's last film as a romantic story, being too old at the age of 50 to play that role. The film is about a witch played by Kim Novak, who is attracted to a mortal played by James Stewart. He puts a spell on him and heads over him, in love with her. I liked the film and its distribution. This film was moderately successful, which was nominated for the Golden Globe for Best Film. GimmeClassics
