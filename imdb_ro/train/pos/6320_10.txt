The main reason I wanted to see this movie was because of the wonderful prize. A ton of my favorite actors in a movie is equal to amazement without actually seeing it. But this movie caught me. It was not what I expected at all. It's been a while since I saw it, but I remember I could not help laughing anymore! And it was not just the distribution that made me. The script was amazingly written. Every time you expect something to happen, it has not happened. There have been so many twists and turns, but they fit with the whole tone of the movie instead of coming out as pretentious. The cinema, along with the set, was absolutely beautiful. I really can not say anything wrong about this movie! Express, I would be Andrew Davoli a little longer on the screen!
