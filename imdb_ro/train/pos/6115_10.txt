Have you ever wondered how far a movie could go? <br /> <br /> Schizophrenic explores relentlessly the extreme world with Harry Russo. <br /> <br /> Harry is an aggressive, drug-addictive killer and drug addict who will stop at nothing to destroy those who stand between him and insanity. Driven by the demonic voices of his vagabond, Harry's ventricle, Harry starts killing them. <br /> <br /> From the director Ron Atkins comes the first installment of the dirtiest story ever to be filmed The only other movie we've seen similar will happen as the second installment called Schizophreniac Necromaniac This is a movie with very low budget and it will not be for everyone, but if you are looking for something disturbing, different and awful, then it would make a good choice. <br /> <br /> DO NOT EXPOSE ANY WITHOUT MODERAL DAY HORROR DAY (like Scream) <br /> <br /> Spectator's discretion is recommended
