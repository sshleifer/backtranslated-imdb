Strong, the powerful supreme gangster Frankie Diomede (always the great Lee Van Cleef in fine and robust form) was arrested and sent to prison so he could cast a traitor detective. He grabs Tony Breda (a nice portrait of Tony Lo Bianco), but also the donkey bastard and the young couple. Frank and Tony form an unlikely friendship behind the bars. Tony helps Frank get out of hand and helps him in his attempt to avenge himself in a group of mob rivals led by Jean Annunziata, ruthless, played by Jean Rochefort. Director Michele Lupo, who works from a scenario absorbed by Sergio Donati and Luciano Vincenzoni, tells the story clean at a steady pace, while sustaining an appropriate tone but occasionally easy to rise (a beating of the brutal shower of a jailhouse and a long tracking rate of destructive mondo cars). Van Cleef and Lo Bianco show a beautiful, weak chemistry on the screen; the relationship between their characters is alternately amusing and moving. Edwige Fenech's reward does not care much about Tony's girlfriend, Orchid, but at least she gets to discover her gorgeous and voluptuous body in a much-appreciated nude scene. Riz Ortolani, groovy, pulsating, syncopat funk / jazz score certainly hits swingin 'swing'. The cinematography polished by Joe D'Amato and Aldo Tonti is just as impressive. A very interesting and fun winner.
