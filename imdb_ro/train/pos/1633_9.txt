I loved this movie when it came out in the 80's and still does! I still quote classic lines such as "tell her again" and "you said you'd break my balls at home." Ron Leibman was hot and very funny! Although it has been undervalued and rejected by MAD, I have to say that this little jewel will always be my treasure and a movie I would take with me if I were sent to a deserted island! I just want someone to launch the DVD because my VHS tape is a bit worn out! If you like comedy stinging, this is for sure for you and should be considered a classic cult! It is military humor at the best and worse! Rent it if you can not own it!
