Once you have seen this small, pleasant and comic film, you will feel better. Yves B. Pelletier's violin gave birth to this wonderful moment of film, which, in my opinion, will be recognized as a 2004 marker for Quebec. The actors Isabelle Blais, Emmanuel Bilodeau, Sylvie Moreau and Stéphane Gagnon have a delicate show. I would compare the feeling that this wonderful story gives you the ones that Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain has given. So if you would like the magnificent Jean-Pierre Jeunet movie, I would say you should also like the first film from Yves B. Pelletier, Les Aimants
