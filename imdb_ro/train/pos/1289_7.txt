First, the film is an ingenious work of art (film). The intrigue was full of surprises, a small desolate pretending to be a mature heir to a million dollars and how he spends it. I mean how hurt this is. Walt Disney broke up this time. Comedy is often awaited, but unexpected. I mean, this movie was OK or it was a good movie. It also teaches a lot about the wise youths and I this kid is really wise and a little time intelligent pants. But it's also shit. How the hell a guy like that kid got a hot police boy and his father let him go. It's like letting a killer be released for ten years. If I did that, I'd be beaten with a "sublel jack" (a giant cane that girds you when you really got hard). This kid is really lucky. Back to the story. Movie makers really knew what they did when they made this movie, but it's still not perfect. The act was good and bad. The child and the woman had no chemistry, no father, but the brooches were excellent. "The special effects on the other hand were blades, plus this film is not based on reality.
