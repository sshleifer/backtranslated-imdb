This film made for French television deals with the tragic effect it has on a close family. When Leo, the youngster at the heart of the story, is diagnosed as having the AIDS virus, he tells his parents that they can not believe them. The film is a study of the way this family deals with its subject. The director, Christophe Honore, must be congratulated on bringing this open account to the screen. Nowhere, but in France, this story can not be made for movies because of the subject. The news has a devastating effect on Marcel, the brother who hears about what Leo has contracted, despite the way parents want to shelter him. Yaniss Lespart and Pierre Mignard do a compelling job in portraying brothers.
