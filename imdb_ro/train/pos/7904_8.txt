If you have read and ever enjoyed a novel by Tom Robbins, you will appreciate this film as a whole-hearted attempt to translate the style of unconventional writing into a great piece of work. The actors and direction of this film are both good. <br /> <br /> The only problem with the movie, as I see it, is that Robbins can relate his ideas and feelings with his words that were still beyond Hollywood's capabilities at the time that this movie was shot. <br /> <br /> Considering both the irrelevance of today's films and the desire and ability of today's public to bury themselves in bizarre, I think even Cowgirls ... would receive a better reception today than when was originally launched.
