I happen to get into this movie one night, so I decided to see it! I was very pleased with the movie ... I thought it was a wonderful plot. It's a great feeling to know that a dead man has returned and that you have the second chance to say what you mean! And this wife remained dedicated for 23 years! I thought it was a great movie!
