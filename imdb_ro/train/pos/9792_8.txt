Once a year "comes" such a movie and makes things easy for you. You have no effort to believe that it is good, it's just that it is. You enjoy while watching and taking her home with you. I can not say that it is absolutely flawless, but it is close. Actor - great, story - interesting and with suspense elements. It's a small, fairly predictable family story, but it's not even the secret itself. is how it takes orbit to get to it. I was impressed by the way the director introduced her deep relationship (her blind face and her cousin). The only thing I did not like so much is the actress who played my mother, it was too hard and unnecessary. Keren
