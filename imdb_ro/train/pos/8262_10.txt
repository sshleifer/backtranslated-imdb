The effort to use a mining catastrophe as a vehicle to declare the director's disapproval of war. The audience not only learns a lot about early mining rescue procedures, but we find that Europeans in the period between World War I and World War II have pacifists (for lack of a better term). Speeches given by each country's representative at the end of the film are inspired by time. Although the revised edition, with the technology of transferring early foreign movies, sometimes "cutting headlines," this film has its own look in many different ways. Character analysis, lighting techniques, historical content, and a script that tested and inspired many writers and directors. Pabst continued to direct and put Weil & Brecht, the original star, Lotte Lenya, "The Three Penny Opera."
