I think I really love this movie. "Prix de Beaute" was originally a silent film, but later it was reprogrammed in French in 1930. Despite the fact that someone else's voice was named over it, it remains an amazing force for Louis Brooks. The fact that her singing voice is called by the legendary Edith Piaf helps us purge the purists about the deception of duplication. <br /> <br /> This is Lulu's story and we first see her at a resort with her beloved macho, Andre (Georges Charlia) and their friend Antonin (Augusto Bandini). Lulu enters the frame like legs: we see her inside the car, changing her in her bathing suit. Lulu is very free, showing his body, and this does not work well with Andre. When Lulu considers the Miss Europe title, we know that a happy ending will not be at the end of Easy Street. <br /> <br /> The film seems to focus a lot on the men's beautiful ogling women. We see a lot of bathing beauty and the reactions of the men who look at them. But at its center, Louise Brooks is magnificent. <br /> <br /> If you do not mind watching movies from the past, consider checking this movie. Louise Brooks is not a name that most movie lovers could know right away, but as soon as you see it, you'll be fascinated and you'll want to know more. Also, check it in "Pandora's Box" if you can find it. Be cautious about releasing the US Kino DVD. I do not know if their projection speed is correct. Many scenarios seem to be presented at a speed too fast. It might have been the way they were shot. I do not know. But because it's the only way to see this movie, it's worth swallowing a bitter pill.
