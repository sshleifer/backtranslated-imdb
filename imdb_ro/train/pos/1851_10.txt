He watched this film in August at the 27th Annual National Conference of Black Journalists in Milwaukee, WI, is the first public screening. THE FILM IS GREAT !!! Derek Luke is great as Antwone Fisher. This young actor has a very bright future. Real Antwone Fisher has done a wonderful job of writing the film, and Denzel's direction is really money. See the opening weekend. You will not be disappointed.
