I just looked at this movie, by mistake. What a small stone. This film, made in 1956, looks and feels like a late film in the seventies. And it's actually better, narrower and more correct than, say, the blue soldier. The ecological, anthropological subtones are long before their time. Undevaluated cinema is superb and terribly realistic. Much more than The Dances with Wolves, The Last Hunt manages to convey the appearance of the buffalo fields of the end of the 1800s. Probably because those in the film were killing fields. The movie was shot during direct forest exploitation, so the animals you see are really shot, the bones are real. In conclusion, a highly underestimated Western masterpiece, superbly directed, shot and shot.
