Personally, I really like this movie and the novel (I read the first book and decided to see the movie). First, the plot is truly original and unique. The actor is also wonderful and I like the song. Judd Crandall (played by Fred Gwynne) fits perfectly into his role and sells him real. There are also a few lines of horn thrown there (Idk if they wanted to be corny), but they really will ease the mood and give a good laugh. The atmosphere of Maine is really a perfect place to film this movie and attracts you all in the whole movie. Not only will you like, but you will want to see it again and again, I recommend this 100% to any horror fan!
