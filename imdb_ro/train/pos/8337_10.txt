Being a great fan of the romantic comedy genre, and therefore I have seen a large number of such films, it is rare that I feel unique. As a matter of fact, it's as rare as I found breathing through laughter during several scenes. The love story is a little thin on the planet, but I would say it's probably the best, because this romantic comedy has a strong focus on "comedy" and in any case it stretches the limits of credibility just a little more than I like most rom companies. The four scientists have offered some of the funniest moments not only in this movie but in any movie I've seen for a long time. I hesitated for the shortest moments before choosing a "10" on a "9" rating as I think too many people use it without discrimination and therefore the maximum rating loses some of its impact. I'm also a big fan of Meg Ryan who helps, but this is one of the few movies I've seen that I would say is totally shaded. She and Tim Robbins are taken as drivers, but for me the second mirror plays in the antics of the humble intellectuals. An original laugh-out-hard movie.
