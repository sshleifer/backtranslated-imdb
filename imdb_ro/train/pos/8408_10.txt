"It was not me! It was, my twin brother Rupert!" Bobby tells Dugan when he is confronted with the fact that he ended up in Sally's place. I have used this line a dozen times over the years (no one has yet to believe that, though). This movie is one of the best for fun and untrustworthy. Steven Oliver was perfect for Dugan's role, so much he was in 1978's "Malibu Beach" as the same character (not as long on the screen). "Nobody calls Dugan has come!" Is another line for centuries. This classic film definitely deserves the admission price.
