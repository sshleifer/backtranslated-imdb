This movie has a lot of gross potential. The script is sharp, the dialogue is (usually) excellent (though it might lose the stingy voice), the direction and the cinema are surprisingly good, although some of the experiments do not work. The main problem here is David Duchovny. Once a geek boy, always a geek boy; and the only sad fact is he can only play Fox Mulder. Position, try to be slick, possess, try to be a macho. Eventually he's trying too hard. He overcame his character, he goes beyond his lines and is just overtaken in all ways by Timothy Hutton and Angelina Jolie, who are each in a class above him in terms of acting qualities. Timothy Hutton was (as always) very good. It was a moment or two in which he dramatized his role, but you could say he's having fun with him. He looked at the role and became the physical and atmospheric character. Angelina Jolie was also very good. He did not have a role; in fact, although she could have used a much stronger person ... her character was not quite developed, though she had remarkably well done what she had. And the chemistry between her and Hutton was obvious (maybe that's why Uma left him ...); Overall, it was rough around the edges, but a solid effort of good distribution and great support roles. If David Duchovny had not destroyed his role, he would have been much better. 7/10.
