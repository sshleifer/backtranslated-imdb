This show was absolutely awesome and I always look forward to seeing him. All the characters were fun and wonderful in their own way, each episode offered a non-stop laugh and was completely fun and different from many other shows. Everyone was absolutely crazy and it was amazingly funny that you could not help but love this show. There were a few episodes of weight, but the show of the '70s has always managed to create a kind of pleasant atmosphere, It does not matter. It was one of the best broadcasts ever, and I will watch this show whenever I can, because it will never get old, it will not become unfortunate and will never become uninteresting.
