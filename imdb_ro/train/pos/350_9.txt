I wanted to see Valentine ever since I saw that Denise Richards and Marley Shelton were in it because they've ever played in some of my favorite movies. When I looked at Valentine, I was amazed at how big the story line was. He's killing me to see he has a low rating, because it was not horrible at all. The actors and actresses played the pieces wonderfully and the way it ended was so bright and cunning. Some scenes were a bit incredible and / or poor and I admit that in some minor parts it was just a little boring, but overall it was non-stop fun and suspense. It had a wonderful story line that made you guess all the way and does not deserve all the nonsense it gets. I recommend watching this movie anytime, but especially at Valentine's Day because it's safe to give you a chills. Oh, and do not even pay attention to the trailer OR rating, please, NO ...
