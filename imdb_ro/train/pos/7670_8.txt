I really liked "Doctor Mordrid". This is a low budget movie, which can be an advantage for some, but I have no problem with it. I admire him more for it because it's more fun than the fun Hollywood creates every year. Too bad he did not receive a theatrical release; I do not know about anyone else, but I'd go see him in the theaters. "Doctor Mordrid" is a fantastic science-fiction movie that anyone can enjoy, especially if they're in science fiction like me. I do not see why it's a R-rated movie; only a word f is said, and there are no terrible death scenes and no blood at all. The timeless rivalry between the wizards Anton and Kabal (Anton wanted to use his powers to save the human race, while Kabal wanted to enslave them) gave the story a sense of delight, while the mythical line added a charm the story itself. Basically, this movie is just fun to watch. There is an unintentionally funny thing in this movie, though: seeing Jeffrey Combs holding a straight face while wearing the blue heel and suit. That makes me laugh every time I see it. But I can do it ... Anyway, the act is great; the main protagonists (Anton and his girlfriend, Samantha) are very nice; Anton is sympathetic and hospitable, and Samantha is friendly. Plus, the settings were great. The floating island, in the other dimension, was a very cold atmosphere; yet let us take a look twice, though; it would have been great to see more scenes here. The main setting was also very clean; Anton's apartment is very spacious and has several refreshing devices, especially the monitoring system he uses to keep track of world events. He even has a man he keeps in his apartment named Edgar. Overall, this great movie; it was fun to watch, and the main actors made a lot of sense in their roles. If you find anywhere you rent "Doctor Mordrid", you have to rent it (or, in my case, buy it, it was definitely the money well spent)! <br /> <br /> My rating: 8 stars out of ten. <br /> <br />
