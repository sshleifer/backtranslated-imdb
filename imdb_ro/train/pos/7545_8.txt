I really liked it though while reading the comments was quite disturbing to me. But as an anime art fan I can fully understand this perfect art work, even if some of it was against my cultures and thinks .. But hey, is the world of art .. !! The beginning of the movie is very strong, weird and confusing. It's hard to understand the content that makes me respect the one who did it. just someone who is extremely open can make a movie so bold ... it is not absolute for children .. even though the characters are cute and adorable but go through some disturbing adventurous adventures (sorry if the spelling is wrong) of your memory.
