This is one of my favorite Motos, and I've seen them all. As usual, Lorre is Moto's charming self. Lionel Atwill plays a delightful museum curator, the usual comic noises are fun here and there are a lot of suspects to throw our eyes on. It's fast and fun. The archaeologist does not have the same flair as Thomas Beck, the second ordinary leader in these programmers, but he is appropriate. Stepin Fetchit is on board, and while stereotyped, his lines are funny, he does not get angry at his intelligence and actually saves the day shortly on the screen.
