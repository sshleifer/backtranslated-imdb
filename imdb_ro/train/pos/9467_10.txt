I was attracted to DAN IN REAL LIFE from the excellent and thirsty reviews for a Dramedy that was well written - thank you Peter Hedges - and because when Steve Carell plays in the movie, you know that an audience will find that in LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE, a show that is very fun and rewarding. DAN IN REAL LIFE has promised this. The film is so real for many families around the world who have lost a member and yet have continued their lives in search of something that would offer their magic back before their loss. With Steve Carell and the wonderful Juliette Binoche, their relationship was so beautifully made and written that their scenes were so real to their characters and their travels. The show, the scenes and the story have made DAN IN REAL LIFE one to remember while heading for the holidays.
