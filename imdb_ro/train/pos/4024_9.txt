I really enjoyed this movie. He kept my guess until the very end of what would happen. One of the better movies about the partition I've seen. Urdula Matondkar is also gorgeous. This is one of the most personal and underground movies I've seen on the partition. It's a little less important than Gadar and it's really an emotional roller coaster in which you start with one opinion of what's going on and you go out completely on the other. This is not the typical bollywood fare, but rather an art-house movie. The best part of this film is that it does not dehumanize part of the partition conflict when it focuses on someone else's story. It does not blame or win, but it allows you to draw your conclusions about things.
