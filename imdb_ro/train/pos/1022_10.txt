Stargate is the best show ever. All actors are absolutely perfect for the roles there. I like the connection between the characters. If you have not seen this show, I strongly recommend you. Although this program is compared to Star trek a lot of time, in fact, can not be because it is completely different. I am a fan of trek stars, but I will certainly miss this show above any star passing. Unfortunately, I live in New Zealand and we do not get Stargate on our TV, so if I want to see that I have to buy DVDs and that Season 10 is not here yet, so I can not see it for some time which is very depressing). However, this program is very good and must be seen, but it has to be warned that it is very dependent. So in the summer I loved Stargate (and Amanda Tapping).
