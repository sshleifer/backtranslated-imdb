This is a movie that will take time to get out of your head once you've seen it. Dialogues are almost perfect, which was to be expected because it was adapted from a piece. Actors give everything they can, the story is simple and attractive. 88 minutes of pure happiness! Yvan Attal is totally credible in his role, Sandrine Kiberlain is still a beautiful blonde (but not so bad) offering as much eye pleasure as ears, Jean-Paul Rouve offers an excellent approximation of the total jerk (and proud to be like that), and Marina Fois is the foolish friend who always kneels when you expect at least. Thumbs up at Bernard Rapp and Associates for adapting this great game and all the best for future productions! I would have liked to have more of them in today's production. If you liked it, you'll probably enjoy: "A Familial Air" and "Cuisine et dependances". Both were written and played by the couple Bacri / Jaoui.
