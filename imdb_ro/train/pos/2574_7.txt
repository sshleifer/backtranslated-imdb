Ten years after the first film, James Belushi, one of the most talented and bright comedic actors in the past twenty years, returns as Detective Dooley for this film. If you expect more from the first movie, you will be disappointed, but this is still a good movie. Realizing that all dog battle scenarios against the man were probably exhausted in the first film, it turns into a slightly more psychological approach in its approach because it focuses on a killer who has a fixation with Dooley's wife recently deceased after who rejected his book, and blames Dooley for her death. The script may not be the best, but the film allows both Belushi and Christine Tucci to show their good ability to act, yet still retaining enough light to humor the first film to make it work, and the chemistry between the two the star is there for everyone to see. An easy-to-play movie that, while perhaps not worth buying if you're not a true fan of either the first movie or Belushi, deserves a watch when it comes to television
