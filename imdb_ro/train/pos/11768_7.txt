This movie surprised me in a good way. From the box I had the impression that it was a thriller of action, but it was too fun to be a thriller, even if it was somewhat interesting. There are plenty of beautiful things and fun travels. this film and James Belushi was born to make Bill Manucci, doing a wonderful job. The rest of the cast is not half bad, and Timothy Dalton is a treat. The story may become quite confusing sometimes when new characters appear during the movie. Things become more complicated, because no one really says the truth about things. If you do not pay attention, things could get a little messy in the end, but I really liked it. Louis Morneau is not everything that's well known, but he's done a perfectly perfect job with this and I've never been looking forward to watching the movie. Men made worth checking out.
