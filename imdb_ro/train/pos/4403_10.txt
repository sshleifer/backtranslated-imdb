Ride with the devil, as later Brokeback Mount Ang Lee, is a film of aesthetic and historical importance. Those who love the film should see it at least twice as its artistic nuances deserve to be understood. <br /> <br /> A perfect piece of art, the surprising depth of humanity. I really do not remember another war movie, it will surprise you, it will change your view of history and politics, you will restore your faith in humanity. After seeing so many crimes, so many sufferings, you do not feel numb, instead of appreciating the bond between human beings. Actor's performances haunt your heart, music drives your mind. Some shoots are not just pictures, they overcome themselves, becoming the sight of the soul. This is the true meaning of the film being a genre of art. A movie like this does not need long comments or opinions, everything he says himself. Ovation at the distribution including Tobey Maguire, Jeffrey Wright and Jewel Kilcher, the cinematographer and composer of beautiful and lyrical music, what accomplishment!
