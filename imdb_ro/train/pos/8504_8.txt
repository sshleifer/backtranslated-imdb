You play in the role of B.J. Blazkowicz, a soldier-type American soldier who is sent to discover the Nazi secret and turn the tide of the Second World War. That means everything from breaking a Nazi dungeon to counter Hitler's war machine and even Fuhrer itself. This is probably the most influential game of his time. That's because it literally inspired obsession. Many games existed at that time and even more today, but every so often you have a true grabber. This is one of them. Just like Tetris before him and, more recently, GTA III in 2002. Yes, Doom is better in almost all respects, but the pictures heard around the world that led to one of the biggest waves of the tides were fired by BJ Blazkowicz. Marine space, Duke Nukem, Max Payne, Serious Sam, John Mullins, JC Denton, Agent 47, Gordon Freeman and the legions of others owes the existence of ID boys. Either directly or in most cases indirectly but still do so. Even with its old look, very old graphics, very simple gameplay (this game is really a game, level) and very rectangular levels, the scope of all six episodes offers a lot of fun. Especially the discovery of these secrets with the treasures and chaingun in them also: "Stop!" * Bang! bang! bang! * "AARRRGH !!!" never ages. for "profound carnage." However, it is exceptionally tainted compared to today's games.
