Robin Williams does everything in his power to combine comedy and pathos, but it does not seem to be bad at all. Donald Moffat is too much like his father-in-law. Jeff Bridges is excellent, though the defender, and Holly Palance and Pamela Reed are great, carrying the film through most harsh spots. It's filling your time, but it's a little more than that.
