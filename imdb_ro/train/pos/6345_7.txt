The costumes and makeup were great, there were some extraordinarily funny lines, and the role was for Jim Carrey. Carrey did such a good job as it could be, given the rather disappointing writing of the script. Of course, it was mostly a children's movie, but if you spend this money to make a movie, you should at least give the story enough to go far beyond Dr. Seuss. I was expecting more from Ron Howard. It deserves a visit, but it does not have the qualities to become a major class by any measure.
