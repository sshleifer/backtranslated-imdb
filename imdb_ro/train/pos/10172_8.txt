The story of Friz Freleng is an excellent private cartoon Snafu, which warns against the spread of rumors causing panic during the war. It has been produced, like other Snafu shoes, the military audience as fun training films, "Rumors" are extremely imaginative and pile up short-lived tones of ideas. When Snafu starts a rumor about a bomb, he climbs into a rumor that America has lost the war. This is brilliantly illustrated by a long piece of rubber and some strange and fictional creatures who return to haunt Snafu with increasingly terrible news about his country's army. "Rumors" are inventive, fast and funny, all of which helps shade the message "do not be sorry". He stands up as one of Snafu's best shorts.
