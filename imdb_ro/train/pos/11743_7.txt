Although this was not without error, this drama was a good one to be presented around Easter. He reminded us of our spiritual self and showed that behind our facades we often hide the deepest sufferings and experiences. It was so much to enjoy in the drama, not least the teens who did a better musical accompaniment to the drama than the rather poor sound score in the background. The actress was excellent and Timothy Spall was gorgeous again. The climax was very satisfactory if it was quite simplistic. Timothy Spall "giving up" to the suicide of his long-dead husband was credible and reflected well the feelings of despair that were present in teenage self-harm. The resolution between the Graffiti and the Muslim boy was pleasant but less credible. A wonderful drama that left me and my husband to see that the evening was well spent. Congratulations!
