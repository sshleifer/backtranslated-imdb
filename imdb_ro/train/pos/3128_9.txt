Corny! I like! Corny - just like the television show 40 years ago! Adam and Burt reappear the same chemistry on the screen, which never seems to have left! They re-live old memories, plus the actors who sing them from the 1960s show some things behind the scenes things that are quite interesting to know. 1960's television has been an escape for many of us, and this DVD is no exception if you are familiar with the original TV show. Battle scene with Boys written and Bams or whatever is fantastic! The cinema scene shows clips of those who died. At the end, Frank Gorshin makes an appearance. He died not long after the DVD was made, so it is his duty to return again to play a villain to Adam and Burt, as he did with Batman and Robin many years ago. He did not lose touch! Thanks to Julie Newmar to regain a villainous role as well. In conclusion, I think this DVD is for wonderful memories and I would like to thank both Adam and Burt for these memories have returned and recreated for those of us who remember the original - !!! Thank you guys!!!
