EARTH is a necessity for children and adults. My son has a lot of fun looking at all these fun birds and the ice bears. We can learn a lot from this movie and we should be proud of our great treasure on earth. There are some animals in danger of disappearing. That is precisely the problem that should prevent all the authorities of our planet. <br /> <br /> This documentary offers many great pictures that I have not seen before. Then it is well accompanied by heavenly music. The director did a good job here, which has a great respect. Nothing can stop me and my family from giving EARTH the highest rate. I hope so much will create a sequel.
