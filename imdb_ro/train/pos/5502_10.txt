Whether this movie is propaganda or not (I strongly believe it is not), it really shows the power of Media. The importance of this documentary is not to show how good a Chavez man is. It is really to show how the Bolivarians saw how it happened, the way Chavez saw it. While it may seem wrong and biased to support a movie, I think the point of view in the film is entirely legitimate. The Venezuelan people, through the Venezuelan private media society, saw only a perspective from part of the coup, the neoliberal side. This film shows how Bolivarians have seen it. Call it propaganda, say it's a court call from you.
