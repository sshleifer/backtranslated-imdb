Like someone living near Buffalo, New York, this movie has scored points with me before I see it, since the story is based here. There are even some real-life news items at Buffalo ... and for once do not beat the area. Hallelujah! <br /> <br /> Teologia, puh-leeze !!! God is still made to look and think like humans ... and, of course, be a bit on the liberal side. Being a light comedy, there is nothing that should win prizes, but it's still fun and it's a nice way to kill 102 minutes. <br /> <br /> There are some laugh-out-hard comedy scenes and, hopefully, the audience - from Christians to atheists. - he has gotten something out of this, except for a few laughs, such as what really prayer should be. Kudos for writers for at least getting that correct theology and giving a good message. Generally, it's a good movie that should offend very little.
