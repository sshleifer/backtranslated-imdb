When I saw the DVD set up for it and the terrible rage of the Red Queen, I felt sure I was in great disappointment, but surprise, surprise, I liked it. Consequences convinced, of course, and unforgiven that such a complicated debate should rush to the point where the subtitles can hardly be read, not to mention the ridiculous explanation. However, this is a dream. Fabulous women in fabulous costumes in wonderful settings and everything constantly on the move and accompanied by a wonderful Bruno Nicolai score. It can not be Morricone, but in these lighter pieces it could be just as well. Very pleasant, with plenty of color, lots of sex, some dirty kills, and minimal police interference. Super.
