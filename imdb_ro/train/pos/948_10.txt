This is simply one of the best interpretations of Dicken's classic story. The script closely follows Dickens' original story and captures a perfect balance between the film's atmosphere and the playing atmosphere. The founding visitors of each format will find enough stories rooted in the chosen presentation style. George C. Scott brings a delightful, realistic approach to Scrooge's character and is very convincing in developing the character instigated by phantom visits. I have found that she managed to win me to the point where I sympathized with the old miser, which is rarely done in other versions. The superb work done by supporting actors adds a lot to this production, which is simply the most enjoyable of all the Christmas versions I've seen.
