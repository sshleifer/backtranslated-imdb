This movie should be required to view all librarians or librarians. All the best lines are directly related to librarianship. Public Library vs. the argument of the academic library is a classic argument between librarians and students of the library. It also breaks many library stereotypes. Librarians may even be able to have fun - even if they do not * usually * sex in the romantic language section! (The best movie about the Desk Setter with Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, of course.)
