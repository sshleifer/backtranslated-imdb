I caught the last half of this movie on a cable one night and was hit by the morbidity she was. Even when one of the two victims is the most damaged, the camera continues to work. the long-lasting images of his body being discovered and his concentration figure in the camp being crowned in a body pouch, both moving and depressing. do not watch this movie if you already depressed. then again do not watch him if your feeling is very good.
