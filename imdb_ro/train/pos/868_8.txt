What is very French about this movie is the time it takes to establish the two main characters. This may require a bit of patience, especially since none is "attractive" in the typical Hollywood definition. However, once the blow "hits", the movie moves fast, maybe sometimes too fast. But it is a real rollercoaster ride and if it does not look too careful, it is quite credible. The type of movie you know Hollywood would hurt her.
