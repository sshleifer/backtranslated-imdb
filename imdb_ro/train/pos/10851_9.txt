I found "still crazy" to be wonderful for fun and not just for those of us who lived in this 1950s eruption, the early 1970s. My 15 year old daughter follows me every time I get the DVD (do not worry, it's only three times) and she loves her too. He is a true lover, the funny exhortation of the epoch, and every actor hits his notes with perfection. It was my first introduction to Bill Nighy and I'm glad that his similar tower in the movie "Love Actually" brought him more attention. Bruce Robinson was incredible as Brian, bringing real life to what might have been a caricature of the rocket stereotype damaged by drugs. It was interesting to see that Robinson made a big name as a writer. I live in Sherman Oaks, California, and after the first time I saw the movie I shot in Billy Connolly at the local mall (he lived here at that time) and told him it was one of five favorite films of all time. He invited me to sit at the table with him and talked about the movie for some time. I even talked about the idea of ​​an American-oriented remake before rejecting it wisely. Why misery with the original? My only problem with "still crazy" is that it was not very popular in theaters and too many people missed a wonderful experience.
