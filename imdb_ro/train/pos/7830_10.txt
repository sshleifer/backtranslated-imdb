In Die Nibelungen: Siegfried, Siegfried was betrayed. Now, Kriemhild is seeking revenge. She marries Hagen and, through a series of events, she finally engages in a very drastic (but right) action at the end. One of the things about watching this movie nowadays is that we can look at some portraits. Attila Hun (named Etzel in the film) is portrayed as a strange person in the East, possibly an allusion to the Soviet Union. Obviously, it was not Fritz Lang's fault that Hitler used "The Nibelungenlied" for German national pride in the Third Reich, but one can see what Fuhrer liked about the story. However, this is an absolutely formidable movie.
