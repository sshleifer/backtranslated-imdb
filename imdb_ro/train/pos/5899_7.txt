The nice idea ... salesgirl Linda Smith (Yolande Donlan) inherits a small small county in Lampidorra. That country, not even in North America, became the 49th state ... (of course, there were only 48 states at that time, because it was made in 1952 ...) Linda travels to the country that is inherited, and we are following it over time while trying to figure out what to do with this strange country and its even stranger people. At one point, she sings a song she pretends to be from her Navajo people and is becoming more and more compelling from there ... though Yolande Donlan's heavy lipstick and the omni-present smile never gets confused. There are other songs scattered through the exit, as citizens sing to meet their new princess. Recorded in a glorious British technicolor version or equivalent, the only big name here is Dirk Bogarde British subject Tony Craig, the cheesemaker. Bogarde made a big hit in the UK film industry after serving in the war, and was even led by QE II. Craig and the "new princess" get stuck with each other, and their adventures become more intertwined as Lampidorra's financial problems get worse ... No less fun ... alongside the Marx Brothers. Also note that Donlan later married Val Guest, the writer and director of our little project, and married for 50 years! The visitor was better known for writing and directing SF filming, both in the UK and the United States.
