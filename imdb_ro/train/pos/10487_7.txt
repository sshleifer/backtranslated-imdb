Saving Grace is a good movie, with his heart in the right place. Grace is a widow recently and realizes that her late husband left her with a lot of debt. She could lose her beautiful house and find no other solution for her misery than start growing marijuana. She lives in a beautiful village where most viewers would like to live, and the villagers are all wonderful people that most viewers would like to have as neighbors. There is one thing wrong with this image, and this is how it portrays the effect that marijuana has on the user. It is obvious that none of the actors or writers of this film ever smoked things. The way villagers act after smoking a joint is ridiculous and supposed to be funny. It is precisely in those scenes that the spirit is replaced by an English slapstick, and that is a sin in a movie that is still very pleasant.
