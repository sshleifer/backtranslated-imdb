This light-hearted comedy should enjoy value for entertainment. It becomes funny sometimes, but if you have not spent the moment on the "side" of the songs, you will lose the comedy when it bursts. are quite credible in their roles. Grace's way of meeting his dead husband's girlfriend was well-played. She's a real lady. And, my favorite is Grace's white white suit that he wears. I strongly recommend this blow to anyone who wants to laugh out loud, applauding for a psychiatrist or just wanting to look something different.
