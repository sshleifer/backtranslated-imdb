He saw this movie at the Vancouver Film Festival and thought he was intelligent, stylish and funny. The distribution was ROCK SOLID. A great work by Carrie Anne Moss, Dylan Baker, Tim Blake Nelson, Billy Connelly and Alexia Fast. <br /> <br /> Strangely, I woke up thinking about the movie a few days after I saw it. > <br /> The writers, Dennis Heaton, Robert Chomiak and Andrew Currie have stratified into many political subtexts, but they did not bother you. <br /> <br /> The world they created is deep, and it made sense. There is a giddy carnivorous spirit for this movie. <br /> <br /> FIDO is guaranteed to cure horror. <br /> <br /> He was loved!
