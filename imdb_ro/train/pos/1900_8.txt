Over time, Dudley Moore played the most famous role of his short career since 1981, ARTHUR, a funny and alternating story that produces hot smiles, big laughter and occasional tears if you have the right mood . Moore was nominated for Best Actress Oscar for the role of Arthur Bach, a drunken playboy who "races cars, plays tennis, trains women but has weekends and is his boss." Arthur is destined to inherit 750 million dollars when he marries a girl named Susan Johnston (Jill Eikenberry), who is the wounded daughter of an undercover gangster. Things get sticky when Arthur meets Linda Morolla (Liza Minnelli) a Queens wrestler actress who steals her father's birthday. Moore lights up the screen in one of the funniest shows in the last 50 years. The last Sir John Gielgud won Oscar Best Supporting Actor for his roleless role in the role of Butler, Arthur's best friend, Hobson, whose contempt for Arthur's behavior covers more paternal feelings. There are other funny contributions to Barney Martin as Linda's father. Stephen Elliott as Susan's father and Geraldine Fitzgerald as Arthur's dementia grandmother. The movie was directed with a charming eye for comedy by a director for the first time named Steve Gordon, who, sadly, died the following year. There was also a forgetful sequel a few years later, but this instant classic is not to be missed.
