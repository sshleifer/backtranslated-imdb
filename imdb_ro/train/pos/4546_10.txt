This film will descend into history as one of the best, right next to Citizen Kane, Casablanca and On The Waterfront. Someone please convince Leno to do a follow-up! Leno and Morita are comedy duo, of which they have not been seen by Abbott and Costello. The evil that emanates from Chris Sarandon, Tom Noonan and Randall "Tex" Cobb will give you chills. Dingman's character, like joyful spots, returns to the days of Shakespeare's comedies. And the climax. Kindness, climax. I'm not going to destroy it for you, but it makes the Death Star's explosion pale in comparison. If you can track this hard-to-find gem, make your family a favor and buy right away. I still have hope for a special DVD edition one of these days.
