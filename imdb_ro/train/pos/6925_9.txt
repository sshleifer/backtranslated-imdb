Lin McAdam (James Stewart) wins a rifle, a Winchester in a shooting contest. Dutchman Henry Brown (Stephen McNally) is a bad loser and steals the gun. Lin gets his horse and goes after the Dutchman and his men and rifle with his friend High Spade (Millard Mitchell). The gun reaches different hands on the road. Will he return to the right owner? Anthony Mann and James Stewart worked together for the first time and came with this masterpiece, Winchester '73 (1950). Stewart is the right man to play the lead role. It was always the right man to do anything. Terrible Shelley Winters plays part of Lola Manners and she's wonderful as always. Dan Duryea is awesome from Waco Johnnie Dean. Charles Drake is brilliant as Lola's lover Steve Miller.Also Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson are seen in the movie and are played by Will Geer and Steve Darrell. Young Rock Hudson plays Young Bull and young Anthony (Tony) Curtis plays Doan. There are many classic moments in this movie. At one point, the group is surrounded by the Indians because it is a Western. It's great to watch this survival game where the fastest drawer and the clearest shooter is the winner. All true Western fans will enjoy this movie.
