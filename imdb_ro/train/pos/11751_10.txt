Kurt Russell is the best man in his life as a past glory, Reno Hightower. Robin Williams is his polar opposite in a very low performance, like Jack Dundee. He gave up Big Pass in more ways than one. You will see some of the most cherished scenes ever taken in a single movie, as Jack sang in a rat, Reno poses and the caribou call comes out. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this classic that is not afraid to show football in the mud as it should be played.
