You have never seen this movie and you consider it an extraordinary classic with veteran actors. By the time this film was made, people in America were different, there was no television or all the modern stuff we have today, except for the radio and the start of some great Hollywood movies. The loving innocent evidence of a young girl of love between a young girl or a young man has been viewed differently than he is today. Ann Shirley, "Murder My Sweet," played a young young orphan who was called "Carrot Top" because of her red hair and was found in a house of two elderly people who were like two wise owls watching on Ann Shirley. It was a small town, and everyone knew everyone, and if anything happened, the whole city learned about it in a few minutes. It's a movie on earth, with cute people trying to help each other in a very simple way to live. Today it seems to be a corn and stupid ball, but believe me, so were the people in America in the 1920s. "& 30 and they were a wonderful generation who loved good family movies.
