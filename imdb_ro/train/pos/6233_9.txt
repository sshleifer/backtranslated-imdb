From a musical point of view, Irving Berlin gave Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers another plush music after Top Hat, if that was possible. Although in this case, such as making Jerome Kern Roberta, the Fleet Tracking kept Randolph Scott with another singer, this time Harriet Hilliard. Randolph Scott is a Navy CPO career and Fred Astaire is an ex-vaudevillian who enlisted in Marina to forget his former partner on Ginger Rogers. But now the two are on vacation. Fred and Ginger deal exactly where they left, and Randy meets the encounter with Ginger's sister, Harriet, who blooms in real beauty. But Randy is a typical love and leaves the sailor. <br /> <br /> Again, Irving Berlin wrote a full hit score with him closely watching the production. Ginger comes to make some special voices with "Let Yourself Go" that she and Fred later dance with. But the real blow to the show is to face the music and dance, which is a number made at a Navy show. Sung first by Astaire and later danced by the pair, Let's Face Music and Dance is one of the great romantic numbers ever written for the screen. Their dance on this is absolute magic. I'm sure when I mention Harriet Hilliard, some younger people might ask who he was. But they'll know right away when I mention her with her famous husband, Ozzie Nelson. That's Ozzie and Harriet. It's a mystery to me why Harriet did not sing when he became David and Ricky's mom on TV. Then again he did not keep his own name. <br /> <br /> Neither Ozzie nor Harriet sang on television. Ozzie was a pale imitation of Rudy Vallee as a singer, but Harriet could have a song. She sings behind me Satan and Moon and I'm here, but where are you, both real and classy. We recommend that you see Follow the Fleet if for no other reason than to hear the size of Harriet Hilliard forgotten today incredibly.
