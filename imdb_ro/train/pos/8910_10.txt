Most of the monster films of the atomic age, which I saw on TV as a child - and some of them, including the BLOB, have scared the light of day. Movies like MARS Invaders have made it too clear for us "little fry" that children would not trust when they came to things like things that invade the National World; The BLOB just reiterated this. I remember, with pleasure, the late evenings stretching out on the floor, watching, while the Snatchers of the Corps and the Invaders and the Martians of Bloch gathered in a society without any idea. It was a summer in the early 1980s when a local scientific museum (in Richmond, Virginia) wore a classical atomic age every weekend. These were 16 mm films, and most were black and white (and the projector was noisy), and the BLOB's "color" prints to a faint pink - but the man was fun. I dragged my mother and liked it as much as I did. He was there, at that science museum, that I really fell in love with BLOB. The intention of the film was, of course, to earn money - but the sincerity of all those involved, from filmmakers to "talent" (the players) made me fall in love with this film. Corny? You bet. Cheesy? They do not get any cheesemakers. But, man, what movie!
