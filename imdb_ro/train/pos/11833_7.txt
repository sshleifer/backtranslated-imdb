White Man + progress + industrialization = BAD. The first nations + nature + animals = GOOD. Simple formula. In fact, in the past days, the same type of propaganda has been used to defend the status quo; now it is used to attack it. However, being said, I think the film succeeds in overcoming the unpleasant politicization, because it plays the themes of original liberty and nature in a way that attracts everyone. You may not be alongside the revisionism of the movie about how the West was lost, lost. But anyone can feel a sense of desire for the days when the horses could circulate freely on the Western plains. (The movie also conveniently stops the fact that there were no horses in America before the evil white man brought them there). Anyway, I liked it. The quality of the animation - especially the opening photo - is incredible.
