In Micro Phonies, the stooges are there best. In this short trio are the mannequins working in a recording studio. They come to look at Alice Van Doren (Christine Mcintyre) singing the voice of spring. The voice is amazing. Curly in the drags is heard by Mrs. Bixby (Symona Boniface). Moe calls Curly Senior Cucaracha. The three stoogi go to a party where Curly will dress in dear. They play a record of the spring voice and it all works well until Moe destroys the recording on Curly's head. They come to use lucia sexlet until the baritone recognizes and disconnects it. Alice Van Doren catches the boy screaming and hiding behind a curtain to help them. Everything is fine until the baritone wonders how Curly sings without the help of a phonograph discovers Alice behind the curtain. The three knights are found to be scams, but Alice's father discovers her daughter's talent and agrees that she should become a singer. Strings are taken out of the room. Excellent.
