Citizen X tells the story of the real life of searching for a serial killer named "The Rostov Ripper" This wonderful movie shows the long journey he took to try and hold a murderer. The film shows how politics could have helped the killer continue his kidnapping for over 12 years. (Probably, over 50 victims, especially women and children) Stephen Rea's performance as principal detective and Donald Sutherland as a general inquiry were superb. Jeffrey DeMunn as Ripper Andrei Romanovich Chikatilo. This is the type of movie that will fascinate you and will immediately put you on the Internet to investigate the real case. This movie should not be missed. He debuted on HBO and never gave me a theatrical communication. Great movie
