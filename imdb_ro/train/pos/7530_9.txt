This is to say a sequel to the animated batman and it's pretty much as good as for all the same reasons that has a lot of action in it the story to is well the voice on the actors are very good, Kevin Conroy as Batman, Mark Hamil as Joker, etc. Bastards are very good, like The Joker, Two-Face, Catwoman, Clayface, etc. So I'm sure you will not be disappointed with Batman's new adventures, because he's really good. So make sure you watch it on TV or rent or buy the collection because it's really good. Overall rating: ********* from ****** **** <br /> <br /> **** from *****
