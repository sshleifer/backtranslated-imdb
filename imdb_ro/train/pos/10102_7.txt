I have to say that it's been a long time since I saw him, but I've seen him five times or several times; a wonderful wonderful story clearly inspired by the musical / comedic mating of new or blushing stars with musical groups of prominence. Kay Kyser's story would be a good example. With Spike Jones unleashed is the best part of the show, as he and his band play many songs and are part of the action, they do a good job of sustaining. Hugh O'Brien plays the face, Buddy Hackett, the rumor that was given to Lou Costello and thus Abbott and Costello are replacing the leadership. I do not know if it's true. Generally, a nice movie, but it's important to have so much Spike Jones and his band on the film for history. They want to be released, as I have not seen or heard about it two decades ago. Hope it is not lost
