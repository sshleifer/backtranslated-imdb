It's Mitzi. I loved it in this. And did not it look fantastic ?! I like these afternoon popcorn movies of life. This is like one of those nailbiters where it always comes into commercials in the most annoying moments. The character Richard was completely creepy. I gave the boys that way. Well, not like lol. I wish Zack was not killed. He was a box and very light on his eyes. I love these stalker stories. It always makes me stand up and make sure my doors are locked. My husband usually does not like these types of movies, but in fact he stood in the whole thing with me and actually enjoyed it. I can not wait to see what Mitzi does!
