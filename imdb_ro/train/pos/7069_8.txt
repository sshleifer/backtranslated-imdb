It was said that Deanna Durbin invented adolescence. This first movie was one of the best. The humorous story presented Deanna, enchanting for 14 years, a little beauty with a gorgeous voice like "Miss Fixit" in a family separated by divorce. For a summary of the scenario, you see other IMDb entries, but quickly Deanna and her two older sisters intend to go to America from Switzerland to prevent their father from remarrying. With an excellent support distribution, especially Barbara Read and Nan Gray as sisters, good direction and editing, the movie captures even the next view. Of the three songs of Deanna, only "Il Bacio" is from the classic repertoire, but when singing it in the police scene, the place of the film in history is assured. At least it was for this spectator who at the age of 15 was killed for life with both Deanna and classical music. One of the beautiful looks that take place in the entire THREE SMART GIRLS is the short vision of the drunk who stretches his throat for a final look at Deanna as the cops have stirred him! An unfortunate result of the success of this film was that the subsequent writers for the Durbin vehicles were stuck in the Miss Fixit theme, which quickly became obsolete. Deanna herself never did. Her status as an actress is more dubious than her charisma, which she surely had. It seems to me that, like other film personalities, she has replaced the "naturalness" with the histrionic ability she lacked. The play worked well for 21 feature films.
