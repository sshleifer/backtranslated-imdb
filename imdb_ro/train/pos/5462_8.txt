First of all, if you're going to watch this, make sure you watch the UNCUT version (although it's very interesting to come back and watch the scenes that have been modified because of censorship), that makes a gross difference. This film is about a young woman, played by Barbara Stanwyck, who, from the age of 14, was forced to prostitute her own father. When her father suddenly passes, she can come out alone in the world. After reading about Nietzsche's philosophies about life, he uses his sexuality to manipulate people to give what they want and leave them in ruins and desperate for her love. Throughout the film, it becomes increasingly materialistic and manipulative, and the audience begins to wonder if it has any sense of morality. Generally, Baby Face is a very shocking film with clear sex scenes that most people would not expect to see in a black and white film. While no sexual act is displayed explicitly on the screen, it is very obvious what happens outside the room. I liked to see this movie very much and I think most of the modern audiences will get at least a joy if, especially with the value of the film's shock. I thought while watching the pacing seemed a little sluggish, but I think about most of the movies you first see. Actually, I think almost all the movies I've seen made since the early 1930s had some minor pacing problems or some parts did not "flow" correctly. This was probably just the film making profession has not been perfected yet? it would take only a few years. Compare a 1939 movie and compare it to a movie from the early 30's and I think you'll see what I mean. Again, I am very glad that I was able to pursue the original cutting; Indeed, it makes a big difference. Also, any John Wayne fans will be surprised to see him in this movie before being renowned for an unusual role.
