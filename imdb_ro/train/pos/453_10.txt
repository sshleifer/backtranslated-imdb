I always tell people that "Enchanted April" is an adult film, with no emotion, no sex and no violence. We might think it's "the best chicken shot," but I bet there is one or two bright people there who love them too. Do not invite children, though. This movie is very low. Watching "Enchanted April" is a very healing experience. The beautiful piece of sound and landscapes, together with the ladies' soft manners, remind you of the tranquility and beauty of a pre-raffled painting. For no one to think that you are really looking at just a kind of movie, I will paraphrase a line that I once heard "Saturday Night Live" and say that the two favorite films are "The Deer Hunter" and " Enchanted April ".
