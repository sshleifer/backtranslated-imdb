If you did not enjoy this movie, be dead or hate Adam Sandler or Don Cheadle. An excellent distribution, all of which have done good. This film has proven that Adam Sandler is a good actor, despite what critics say. Adam Sandler becomes a respected actor. It all started with the Big Daddy show, then he made some bad movies, then went through wonderful shows in 50 First Dates, The Longest Yard, then Click, and now he's over. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie. Adam Sandler plays a man who has lost everything. The closest thing to his family is the mother-in-law and the father-in-law. After his old college colleague (Cheadle) has entered, he seems to change his life. I will not say, because I do not want to destroy the movie, but I recommend this movie. One of the best movies in 2007.
