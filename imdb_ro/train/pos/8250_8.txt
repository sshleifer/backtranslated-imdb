This film takes place in the 1950s. To this end, the dead (called zombies) appeared to eat the living. However, a company has developed a collar that, when putting the zombies around the neck, makes them docile and perfect servants. Robinsons mother Helen (Carrie-Anne Moss), father Bill (Dylan Baker) and son Timmy (K'Sun Ray) hire a zombie because everyone in their block already has one. Tim calls Zombie Fido (Billy Connolly) and becomes a friend with him. But his father hates him and Timmy loses control of Fido and things go wrong. As you can see this is - among many others - a take off on the "Lassie" series with Fido staying at Lassie. Timmy was named for a reason! Each of Lassie's famous episodes is rotating here. My favorite is when Timmy sends Fido off to get help before the zombies eat it! It is also a satire of the 1950s Douglas Sirk, in which everything is luminous and colorful - but dark secrets destroy people. The characters wear very bright clothing from the 1950s (Moss is always in a dress) - the furniture, settings and cars are especially all 1950s in hyper-bright colors. Even when the script becomes repetitive, it's always something to look at. The script is good - but there are just so many Lassie jokes you can do. Melodramatic is a kind of silly, but the cast pulls it. Everyone here is excellent and even on the target. Even Connolly as a zombie without emotion does a good job. Moss is the best - playing every line for all that's worth - but never cross the board. This is not for everyone (of course). Sahara can be lost to most people, and the gore is pretty tainted. Gore is so casual and with happy music playing over it is hard to take it seriously. So, for some people, this will really work. I give her 8.
