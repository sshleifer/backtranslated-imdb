I did not expect too much for this movie, but it was very pleasantly surprised because it is easy and fun and very well observed. The central trio of motorcyclists was surprisingly joyful as they dropped and clung the way through their drug-directed travel to Wales. The humor was gentle and subtle, just like the three characters (they are witnessing their sympathetic treatment of the little old shop owner). The countryside atmosphere of Wales was captured perfectly, and the soundtrack was very well chosen. With intelligent and careful scriptures, with great attention to detail - I have never seen such a realistic representation of alternative culture - I felt I was with them. Very light in touch and full of fun - not what you can expect from a movie about bikers and drugs. A delight on all fronts and difficult to criticize, though I thought the last two scenes were a bit lame - the film should have ended when they left Wales. But, in general, an unexpected treasure of a movie.
