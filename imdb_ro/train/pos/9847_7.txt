He had fun watching this movie .. despite the feeling I had a lot of time, that this movie was close to copying Monsters Inc. There are quite a few things that are extremely similar between the two, the relationship between an animal / monster and a small child, other animals trying to break this relationship, etc. He's been feeling pretty along the movie for me. One of the redeeming features is Scratch :) Very funny even if he has no purpose :)
