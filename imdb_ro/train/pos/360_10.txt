11 Oscar nominations and zero win! I still understand why - not that the actors in the movie did it better afterwards that you can do them through banal role awards like Halle Berry and Denzel Washington - Whoopi, Oprah, Margaret Avery and Danny Glover etc - were amazing - I'm curious to receive scripts from the Oscar talks that year ...... should go to the Shoulda-woulda-cana for judges .... It's an amazing book - but it's true of Alice Walker's writing style, it has a way to bet that it exaggerates its characters - so I'm very glad that the screen adaptation has done a few things. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was amazing - African scenes live long to be desired - the African side of the book should be put in Liberia - somewhere in West Africa - BUT oh no! Steven Spielberg thinks the world is so bad to think of Africa outside Safari - so yes there must be a Zebra scene and wildlife when we all know that there is no Western Africa ---- and above all of which people speak Swahili --- who speaks Swahili in West Africa? I just had to get rid of this ... ... but like a story - amazing, the movie - from this world - CLASSIC give it !! <br /> <br /> I hold it and look at it when my soul needs a rejuvenation.
