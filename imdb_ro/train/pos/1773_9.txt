Barriers appear to be one of those series that have been lost in the mist of time. Once it was transmitted in the early 1980s and repeated it, it has since been sinking without marks. This is a shame grievance. I first looked at this when it was broadcast in the Southern television region on Sunday afternoon and was classically visualized in tea. Although I do not remember much about the program, there are a few things left in my mind. The most notable were the unforgettable titles. Fluent music accompanied by an attempt to escape along an eastern European border and the next car crash (and that scene left me an ascending love of "fintail" models from Mercedes using a Merc 200). Although it was not clear at first, the solution to the mystery of the series was in these titles. The plot about a young musician trying to discover what really happened when he discovered he was adopted had a lot of overturning and transformation, but Barriers was a surprisingly "adult" drama of children. Benedict Taylor was excellent as Billy and it was a shame that he did not do much more. It was a quality drama long awaited for launching the DVD and I hope I will have the chance to re-know me in the future. <br /> <br /> A beautiful memory from childhood
