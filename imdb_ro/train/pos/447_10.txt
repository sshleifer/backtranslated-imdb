This is one of the best movies. It's one of my favorites. A good action movie. The story is very sensitive and moving. It also works well on the camera. The names of actresses and actors are not at the top of the US star list. However, they offer equal or better performances than the top of the list. It's such a pleasure to see a movie about love, love, true friendship, without having to endure forgetting someone who has to hit their way of saving the world. <br /> <br /> If you do not like this movie then you have no heart or feelings. Then watch a sports movie. There is no killing or horror here. See the movie. It's obligatory. TH
