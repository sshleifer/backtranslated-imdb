I've always imagined this movie on the video cover. Eventually he got to buy it for a fiver in a sale and boy what film. An absolutely amazing performance of all cases and is so beautiful. Even sometimes at a distance, so you can barely hear what the dialogue is, as if you were really distracted to take some of the story. It's really moving, often funny and very traceable. Not much dialogue, but it's filmed so that you feel so much. A 9/10 from me. I need to see.
