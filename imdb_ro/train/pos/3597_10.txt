(spoilers) <br /> <br /> I was blown away from this movie. I was rented on movielink for a bit, and decided to check out this movie out. Many boxing movies seem to overload the blood. In this film, it shows him at the level of amateur. Although I want more attention to be brought to improve her note. The film highlights the problems faced by some families with sex. I was a little worried about the end. But the end was not a disappointment. I think it was pretty clear by the title he will win. What was unexpected was that the two returned together as well as the final. He liked the score for some of the scenes. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span>
