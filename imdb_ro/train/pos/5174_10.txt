I swear I can watch this movie every weekend of my life and I can not get sick of it! Every aspect of human emotion is captured so magically by the act, script, direction and overall feeling of this film. It's been a long time since I saw a movie that made me suffocate for laughter, reflect from sadness and feel every intentional feeling that comes in this excellent work! We need more movies like this !!! Mike Binder: Are you listening?
