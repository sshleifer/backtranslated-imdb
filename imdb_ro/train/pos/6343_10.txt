Leave me on stage. It is school holidays and there is absolutely nothing to the movies. I am with my friend who decides what to see. We are looking for a movie that will soon begin and "The Grinch" comes. We buy tickets without knowing what to expect. What I received was a roller-coaster of fun. Jim Carrey (who can add is my first actor from all over the world) was absolutely magnificent like Grinch in Ron Howard's best movie (next to Apollo 13). The way that this film was made, the landscape, the actors, the props and the music was amazing. He really brought this childhood movie. The story is based on the story of the beam. As we all know, Grinch is a horrible person who can not stay at Christmas. He lives much over Whoville and has never mixed up well with the people in the city. But a little girl will change the look of Grinch on life and on others in a drastic way. Cindy Lou Cine (played by the adorable new actress Taylor Momsem) meets Grinch how he finds his good side right away. She's trying to break the barrier and help Grinch move and mess with the people in town. Everything up to this movie is a laugh for the whole family, both children and parents. A SOLID 10/10. Jim okay. <br /> <br />
