This is the hands down the biggest show ever stand up. I've seen a lot of shows, I've been to a lot of stand-up shows and I'm looking at Bet's Comic View, but I have not seen anybody matching Murphy's talent on this show. The impressions are excellent, the skits are wonderful, and the calendar is perfect. You can even say that the crowd really gets. When he did Raw a few years later, he was also very good, but this is # 1 in my book. He also shows that at some point, especially at the beginning of the 1980s and the mid-1980s, Murphy was funny. My favorite parts of the show are when they recite the family's grill and "Ice Cream! Mooommmm! The ice cream man comes!" Another big part is where his mother is like Clint Eastwood.
