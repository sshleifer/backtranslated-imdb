I've probably seen this movie first around 1995. Since then I've been back to it several times. It's great! I especially like the first and second clips, Creation and Growth of Civilization. Wow! It was so cold in the glory days of CG animation. CG is much older than me because I know the movie "Tron" was done 7 years before my time. But this film was a landmark in the early 1990s. It was probably the first collaboration of various CG-based experiments for music. I like so much, I think I'll look right now. Bye
