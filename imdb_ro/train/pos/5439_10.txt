Obviously, a movie that had a great influence not only on the friend's genre, but also on the genre of action. George Lucas had to be a fan of this film because so much of the Star Wars series seems to be a tribute to Gunga Din. The characters that Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks play are just precursors to Han Solo, Luke Skywalker and Chewbacca. Even Gunga From Sam Jaffe turned into C-3PO and R2-D2 and likes it or not: Jar Jar Binks. Today this film is regarded as non-PC, but there is a speech by Eduardo Ciannelli as the Guru leader of the Indian opposition to the British rays, which could be resumed in many feelings today. <br /> <br /> For a boy, this was a great movie. Three strong male leadership and just a clue of love. There was a time when young boys considered kissing the girl, in the Saturday morning movie it was just a meal. Not like today, when more skin is met with delight. Too late to cry losing innocence. We hope this movie will not be forgotten, and some who navigate the channel will stop at TCM and will capture a movie with action, adventure and a cast of thousands instead of CGI actors.
