From time to time, a filmmaker brings to life a unique group of people and lets you see yourself inside to see things that make us human. Lawrence Kasden did it again. I have always felt that Big Cill was the hymn of his age and managed to do it again in the Grand Canyon. Whenever we often find ourselves in a moment when we have the choice of life and often we blow it. This is a film about people who find the courage to choose and live their lives because of this choice. The juxtaposition of small and large events, which allows us to see how many trivial things are actually worrying, is truly a genius. I have watched this movie several times and are constantly surprised at how deep the emotions have gone through this movie. Danny Glover and Kevin Kline play their roles with great mood, and the portrait of Stever Martins of a filmmaker is useless. Thanks again to Mr. Kasden
