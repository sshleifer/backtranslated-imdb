Three horror stories based on the members of a Hindu transgressional worship who return home, but they change somewhat. In the first story, our ex-cult member is now in a crazy asylum and is visited by a reporter who wants to find out what happened to the cult. Somehow slowly goes as the story is told in flashbacks while the two are sitting and facing each other. The reporter is particularly interested in what leads to the death of the participants. What seemed boring, suddenly, becomes very interesting, with a surprising story in the story. Things get pretty bloody. The second story has a young violent criminal visiting a psychiatrist for compulsory therapy. The patient seems to have a certain type of agenda, but the psychiatrist is in front of this task. Again, things slow down a little and become strange. Then there is a weird story in the story, which is very well written and surprising. The final story deals with the spiritual healer who pretends to be able to remove the diseases from them with his hands. One of the patients is a former member of the cult, so healing successfully becomes more complicated. Again, we are surprised by a turn. It has a pretty violent scene there. There is female frontal nudity as well as male frontal nudity for some reason. I discovered that the story is very well written, and the director manages to install every story with surprising surprise and goral consequences. Note: Review of the German DVD.
