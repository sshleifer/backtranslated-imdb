A critical and financial flop at the first release, critics have returned and said this film is the best of the director. Ronde's movie adventure is growing fast as boys from a detective agency (Ben Gazzara, John Ritter and Blaine Novak) continue to fall and go out of love with some of the strangest and most beautiful women on the film (Audrey Hepburn, Coleen Camp, Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hansen). Much of the script was ad-libd or re-written on the filming day, which gives the movie a beating sensation. Ben Gazzara is excellent as the head detective, convincing Audrey Hepburn after giving up Colleen Camp singer and saw Patti Hansen cab driver on the side. John Ritter watches Dorothy Stratten and falls in love with her. Blaine Novak has some girls he's following (including Joyce Hyser and Elizabeth Pena). This movie has some extraordinary performances by an extra bowl. Standouts are Audrey Hepburn (she does not have a line in the first half of the movie). Ben Gazzara has never been better (and an inspiring choice for a romantic lead), and Colleen Camp has one of the best roles in the role of maniac singer Christy Miller. It's a pleasure to watch when she isolates her lines in a rat-tat-tat delivery. Highly recommended! ******** stars!
