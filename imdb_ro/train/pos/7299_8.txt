Slightly slogan, terrible scenario full of holes, hot blonde is eaten alive, evil scientist has a serious mustache, a man takes a trained gunman platoon, and he conquers, terrible special effects, solves the problem by blowing his head off the monster. .. Awesome. The only thing missing was an unnecessary sexual scene during a crime. Haha. Fun fun full of predictable twists and laughter. I really enjoyed this movie, but before you watch it, make sure you're laughing. I recommend this movie to people who can watch a movie and do not take it so seriously. I can not, in my mind, believe that this movie was made for people to take it seriously. However, if you can watch it and you can relax and enjoy yourself, I really think you can enjoy this movie as it was intended to enjoy. Very simple. So take some popcorn and some beers and make a night of fun with some friends and this movie. It brought joy into my life.
