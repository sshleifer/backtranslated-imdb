This has to be one of the best movies to come in HK for a long time, I was looking forward to taking my hands on this film just on the title. The silent actors were fantastic in this show and I was particularly impressed by Sam Lee's crazy behavior, unthinkable, and Edison's portrayal of a killer machine that has normally reversed the image of an idol. I would certainly recommend those who are looking for an elegant and actionable movie. However, I must warn you, this is also an equally depressing film, because every character in the movie is somehow dead end and trouble theirs, and struggles to breathe. Makes you think of what real life is.
