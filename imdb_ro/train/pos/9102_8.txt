I saw this film at the 18th Haifa Film Festival and it's one of the best I've seen this year. Seeing it on a large screen (and I refer to BIG, not one of those TV screens most of the cinemas have), with an excellent sound system, it always enhances cinematic experience, the film takes the eyes and ears and sucks on the story. image. <br /> <br /> The film presents a set of characters that are poorly interconnected. Their stories traverse some points, and the multitude of story lines reminded me of the great Robert Altman and his extraordinary films. But the real hero of the film is, of course, the city of Madrid, which offers the background of the whole film. It hosts the characters, contains the sidewalks and the roads that go, and sets the background atmosphere for all the events, all in beautifully filmed scenes. The film returns again and again to certain themes (shoes, for example) and, in essence, Salazar makes his metaphors more and more readable to the spectator as the film progresses. It combines city views with character images and fits neatly with the feeling of the scene in the background. A set of talented actors helps them portray a wide variety of characters. An excellent example is the scene where Juaquin takes Anita on the street for the first time. It might not work on a small screen, but it gave me holes on a big screen. The message of the movie is very positive and, consequently, the movie is easy and fun sometimes. The music along the movie is usually pop with some instrumental pieces (I hope to get my hands on the soundtrack one day, though I seriously doubt it will do it). We all came out of this movie with a sensational feeling, and I'm not easily impressed (you'll have to take my word for it). For this and more I give this film a 8/10 solid.
