I am not at all concerned with horror films and I am willing to see almost any of them. That does not mean I'm willing to re-see many of them or that I will not have critics for them. This movie is creepy and is very well done. In fact, I think this movie would make a great double note with Session 9. I should say before I get to my comments that I looked myself. I started watching her before I went to bed and it was about 15 minutes before I realized it was too efficient, so I saved the rest of the morning. Even as she watched her in the busy day, she was still creepy. However, I can not guarantee how effective it is when looking at a larger group. After the death of their daughter, a couple moves to a remote cabin as a means of trying to come to terms with this death. Let me notice this death - this is one of the rare films that does not prevent the death of a child. This is more important because both sets of tune as well as explains much of the act that penetrates the movie. The couple is not doing well. The wife has distanced her from the relationship, and her husband is doing everything she can to try to bring her back. While some of the comments complained about acting - one said she acts more like a father and daughter than her husband and wife, and this is legitimate. He's trying to give him more direction. It's a role that people sometimes play. There is a variety of hope in the film and most are quite non-violent, though grotesque in some respects. The story itself feels very simple for most of the movie, and has a strange turn around. While the turn is not absurd, it certainly is not what you expected from the way things were in progress. Moody, atmospheric, and very well done for something that seems to have been shot on the video.
