I'm overwhelmed by Jim Carrey's work. I'm still blocking the movie in my head. Grinch likes Martha May, Cindy Lou (who is very annoying, her sweet innocence) trying to bring Grinch in the spirit of Christmas, Grinch's childhood (very funny!) And, moreover, All about gifts. I have to say that I felt stupid going out of the theater with a bunch of babies and kids laughing and so on, but this movie was a good adaptation of Dr. Sesus's short film and IS for all ages.
