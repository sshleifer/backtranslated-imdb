there are movies like this that make you want to never choose the bastard who's growing up in school. If you liked this movie, then I would suggest you see Valentine. I just found out today that the guy who played Marty (Simon) committed suicide shortly after the movie was released, which is a shame because he did a good job. I wonder if it's because of the role he played in the movie. It starts when Carol stops them from going into the toilet for the girls to behave as if they were going to do it. When changing into showers, folk collapses slipped into the bathroom and had everything ready, room, electrical shock, pole. When Marty opened the hollow curtain bay, he realized he was mistaken. He tries to cover the shower, but the kids open it, grab Marty and start to feel sorry for him as the camera rotates. They took it, and had given it his head in the mud as it was washed, and pushed him (gently). When the children are in detention, given by the coach, two of the boys give Marty a joint that will make him throw himself. Skip over the breaks from one of the glass windows in the gym using a brick to defeat the teacher. While Marty throws himself into the bathroom, sneaks into the Laboratory of Science and mixes some things that look like cocaine, but I'm not sure what it was. The lab throws him into a malfunction. Five years later, the children who tortured him that day received invitations for a 5-year school meeting at the old school that was burned the day it exploded. One by one people are killed. I do not understand how the drowning girl really drowned. he might have come back after Marty left. It almost came out the first time.
