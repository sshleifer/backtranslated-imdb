I like movies like this for their spirit, without a word game. It's a decent and clean film about a backgammon baseball team and a young fan wants to win, since his father said that this is the only way he's back for him. <br /> <br /> The spirit shines in two ways: a funny cast with Danny Glover and a young Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and with the heavenly soloist Al, who takes the dynamic form of Christopher Lloyd. It's an energetic film. It makes you smile and really gets involved in sports. <br /> <br /> Here is my mind. the only thing that bothers me a lot is that these sports movies turn you into an unexpected fan for the team. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this. It just seems strange to me that I should get out of the movie, thinking the angels are a strong and cool team, when really my basic loyalty, as she is, is in the Jays de la Toronto Blue. It's really interesting. If it's just a movie about a subacid children's squad, then fine.
