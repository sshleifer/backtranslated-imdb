Based on James J Corbett's biography, "The Roar Of The Crowd," Gentleman Jim is an extraordinarily gentle picture that perfectly encapsulates not only the appearance of Corbett's pugilistic lunch but also the wind of change in boxing around The story follows Corbett (Perfect Errol Flynn) from his humble beginnings as a banker in San Francisco, through a fight with a chance with an ex-boxing champion who eventually leads him to fight with the furious champion of the world group, John L Sullivan {Ward Bond personified beef personified}. Not all the fighting is in the ring, and all of the Corbett life's sales make it a great fun picture. There are class problems that have to be overcome {perfected as club members to pay for a hanger or two} and Corbett not only has to fight to get respect for the so-called colleagues, but he must also to overcome his ego as he grows so fast as his reputation. Together with Corbett's pretty marvelous family and all their humorous support, Corbett's journey is as enthusiastic as joy, but equally bold and daring, he is a very nice person and is a character that fits with the moniker tag received by Gentleman Jim. The film never falls for a moment, and it is proof of director Raoul Walsh that although we look forward to the final fight, the outer ring goes on to keep us funny, even the subject of interest for love does not hurt this image {thank Alexis Smith }. The battles take off and show perfectly how Corbett became the champion in which he played, and his mark of dance rings around slugger fighters is now firmly placed in boxing history. As the final roll rolls, we all descend to the ground after a meeting after Sullivan and Corbett puts all the brutality in context, and here is the place where humility and humility become a winner and as far as this spectator goes .... ......... will make for me to be sure I'm sure, 9/10 for a truly wonderful picture.
