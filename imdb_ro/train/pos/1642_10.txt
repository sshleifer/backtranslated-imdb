I have not seen the movie since it was released for the first time, but it was memorable. The performances of Rip Torn and Conchata Farrell were superb, excellent photography, the story line on the move, and everything else about it was of the highest standard. However, he seems to have been quite forgotten. Maybe because Britain is a strange market for it, but I have not seen the movie on TV or video, which is sad. Was it more successful in the US, where it could have been considered a fairly accurate historical drama? Always think that 50% of a good film is music, and although I'm not sure that I think the theme of the title was a simple, but moving, clarinet about "What a friend we have in Jesus." The movie then continued to disappoint that! Am I right or not?
