"Lady of Shanghai" is well-known as one of Hollywood's most disturbing productions. Welles' original cut was taken by the producers and cut into ribbons. This made the story of the mystery already confusing and more difficult to follow. The post has called a good deal of its dialogue due to the Irish accent density, and the doubling is too apparent and badly done. The most disastrous of all, Welles and Mr. Rita Hayworth, who are on the screen and in real life, broke up in their relationship, and their tumultuous chemistry comes to the screen. Fortunately, this is overtaken by Orson Welles's fantastic direction. He makes the movie incredibly stylish and atmospheric - every scene seems to breathe down the screen. Also, characters and scenes are so bizarre that they are limited to dreams and surrealities. This sense of strangeness raises scenes that are often found in these films, such as the sequences in the middle court. Typically, the dramas in the meeting room are chosen, but Welles' direction and strange touches make them as fascinating as anything else. The end of the carnival almost reminds one of David Lynch. Action here is also very good. Despite their relationship, Welles and Hayworth give decent performance - yet their interactions are lacking. All the others are gorgeous and delightful to look at, especially Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders. The "Lady of Shanghai" obviously has its problems, but it's worth watching just to see one of the cinemas master at its best. (8/10)
