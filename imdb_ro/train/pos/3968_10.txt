I first saw this movie as a boy and I recently bought it on DVD. James Stewart brings a great deal to the role of Chip Hardesty, a hard and dedicated agent of the FBI. His life in the Bureau is forbidden with his family life, which is not, however, pink. His wife (an excellent portrayal of Vera Miles) lives in fear of the dangerous nature of his job and even separates for a while; Chip's best friend and collective agent Sam Crandall (Murray Hamilton) is killed in a war; Mike's face, Mike, joins the seamen during the Second World War. Through all this, the family continues with courage and dignity. The sequences of action are quite interesting, and the semi-documentary style of the movie works effectively. And Max Steiner's music says it all; fidelity, courage and integrity. This country owes a great debt of gratitude to the men and women of the FBI and, yes, to J. Edgar Hoover. If Mr Hoover's type of vigilance had been noticed, he might have been spared during September 11, the crimes of crimes against children, and many venal politicians we had to deal with since his passing.
