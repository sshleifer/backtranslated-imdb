I can see why this film was nominated for Best Short Action Action Oscars, as it was built with craftsmanship. Even if you do not really like Blues (although for me, this sounded much more like jazz), you can easily appreciate this movie. It is simply very well done, although for my life, I can not see why director Gjon Mili has just directed a movie - this one. In other words, the film is nominated and yet the director has not received any kind of career stimulation. As far as black artists are concerned, I could understand that this does not make their careers turn into high-speed gears because, unfortunately, most white societies have indifference (or worse) for blacks or "that music." If you watch this movie, if you do not particularly enjoy the previous portion, skip ahead to the 5:50 mark - if it's taken up considerably. When the lady did not sing and the performers began to improvise, the rhythm improved slightly.
