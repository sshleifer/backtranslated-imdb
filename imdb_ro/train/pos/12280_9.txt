This is one of the few movies I've ever watched in the theater. I really love this film for his atmosphere and to tell about the life of the tragic hero Esteban Trueba. He makes so many mistakes, but he gets a chance for redemption. Is not this thought quite consoling? When I looked at him for the first time, I thought that after the winning election, the movie would be over - I did not know the book. The boy was wrong when the dramatic peak came out! I was literally swept away by the absolute power of the last half hour of the film. Many people here deeply displace this movie. I can not understand that one little bit. Perhaps those who read the first book are - like many times with screen adaptations of the Romanians - simply disappointed that so many things remained untold, unseen, inexplicable. But as a movie that tells an emotional story - the story of a family, the rise and fall of a man, the deep compassion of a woman, the power of love and the madness of hatred (and conservatism) - this movie is simply splendid! In addition, the soundtrack is incredibly good and the distribution is great - especially Winona Ryder and Jeremy Irons. So, surely, one of the movies for which the cinema was invented!
