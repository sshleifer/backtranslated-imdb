He never realized that Charles Boyer (Luis Denard) appeared with Lauren Bacall (Rose Cullen) in a movie together and enjoyed great action together. Even Peter Lorre, (Contreras) had a role in this film and had a bad misfortune in his bathroom, which made him fall. This story relates to a Republican courier, Luis Denard, who visits England during the Spanish Civil War and is trying to disrupt a coal mining contract that will cause great damage to other nations. Lauren Bacall (Rose Cullen) comes to Luis Denard's help, taking him in love at the same time and then helping him escape from a furious crowd of English workers who threaten his life. The best bad guy in this movie is Victor Francen, (Licata) "The Beast with Five Fingers", which offers remarkable performance. Great 1945 classic film without Humphrey Bogart.
