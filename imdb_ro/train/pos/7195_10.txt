I liked this republican exit series! The story was one of the best I've ever seen! Even tough, image quality was not the best but OK. The distribution in this series is also a bit bad but not terrible. They just had to do something more. As I said the story is GREAT! Just stay there and wait to find out who Don Del Oro is! The theme music is great! He is the same guy who served the music for Walt Disney's Zorro version, which served Fightin Legion music. Costumes and buildings are very good. Zorro is very cool and so are the Legionnaires! I recommend this series. Buy it! <br /> <br /> I like that Reed Hadley plays Zorro! He is funny, smart and courageous! Marking: 6.
