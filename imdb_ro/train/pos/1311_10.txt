This is one of the best movies out there and that says many were for television. I really would like to have been on d.v. Helen Hunt gave such prime performance. She perfectly interpreted a spring cop in the case of a serial killer. When he broke up because he killed another baby, it was amazing. She is so alone that she gets to her. When she talks about her mother! WOW! Steven Weber as serial killer was so shocking! He really brought it into his dark world. He was Oscar-worthy. When he talks about killing children, scary! When he realizes who he really is! What a scene! <br /> <br /> They do not really do that. It was a real thriller without being angry.
