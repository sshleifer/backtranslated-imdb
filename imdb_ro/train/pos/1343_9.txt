Thread is not a single Scorsese movie that I would put on a list of my favorite movies. But this is the best thing I've ever done in my DVD player in about five years. Scorsese's exhilarating discovery of favorite moments and how Hollywood works is incredibly graceful, calm and intelligent. <br /> <br /> There are 3 DVDs. It should have been a British production, because everything about American corporate culture would have trampled on the quiet, methodical, fearless, content-focused approach that is being taken here. And an American production would have said that they liked only movies that were popular favorites. I want everyone to take a page out of her love of movies. You should love the movies you make for personal, idiosyncratic and specific reasons. There are not just more "Me-too" votes for Naos, etc. People have no idea what ideas are being explored in their favorite movies. If it were, the movies would be more exciting than they are. Scorsese knows what ideas are being explored, and that makes him a convincing and involved speaker on the subject. I really appreciate his articulate, generous interviews over the last decade. On a negative note, Scorsese is best when he is delighted to show you an obscure film, rather than teaching a well-established film about the history of the film. And I'd like to get her three hairs from her nose. It's very distracting.
