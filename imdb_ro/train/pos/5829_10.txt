This is one of two or three Stooges favorite shoes and undoubtedly the best interpretation of Christine McIntyre with the trio. She is good in a series of other shorts, but here she is absolutely brilliant. Her song is not fun at all, in fact it's pretty, but the plot is built in such a way that singing increases humor rather than distracting them. We hear that McIntyre is singing the entire Voice of Spring at least three times, but he does not get old, partly because we do not bother our voice, and partly because it blends so well with Stooges' antique. The use of the opera soprano in a comedy reminds of Kitty Carlisle's role in Marx's "Night at Opera", but singing is much more a part of comedy here than in "Opera" and McIntyre (perhaps more in other performances here) presented a comedy talent that Carlisle never did. Stooges' song, McIntyre's song and a well-built plot combine for 5 out of 5 stars.
