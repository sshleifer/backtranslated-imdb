Ancient Mariner is a truly classic piece, because the original poem was / is. The background / setting itself with the old sailor is good, clear and unqualified. The artistic work that accompanies the reading of the poem perfectly matches the time / period of the setting and the work itself, wearing the audience in the period with an acomod, still moving, using excellent motion strategies still well-conquered by MTV pre-producers, and much less apparently in more recent works. (MTV brought a static motion and video that often crosses irrelevant cuts, from theme to theme, without moving forward and without clear relationship with the theme or story.) The voice, intonation and vitality of Redgrave's reading brings to life this moving poem with all fear, dispute and pain. In addition, the smooth motion of the video accentuates the rhythm and monotonous occasion (in this case, a positive state under the theme of the story itself) of the author's interpretation of the sad and distressing story of the ancient sailor. This is a necessity for any love of classical, great poetry, a high story that almost sounds true, and a story that has left a lasting impact on our world and culture. Who does not understand the meaning of a "albatross"? or the concept of "water, water everywhere and not a drop of drinking?" A truly fine experience. Thank you, Mr. DaSilva for bringing us to life, never to forget.
