I can not believe these games can be so much better, but they do. Unfortunately, I had to rent a Dreamcast to play it, but even if I beat him, I can not wait to buy it for PS2. This is the only series of games I have to own, even though I've often beaten them. I hope they never stop doing this kind of game, even if the series has to end. <br /> <br />
