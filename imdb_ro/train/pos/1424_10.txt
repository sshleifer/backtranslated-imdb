It is rather annoying that the reviewers continue to compare this to Planet Earth ... * Course * Earth is better - it has much more of the same thing. Earth is like an extended trailer for the planet Earth and, as such, is inevitably inferior and simplified. But this does not compare with similar ones. As a feature documentary (or, in fact, something of length) it exceeds almost everything you will see throughout your life (if you do not choose to cross the Earth into helicopters with long-range cameras over the years and wait months in the most extreme environments to take a look at the most extraordinary beings on earth, which - it's hard to believe.) About the narrator: yes, everyone in the UK - which includes me very much much - loves David Attenborough, and there is no excuse for him not to be revealed here, but he is hardly worth a star or three. He was not a presenter on Planet Earth, just a narrator, and I'm sure he's pretty modest and graceful to realize that everything that many viewers get is a good thing. Whoever sees this will be overwhelmed by his amazement, majesty and glory. All commentators agree to this. Those who love it (or everyone else) want / should go to see a Planet Earth purchase. So, three applause for cinematographic release and a great boooo for anyone is pretty inexpensive to buy this on DVD, rather than the set of Planet Earth boxes. But as works of art, they are not in competition here. The earth is big enough for both.
