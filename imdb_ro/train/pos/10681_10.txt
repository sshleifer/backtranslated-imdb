While the British produced some hilarious and slick sitcoms in the 1990s - Ab Fab, Men Behaving Badly, One Foot in the Grave, etc. - 70s were the real golden age. In 1970, there were whole new territories to explore, including sexual revolution, feminism, and slow awareness of the need for "sensitivity" that, after twenty years, would become political correctness. Attempts to struggle with the confusion of this modern modern world have been subtle and not so subtle in everything that happens, from the sketches of Monty Python's Flying Circus to sitcoms like House Man. (By the late 1970s, this "battle" had resulted in more meditative and sweet-sweet situations, such as the Butterflies masterpiece). The Man about the House is a perfect example of the good Britons of the time - slightly cute, weird, fresh, ingenious, sometimes scandalous, with some remarks well done on contemporary life. Compare it to a 1990's cynical show, like Ab Fab, and it's hard to believe that the two were created in the same country. Man About the House is one of the greatest Britons of the '70s, right up there with the Good Neighbors (Good Life) and About the House escapes George and Mildred. His quality is attested by the fact that, as with the Good Neighbors, creators, writers and many of them have been successful in British television.
