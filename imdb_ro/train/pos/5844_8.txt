In 1948, this was my favorite movie. Betty Grable's costumes were so ruthless that I wanted to grow up to be her and to dress like that. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., was irresistible as the Hungarian officer. Foolish and stupid, how could this film appear at the beginning when I was eight years old, I seemed to say something important about the relationship between men and women. I saw it again; I was surprised to find that it was still there.
