I saw Saving Grace just after he came out on the video. Since then she has become one of my favorites! The land is not particularly complex, but it does not move away from entertainment. It is chuck full of comedy moments and has a very pleasant quality to her. The characters are what makes the movie so good. Each has its own strange qualities that add to the humor, the two old ladies played by Linda Kerr Scott and Phyllida Law cry in mind. The superb action was made by everyone, especially by Brenda Blythen. She and Craig Ferguson were marveling together to take a few more funny moments. If you are looking for a good comedy I would definitely recommend this movie!
