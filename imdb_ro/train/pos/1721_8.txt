Had this film been made a few years later, I would have given her a smaller score. However, for 1909, it was a small dandy film and still stands pretty good today. Just do not try to compare this silent film with the subsequent silence - the industry has changed so radically that the shorts of the first decade of the 20th century do not resemble the films made in the 1910s and beyond. <br /> <br /> This film has a length of 11 minutes (about average for most of the movies then) and is a variant of Edgar Allen Poe's THE CASK OF AMONTILLADO. While many are familiar with the story, I will not elaborate, because I do not want to destroy the movie. Just enough to say it's very creepy!
