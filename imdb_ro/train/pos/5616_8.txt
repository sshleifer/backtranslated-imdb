What can be said, indeed ... The tenant is a first class thriller with an equal amount of suspense and blowing paranoia. It's a complex movie - every detail seems to be included for a reason - although the plot rarely makes sense, and much of it is never approached in an objective manner. Therefore, we are left with Trelkovsky (Polanski) increasingly unstable - a gentle Polish who obtained an apartment due to the previous suicide of the tenant - to guide us through a world of fear and uncertainty escalating. After a heating party of the apartment, thrown by a group of incoherent colleagues, Trelkovsky is under an increased, unmistakable examination by the other occupants in his building; the rest of the film chronicles its mental deterioration and gives us a thorough minute of David Lynch's subsequent efforts. The "tenant", however, is more reluctant and sinister, trained with unexpected comic relief, fine performances and a truly haunting score. It's a more experienced film than it was described, so let's get it.
