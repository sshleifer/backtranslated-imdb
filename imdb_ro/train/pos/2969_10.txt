This movie is about two guys who made a sport on the spot, trying to get it. 2. BASEketball becomes a national sport. Joe Cooper (Trey Parker) is the loved captain, but he is ugly when he loses the NBA with another rival team. He meets Yasmine Bleeth's dream girl and eventually kisses. the first time I saw this movie and wet my pants was so funny. a certain guy has to see for all fans of comedy. If you like the South Park, you like this! Maybe you do not look at the kids is a little inappropriate for little boys. some duds give him 6Â½ out of ten, give him 11 out of ten. I like coop he rocks I have to go after thank you because you read this
