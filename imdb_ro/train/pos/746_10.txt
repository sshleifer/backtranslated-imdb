As I get to the 35-year-old back, I'm shaking my head more and more with today's drug-infected, teenage, teenage teenagers. It was great to remember that she was just as crazy for me back in my day as it is for teenagers today. This film drives that point home to the core. If you are a fan of the 70s, you will love the movie. From KISS posters to an Angel concert, this movie rocks! <br /> <br /> Look for a young Laura Dern. Why did not they have more songs from the Runaways I will never know? <br /> <br /> I had a problem with Randy Quaid's character deflating a 16-year-old girl. While he was away, she and her friends have a party that destroys the typical house. The cops come and everything, but they do not mention anything about the minor drinks and how these kids took their hands on these things. Foxes belong to "Over the Edge", "Fast Times", "Dazed & Confused" and "Kids" as one of the teen angst movements all the time. I say buy it and watch it with your kids and talk about it all.
