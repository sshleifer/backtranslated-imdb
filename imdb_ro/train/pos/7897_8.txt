At first glance, this movie does not seem to be a special one. After all the movies of Bette Davis with only 166 votes on IMDb and a rating of 6.5 must be bad enough. But the film turned out to be a delightful and original surprise. You would expect from the beginning that this is a typical 30-year-old classic movie with a story of formal love, but the movie is surprisingly well-built and has an unusual and original story that also helps transform this film into a " a very pleasant film. The story is borne by the two main characters of Bette Davis and George Brent. They helped a cast of mostly funny characters, but the movie mainly involves only two around them. Their character is involved in a very unusual and intelligent love story that works and humorously. Make this movie a charming comedy to watch, which is perfect for fun. The film is pretty short (just over an hour), which means that the story does not waste any time on the useless lines of plot, development and characters. It also makes the movie quite fast pace, which helps make this movie a perfect watch also of today's standards as well. The movie may sometimes be a simple one, but it never works to the detriment of entertainment or entertainment. A nice and romantic comedy that deserves to be seen more! <br /> <br /> 8/10
