William (Nicholas Ball) and Emma Peters (Rachel Davies) are buying an old house where a brutal crime happened years ago, in a very bad state, with the intention of restoring them. She moves with their daughter Sophie (Emma RidleY) and becomes friends of their neighbors Jean (Patricia Maynard) and George Evans (Brian Croucher). However, weird happenings in the house, including the death of Sophie's cat. In Sophie's birthday party, a blood leakage pipe and they leave the place, revealing a secret later. "The Bloody House to Death" is a scary and one of the best episodes in the "Hammer House of Terror" series. The fantastic revenge, revealing a secret and tragic conclusion, are really excellent. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Casa Que Sangrou At√© Morrer" ("The House Bleeding to Death")
