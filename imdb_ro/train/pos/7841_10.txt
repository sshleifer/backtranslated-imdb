this is really a living for every Bolan fan, some may think it's a bit over the top, and it's just about the ego of Ringo and Marc, but I think it's similar to any other video concert, except that is Marc Bolan, not just a guy! I especially liked the music video for the children of the revolution, with Elton John and Ringo Starr. this clip alone deserves all the money, I can not believe they did not release this version as a single. The film is great, especially for new dances. I was not alive in the 1970s. but the dances were generally shot out of what was happening around them. the media did not play or showed any popular music ever since, including Marc Bolan and T.Rex, played only a little with Doors, but only very popular songs. So, I know from my father, seeing this, I give him back some of his youth, he never experienced. I do not have much time, so ... If you're Marc Bolan's youngest fan, you have to see that. you may find it boring or as told earlier, a little over the top. But at least you've seen one of the best musicians ever in action! The only thing that disappoints me is that Ride A White Swan is not on the tape. but I forgive, since Jeepster and Get It On are so wonderful played.
