The only reason I give this movie 8/10 stars, not 10, is because 1) Sinatra is terrible and 2) Kelly's love interest leaves much to be desired (IMHO). Love Dean Stockwell, Quantum Leap - Al, is the little boy. The Jerry Mouse dance sequence is one of the most amazing and amazing dance sequences I've ever seen. Tom and Jerry are still a favorite of me and my daughter. I am 28 years old and she is 4 years old, so while the character is less iconic than Mickey, he is still a favorite of many children and adults today. Kelly is always captivating, eyes full of fun and excitement. In every movie I've ever seen, he always steals the show. One of the best dancers of the 20th century. No wonder Paula Abdul "tried" Kelly's movements. I would also list Gene Kelly as one of the most beautiful people of the twentieth century. If you should only watch one side, do not miss Kelly's dance with Jerry Mouse. You will not be disappointed.
