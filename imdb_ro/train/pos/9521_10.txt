I think this movie is shining. there are many reasons why, but these are some of them 1) the good acting by Tom and Tyler 2) the genius of the machine gun that was a piece of glow 3) I thought the end was a good twist because I did not, I never expected that all of Sam Mendes's credit at the end of the year. as well as these 3 points, the movie is fine and the movie. I'm a college student and I studied this film in detail and it was one of the best movies I've seen for many years. I would like to thank you very much for all those involved in making this film. Finally, I would like to say that the best scene in the movie is the machine-gun scene in which John Rooney gets to kill that it's just a pure glow in shooting the scene in silence until John Rooney says "I'm glad you are" is much better I think because the viewer creates his own sound and the sound is totally different for every shining spectator.
