From the first scene, I was very excited. "I can say this will be great!" I thought. The act was so good, I felt as if I were a sideline - falling into these people's lives. And the music was extremely disturbing. The plan began with a sudden event, and then it headed forward (it might feel) to an irrevocable fate. Construction has been slow, but I personally love this as long as the quiet tension remains on the right track and does not get derailed before it's ready to pay for it. So everything goes well, and then the fireworks start, and before you know, the credits are running. "WHAT THE?!!!" it was all I could say with my comrade night movie. If you understand the director's intentions, the blunt end makes sense (for those of you who have already seen the movie, visit the very fascinating and hilarious interview with Larry Fessenden at filmcritic.com), but I can not say it was not broken off quite well. Probably this could have been solved with just ten minutes of material before the climax. Anyway, it's too bad. These ten minutes could have made the difference in the world. (But for those of you who do not write or make movies, you have to know that making a story of the right calendar is a rough pain in the ass and certainly do not make this critique of any kind of pedestal!) <Br / > <br /> Wendigo feels like a masterpiece that has been abandoned before it's over. But the hay, I'd take a blonde masterpiece every day in a dog-poo piece that's been produced too much, with too many digital effects (like most horror movies nowadays). Another comment. Some monster scenes have left me confused about the fact that I should be scared or laugh. I do not know how to explain it, but there was a Monty Python who felt distinctly about this monster in its more mysterious forms. Though this may seem a terrible criticism of a horror movie - I do not know, it has still worked for me in a crooked way. I will never look at the deer horns the same way again! :)
