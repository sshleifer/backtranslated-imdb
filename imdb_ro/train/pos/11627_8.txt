Lisa is a manager or owner of the hotel and she is on a flight to Miami. He is approaching an assassin called Jackson who tells him he has to go through a family room or that her father dies. The reason the room needs to pass is that Jackson wants to blow him up. It's a big suspense movie because Lisa is trying to find ways to get rid of this thing Jackson created. The whole story is great and I thought she could have spent some time on the plane. He may have more on the plane, but besides, the whole movie was pretty good. I particularly liked the end, because it was inactive. I did not know what would happen and I was surprised. For me, the movie took off.
