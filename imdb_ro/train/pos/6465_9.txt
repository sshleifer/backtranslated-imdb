This film, recently voted as a favorite audience at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival, is also inspired on the move. A renowned conductor, forced to retire by illness, returns to the small birth village to become the leader of the church choir and eventually finds fulfillment in his music. Based on the Sweedish features of keeping things in itself and the insular character of a small Swedish village, this film is well developed for each character. directed a lot, acted and sang, brought tears to many eyes and smiled to everyone. We hope it will find distribution in the United States. If you can, you see it!
