Gary Busey is the title character, Frank "Bulletproof" McBain, your policeman who did not win the nickname, because no matter how many bullets he has (38 counts), he never stops after the bad guys. When a last-generation American tank named "Thunderblast" is headed by revolutionaries / terrorists led by General Brogado (Rene Enriquez) and Libyan Colonel Kartiff (Henry Silva), who line up with Russian villains. The army's staff are held prisoners, including Devon Shepard (Darlanne Fluegel), who happens to be McBain's girlfriend. McBain is then recruited by the army for a rescue mission. Busey may not have the physical presence of saying, someone like Schwarzenegger, who would have been another suitable conductor for such a movie, but he explodes like a type of confidence that is fast with witches. Fluegel is a large female lead; she not only looks incredibly sexy but also makes for a good-looking babe. Enriquez, Silva, Juan Fernandez, and always welcome William Smith (as a Russian master) are a bad prey in the cinematic action tradition. Supportive distribution is quite full of familiar and trusted actors: L.Q. Jones, R.G. Armstrong, Thalmus Rasulala, Lincoln Kilpatrick, Mills Watson, Luke Askew, Danny Trejo and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa. <br /> <br /> T.L. Lankford and B.J. Goldman provides the script based on a story by Lankford and veteran director B, Fred Olen Ray. It's the kind of scenario you just know that writers have their tongues on their cheeks: they know their material is absurd and cheesy, and just have their credibility on the window. Steve Carver, veteran director of action, keeps him on the move and offers a respectable amount of gunfire, explosions and generous chaos. <br /> <br /> "Bulletproof" is a pleasant fun for fans of action that does not stop their brains from time to time and just enjoying a generous assortment of violence and humor. 7/10
