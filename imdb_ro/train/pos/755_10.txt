Dirty Sanchez is Jackass's extended version of the British, in which the four boys (Pritchard, Dainton, Joycey and Pancho) are making great efforts to hurt and humiliate each other. The reason this show is better than Jackass is because most cascades are not planned, which makes the reaction more fun. There are 3 series of the show, the first one follows them and has a long look at their life, eg. there is an episode about their lives of love, jobs, etc. The second series sends boys to try different occupations. The third follows their European tour. It seems boys are becoming more and more bold as the show progresses in series. In my opinion, the third series is the best, but trust me when I say if you have a weekly stomach. You DO NOT SEE because you are easy to see a fair amount of blood and get red in each episode.
