Another hit by Norman Lear, detailing the problems African Americans had to pass in the 1960s and 1970s. With Esther Rolle and her husband, along with three children living in a Chicago high rise project in a predominantly black neighborhood , the show showed what black people were going through with a landlord (the black agent Mr. Bookman) as well as the daily prices and problems of the existing ones. The three children described how people seem to confront their problems differently - from JJ comic to militant Ralph Carter, to their daughter who wanted to be successful, this show being a perfect description of African-American life .
