I heard that this movie was good to many of my friends who saw it and said it was amazing, so I had very high expectations - and Nancy Drew has exceeded these great expectations! It had some funny parts, they made me have fun and all the guys were trying to kill her, and Emma Roberts was amazing as Nancy Drew. The rest of the distribution was very good as well. I would definitely recommend this movie! <br /> <br /> Nancy: "I wonder why these guys are trying to kill us?" "Nancy:" I hate when people try to kill me, it's so rude! "<br /> <br /> </ p> <p> Nancy Drew
