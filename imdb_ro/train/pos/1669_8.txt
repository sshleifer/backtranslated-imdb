Artemisia Gentileschi, daughter of Orazio Gentileschi, showed an early promise as a painter. Learned by her father, Artemisia was born in an age that denied talented women the right to do their work to be seen alongside the art created by men. Her tragic life is characterized by this biographical film directed and co-written by Agnes Merlik. After reading the novel "Passion of Artemisia" by Susan Vreeland, it has made us explore more about this woman's life, her work and her inheritance. We also read Mary Garrard's "Artemisia Gentileschi", which should be a book read by all art lovers. "Artemisia" presents the fictitious facts I have read about showing the young woman's early life as starting to paint. She was clearly influenced by her father's work, by Caravaggio, Agostino Tassi and other Florentine painters of that period. Her relationship and love with Tassi is the basis of the film. Unfortunately, Artemisia could not go so much that she could have because of prejudice against women in art. She also did not help her to make a scandal in which she was accused of being raped by Tassi. She had to go to Rome to stay away from that unfortunate moment of her life. Valentina Cervi makes a beautiful Artemisia. She is a beautiful creature that has awakened men's passion. Michel Serrault plays Orazio, her father. Miki Maojlovic is seen as Tassi, the man who wanted Artemisia, but he got to jail. Emmanuelle Devos appears for a moment. The film has a glossy finish that Benoit Delhomme's work captures in all its splendor. The scenic locales of the film give an idea of ​​what inspired this painting school in their paintings. Krishna Levy's music is good for what we see. Agnes Merlik straightened his hand with a sure hand showing his own visual style.
