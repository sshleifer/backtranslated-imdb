This is easy 9. Michel Serrault, better known for comic roles in the previous part of his acting career, is doing an amazing, even worrying job, to borrow Dr. Petiot, a legendary French killer. <br /> <br /> He is equally credible at any time in the movie, that the actor disappears entirely behind the character - only the best ever best done, and when I do it only in a hand sides at best. > The whole story (a real story that happened in France in the 20th century) is so strong, so sinister - it makes for a very strong movie that she has been remembered for a long time.
