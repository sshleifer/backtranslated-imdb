This show has all the typical characters in a comedy: the good guy, the idiot, the perversion, the rich girl ... but it's set in the '70s. This is the only difference she has with other TV comedies. I do not know how you like this show. His humor is pathetic! I want to say that the jokes are so direct ... A typical dialogue is the following: "Fez: Oh, Jackie I want to have sex with you (audience laughs) Jackie: Fez you're a perverse (audience laughs) Fez: Yeah, I am (Audience and applause) "It's not funny. I think if he did not have those laughs (I do not know how you say it in English, I'm sorry), you would not laugh at all. This is not a smart comedy, it is an insult to the audience. I like most American comedies, but this is not good at all. I would give 4 out of 10. (I'm sorry for my poor tongue again.)
