A series of vignettes, most of which falsify television in the 1970s, but also some digging in government and America's corporations. One of the longest segments, Dealers, is not that funny to me and I do not know what parody means. Some of the others, however, are completely separate. I am especially glad to see the cooking show segment. Most of the wrong words I know are used in the film, and if you oppose frontal nudity, stay away.
