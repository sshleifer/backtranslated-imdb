Oddly, this version of OPEN OYES is more mature and nuanced. Actor Crowe, helped by the retrospective, is much tighter and cleaner than the original Amenabar. The Spanish Filmmaker should realize the story first, but there is no doubt that Crowe has improved - even if a little. Notice that you have no idea what the leadership has done in EYE OPENING, but you know almost everything about the leadership of VANILLA SKY. That's what I mean by more "fleshed out".
