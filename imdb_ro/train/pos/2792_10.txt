I love this movie. It's a great movie that combines English and Indian cultures with feminist issues like girls wanting to play sports previously reserved for men. It affirms the struggles both for an Indian person who wants to break away from his cultural barriers and for women who want to overcome gender restrictions in sports, especially in England. I think cultural struggles are more pronounced than other issues. Unlike the other comment, I do not think this movie is something like Dirty Dancing or any other kind of chicken blow. This movement is loved by many kinds of men, men and women, young and old alike.
