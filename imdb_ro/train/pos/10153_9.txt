I caught this movie in a screening test. She was very surprised to find a very sweet and fun story. Well, he acted. Natasha Henstridge is the next Julia Roberts. The male leadership was awsome. Very funny movie. It takes place in the best locations in New York. It made me want to go there. I just saw "You got mail" I thought "You had to be" it was a much better story Freshher It was clean and great for the whole family I think it will be good Audience I saw it with love.
