I only know about another movie that could compete with the Opening Event and that's Bergman's Persona. Both films are simply stunning, they have a wealth of hard-to-understand ideas at first glance. We have a deep meditation on the relationship between art and life as an actress, Myrtle Gordon (Gena Rowlands), is more in touch with the character she is playing on stage than she wants. The accidental death of one of her fans, a young girl who declares her love for Myrtle and she is then hit by a car, leaves a profound sign to the actress. She begins to ask questions about her aging that begins to affect her until the only solution becomes alcohol. But that does not help much, and Myrtle is a step away from complete madness. The scene in which he kills the imaginary (or not) spirit of the dead girl is one of the most thrilling scenes I've ever found in a Cassavets movie. The film ends with a genius show on behalf of the director while filming a theater scene in which he and Gow Rowlands improvise a scene, since Myrtle comes too drunk on the opening night to fully fulfill the part. This scene was shot spontaneously, with a living audience, the laughter is authentic, the chemistry between Casavates and Rowlands is absolutely amazing. If you liked Persona or are interested in a movie that offers great ideas alongside great entertainment, this movie will suit you well.
