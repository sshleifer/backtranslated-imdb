There are a few movies or films I've been watching over the years. The Gospel Road was one of them. I have seen this as a teenager and I would love to see again. My favorite songs were that 1 / Jesus was blond, <br /> <br /> 2 / The last dinner was a huge meal, 3 / he liked to play with the kids , <br /> <br /> 4 / His death was for all people and for all time. The film may not have been theologically or qualitatively, but it touched my heart at that time. Plus, I'm a Johnny Cash fan and it was a courageous adventure. If it ever appears on DVD, I will buy it exclusively for sentimental reasons.
