In the same melody as the American reels along Mohawk, John Ford captures American history in a way that is fictitious and yet very credible. Henry Fonda has made three consecutive films in this era with Ford, and the three are about a certain time and place, with a focus on setting and cultural surroundings. In Mohawk, America's pioneer is blooming with the Americans who are fighting against them against the Indians and other forces. Here, Ford shows us America from the 19th century; a moment when invention and creativity began to flourish, and this nation has truly become great. Among them was a young, tall, young lawyer in Illinois, called Abe Lincoln, and this film fictional life as a lawyer, prefiguring the greatness he will achieve later. Fonda is great in this film, capturing the essence of what is considered Lincoln's person, though no one knows exactly how it was then. Sets and support parts also work well together and provide a unique balance in Ford's picturesque American Dream and its many shapes. This is not a film that has to be taken literally, but rather symbolically, showing that Lincoln really warmed up for the events of his life that created his inheritance. We have some scenes between him and a young Mary Todd; and it's hard to see how they ended up together, but that's not the point. I think this is simply a tribute to the greatness of Lincoln, widely regarded as the greatest American president. His quiet and direct attitude was rare and would be today. Indeed, our government needs more people like him.
