Every time this movie is on the BBC, someone in the Radio Times says what a satire is against the post-war world of reasoning and welfare. I do not think this is the purpose of the movie. The film parodies the spies (time criminals who led the black market) and the domestic league, which fought against government restrictions, but they were indeed a Tory front organization. Yes, of course, the film sends political / social but ultimately the people realize they need all the controls to ensure a fair society, they want to be more British than foreigners. But I do not think they're going back to being exactly like before.
