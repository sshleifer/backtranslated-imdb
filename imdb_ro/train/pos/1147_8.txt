Soapdish can descend as one of the most underestimated films ever made. A stellar, unselfish distribution that understands exactly where the movie and the roles it plays in it. While everyone scattered it, there was no chance. Kline showed wisdom and great physical comedy, and Goldberg and Downey knew how to have a fun conversation, while someone else was talking, I could go on. Do not pass this movie!
