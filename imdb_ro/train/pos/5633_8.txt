Farrah Fawcett is gorgeous in this powerful drama in 1986, where she plays Marjorie, a woman who manages to escape from a rapist's clutches. Well done to Farrah because she was nominated for the Golden Globe "Best Actress". When her rapper Joe (terribly played by James Russo) enters her house and shares with her two roommates out!), Marjorie has to play along with Joe's terrifying demands. If roommates return home, they are amazed (at least) by Marjorie's actions and a great interpretation of Alfre Woodard, who desperately tries to persuade Marjorie to do the right thing and turn into police, make the film even more nail-bite. I find Diana Scarwid quite irritating, but when Joe eventually admits that he came there to kill everyone, he makes the film a very emotional piece of drama indeed. Overall, Extremities is a thoughtful and well-acting brilliant movie and I have to watch for hundreds of times so far! Good for everyone involved.
