Hollywood imitates Dayatiem soaps at its best! It's the fun we never see. Big characters and great lines. Whoopi is hilarious ..... Sally Field is so up ... Gary Marshalls's lines are a revolt ... I really like good comedies. Never be afraid to have fun alone !!!!!! The sets were great ... the wardrobe was on the way, and the back of the "Montana Morehead" was a diabolical delight. Terri Hatcher as "Dr. Monica Demonico" did not have enough lines, but still more wonderful and fun when on screen. I would love to know how the idea of ​​this movie came about. I have never seen a cast of people who have so much fun doing comedy work! Soapdish is a must have and I'm waiting for the DVD!
