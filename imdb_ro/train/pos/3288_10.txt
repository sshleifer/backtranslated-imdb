This is a cool fantasy movie. One of my fables is really so cool. Director Bernard Rose, who continued to guide Candyman, made a wonderful start with this film. Film about a girl named Anna, who gets sick of glandular fever at age 11. She draws a house on a piece of paper in her exercise book and falls into a dream where the house is real. Every dream he has afterwards is changed by the presence of what he adds to the picture. In the third dream, she meets a boy he thinks he created, called Mark. She becomes friends with him and their relationship becomes stronger as dreams become darker and more frightening. Charlotte Burke who plays Anna is an extraordinary actress and it is very strange that after a single film she should disappear and never be in any time again. It gives a great performance in this movie. Hans Zimmer's score is also a needle. Like Broken Arrow, music is ghostly and mysterious. It's a shame that the soundtrack is no longer available on the CD. The DVD is only available in R2.
