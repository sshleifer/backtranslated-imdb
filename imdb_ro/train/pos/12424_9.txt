I always wanted David Duchovney to get into the movie and eventually did it and made me proud. This movie lived up to what we hoped for. Duchovney played his character very well, managing to stay consistent with something new, instead of playing Agent Molder with whom we are accustomed. Therefore, he gives him extra credit for his role, too, because I did not see anyone else playing that character. David was great, but nothing compared to the psychotic Timothy Hutton. A brilliant performance that does not get you tired of the movie, because it never surprises you. It has weaknesses and strengths, making the story more credible. I also enjoyed the narrative very much, I added the story to a good deal and I had very memorable quotes, which I still use forever. This movie also had a wounderfull score. I recommend this to anyone who likes drama and does not bother their blood.
