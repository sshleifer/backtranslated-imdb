The world is made up of two different types of movies ... There are types of "English Patient" who can not be disturbed to enjoy something that is not big enough to be displayed on PBS and there is "Happy Gilmore" for which an hour and a half of genital games definitely deserve $ 7. Of course there is a ton of gray area, but you know in which direction you support yourself. If you are a person living in English, save yourself time, save your money and save all your comments "Oh, this movie is so childish and stupid." I know, you like to overturn every movie you do not like and every person you like, but maybe you could hold on to it once. But if you are a happy guy Gilmore. .. go see this ... You will find hilarious. Tim Meadows has created a hilarious character, and Will Farrell continues to be hilarious in almost everything he does. Go check. You will be glad you did. And it's okay.
