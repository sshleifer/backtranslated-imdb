On the whole, this is a delightful, luminous, romantic and musical comedy. I think it could be a small case for the movie to be long. But I'm not sure what you cut off. Singing Kelly and Sinatra? Not. The fabulous dance Kelly does? Not. Does movie time take to develop the story line and develop character relationships? No (it seems to be a common complaint many times that the latest movies do not develop the characters). Some say that Iturbi did not bring much to the film, but that gives us the chance to see and hear a great talent from the 1040s. And if he was not an actor? He was an important part of the film because the basic plot was to bring Grayson to an audition with him. Initially, Katherine Grayson wanted to be an opera star. Louis B. Mayer brought it to MGM for a screen test that includes an area. During his hearing in the movie, there is a MGM brass blow that nodded and smiled. You can imagine it was so when it really did a test screen years ago. This movie is so lively is hard to touch all the most important. A great use was made of color and lighting throughout the film. You can see why Frank Sinatra has become the star that he did. A nice counter-point in the movie is how Sinatra (a ladies man even then) played the role of wanting to find only once during the vacation. You will feel good after seeing this movie. 7/10
