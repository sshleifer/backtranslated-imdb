In April 1965, CBS broadcast Barbra Streisand's first monumental television. The show was not only a rataway success, but also won five Emmy Awards. This is one of the most memorable moments of television in the 1960s, and unfortunately, the kind of special television they do not produce anymore. Filled with wonderful songs and spectacular spectacle by Barbra, this specialty is a must-see for any fan in Streisand and anyone interested in early television.
