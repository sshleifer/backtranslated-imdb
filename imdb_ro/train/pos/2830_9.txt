The extraordinary Rosemary Forsyth is the main reason to see this movie. Why never became a bigger store can never be known. But she's exceptional and steals every scene she's in. Garson Kanin directed this piece of fluff and distribution is the first rate, with Robert Drivas and Brenda Vaccaro especially memorable. A "9" of "10."
