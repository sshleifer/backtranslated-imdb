This movie is fantastic. Finally, well-written characters that you can love for everything that's good and bad. Pierce Brosnan is full of hysteria in this role of self-wiping. I think that's the best thing he ever did. He has done other roles that have shown shades of being capable of such full work, but this role eventually gave him the room to run with it. I almost died when she walked through the hotel lobby in lingerie and boots. And Greg Kinnear and Hope Davis are a very aspiring couple as well as aspiring actors. Kinnear is so cute that his turn is indeed pleasing. You give your good actors a good work to play and give us a little more back.
