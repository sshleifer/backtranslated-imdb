I think the movie was kind of weird. In the opening scene, a person is killed without reason. It is no longer mentioned. The special effects could also be better, but I enjoyed watching an older horror movie. It's not the best example of a classic horror film, but it was still a good movie. I give about 5 out of 10 scales.
