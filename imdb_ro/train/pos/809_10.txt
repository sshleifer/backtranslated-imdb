A very good movie. A classic SF movie with humor, action and everything. This film offers a larger number of strangers. We see the leaders of the Rebel Alliance and many of the imperial forces. The Emperor is somehow an original character. I liked the Ewoki as some indigenous wilds and the Vietnamese. (Excellent references) I liked the duel between Vader and Luke, which is the best of the saga. In the return of the Jedi the epilogue of the first trilogy ends, and the Empire eventually falls. I also appreciated the victory feast of Vader's redemption and returns to Anakin Skywalker's spirit with Yoda and Obi-Wan. Give a sadness and a tear. The biggest scenes in Star Wars are among this film: When Vader starts the Emperor. Luke watches and finds comfort when I see Obi-Wan, Yoda and his ... father (the 1997 version is not Hayden Christenssen). The next scene is best when Luke is in a hurry to hit Darth Vader to defend Leia. There is a dark part of this film, despite the fact that there is a good ending. I felt there were many more than my eyes. And as always John William's music will bring classicism to the "Star Wars" universe.
