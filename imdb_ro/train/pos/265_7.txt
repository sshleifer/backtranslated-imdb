A series of random theft, seemingly insignificant at her sister's bedchamber, was quite agitated by Miss Lemon. A ring, bulbs, a backpack, a lighter, a stethoscope, a shoe? there seems to be no rhyme or reason for any of them. Miss Lemon asks the employer, the great Belgian detective Hercule Poirot, to analyze the problem. But what Poirot sees is something much more sinister than Miss Lemon could have imagined. And Poirot's fears are confirmed when one of the students living in the hostel is found dead. It's up to Poirot to bring a killer to justice. Hickory Dickory Dock is a solid but not spectacular entry into the long-running Poirot series. I appreciate how faithful the scenario for Agatha Christie's original story is. I realize that certain freedoms have to be taken, but still I appreciate the effort. Are the major points of the mystery all there? minor thefts, bedchair, students, broken backpack and, of course, Poirot's ability to see something sinister before it happens. With a few exceptions, student distribution is almost as I imagined. Damian Lewis and Jessica Lloyd are in the group. As I always enjoy Poirot from David Suchet, I get a real blow from episodes with Philip Jackson's Inspector Japp and Pauline Moran's Lemon Lemon. This episode is a real betrayal as Miss Lemon receives more screen time than usual. Finally, I liked the use of the mouse ever present as an observer of the boarding house activities. It's a fun little game on the Hickory Dickory Dock title. I realized when I looked at Hickory Dickory Dock exactly what the great influence of Agatha Christie had on highly stylized Italian mystery films or Gialli the '60s and' 70s. Take the murder of Mrs. Nicoletis as an example. If you had to face the scenic nature of the scene, you would have something straight from a Giallo of the 70s. In fact, Hickory's entire Dickory Dock plot could have been used in a Giallo. It's quite complicated and quite interesting to have worked.
