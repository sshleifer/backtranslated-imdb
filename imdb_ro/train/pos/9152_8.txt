This is a good movie for 99% of the duration. I feel that the end closed this movie from a greater recognition. It is shot in a rather naive manner. This is clearly done to create a more refreshing feeling for the film - a sense of isolation is apparently very soon due to this shooting technique. The terrible characters are very well acted and presented, "Joe called. However, healthy (normal) characters are a bit pathetic to my liking - they are given, they are supposed to meet equally pathetic, but there is little OTT. The movie starts slowly (and the naive work room smacks from movie "B" to start with) and very normally, but you will soon get a sense of imminent brutality that is about to occur. This is one of the most "twisted" films in terms of cold-blooded violence. After the sudden and incredibly lazy ending, I felt disappointed. I would have given the movie a 9-foot film if the end was consistent with the rest of the film, but as it is in the film, it's only 7 on the power of "eeriness" and nail bites. /> <br /> Give her a clock and excuse the end!
