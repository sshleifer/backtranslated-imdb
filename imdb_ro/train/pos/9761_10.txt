Here's a direct movie from my childhood, my family was registered; but it was kind of hit over and losted over the years. Now I was lucky to watch the entire movie on youtube.com; I loved this wonderful movie when I looked like a child, and after I look again (online), I still do it today. My favorite song in the movie is "Candy Hearts and Paper Flowers" (I will always remember that sweet song forever). <br /> <br /> I was surprised when I looked at the opening credits (who were the ones who animated) that some of the animators date back to the 1930s (WOW !, about 47 years old).
