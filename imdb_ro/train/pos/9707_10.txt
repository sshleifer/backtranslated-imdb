One year ago, I finally gave up American television. I thought I'd quit TV completely until a friend who lived in England showed me some programs that included the Office, Extras, Blackadder, and the League of Gentlemen. Then I decided to go to British television. Among all the above shows, the League of Gentlemen is slightly the darkest and most twisting of them, offering guilty laughter and materials that have not been found in any other comedy I have ever seen. The characters included are the most unfortunate couple of marriage, a slaughter that puts the ingredients in the meat that is not indicated (perhaps for the best), an upset couple looking at a local shop that deals only with locals and the worst physician vet. This program is one of the best I've ever seen.
