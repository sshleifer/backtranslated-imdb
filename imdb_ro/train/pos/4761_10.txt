An excellent movie with great performance from Zack & Lochley. To their satisfaction (and mine), Garibaldi arrived at the station. (With all respect for Jerry Doyle, but in Seasons 4 & 5 I lost the sympathy for the character.) It does not take too long to start criticizing Zack (which I like most of the show) and take over. I'm sure Zack could have done it. The plot of Soulhunter is fascinating, especially if you believe in the sky like Zack. Humor complements it nicely. 10/10
