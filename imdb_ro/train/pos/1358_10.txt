Season after season, the players or characters in this show seem to be people you would absolutely like to hate. Is this fake show to be so or were they chosen for the same thing? Each episode hits a single person specifically and gets killed. You like to see that they are themselves, though they are totally wrong and sick. You like to see them deceive others, screw them, play them dirty, turn them back, escape, and eventually give it to Trump. The amount of tears also seems to increase depending on the season. The reward that seeks to offset the humiliation and suffering of the past is also very low. In newer seasons such as "You could meet xyx who will teach you about uvw" .. like who freaking care? The characters are so ugly, collective and individual that you wonder if they are paid actors? The only healthy man gets to win. Watch carefully and keep a conscience. These are your colleagues on the firing line.
