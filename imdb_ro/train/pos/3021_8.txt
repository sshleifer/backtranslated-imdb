but it's worth watching for Boyer, Lorre and Paxinou. Greene's amusements that were filmed during the war either required transplantation on American shores, as in The This Gun for Hire, or the use of American actors in roles they did not fit. Bacall fits here. I waited for her to whistle and bring Bogie; her voice is simply wrong for a senior English class. But listen to the dialogue! No, people do not talk like that except books, but Greene sends a message about an England that has to wake up to the dangers of the world. Another positive note: Greene's character lineup was entirely upheld. While Mr. Mukerjee resembles a Brahamin, at least his nationality was preserved, and his final conversation with Paxinou is invaluable.
