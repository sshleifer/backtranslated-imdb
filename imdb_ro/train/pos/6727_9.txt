I realized a few days ago that the producers of this film put a piece of words in his title. This film is not primarily about the act of "riding giants", but especially about the giants of sport, giants RIDING, to change the focus. In my adolescence I lived a block at Wedge, one of the heaviest and best bodysurfing spots in the world. I was in 15-18 foot surf, and I traveled and were hammered by 10 and 12-foot waves on several occasions. This experience is why I am in great surprise with the surfers in this film. The idea that Jeff Clark, in all likelihood, an ordinary mortal, could escape Maverick BY HIMSELF's riding for over a decade is beyond my appreciation. The first rule of safety for any water sport is "Never sail / dive / swim by yourself." He went where healthy people would not be, and he lived to say about it. I would not go there if the water were 75 degrees and all the sharks were gone. <br /> <br /> In the hot water world: The first wave of Jaws waves always makes the skin torn all over my body. These are not just frightening waves, they are uncontrolled waves of bowel evacuation. When we see Laird Hamilton not only have the winds survived 40 to 60 meters (they can hardly write those numbers), but actually I'm working like fun-filled days at Rincon, I'm blowing. There is a dedication and concentration in high-powered bikers that is comparable to anyone in the world. <br /> <br /> This wonderful movie. I gave it a 9 instead of 10 just because it neglects to mention that in the outside world Hamilton / Kalama crew there are big riders with big waves and I think they deserved the mention. Splice in Ken Bradshaw at the surrounding cabins and a 10 is!
