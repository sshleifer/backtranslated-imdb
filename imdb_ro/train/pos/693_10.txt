This is an almost actionless film, watching Jack, an insomnia, as he goes through hallucinations, is visited by dead friends, throws himself out of a building, and often can not tell the reality of hallucinations. Dominic Monaghan, like Jack, is truly credible. Confused and scared but lethargic, and sometimes gently accepting what he sees, we follow him trying to solve what he sees and find a way to sleep. Enter a speaker dog (another hallucination) and the kids suddenly appear in Jack's bedroom and bathroom without any explanation of how they got there (more hallucinations) and you have an interesting, wonderful mind, 43 minutes And the shower scene is enough to get any fan out of the Dom coming for more.
