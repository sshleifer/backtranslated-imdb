If Arthur Askey's thoughts overturn you, do not worry, yet you can watch and love The Train Ghost, just as wonderful Back Room Boy, is a movie that's just too good to be submerged by just one performance, and that of the main actor. Personally, I love Askey, maybe it's because I'm going to his world rather than waiting for him to enter into me, which is a mistake too many people do. The ghost trail is so powerful that you could not follow it without being amazed by the deep and dark world it has transported to you, immersing it in a way that cheap and cheerful snowmobiles managed to be during early despair '40 and it's a movie that I would imagine few people have ever seen only once. The distribution is exceptionally good, maybe Linden Travers sees it a little thick, but against the backdrop of a solitary station during the war, she could not play with a madman and not stand out. The sad passage of the wonderful Carole Lynne earlier this year broke the last link I had with this incredible movie and is really true in the past, but we were waiting patiently for us to push the game.
