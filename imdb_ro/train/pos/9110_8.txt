You know? Our spirit is based on that revolution, it's asleep ... I can explain, I think! Well ... Until April 25, 1974, our freedom was limited, we did not have the freedom of speech, but when we came to the revolution, it seems that the Portuguese people lost their opinion, we do not use our freedom of speech! This is a consequence of the revolution! I think it's clear! ... About the movie ... I think she has some mistakes about the action of a certain character, but the way I use it to watch Portuguese movies is pretty good !! I really like!
