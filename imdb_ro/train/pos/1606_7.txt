"Adult film" is a rare thing these days, but Moonstruck does it well, and it's still a better film than the average, aging well. Although comic moments aim less than the rest, the film has a wonderful specialty (the Italians in Brooklyn) that is not used to change characters or viewers. (that is, Mobsters never comes to conclusion, it does not become grotesque as the Greek wedding My Big Fat) The secondary lines of the story are economically said with short scenes that allow a break from the main thread. These are the scenes that are now missing in contemporary films, where their immediate value can not be impressed by producers and seniors. I miss these scenes. They are also older characters. The film has an easy, quiet way to a conclusion. There is not a badly written scene, now included, to make some spy directors relax. Cage and Cher are doing very nice work. Moonstruck invokes old school, ethnicity, New York work, just like Marty, except that Moonstruck is less sanctifying.
