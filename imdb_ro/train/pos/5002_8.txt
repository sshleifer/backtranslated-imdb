I was privileged to see some of the original versions of Aardman's UK show. It has always been fun and always funny. None of the charm was lost in translation - it's just as fresh as the people interviewed - if part of it is written or not, as it is rumored, it's beside the subject. It's always fun. Aardman's animations show a great imagination in the characters used for each voice, the aspect they probably love most about his show and concept (the pande's hostility, the porcupines discussing the fears of needles, the monkey painting). The rules really increase you too, like Maryland's horses and donkeys, most of all married couples (parrots, insects and cats to name a few) and the character expressed by the children and even got to dig the ferret! Monday finally becomes a day to expect.
