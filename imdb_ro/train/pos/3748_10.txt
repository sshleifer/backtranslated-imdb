I have watched many times and I'm going to buy the full features. I like the whole comedy of Jason Steele. It is very different and unique and it is very pleasant. I like indie movies and that's great. The plot is weird, but very funny. This short movie is about a spatula called Edward. The order of events is a little mixed, making this movie very interesting to watch. At first, you see Edward struggling with the spoons, but then he turns his attention earlier in his life. This is a bad movie, but of course it's still great. We recommend watching this movie at www.spatulamadness.com or www.filmcow.com. It's very funny. Humor may not fit with everyone's taste, but anyway he looks. It will take just 16 minutes of your time and is free of charge. Go WATCH SPATULA MADNESS!
