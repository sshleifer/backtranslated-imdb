I saw this movie independently when it was in Philadelphia and it was a pleasant surprise. I left the theater with a smile on my face. One of the things that made him so funny was that he relied on a real story - hilarious! It also has high value actors in it. Mindy Sterling is in it and is very good. I loved her in Austin Powers. Howard Hesseman is also wonderful. I remember the class boss. I'm sick of all the dark movies that are being kept. This is fun and light, and I can follow it with my family and can not be embarrassed. I keep checking if it comes to DVD. I'm going to buy it for sure.
