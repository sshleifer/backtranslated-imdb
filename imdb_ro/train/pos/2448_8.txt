Yes, it's upside down, yes, it's a little cliché and yes, Constance Marie is a totally babe and worthy to see again and again! Banknotes and gags could become old and repetitive after a while, but the show is still fun to look at. Since it is a family show humor is clipped down and writers have incorporated family values ​​and ideals between gags. George Lopez is funny. Do not take it seriously and the show is a winner. I'm sure he did not want his character to be serious or a virtuoso. His outbursts and shouts of joy are hilarious ... I have to say that a big, dark and bitter place is Benny. I hate the character ... so much so that whenever it takes more than 30 seconds, I stop the TV, so I do not have to hear it. There is nothing fun about her dialogue or her jokes. As a mother, she must be the worst there and I'm just shocked and surprised that George, as a character, would support a person so deplorable for so long. Even when I checked out Benny's view, I think of myself: seeing it's much better than looking at the Bill Engvall show. Now it's a bad sitcom ...
