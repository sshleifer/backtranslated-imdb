Often we see movies about unwanted things happening in politics, but I still recommend "City Hall". In a role he was born to play, Al Pacino plays the role of mayor of New York, who has to deal with the shooting of a boy. But it seems that nothing he does will have any effect. In this film, the characters are as noisy as we would have expected from someone involved in a political scandal. No matter how much you trust any given politician, you can have doubts after watching this movie. I understand that I can not call a specific example of something similar to what this movie describes, but that's not the point. If we had the idealistic ideas of the top, this film scarpines such ideas. I certainly encourage you to see. Also starring John Cusack, Bridget Fonda, Danny Aiello, Anthony Franciosa and David Paymer.
