I like pretty much this episode, Ruth Gordon is good if it's not a little weird as always. As has been said, music is very good and has a mood that does not exist in all episodes. But there is a big hole of plot, so wide that you can drive a fleet of trucks through it. It is found that the light does not work in the vault. Do not you think the very intelligent Columbo or the rest of the police would have thought to check if the bulb was working? You would think that in a short order the bulb was unscrewed and so found the note. Granted this is fiction TV, and different holes will always be found, but this seems too bright. It really does not make Columbo to be the hidden genius when the light does not work, but the "death bed" testimony continues to be unfounded, apparently for days.
