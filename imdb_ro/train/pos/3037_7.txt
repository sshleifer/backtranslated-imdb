"MacArthur" begins and ends at the Hudson West Point American Military Academy, from General Douglas MacArthur, Gregory Peck, Alma Mata. We see that a 82-year-old, Gen.MacArthur, gives the opening speech at the graduation class in 1962 what honor it is to serve his country. The film then makes a retrospective of nearly two hours on the generous and controversial career of General MacArthur that begins in the darkest hours of the Second World War on Corregidor's assaulted island in the Philippines at the beginning of the spring of 1942. <br /> <br /> He said he would leave the island in Australia before the Japanese army invaded General MacArthur, for the first time in his military career, almost ignored a direct order from his senior president, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dan O 'Herlihy. Feeling that he would leave his people at the greatest hour of need, MacArthur patiently with his wife and young son did what he was told just to haunt him to remember the war . This was the reason, his death of fire or captivity by the Japanese, which led General MacArthur to use all his influence to get the FDR two years later to launch a major invasion of the Philippians instead of the Island Formosa promised the promise both to the Philippine people and to the thousands of American prisoners left behind. That he will come back and return with the power of the army and the American ship to sustain his promise! In the two years until the invasion of the Filipino Indians, General MacArther beat the Japanese forces in South Pafif in a series of brilliant insights struck by the island that isolated and hung hundreds of thousands of Japanese troops in teaching. The general has suffered much less American military loss than any other Allied Commander in the Pacific War! <br /> <br /> It was in the 1950/51 war in Korea that General MacArthur achieved the brightest victory, as well as the most serious military defeat. After overcoming the brilliant and perfectly executed North Korean army with the invading US Marines suffering less than 100 casualties, the inversion of Inchon's rear door or Inchon's left hook, General MacArther feeling invincible, sent the US / UN under its command line, along the Yalu River, China's Red China Communist Party. He said his subordinates were facing the threat of a massive terrorist attack on Communist Chinese troops, General MacArthur, who had just exerted pressure until the attack materialized, cutting the US and the United Nations on ribbons. Unexpected wave after the attack of Chinese red troops forced the US / UN forces to retire in the 1950's Big Bug Out with their lives, leaving all their equipment behind the North Korean border even abandoning the South Korean capital of Seoul ! This proved to be one of the largest military disasters in US history, with US forces losing a record in the Korean War, 1,000 lives on the first day of November. 29/30 1950 Chinese Communist Invasion! Shocked and humiliated in what he allowed, especially due to his own arrogance, MacArthur went offensive not against the advanced Chinese and Nokoreans, but his commander and chief of the president. Harry S. Truman, Ed Flanders, in which he has no spin or courage to do what needs to be done: launching a large-scale invasion of Communist China with nuclear weapons if necessary to prevent troops from overtaking the Korean Peninsula! For Pres. Truman, who had taken a lot of garbage from General MacArthur, where he ran away from his mouth in public, in the way he was badly in the war without leaving everything out as MacArthur wanted, and against the Red Chinese it was last straw! On April 11, 1951, Pres. Truman has reluctantly redeemed General MacArthur as commander of the United States / UN forces in Korea! Pres. Also, the courageous but very unpopular decision that it did not go along with MacArthur's total war strategy prevented a third world war from bursting with the ally of the Soviet-Communist Union of China - who at the time - like the US - has an atomic bomb! Pres. Truman's controversial decision to demolish the very popular general, MacArthur, also cost him his re-election in 1952, with his so low number of votes in the mid-20s that he retired in March of that year in Campania US presidency The attempt was that MacArthur's misfortune was around when the political and military climate in the world changed to lead future wars. Along with the horrors of a nuclear war now, in 1950/51, a reality would have been national suicide, as if Gen. MacArthur, against the Red Chinese, with whom it would be possible to reach a nuclear holocaust, not only the USSR & Red China, but the whole world! It was an important reality of the future war that General MacArthur had never been taught because bombs A and H were not yet invented in West Point. Back in 1962 we can now see that Gen. MacArthur, after completing his West Point speech, had become both an older and wiser soldier, and his retirement from American soldiers, a larger state man in his sense of war and its futility. One thing General MacArthur taught him at an early age, from his general dad civil war Douglas MacArthur Sr, who remained on him all his life, was that a soldier like himself war should be the last - problems between nations. In the sense that the soldiers must fight and die in it. It was a lifetime, with the emergence of the nuclear era, that General MacArthur realized how well and wisely his father, the winner of a Congressional Honor Medal, as he himself was, really!
