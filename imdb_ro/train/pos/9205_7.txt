It grew on me. I like the music of R.D. Burman, and despite the crumbling elements of the story, I found many things to move while I continued watching the movie. The brother-sister plot line is strong, I thought; there are also several mandatory issues such as barracks, a crime story, etc., which distract attention. (Although it is not unhappy from a certain point of view.) Also, the translation into English is certainly by someone for whom it was a little stretched and as soon as possible, thank you for doing so, a. <br /> <Like many of the Bollywood movies I've seen, it's melodramatic and opera-like, including a song first sung by a little boy to cheer her sister abused and unhappy, and then the same song sings 12 or so many years later by the man who traveled to Kathmandu trying to come back with this grown-up and disturbing girl (she was told that her brother and mother died), stroking the pain with drugs. /> A great thing about this 1971 film is that it refers to the hippie movement that has brought a horde of seekers to India from the Indian point of view, who sees them as people driven in India through spiritual hunger by gaps their own societies, but still in India, living only for the pleasures of the moment. Hippie drug scales and dances are really wonderful and accurate in their tone (they are old enough to remember) and I feel pretty sure that the masses of young white young white people are real hippies, as I remember hearing about the kids on the east caravan getting this kind of work in Bollywood. (It's not about Hare Krishna's current movement, although the hippies of the movie are singing a Krishna / Rama song, as well as a group of real Indian devotees, unrelated to hippies, in the opening scene of the movie.) <br /> <br /> Virginia
