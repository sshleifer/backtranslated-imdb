Watching "Impulse" is a very satisfying experience. Unpredictable films are such a rarity, when it comes as "Impulse," is something to embrace. The script is logical and extremely creative. Meg Tilly, Tim Matheson, Hume Cronyn and Bill Paxton perform credibly. This could have been interpreted as a zombie movie, but "Impulse" is far superior to any boring "zombie," and originality shines in almost every scene. You have the feeling that this could have happened, even if the script is pure fiction. From opening "grabber" to running credits, you'll be fascinated. Very fun and definitely recommended. - MERK
