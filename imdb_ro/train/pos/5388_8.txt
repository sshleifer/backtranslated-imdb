I saw this movie yesterday on Turner and I could not keep looking until it was over, even if we could guess what would happen. Farrell was great in her role, and everyone else did a super job. Some of them seemed to stretch the boundaries, but in all, I liked it! If you have the chance to see it, please! In fact, I cried in some scenes, but then I think if you are a mother, you would be. Loretta is beautiful and I was just amazed by the idea of ​​being their crazy mother there, it seemed before her time. I say, See if you can, and do not listen to criticism. As I say, I laughed, I cried! I liked very much!
