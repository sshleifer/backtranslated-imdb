Just like the Tarzan Man of Waters (1932), just more. There are more things, more animals, more diverse African tribes, and scenes that must be thought, if they were fine with three or four lei, forty would be better. Tarzan struggles with crocodiles, the crocodile car turns in the water like a bolt, around and around it, the jaws clogged. Tarzan can kill him with an ubiquitous knife, if the Saurian blows up he will stop. Tarzan kills Lei and rhinoceros and an increasing number of animals. His friends are real chimps, people wearing bigger monkeys and elephants. In fact, they use Indian elephants much more friendly and trainable than those in Africa, with ears attached to their heads. The human story: Another white man, worse than the rest, shows along with Holt to go after the ivory cemetery ivory. Tarzan will not show them the way, so the bad guy shoots an elephant so he can follow him on the deathbed. Tarzan intervenes and the bad guy shoots him, but of course he survives and returns to save Jane. Everyone dies, Holt and the bad guy and every one of their "boys". People are consuming, especially Africans, and there does not seem to be a great distinction between black peoples who die because they work for white travelers traveling through the taboo country and those black brothers who kill them. This must be the last Tarzan movie before Hays Code makes Jane wear more clothes. There are a number of underwater scenes in which Jane swims nude, and although the light flicker the movement and noises are very appealing. It turns out that one of Weismuller's friends in the Olympic swimming team made nude scenes and not Maureen O'Sullivan. She, however, moves through the film wearing the same type of Weismuller loom wearing (plus a bikini peak), showing a wonderful look at the thigh and hip. They still do not need to talk much. They sleep together and sleep with cool animals and stay away from cities. No wonder they are happy.
