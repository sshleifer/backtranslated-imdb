This image appeared in 1975 and was the second series of the three parts of Sheriff Buford Pusser's life. Bo Svenson takes on the role of Sheriff Buford Pusser, and Luke Askew plays Mobster Pinky Dobson. The last one I saw on Sheriff Pusser was placed in a hospital bed after him and his wife, who was killed in an ambush Sunday morning. After Pusser recovers, he goes after the men who killed his wife. It is Pusser able to complete the vengeance he has or after the mafia tries to get him out before he succeeds. The only thing that bothers me about this image is that it was a true story. How could you go to a city with such crimes and yet do nothing. Since she was not a true actress in this picture, I can not give him ten zebra stars, but I can give him 8
