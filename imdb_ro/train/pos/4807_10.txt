I really thought this movie was superb. Not only is history correct, but the style is sumptuous and yet intimate. I was a fan of Emily Blunt's portrayal of Victoria and how she kept her spirit, even if she was forced into virtual exile in her youth. Blunt describes the charismatic and sometimes dogmatic manner that Vicotria has become famous (perhaps infamous). The romantic elements of the movie are so authentic and delicate that by the end of the movie you really understand why Vicotria chose to live the rest of the days in mourning by Albert. The technical aspects of the film are worth noting. I appreciate the beautiful score, which moves quite wonderfully, along with the dramatic story movement. I also considered that cinema is remarkable, some scenes leaving me quite breathing because of the lushness and splendor that she describes. There were so few movies this year as beautiful and delicate as this movie and reported as one of the best in 2009!
