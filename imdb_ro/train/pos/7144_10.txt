I saw the film Holes and say it must be the best movie all year round. Displays the child all over the world. I mean who would come up with the idea of ​​having frightened boys to cut holes like their punishment? Louis Sachar is the one who. Although the film was different from the book, it was still very good. For example, Caveman / Stanley was supposed to be the biggest one there. Weight wise and height, but ZigZag / Ricky was taller and Ardit / Theodore was bigger. Also, X-Ray / Rex was supposed to be one of the youngest boys, but it was not. The only thing I did not like the movie was that the flashbacks were pretty persuasive and long. I would have seen the present rather than the past, but that's just my opinion. I especially like the boys' work. Like Squid / Alan that was played by Jake M.Smith was supposed to be a moody and tough child. Jake M.Smith did exactly that and did a great job just like most of the actors in the Holes. So, I would say if you have not seen Holes yet, then you should definitely see it when it comes out again or you will lose all the fun.
