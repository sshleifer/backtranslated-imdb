My wife, Kate and I have absolutely loved the series and can not wait for the next one (hopefully there is a sequel!). I would love to know what the catchy song is and who wrote it, maybe because I'm "old and gray" and still more interested in life :-). If someone has the complete lyrics, please send them. Of course, a major reason why my wife and I liked it so much was that we were 75 years old and we retired, but still very intellectually active. It's great to see a show that highlights the contribution to society, which can still be done by the elderly with great skills and experience. The aspect of human interest that shows the interactions of the characters and the youngest around them is an important part of the show. This series is extremely fun and very sophisticated, like some of the other favorites, "Spooks" and "Hustle".
