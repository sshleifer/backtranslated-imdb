Dear good ! Buttgereit's masterpiece is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Closer to the movies of Peter Greenaway and Jean-Luc Godard, he is really disturbing, but not frightening like Necromantis. All the little stories have a profound philosophical interest, and direction is totally inventive despite the lack of money (see sketch of the "bridge"). Highly recommended!
