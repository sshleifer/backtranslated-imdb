Thomas Ince has always had a talent to bring to life simple family stories with fullness and flair. "Italian" is such a movie. Strong action, especially by George Beban, the father of child silent actor George Beban, Jr., and the wonderful sets present a realistic feeling of New York immigrant dwellings. These give this 1915 film an unusual authenticity in the features of this era. The film begins with the modern day, and a man (George Beban in modern clothes) reads a story about an Italian immigrant and then goes on a story with George playing the immigrant. He raises enough money to bring his fiance from Italy to America, marries her and has a son with her. But the times are tough and the family is struggling to survive. I woke up wondering why my mother had not breastfed her baby and avoided complications with a dirty formula, but well, even the Former Dream Factory imposed a fair political behavior for women in 1915! <br /> <br /> The best stage scene is when Beban has the chance to take revenge on a crime boss who put him in jail inappropriately, and at the last minute decides against his planned action plan. Very neat. I loved the effect of the curtain, it was great. Great use of lighting in this movie. Give the "Italian" a 8 out of 10.
