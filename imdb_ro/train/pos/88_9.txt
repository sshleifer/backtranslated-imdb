This was one of the best movies I've ever seen. The film refers to real life and how medicines can play a major role. Although this movie seems to be produced from a low budget, I realized it was very interesting to watch. Some may not like the story and say the script is missing. However, when a person gets so deep in drugs as these characters, there is no direction is life. I think this film is an accurate representation of what might happen to a person if they face extreme temptations. Most distributions are newcomers in the industry. However, they all pulled it very well. Everyone seemed to do their job well and get involved properly. I think this movie could be a good tool to use when dealing with a person or a loved one who is involved in drugs and seems to be spiraling without control. This movie could only scare them enough to change their ways.
