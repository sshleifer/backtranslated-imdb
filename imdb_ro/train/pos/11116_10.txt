"The Godfather," "Citizen Kane," "Star Wars," "Goodfellas" None of the above compares to the complex shine of the Sopranos. Each character has layers on absolute, full and total three-dimensional verticality layers. He cares about Tony Soprano wholeheartedly, despite the fact that the simplest model of evil or good is bad. Soprano is the most challenging, complicated and fascinating protagonist ever created at this point in history. If you are keen to be clearly challenged as a spectator and to be constantly changed in terms of entertainment feelings, watch the "Sopranos". I advise anyone to sit down and watch the first episode of Season 1 and do not want to continue with the series. Each season is completely brilliant in its own way. DVDs are essential for collecting any **** of 4
