"Pandora's Clock" is a suspense / thriller that fits into a cross between a virus movie and a disastrous film. This film, which broadcast NBC in two parts in its debut that was presented in 1996, is about an airplane flight that gets infected with a virus when one of the passengers happens to have worn this disease. The US government is debating whether the plane should be destroyed or not, while the pilot (Richard Dean Anderson) and a virus expert (Daphne Zuniga) are trying to identify something to avoid disaster. I'm not a big fan of TV movies and ministeries, but I liked Pandora's Clock. It's a walk. Jane Leeves ("Frasier" TV), Robert Loggia and Edward Herrmann (as president) also play. *** (out of four)
