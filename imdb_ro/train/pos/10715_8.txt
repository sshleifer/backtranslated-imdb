Teresa Pavlinek was a popular member of the Toronto Second City show. He has made numerous spots and advertisements here in Canada. Finally, somebody makes sense to create a show for her. The case seems pretty good. I've tracked the pilot several times now and I still find it refreshing. Although I do not know why the show is listed as "The Jane Show 2004." (I may be wrong) But to my knowledge, the show was conceptualized in 2005 and appeared at Global TV in Canada in early 2006. It is a fresh idea and hopefully does well. Too bad that this could not be associated with Corner Gas. Now I know that Corner gas is on CTV, but the two shows would be pieces of company.
