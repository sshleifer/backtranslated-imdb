Anton Newcombe makes the film and is the main subject. Watching him sing a song if not an entire album showed him quickly that the guy is a real talent. He thinks he is God, but he is so prolific and interesting. DW are not really interesting in musical comparison or otherwise. - Hey, do you have a driving license? , Anton tells the cameraman: "Well, let this guitar pawn!" Use a lot of archive / home video. Great to see the rock documents still made. A cool doc about the creative process. If you like this, visit Nirvana Live! This evening! Sold! on DVD. A good Anton experience is this movie. 8 out of 10
