Bill and Ted's fake journey is probably the most excellent movie I've ever watched. Although the acting and landscape, etc., is poor, who cares. The story line is brilliant, and the jokes and words that come are excellent, the ideas are also great. I recommend anyone to see this classic. The best part is obviously when I die "melvin", I was cracked for 10 minutes and missed the next part of the film. This is much better than the first, which was great. Perhaps the funniest movie of all time !!!!! I think the best parts of the movie are when Bill and Ted cry out and play solo guitar, he was hilarious. Rock on Bill, Ted and Eddie Van Halen, bring a third movie!
