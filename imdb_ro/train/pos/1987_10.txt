The movie was great! I can not get over the songs. I think I'm too old for musicians, but this movie deserves credit here, boys! My favorite favorite was Jack Wild. I, being an amateur of the British actor, can not stop me from all the young people who look fresh. I never knew that when Jack made that movie, he was sixteen! He looks like an eleven-year-old man. It's short, that helps. Try to publish your answers, collegiate posters, so I can explain your experiences. Oh, and Oliver Reed, that guy, Bill Sikes, I think drones are very familiar. Do you have any idea where he played before? If so, post it, I really want to know.
