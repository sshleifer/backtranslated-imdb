Deathtrap is not a whisper. It's who he's gonna do to who first. It's so hard to describe this movie without giving anything, so I will not mention anything about the plot anymore. As for the action, Crise Reeves is the greatest role of Clifford, a young writer. You will really see the gamut in his action skills in this movie from the "expiration of cheeseburgers" to scary straight. Clifford is so hard to play, and in stage production of this I've never seen Clifford on both ends of the spectrum. The actor plays it like a homicide puppy or maniac. Reeves is the only person I've ever seen that has the best character. As for Michael Caine, he ... ... is fine that Michael Caine. One of the best actors in the last 50 years and in this movie as good as he ever was.
