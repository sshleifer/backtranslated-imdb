......... and you will get Chori Chori Chupke Chupke. Do not get me wrong, this movie is much less explicit (or not) than Pretty Woman, but it was a new topic for Bollywood. The subject has been accepted but is far from Jism, Murder and Julie. To tell you the truth, the subject is presented in a very clean way. But the plot has the number of clich√©s. The beginning of the film is presented in a very "filmi" way. There are very small holes. The movie rises once Rani has a spontaneous abortion in which you feel you are watching something other than a typical movie. Otherwise, the entire family sequence felt overwhelmed at first. The act could not have been better. Salman Khan sometimes impresses and sometimes leaves you down. Here he gave one of the best shows. In addition, his role is written so well that he applauds each time he solves a problem. Rani Mukherjee was appropriate. Throughout the movie, you feel the most for her character, but it is shaded by Preity Zinta. Preity Zinta is the perfect picture. Of the three, he gives everyone to fight for their money. It is surprising how it can be as convincing when innocent. And believe me, Madhubala is far from your face next door. This role is one of the reasons why I evaluate them. The support is that the family you see in HAHK, where they have no meaning for the plot, but found them tolerable here. The songs are pretty pretty. The title song is the most favorite of them, along with Dil Tera Mera Dil (Hearts). Mehndi Mehndi (Henna) and Dekhne Walon Ne (Look at the vision of the world) are two tunes that perfectly match the movie. Preity's cabaret number, Diwani Diwani (Crazy), could have been reduced while no. 1 Punjabi went into boredom, although he had a good dance. Otherwise, the movie definitely deserves a watch.
