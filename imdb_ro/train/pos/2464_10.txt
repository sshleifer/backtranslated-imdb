One of the best cinematic dramas I've ever seen. We do a lot of action in the church and this is one that can be used as a resource that highlights all the good things that actors can do in their work. I strongly recommend this, especially for those who have an interest in acting as a "must see". There are several scenes of notes. For one, the scene of the cemetery when Hamlet meets Yorick (everyone knows about that scene going to elementary school only) and the interaction with the skull was extremely well done. The logic used in this scene was extraordinary-I assume a testament to Shakespeare more than anything else. For a second, I enjoyed the scene in which Hamlet, Horatio and the character played by Robin Williams talked about the next duel.
