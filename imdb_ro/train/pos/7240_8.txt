When I found this movie in my local video, I expected it to be another American vampire movie the same way in "The Lost Boys" (1987). To my surprise, "To Die For" is a very good movie. sometimes, but there are enough sets of pieces and elegant surprises to satisfy vampire enthusiasts. This is a perfect blend of romance and horror and is sometimes surprisingly tough. Highly recommended.
