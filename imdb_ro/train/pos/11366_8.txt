A gorgeous and compelling drama about the hunt for the Russian serial killer Andrea Chikatilo. The magnificent spectacle of Stephen Rea, the forensic scientist responsible for the investigation, which finds the biggest obstacle to progress, is the Russian government, especially the old members of the Communist Party wishing to maintain a closed society. /> The film has a fundamental theme about the decline of communist society, and the progress in hunting for the killer is reflected in the progress of the social and political changes in Russia, which is subtle. There is a conflict of old ways and new ways, and these are represented by the two views of Rea superior (played by Donald Sutherland) and by Rea himself. They are initially polarized, with Sutherland "tall" in the system looking down, and Rea "down" on the earth, looking up. However, they have a common cause? to catch the serial killer. Throughout the movie, the relationship between these two develops, and the tension slows gradually until at the end of the movie Rea and Sutherland and Rea and Sutherland have a mutual respect to each other, the killer is caught and Glasnost comes symbolically. Excellent script. More credits come to Sutherland's performance, which is superb and sympathetic, Jeffrey DeMunn as the killer we despise but I do not hate him, and Max Von Sydow, who is convincingly the humble psychologist who risks his reputation for helping .
