No message. No symbolism. There are no dark underground. Just a wonderful melange of music, nostalgia and fun of people who obviously had the opportunity to do it. It is a refreshing antidote for some of the pretentious garbage that has been founded by studios. Of course NEVER with the incomparable Judi Dench is worth looking. Cleo Laine's brilliant jazz song is a bonus. This lady is in the same league as Ella late. This happens on my film shelf to be retired anytime I feel the need for a warm experience and a good, heart-filled handset. Just a great movie!
