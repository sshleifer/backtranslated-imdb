A masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Thus, it is possible, not for everyone. The camera, acting, direction, and everything else is unique, original, superb in every way - and very different from the trash we are accustomed to getting. <br /> <br /> Summer Phoenix creates a deep, credible and intriguing Esther Kahn. Like all the other things in this movie, her act is unique - it's completely my own - neither "British" nor "American" nor anything I've ever seen. There is something interesting about it. Long, uninterrupted, natural photos are wonderful, reminding us that we have become too accustomed to some restricted shooting and editing modes.
