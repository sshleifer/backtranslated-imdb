As a disclaimer, I've seen the movie 5-6 times in the last 15 years and I've only seen music this week. This allowed me to judge the movie without being affected by what was or was not in the music (however, I was fooled when I looked at the music :)) I think Michael Douglas worked pretty well in that role, along with Kasey. I think the movie "Let me dance for you" is one of the best parts of the movie, a useful addition to music. Dancers and singing in the movie are far superior to the musical, as well as the one that is at least 10 times bigger (easier to make in the movie, of course). Decorations, lighting, dancing and singing are also much better in the movie, which should be expected and really has been delivered. <br /> <br /> Songs that were in common with musicals are better done in the film, the new ones are pretty good, and the whole movie offers more than musical in my opinion, especially when compared to musical that has few decors. One of the bad points of the film is the obvious cuts between singers and singers singing for some of the characters, but their dance is impeccable and the end product was more enjoyable than music
