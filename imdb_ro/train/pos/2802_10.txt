As someone who has never been in sport, it seems to me that it would be hard for me to enter football (or as we inexplicably call the Americans, football) - "Bend It Like Beckham." But I have to say it was a great movie! Anglo-Indian Jesminder Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) and his WASP friend Juliette Paxton (Keira Knightley) love to play football (yes, I will say British and international) and I love football player David Beckham. But Jesminder's traditional Jesuit parents do not agree (her mother offers a really defeated football description at the beginning of the film). Okay, maybe it was kind of a clich√© in this sense, but you have to love this movie! And if, like me, you go to this movie without knowing the definition of "bending" in football ... do not worry, the movie explains it (I have never heard of David Beckham before this movie). And we all know that Keira Knightley hit her big: a few months after "BILB" went out to the United States, she starred in "The Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl."
