This was a very challenging film, especially for 1973. At the time, he was actually a huge box office success. After 1970, it seemed to be forgotten, but its central messages were too important to disappear completely. It was actually at least fifteen years before its time ... no one ever heard about the "greenhouse effect" before 1985, the controversial issue of euthanasia was rarely increased. The sets and special effects might seem a bit overpriced, but the big money for SF movies represented a bet at that time. If you look closely, you will see that it makes sense. This is a message film, not for star zonked warrior fans who can not stand by a minute of stimulating thought, unless it contains a million dollars worth of explosions. It was also Hestons's last good film, the end of his famous distal philosophy. After that, all episodes of disaster were scary, and the budget crowd thanked. It may not be the funniest two-hour movie ever made and the end could be creepy and depressing, but it's hard to find any courageous filmmaker to handle a subject like this one.
