I just saw the Hot Millions on TCM and I forgot this gem. Ustinov creates an intelligent and divisive plot that makes him cleverly go from the connector to the clever one ... Well, you will see. Maggie Smith is perfect as a secretary / neighbor who has a difficult time holding a job but has a warm and vibrant personality that shines in this image. It creates a beautiful portrayal of a warm, full of spirit and real person, who in the long run ... and ... Moldovan and Newhart, as top executives, consider the challenge of doing what might be royal roles and make them come out in a comic life of their own. <br /> <br /> Robert Morley and Ceasar Romero are just a pleasure to see and know at least in Romero's case, Ustinov extends a helping hand. <br /> <br /> This movie is meant to be a blow back to the growing computer age and it is the problems for man con man or man for that matter, but in fact the characters are so engaging and so entertaining to look at it, the plot of the computer is almost lost ... I say almost. <br /> <br /> Leave your usual expectations of modern comedy and look for the best performances and friendly, forgiving and profoundly plotting plotting in this image.
