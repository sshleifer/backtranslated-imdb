girlfight uses a well-known formula as someone pointed out, however, I have seen a lot of movies that do not do that well or are not credible. I think it's ultimately easier for a woman to empathize with her character and thus feel more touched by the movie. the film is both mentally and physically encouraging even if your life and environment are completely different and I think the viewer can win a lot by seeing this. although it took me 5 years to start boxing and sport in general, this is the film that sparked me so the plot is familiar / common. actors are good. but the thoughts that can spark are what makes it above average in my opinion. has made a big impression on me and I know I'm not alone.
