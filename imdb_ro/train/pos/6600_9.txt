I'll keep this short and sweet review ... I saw the trailer for that, and I thought I was giving it a whirl in five minutes, and my initial thoughts were, "What the hell is this?" But, after 10 minutes, I was hooked up and after twenty, I got my swamp on the floor. This film is a wonderful example of how different a film can be and it is also French. This movie is a high-quality artwork wrapped in a futuristic, noir motion pack, the motion movement is very intelligent, and the black-and-white animation style that does not have gray, though at first it did not do it for me. the end of the movie and I woke up wishing that every movie was done like that. I think that my opinion was helped by the great doubt that it would have been very easy to destroy it if so many respected actors had not landed because many actors do not give any sensation to the characters (Just watch any legendary movie in Hong Kong in english to see the perfect example) i gave 9, although i gave it an extra 2 because of how fresh and new everything it feels ....
