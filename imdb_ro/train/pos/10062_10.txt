Wow. What a wonderful movie. The script is almost perfect, it seems that this is the only one written by Minglun Wei, I hope he has more stories in it. The act is sublime. Quitting Zhou as Doggie was amazing - very natural talent, and Xu Zhu was a delight - very credible as the old traditionalist. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was very effective, guiding without being overwhelming. <br /> <br /> If only such films were made in either Hollywood or Hong Kong - a friendly, good, well-written, well-guided, almost perfect gem.
