This show is weird! jokes are original, God and I love Eric and Kelso! Yeah, I know what they say after the 8th season is no longer funny because Eric and Kelso are no longer in the show and Randy is a real dumbass. Randy is, compared to Eric and Kelso. <br /> <br /> You can not get the funniest characters and switch em with "I'm a cool guy" type guy (Randy). this is not his fault anyway, but writers are trying to keep the 8th funny season, it's still not, not as much as the previous seasons, but well. 360's are wonderful, the circle, red is a real type of abused father mind :) and the kitten is always half tall. Hyde is always trying to cool, he has his moments. the least favored characters are Jackie and Donna. are cool, but not without Kelso and Eric. Dumbass!
