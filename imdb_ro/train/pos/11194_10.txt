Wrong scenario, bad direction, over peak performance, broken dialogue. What can you ask for? For laughing, it just is not better than that. Zadora's ban with the rattlesnake scenes he finds for a hilarious parody of the Hollywood machine. Almost as fun as Spinal Tap, even if it was not clearly intended as such. Do not miss Ray Liotta's debut film, "Looks like it's a penis."
