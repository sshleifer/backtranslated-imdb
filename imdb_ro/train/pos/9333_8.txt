After lived in Ontario my entire life, in the same city that Marlene Moore grew up, I heard stories about her from my parents, my grandparents and my family members. So when I found out that they were going to shoot a movie about her and that the start would be shot on my street and her house pretty close to me, I was excited. If you read the book Rock Bye Baby, which is about Marlene Moore, you have an image quite different from her as a person, she was considered strangely beautiful by people who really had a chance to know her except her own family who abused her frequently as a child except one of her brothers. Also, if you live in my area and you are smart enough to listen to those around you who knew it from school, you would find out that she was really hurt before she was set up in an institution, has always been defensive and it would seem that a lack of desire to learn in a school environment was in fact embarrassed by the fact that he failed to do so. Marlene does not deserve the life she received, with the lack of help she had to receive desperately. The government and the people around her helped more to die by not trying to understand her needs and why she did what she did. I find myself still angry that she was put in prison for self-defense by a man who tried to rape her. As her brother once said, "They did not know what to do with her, so they shut her up and killed her." I believe in it with all my heart. Relax in peace, Marlene, you deserve that much.
