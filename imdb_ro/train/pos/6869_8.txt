This movie may seem dated today, but remember that it was made in 1974 - before Saturday Night Live, before Howard Stern, back when George Carlin just passed beyond Hippie Dippie Weatherman and in satirical humor. This film is everyone's grandfather. Enjoy its historical significance as well as its strong entertainment value.
