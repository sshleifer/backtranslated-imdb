Since the day I saw this movie when it came out in 1981, it was one of my favorite favorites. The blurb I wrote for Amazon is below and I'm just delighted that it will eventually appear on DVD on 10/17/06 - the 25th anniversary of the movie. The last credit in this film explains his appeal - "Thank you to the Manhattan people for the island whose film was filmed." A charming and charming romantic comedy is a New York story written by Peter Bogdanovich (a native) who can identify each location (West 12th Street, Ansonia, the old FAO Schwartz, Plaza, Roxy, Chez Brigitte, and City Limits, which was a country and western club). One has the impression that the whole distribution has also clicked on the screen as it does, and this privacy is clearly communicated. I laughed, I cried, it was better than CATS. Not only an ode for Dorothy Stratten, she was also the last appearance of Audrey Hepburn (she had a cameo after this film), and her inner beauty is seen on the screen. Buy it, make a big cloth of popcorn and push with someone you like.
