"The Lady in Question (1999)" by Gene Wilder is a well-drained drama that reminds me of the old black-and-white series Raymond Burr Perry Mason. Both Perry and Cash have guessed me all the way. There were many suspects who had a motive for murder, but I had no idea what character they were. Gene Wilder has a particularly charming spirit about him, even in his facial expressions and in the vocal inflections that make him perfect for the part. The portions of the film that played the actors were very good. I am sure this is an additional challenge for the distribution to be withdrawn. I'm not surprised to see that he made part of the script. Even his singing was a delight. He likes this role more than his former role as "The Frankenstein Young" and "Willy Wonka". I hope A & E will continue this series. They should say something like "A & E Gene Wilder Mysteries." Music matches the period. I liked live live combo and swing songs. I was a little clear from the beginning if I saw a retrospective or if the action took place during that period. And I do not agree that inclusion of profanity is necessary for the flow of the scenario. For me, this always distracts attention. In general, my wife and I enjoyed this second very well in a well-established start in what we hope will be many others - just like one of the other favorites: Raymond Perry Mason of Burr.
