Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra threw each other as they made this film in the years to come. Brando asked Sinatra for a few lessons to play, but Sinatra (who was already mad at being cast as Nathan Detroit from Skye Masterson) wanted to be the star singer in production and did not want anyone to be good than he is. He told Brando to lose himself, so he would come back to him. Marlon continued to chase the scene in which Sinatra ate cheesecake, so he should have eaten, eaten and eaten. In the following years, Sinatra gave Brando the nickname "Mumbles" or "Mr.Mumbles" because of the way he speaks.
