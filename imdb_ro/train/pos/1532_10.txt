This, like Murder She Wrote, is one of those shows that after a stressful day at school, I sit in front of the TV, and watch. Why? Because I really like it, and it's a shame she's not in the air anymore. Van Dyke Dick is amazing as Dr. Mark Sloan, a detective physician who, along with his son, resolves crimes. He is joined by an extremely unknown but very competent cast, namely his real son, Barry Van Dyke. Victoria Rowell is also good, but I noticed that every series is changing her hairstyle. I also liked Scott Baio and Charlie Schlatter, but I loved Michael Tucci like Norman, and he was puzzled how he suddenly disappeared. This show is so fun, with big stars of customers, it's a bit obvious sometimes, like Colombo, but in each episode, there's always something to chuck about. In conclusion, a large series, with two fingers up and a 10/10. Bethany Cox
