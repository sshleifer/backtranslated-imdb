This great movie failed to score more than 5! Why not! It is a wonderful portrayal of Christ's life without the ruthless sensuality of the Passion of Christ. John Cash has done wonderful things for God, which are amazingly avoided and neglected in the areas where they should matter the most, like our churches. The movie itself lasted less than a month to film, while Johnny felt the strong presence of God guiding him through it. Great credit for all those involved in this overwhelming film sincerely by its fans. At least, Billy Graham's crusade he appreciated it well enough to use it as a first source of education for new Christians. Thanks to Fox for producing it. While Walk the Line showed that it was strange that this man survived alone, an undervalued masterpiece. The people are not canonized by popular vote as this production proves! In conclusion, I think this film is one of the great documentaries of the world, because it is presented sincerely, honestly and with an important testimony of the Christian faith!
