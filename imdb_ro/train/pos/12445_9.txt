I've seen this movie and I have to say I'm very impressed. There are not many movies I like, but I like that. You should see this movie by yourself and comment on it, because this is one of my favorite movies. I'm sorry to see this again. Action fused with a fantastic story. Very impressive. I like Modesty's character. In fact, it is very mystical and mysterious (I like that ^ ^). The bad boy is too beautiful. Well, in fact, this movie is rare in 'movieworld'. I thought about the vote of this film, I thought this should be a very popular film. I think it's wrong. He was ME, who was very impressed with this movie, and I hope I'm not the only one who just takes the cost to watch this movie. See and vote.
