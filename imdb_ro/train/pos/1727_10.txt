Horse Horse is a very clever movie about a very clever and successful escape plan developed by the British POW during the Second World War. It is gorgeously acting with a sense of humor, especially the lines expressed by Aco language Leo Genn. Anthony Steele and David Tomlinson (later George Banks in Mary Poppins) are wonderful as the two heroes. The direction is stretched and moves quickly. Highly recommended.
