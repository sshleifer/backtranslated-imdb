My discovery of cinematography by Jan Svankmajer opened my eyes to a whole tradition of Czech animation, about which Jir√≠ Trnka was a pioneer. His hand is one of the best performing and best performing animation films I have ever seen. A potter wakes up and defends his plant. Then he goes to make a pot. But there comes the huge hand that crashes the pot and asks the potter to make a statue of himself. He throws his hand out, but soon turns around and closes it in a bird cage where he is forced to sculpt a handful of stone. He deals with this, failing exhaustion, but ultimately ends the task. In a wonderful sequence of metacinem, the potter uses a candle to burn the visible puppet ropes that keep him in horror, and he escapes home. He closes and is accidentally killed by his own girlfriend when he falls on his head. This film does not hide the fact that it is a pure animation, unlike the modern films that strive to be realistic?). The hand, for example, is clearly someone's hand in a glove. Everything else is clay. The strings are visible and part of the narrative, making it the precursor of the Strings movie. The atmosphere is frightening: that hand that goes after the little potter has inspired me more fear than many horror films combined. The film is obvious, but it avoids being completely manipulative for its simplicity. is a fable about artistic freedom and tyranny that can not help winning the heart and mind of anyone holding freedom as a natural right.
