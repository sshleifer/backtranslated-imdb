I really enjoy this show, but I first saw the second episode. After seeing the first episode, I could see why people were stopped at the beginning. The humor of the first episode is not the best and is struggling to start the series. However, I still enjoy the mild and humorous attitude of the show. Characters grow much longer after the episode and become genuinely enjoyable characters. As a first episode, it really does not accurately represent the rest of the show, which is really pretty good. The episode is not bad by any means, but as the show advances, it gets better and better, so watch more episodes before passing any judgment on the quality of the show.
