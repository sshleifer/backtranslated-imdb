What a pleasant surprise: a sequel to Disney DTV (Direct to Video), which is actually good. "The Lion King 1 1/2" is a comedy business involving everyone who likes meerkat and warthog, Timon and Pumbaa. Start with them watching the original movie and commenting until Timon complains that "we are not here yet". After fighting over the remote control, Timon and Pumbaa decided to tell the audience "their story". They start the new movie and the ladies begin. <br /> <br /> To be honest, he lost hope in Disney. Most of their direct charge to the video was aggressively horrible, with desperate story lines to cash in on the original. "1 1/2" decides to try something different: tells the original story from a new point of view. Okay, add some things, like where Timon came from and how they met with him and Pumbaa, but it's an interesting concept. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella perfectly recover the bond and friendship that made us love them in the first film. There are also some neat movie parodies (including a scene spoofing simultaneously "The Good, Bad, and Ugly" and "Cool Hand Luke"), and the script is full of memorable funny lines. the distribution is Julie Kavner ("The Simpsons") as Timon's mother, and Jerry Stiller is Max's uncle Timon. Matthew Broderick appears as Simba, and his "teenage" scene reminded me of Ferris Bueller. Everybody is doing well, especially Robert Guillame (is that how you say it). Just as Rafiki, who emanates more and more Yoda - speaks in this movie (Timon commented several times). King 1 1/2 'is a perfect alternative for those who get tired of Shrekification of animation. 10/10
