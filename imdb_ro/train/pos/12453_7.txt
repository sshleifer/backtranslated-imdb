Unfortunately, many consumers who write comments for IMDb have a low budget that is not good. Everything else might need this movie, the budget really is not part of it. Big sets and a lot of special effects would turn it into another Lara Croft movie. What we have here is a step or two better than that. Almost unknown Alexandra Staden is captivating as enigmatic Modesty, and this is crucial for this movie to work. Her little smiles wise and knowing the looks are impressive and you find that you want the room not to face. It makes the work of Nikolai Coaster-Waldau have an extraordinary cerebral interest for her, something that Modesty can exploit. She is capable of removing her rape with a blow and spitting "do not waste any more time". then the storm between his very armed, but suddenly different people. Making a scene like this plausible does not happen by chance. Probably the biggest problem I have with the thin Staden on the railroad, the Modesty game is that it is not very credible for her to go hand in hand with an athletic and muscular type such as Coaster-Waldau and beat him. She is not just a Peta Wilson or a Hilary Swank actress who can make a convincing shot. Coaster-Waldau, left in Staden's hands, seems to have been rough with his younger sister. Because this movie is not a movie action, it is not a big flaw. I hope they will do better if and when they continue.
