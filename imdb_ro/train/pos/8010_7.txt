I previously thought this movie was the worst movie in Muppet. I would now like to withdraw this statement. In my opinion, the smallest MUppet movie was the TV movie It's a BEAUTIFUL BUYER Merry Christmas, it's a wonderful life that was really terrible. MUPPETS TAKE MANHATTAN is nothing special but miles more enjoyable than Christmas MERRY MUPPET. <br /> <br /> The best songs are the song "You can not make any response," the one that Muppet Babies plays and the songs for the big end. As I loved the Muppet Babies TV show, I liked Muppet Babies here (I was told that it was what inspired the Muppet Babies show) MANHATTAN MELODIES himself showed himself as a true showstopper with Muppets on Sesame Street even appear for the wedding. Just as Kermit puts it in the final line: "What better way could I do something?" But I wish that what was between the beginning and the end was a bit more fun. There are some nice Brooke Shields and Gregory Hines and a great succession of dances from Rizzo and Rats (choreography was by chance, great Jim Henson) and the movie is definitely having fun. I have to say that MUPPET MOVIE, GREAT MUPPET CAPER and MUPPET Christmas CAROL are the three MUppet movies defined.
