Although I enjoyed Jim Carrey's latest "The Truman Show," I always thought about his true lies in the physical comedy. That does not mean he's a fantastic, talented actor: those Academy Award winners seem to like them so much, he never had a nomination or a prize (really worth it). Well, any "institution" that designates a cellar such as "Titanic" for 11 Oscars should not be taken seriously. On the review. "The Grinch" is the sweetest, best-of-breed, best-featured, more enjoyable film seasons of "The Nightmare Before Christmas". Both films seem very similar, with their highly stylized sets and the premise that someone is chasing Christmas. Both make their main actors appear to be the villains (one higher than the other), both packing a strong moral lesson and both are truly enjoyable. That until you realize Jack Skellington is a doll, and Grinch is a human being. But a human being who is so incredibly expressive, so fluid in his movements, so perfect, so unreal, that he never gets in the way of the film. He may be hilarious, may be a sad soul, may be upset. He lives in a three-dimensional world where three-dimensional people live. He jokes, laughs, laments, and finally saves Christmas. I liked this movie to bits and can not wait to appear on DVD. This is one of those movies that you will truly enjoy 10, 20 years from now. How endless they come from.
