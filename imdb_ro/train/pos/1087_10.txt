I'm so much loved in this little sweet comedy. Anyone who has ever built or bought a house, or even was lacking in space, will find that there is more than a bunch of truth in the situation of the other Blanding, Melvyn Douglas, and acts as Blandings attorney and the voice of reason. Myrna Loy is also the best she has as a rather frightened but extremely patient wife. But the best performance is Grant's. He is the American man, especially relevant at the time of the film, when the nation was in a situation of lack of housing after the end of the war. The themes are universal, the lack of money, the strain of labor, the fear of infidelity. Yes, it's revolving, but you have to remember that it was a time when the world was recovering from a terrible war and wanted a happy ending. It's still relevant today and I have to take out the poor visits I see in front of a current preference for scary comedies. The appearance of the movie is slick, and there are some great comedy pieces, of course, especially at the beginning. Although some social relevance might have been lost, almost sixty years after its release, it is still a jewel.
