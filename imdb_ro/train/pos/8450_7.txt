Was'nt very bad for Raw's first PPV in 006. But the end was really shocking for all those present and those who were looking at home. FIRST MATCH - RIC FLAIR VS. EDGE W / LITA FOR THE WWE INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP It's not a bad opener, they can play a big game seriously if they have more time to make a fight. Flair wins after DQ after Edge hits him with MITB's briefcase. 3/10 THE SECOND MATCH STRATUS VS. MICKIE JAMES FOR WWE WOMEN CHAMPIONSHIP It's not a bad thing to note that this is the first time these Divas have ever faced the ring together. Mickie goes for a modified Chick Kick, but Trish laughs and hits his own Chick Kick for the victory to keep his title. 3/10 The third round of the H VS. BIG SHOW This match was really good indeed. The entire HHH match focuses on the injured arm of the Big Show, but the Big Show still fights back. Later, HHH manages to overthrow Big Show & Nails a Pedigree for victory. 5/10 FOURTH FOUR - SHELTON BENJAMIN W / MAMA VS. VISCERA {It was a bonus match} Not so bad, it was okay. After Viscera descended, behind the Referee, Benjamin's mother received a bag (which had bricks in it) and killed Viscera on her head three times. Viscera stood up only to be caught by Benjamin to win against the big man. 4/10 <br /> <br /> ALTHOU FOUR - JERRY 'THE KING' LAWLER VS. GREGORY HELMS Boring, slow and careless. Both men did not really make a very good effort. Jerry Lawler wins after a punch for victory. 2/10 <br /> <br /> Sixth MATCH-TORRIE Wilson VS. VICTORIA VS. ASHLEY VS. MARIA VS. CANDICE MICHELLE IN WOMEN'S FIRST WOMAN HAS BEEN MADE TO ME. Ashley {She thinks she's been stripping Candice last time to win the first Gauntlet Women match. 5/10 THE HAND SEMESTER - JOHN CENA VS. CHRIS MASTERS VS. CARLITO VS. SHAWN MICHAELS VS. KANE VS. KURT ANGLE W / DAIVARI IN A ROOM CHANGE FOR WWE CHAMPIONSHIP It was a match of the Cold Remove Room. But nothing will be the last year of the Elimination Room, which was the best. The last three are Masters, Cena & Carlito. Carlito turns his back on the Masters and takes a walk on him to eliminate him. Seconds later, Price becomes a Roll-up on Carlito because the three of them matter to win the Elimination Chamber and keep their WWE title. But his night is not over yet. 7/10 After the match, Vince McMahon comes out and congratulates the Price for his victory. Vince McMahon says his night is still over and says Edge collects Money's money in The Bank as an opportunity to challenge the Prize for the title. Edge goes out with Lita, puts Vince's briefcase and goes to the ring, the price has another match to go here tonight. <br /> <br /> OAM MATCH - JOHN CENA VS. EDGE W / LITA FOR THE WWE CHAMPION {The price that is blocked during the match in the room} is hit immediately by the Edge, Edge then the Spear nail on the Price, goes for coverage and at its Price breaks out. Edge Nail Another Spear & Cover for shocking three count as he beat Price & won the WWE Championship for the first time in his career. 1/10 Thus, last year, the New Year's Revolution was better than this year, but it was still fine. The EC game was also good and the shock of Edge cashing in its MITB opportunity is certainly the most shocking at the PPV show. Generally: I will give it 7/10 & a
