I saw this movie (the English title is "Who's Playing?") At the Montreal International Film Festival in 1980. She then won raves ... and disappeared. A terrible shame. It's brilliant. Sublime, ridiculous, sad and extremely funny. The script is a work of art. 19 years have passed and I have seen only a handful of comedies (or any other genre that matter) that fit its originality.
