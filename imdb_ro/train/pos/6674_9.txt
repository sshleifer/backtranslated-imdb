The first thing I thought after watching "Mystery Men" was how could this movie be so unpopular? I found this movie so adorable and funny that its condition as a bomb defies logic. Well, I hope that in the future it will become a hit and you can count me amongst its fans. Simply, and without too much, this film makes comic books the "Princess Bride" made for fairy tales and "Who Fit Roger Rabbit?" For classical cartoons. This should give you a better idea of ​​the movie tone, then the marketing committee that was unfortunately signed (this is one of those cases like the Iron Giant, where the studio had no idea what he had on his hands). Rent it the next time you're in the mood for something a little wrong. You will no longer listen to BeeGees in the same light again.
