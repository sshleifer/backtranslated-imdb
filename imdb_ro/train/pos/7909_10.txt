When it first came out, my father brought her home - I was amazed by it - It was so different from everything I saw before. I was looking for a specific movie last night and I found again the "Eye of the Mind". The tape is broken and I'm surprised the tape is still working! Although it is not the "Finding Nemo" quality graphics, it is still very good. You should sell it again - it's a landmark for computer animation images. Highly recommended! <br /> <br /> This is: <br /> <br /> "The Eye of the Mind" is a spectacular odyssey through time.
