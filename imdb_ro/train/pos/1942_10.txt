I consider it a huge film shooting. I got sick on the couch and I came out in this movie. Even from the opening to the end I looked with amazement at these great actors, which I have never seen, say a wonderful word. The movie was beautiful. It was exactly what I needed. I hope this message is listened to in connection with any misconceptions written by others. The director has a heart and beats his actors all the way. Thanku to make a movie like this. Only wonderful strange, beautiful beautiful characters that are erroneous and graceful all at once. Perfect. I can not support this without 10 rows in total, so I will continue to say I want more from this director, more than all the actors in this film and more from the writer. I did not want it to end. The end
