I had a chance to see a movie of this movie recently. I think she's gonna be in the theaters in Canada for some time around Mother's Day. If you are in a nearby theater ... GO! It's not a funny movie of sense-good - it's more in the sense of a movie of feeling and thinking. The director does a great job of character development - it leaves you in the heart, mind and hurt of Hagar a little bit. At first, her attitudes and behaviors do not make much sense. When her story unfolds, she becomes a person you can understand. As in life ... understanding brings empathy. I found it pleasing until the end of the movie - especially when she opened her heart to the young man in the barracks near the lake. Hagar's relationship with his two sons is painful - and reflective many of our experiences in this world. Her youngest son, John, who is lively and adventurous, takes the spectator to the edge of the chair - and the kind of raw emotion, so authentic and rare. It's fun to see Ellen Page acting in this movie. She is so different from the young woman she's playing in Juno. She gives me even greater appreciation for her ability to act. If you love her in Juno, you'll love her in Angel The Stone. Of course it's Ellen Burnstyn like Hagar. There is probably no way to express the power to act as strong as the actor's ability to make you forget any other person they have ever played. I never thought about Ellen Burnstyn ever in this movie - I always thought of Hagar. She swept through her character - the hook, the line and the plateau. Kari Skogland's ability to capture this book by one of Canada's most beloved authors is impressive. It shines brilliantly on both the frightening and angelic parts of this complex woman, Hagar - the Angel of Stone.
