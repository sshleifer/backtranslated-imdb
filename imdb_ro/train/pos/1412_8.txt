Why should you explore the fascinating nature documentary "Earth"? How long do you have on earth to explain this to you? Okay, I will not extend my review research to "Earth" to infinity, but I have to be at the bottom of my why is "you have to see". The documentary makes a round trip in-kind on the migration routes on three animal families: a polar female bear and her chicks with the sub-plot of her father's real life have the courage to hunt for food on his isolated path, a whale mother with her baby got a prey for migration and a elephant mother with her little chicks (maybe not so small, they are elephants) who migrate to Africa. Alastair Forthegill & Mark Linfield's directors have done a job "outside this land", also captivating the survival skills of many other animal species, in addition to the magnetic photos of the three protagonists of our family of animals. The cinematographic team qualified by Richard Brooks Burton, Mike Holding, Adam Ravetch and Andrew Shillabeer were animated in the cameras of the wonderful nature and instinctive animal behaviors; not to mention, the animal beasts of the animals were blooming. The "Earth" is also a student who learns about the effect of global warming on animals; the polar bear poet of the dock is the animal boy poster about this consequence. So, colleagues, it's time to travel documentary on a visit to "Earth" today! **** Good
