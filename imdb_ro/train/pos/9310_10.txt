wow, how can I even discuss this movie without tears coming to my eyes? It was certainly the climax of my year - not my life. As if raptors' graphics were not quite amazing, award winning editors continued to use exactly the same movie throughout the movie, even when the background did not really fit the setting of the scene. Wow, what a genius. And while the movie is full of plot holes (for example, a couple of clips from a t-Rex animal where a raptor should be a key moment Pappy finds a torture room, he calls out "Colin Eo girl! ") I will never forget the brilliance of the planet Raptor. Thanks Sci-Fi for another classic.
