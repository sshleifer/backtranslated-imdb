A hit at that time, but now better classified as an Australian cult movie. Humor is widespread, debated and in the final stage where a BBC studio fire extinguishes by urinating him, raw. It contains just about every cliche about the traditional Australian pilgrimage in the "old country" and about every clich√© about those raptors, pinned up all of them, Tory Brits. It would be acceptable to the British, because of its strong cast by well-known actors, and Australians of that generation who can "get" humor. Americans - look. Language and jokes are in the Australian dialect of English and, as such, will be incomprehensible.
