This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I read the book and I liked it, but this movie expands on everything that makes the famous book. The act is fantastic, especially by Jon Voight, who plays Sir, a very bad character. This movie has a certain way of storyline that keeps you constantly caught up to the end where everything is pulled together for a wonderful end. I also like the way this is directed through the intermittent back and forth between modern history and those of Stanley's ancestors. The story was written by Louis Sachar, yes, but it seems that this story is made for the film, and Andrew Davis is doing a good job pointing it. I definitely recommend it to everyone who enjoys good movies.
