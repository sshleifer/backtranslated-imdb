What a fun movie! If you are a Giallo fan, Red Queen Kills 7 Times is a true winner. First of all, it's hard to make mistakes with Barbara Bouchet and Marina Malfatti in the same Giallo. Both are wonderful - especially the unseen invisible Bouchet as a woman tame of guilt, fearing for her life. Red Queen Kills 7 Times killing scenes are particularly cute and have enough blood to make most fans happy. One of the first crimes is unexpected and makes the film a good start. The murderer, The Queen Red, is one of the most criminals and the most exciting criminals I've seen in an Italian film. The sets and fashion of the '70s are great. In fact, all the visuals are interesting with the red queen laughing over the bridge during the night being one of my favorite moments in the movie. The convoluted land has kept me interested over time. Finally, Bruno Nicolai's score may be the best I've heard from the composer. The main theme is so memorable that I have not managed to get it out of my head for two days. The only two problems I've had with Red Queen Kills 7 Times come to the film's finale. First of all, the person responsible for the crime is far too easy to see. If you've seen more than one Gialli couple, you will have no problem in determining who is behind the murders. Secondly, the end feels a bit too hasty and as a result it's a little confusing. I'm definitely not someone who needs every point of chance that I've introduced, but I admit I've lost everything. A second view could clarify this.
