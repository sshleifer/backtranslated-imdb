If you like war games mech is pretty good. Some of them are cheap, but robot battles are worth seeing. I've enjoyed the mech war field for some time, and this is probably the only movie I've ever seen coming close to that feeling of being one of those immense craftsmen. If you like genres, then the games you want are Mech Warrior Three and Four and if you have an Xbox and $ 350 for the Backup Steel Battle. The movie is worth seeing at least once. There must be more films on the same subject there. Fewer remakes and more original works. <br /> <br /> Enjoy
