In response to the person who made a comment about how the film is shooting and who thought he had no purpose the role of brother Jess here is my answer: The role of Jess's brother is to provide a form of dramatic irony in the story. Craig Sheffer / Norman could have predicted the problems associated with life in life all the while, looking at how Jess's brother proved to be. There are various situations where Brad Pitt and his life are running in parallel, for example, when Jess's brother takes Craig Sheffer to a separate bar and then finds Brad Pitt there a few days later. Dramatic irony was there, so Craig Sheffer's character would have a greater emotional agitation to the death of his brothers, knowing he could do more to prevent it, and then create a more compelling mood in the movie.
