Fragglerock is excellent in the way Schindler's list was excellent. A great watch for children and adults of all generations. Large nodes can be seen as hinting to phallic symbols in the same way that H.R. Puff N Stuff has suggested smoking marijuana. Your kids will love this movie. I loved it very much like a child. My father showed me this movie as a child. He enjoyed it and pointed out that exaggerated nose was a fallacy. Although at that moment I had no idea what they were. The film is comedy and adventure. The story is tiring and cheerful. I and you will rejoice together.
