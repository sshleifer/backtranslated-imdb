Start slowly, pointing to the disturbing lives of the two housewives who decide to rent a castle in Italy in April, but do not give up on it. Nothing happens, but time passes with precision and there are many false jokes (my favorite is riding in the storm, which I find hilarious). The movie is marvelously romantic in many ways, the landscape is beautiful (like Polly Walker) and the resolutions in the movie are very satisfying. The film has a few freedoms, with Arbuthnot / Briggs / Dester, but I actually preferred the movie version of it (it may be more sentimental, but I felt it was more consistent with the tone of the story, and anyway, I like the feeling then when well done). An excellent movie, especially as a movie in bad weather.
