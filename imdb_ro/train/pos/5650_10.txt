"Some at the door." OHHH, how I miss this show so bad ... but we're lucky to have the "Invasion" now. Thank you, Shawn Cassidy. American Gothic, he had everything. If I had to choose one thing I liked best at the show, it must be "its lines of plans that are not predictable." The favorite actor was Lucas Black .. I love the southern accent. I bought the DVD right away, and my kids are also fans. There are some hot and hot scenes. And some devils. So, if the child looks, we recommend you edit (fast / ascendant). He has humor, on a level Joss Wheedon, where many shows are missing. Adults and adult situations that are handled with fines. The DVD has some extra, but I want to have a lot more. If you want to have fun and enjoy a great show, come to the "American Gothic" watch!
