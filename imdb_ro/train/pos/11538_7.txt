Felix Unger (Jack Lemmon) has just been thrown by his wife because he is one of the most annoying neurotic people in the world. Suicide is his way of getting out, but he does not seem to make her work, so he goes to his friends' home. Oscar Madison (Walther Matthau) is also recently divorced and living in the bachelor's sky. Smoking, gambling, hitting chickens, eating out and never cleaning up are not the paradise for him. Well, with suicide attempts, Oscar decides to let Felix move. First, it's a match made in the sky, Felix cooks and cleans and helps Oscar to pay his pension in time, but soon Oscar beats for women and Felix today's world would probably be gay) is not ready to go further. They invite a pair of British birds and find Felix so cute that soon they and Felix cry and talk about his family life, leaving the Oscar denied. That's it, he explodes and throws him out, but Felix is ​​not as helpless as he seems and soon has his upper hand. Favorite Quote "You left me small notes on my pillow, I told you 158 times that I can not stand some small notes on my pillow." F.U: "It took me three hours to realize that F.U was Felix Ungar!" Based on a play by Neil Simon (who also wrote the script), it has a certain sense of theater. Set and repair and show that you feel quite playable (for better or worse). Lemmon and Mathau have a great comedy chemistry and appeared in the Grumpier Old Men and Out to Sea films, resuming the same frightening roles but with different names (to avoid copyright issues, I'm sure). <br /> This film is like chocolate strawberries. Chocolate is smooth, sweet and rich, strawberry is tart, juicy, and shiny red (unless you get the greens green). They are almost polar opposites, but together, the contrasts stand out and make a wonderful dessert. 7/10 <br /> <br /> http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
