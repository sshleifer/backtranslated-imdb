EDDIE MURPHY DELIRIOUS is easily the most entertaining stand-up concert I've ever seen. Most stand-up acts are usually available at some point, but not on these people. For 90 minutes there is no moment that is not amusing laterally. From the moment Eddie makes a hilarious impression impressed by Mr.T, laughter is non-stop. Unfortunately, this was done in 1983, and Eddie did nothing almost as fun. it is unbelievable that the man who wrote this extraordinary spectacle has written a film called HARLEM NIGHTS, which was not at all funny. Eddie, if you're there, please come back and make a film concert in DELIRIOUS's vein. Believe me, your fans will love you for that. And I think you know that.
