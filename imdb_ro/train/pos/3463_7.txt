I'm a big fan of the Beatles. My favorite Beatle is Paul and my least favorite is John. I already knew pretty little about the Beatles and the truth behind the split, as well as the John Lennon family and the Paul Wings band. I was curious to see how this film will deal with the relationship between John and Paul so many years after the separation. I was not disappointed with this movie. Although the story itself is fiction, many of the references that the two musicians used were very accurate. They included how Yoko Ono would always be with John anywhere, Wings song "Songs Silly Love" being the number one hit that year, and the Apple studio roof concert that sang the music from the album "Let It Be. " The actors did a great job in playing John and Paul. The accents could have used some more, but they seemed to act much like reading the two former Beatles. I also liked the dialogue between them, which was basically what the whole movie was. Finishing at first disappointed me, but the more you think about it, the more you appreciate it, especially as it really was how it really went into real life. They also show fantastic skit from "Saturday Night Live", in which the Beatles are offered $ 3,000 to attend the show. (compared to another $ 220 million they offered) Generally, I was not disappointed with this movie. It really gives you more sense of why the Beatles broke up and why they never came back together.
