And this is especially true for lawyers and policemen. Puerto Rico, which boasts a small but powerful film production company, brings this multi-layered story about corruption because of the drug cartel that starts in South America, stops on the Commonwealth Island and then North America . Steven Bauer, the most acclaimed face on the screen, leads a cast of top actors in a story about "Can you see the only respectable face in the crowd?" Ricardo Mendez Matta moves from the main direction of the action adventure for American television in a script written by Matta along with Poli Marichal. The rest of the songs (Elpidia Carrillo, Magda Rivera, Jose Herredia, Luz Maria Randon, to name a few) turn into such beautiful roles in a movie that will make you wonder, are there respectable characters here? Spoken in Spanish with subtitles in English. Rated "R" by MPAA, this film contains outbursts of vulgar language, short blobs of nudity, adult content and violence, some of which are pretty scary.
