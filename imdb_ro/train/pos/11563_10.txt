I have seen this many years after the television series and, initially, I did not care. Then, as my memory about the serial disappeared with the passage of time, I looked again and found it absolutely hilarious. Based on the play piece by Neil Simon, it was not "open" much for the big screen, and this is one of its strengths. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are brilliant as Oscar and Felix, and the support distribution is great, especially John Fielder as "Vinnie". Even now, certain moments can cut me down to tears of laughter - Felix interrupted the Oscar in the middle of a dinner ceremony, Oscar coming down and watching Felix around the apartment, the sisters of Pigeon Suitions escaped by Felix's tales, of course, the legendary scene of the canteen (later was pulled off by "When Harry Meets Sally") by Nora Ephron. Razor-dialogue clear too. When guys think Felix has taken an overdose, Oscar says, "It could be vitamin! It could be the healthiest in the room!" Fantastic!
