Recently, a friend and I have been discussing educational and ethical influences when we were growing in the 1950s as compared to today. He mentioned Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who in 1798 wrote The Rime of The Mariner Ancient. We were forced to recite parts of epic poetry in high school and English college courses in English. My friend said: "And his messages could be called metaphysical in the context of today." <br /> <br /> We tried to recite it and just remember pieces and pieces. (I have problems with Dr. Seuss's memory.) I said I would receive two copies of poetry so that everyone could read. It was easy enough, but I was extremely surprised to find that it was turned into a movie. We look forward to watching the movie to see how it was played. After all, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner is not even an easy reading. After each reading of poetry, I watched the movie together. We considered the movie a remarkable achievement, especially since it was done in the 1970s before computers before the so-called "Ken Burns effect," "and before the special effects often begin to compensate for the lack of substance. are the 19th and 20th century illustrations that have been extracted from "lesser-known artists," such as Willy Pogany, Hollywood's early designer. <br /> <br /> The film is related to Sir Michael Redgrave, who learned poetry when he was a school teacher, adding a tone of authority and credibility, remaining true to poetry. His mastery is in layers of subtle messages transmitted without "training" "or become an oppressive and obvious story of morality." We found a so refreshing change to today's mentality "in front of you" and "tighten them." Most of today's morality messages in the movie are two-dimensional: extreme violence, crime and chaos marks the evil. The bad ones are indeed very bad, and the good ones are super heroes. It is as if the human character is devoid of any hue. The Ancient Mariner's Rim is a celebration of the individual, character, appreciation to celebrate the wealth that life has in the wider context of mankind, that is, the ability of man to give to others. <br /> <br /> Bearing the fact that I found this "unknown" jewel, I found out that she won the top five in six category at international film festivals "name". Another surprise was studying the director of the film, Raul daSilva, a recognized authority for early animation, and writing six film awards. <br /> <br /> The message of this film is equally relevant today, if not more than when Coleridge wrote the original epic poem, and when Raul da Silva translated the film. If I were still learning high school, which I did for five years, I would take it and show it to all my students. There is a level of wealth here that naturally leads to discussion of the great and important issues that we all face, either in 1798, 1978, or today - in fact, as long as mankind has a spiritual component. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
