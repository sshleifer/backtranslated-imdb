This is a better adaptation of the book than with Paltrow (though I liked that too). It's not so much that Beckinsale is better - both are very good - but the script is better. Davies is a master of Austen's adaptation for shooting, and the production values ​​here are very good. It's not as glossy as Hollywood treatment, but it's close, and I figured the locations and costumes worked better.
