When I first saw this movie on the cable, it instantly became one of my favorite movies. I'm a great fan of James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall. The film presents a clear picture of southern and racist attitudes. Most of the attitudes came from Soll, an old planting owner who uses convicts for work. Soll is what the movement does, its funny stories let us know about the way the South was. I suppose if Soll lived today, he would have been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. However, his attitude towards a boy who comes to work for him and for the convicts is complex. While he has racist opinions, he has grown to trust some black men. The two most convicted convicts are Jackson (Mel Winkler) and Ben (James Earl Jones). The conversations between Ben and Soll are the best in the movie, they have real chemistry. James Earl Jones and Mel Winkler both, but in big shows as well as Hass. This movie should have become more notorious. However, it's on DVD and it's worth the money. Rayvyn
