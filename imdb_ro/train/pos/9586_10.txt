The film really challenges you and the society we live in. It is well made and very strong. The people in the film are honest and revealing about the world that exists outside the normative ideological perspective. I think it offers a wonderful perspective on a subculturality that shakes the viewer's ideas on society. It's sometimes shocking and stronger because of that. Some parts have been hard to follow because most of the reality is, but it does not end. Good is the first time you look at it, but it gets better for the second or third time; because you had the opportunity to pack your mind around those topics that it discusses and provokes.
