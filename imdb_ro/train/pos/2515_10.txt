Moon Child, starring Japanese rockers Hyde and Gackt, was a better movie than I expected. In fact, I was very impressed and immediately became one of my favorite films. Located in Mallepa, the story follows a group of street orphans, Sho, brother Shin Shinji and Toshi who rob and kill to earn their living. On one of the robberies, Sho meets Hyde's Kei vampire burning in the sunlight. By the rough nature of events, Kei's true nature is shown, but no one removes it. Time goes by and implies that the immortal Kei, which never changes, has raised Sho, and the two have a very close connection. Sho and Kei then meet the Son in a scandalous weapon battle and become fast friends. Both Kei and Hyde fall in love with his sister, Yi-Che. Time is coming again and shows a raised Sho, this time empty of Kei. It also explains that Sho and Son have become enemies. Through the tragedy after the tragedy, this film sinks into the reality of life and all the hardships, focusing on friendship and love. It's a truly emotional film, but sad at the same time. As for the acting, I think Gackt did a magnificent job. Hyde did an amazing job for a first stopwatch. The photos were beautiful, but the film had rare and short photographs. <br /> <br /> Overall, I have to say this movie is amazing on the move, and I strongly recommend it.
