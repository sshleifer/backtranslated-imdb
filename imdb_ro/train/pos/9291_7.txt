An interesting look at Japan before opening west. John Wayne, as America's first consul in Japan, is in line with the agreements resulting from Perry's diplomacy. Not welcome. Wayne finally wins the Shogun meeting after controlling a cholera outbreak introduced by an American ship. There follows a colorful procession of capital bearing gifts for Shogun, including a bottle of Old Tanglefoot. The meeting with the Shogun, the Japanese noble debates, and an assassination during an archery exhibition show an interesting look at the politics of the period. In a pretty good film, and besides how often you see the Duke loses a fight for a half of his size.
