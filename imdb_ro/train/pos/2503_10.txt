I am extremely pretentious about the movies I see. I've heard of the Moon Child completely by chance. I have been a fan of L'Arc En Ciel for some time and a fan of Gackt and Mizer just recently. Finally, I found out that the movie was re-released and took it without a second thought. <br /> <br /> Being as critical as I am about movies, I admit that action scenes may be somewhat hockey sometimes ... but it's meant to be, as another user suggested, quintessential calm before the storm, citing Gary Oldman of Leon ... without falling into the spoiler, the movie hit me extremely hard because you realize that the limits of friendship are limitless and often say that true friendship is loyalty and marriage is until death you are not part. Hyde and Gackt show performance that shows why they are able to engage such depths in their song lyrics, their passion for music happens on the big screen and in the process creates an exemplary movie that will reach the other's soul and evoke the emotional response. After seeing the movie for the first time, I realized that it's likely that it's going to be turning around hard for my collection. I want to encourage anyone to read this post to pick up the movie if you want to get away from the current trend of the Hollywood movie ... that takes a whole new direction using Yakuza classic movie elements and how can you be wrong with a cameo from Ryo Ishibashi from Takashi Miike "Audition" and "Suicide Club" fame? Man .. I just can not say enough about this movie, but I'll stop here. <br /> <br />
