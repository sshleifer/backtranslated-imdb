Although this film has a first list of loyal actors, great special effects and a surprise story, it was not taken for the distribution of the studios and went straight to the DVD. Maybe it contains too much information about "police force" or maybe it's too many action actions launched during a complaint, but no matter what big screens have missed the opportunity, fortunately the new concept of direct release on DVD allows us to enjoy it. The theme is old: the novice reporter discovers an inner circle of cops who are corrupt - in this case, the FRAT (First Response Assault and Tactical), a group of policemen well trained to clean up the mythical Edison city from its low crime scene , prostitution, etc. Work under cover of the temptation of packing confiscated goods and money proves to be an opportunity too, and now, 15 years after its formation, FRAT is responsible for crime, drug trafficking, terrorizing innocent people, and so on. The dog is Lazerov (Dylan McDermott, who makes a terrible real gangster!) And his partner, Rafe Deed Cool J, even poorer than usual and proving he can be a sensible actor). Reporter Pollack (Justin Timberlake) captures the wind of a "bad mistake" and reports his theory of fraud and corruption to his chief paper, Ashford (Morgan Freeman, always reliable). Gradually, Polack convicts Ashford and later Wallace (Kevin Spacey, also a constant character character) and helps Pollack in this investigative investigation. Pollack closer to the truth, most surprises and bad incidents happen and the story runs the mall to a series of unexpected results. Timberlake lacks the charisma of driving, especially in the company of such actor actors. But LL Cool J, Freeman, Spacey and McDermott keep the well lubricated machines of a film that rolls to the end. No, it's not a great movie, but it's one that makes the edge of the movement of the seat with a message. Grady Harp
