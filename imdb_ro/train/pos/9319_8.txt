....... Playing Kaddiddlehopper, Col San Fernando, etc. The man was wide enough and a scream. I like to see him interacting with Amanda Blake or Don Knotts or someone - he clearly had a ball and I think he made it easier for his guests - as long as they knew he was not disciplined, 19 a kind of production. Relax and lose was clearly the name of the game there. He remembered boys like Milton Berle, Benny Hill, maybe Jerry Lewis. The long time, the old gags that kept the public in seams for decades, a joy full of what he did. His sad clown he played was good, but in an appealing manner. Personally, I think it's great, just when he bought a DVD set of shows from the '61s or so, stuff back in a fun way for me. I remember seeing him on TV at the end of the round when he finished the series in 1971 or so. Check whether you are fan or curious. It was a revolt.
