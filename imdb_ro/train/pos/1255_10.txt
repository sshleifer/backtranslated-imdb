This is a very good movie. Do you want to know the real reasons why so many here are beating this movie? I'll tell you. In this movie, you have a black criminal who goes beyond a white teacher. A black policeman telling the white teacher that he fails to defend the black murderer and the black cop turns out to be right. - make white teacher look bad. She always goes to race. This is an excellent movie. Do not pay attention to the racist. If you can overcome the fact that there are characters that are played by blacks in this movie that overwhelm the white characters then you should not have any trouble enjoying this movie. I recommended everyone to go see this movie.
