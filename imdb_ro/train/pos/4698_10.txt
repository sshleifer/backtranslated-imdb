Like wine, "Johnny Dangerously" gets better and better every day. This spiritual, intelligent, well-acting film could very well stand on its own - but like a parody of the gangster genre, it's truly remarkable. In fact, it is quite obvious, the best film of its kind ... the funniest spoof of mob movies and even that period - although, of course, this position is probably easier to achieve when its main competitors are so primitive, vulgar and boring pseudocomedies like Jane Austen's Mafia.
