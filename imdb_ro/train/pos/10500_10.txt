Although the Super Mario 64 is not like the rest of the series, it is still a classic and is as good as the old games. Games with this resume value are few and they are very far away. In addition, this game has so much variety. There are 15 levels each with several different tasks you can do and many other hidden tasks. The game is not very challenging, but its lack of challenge does not remove the game at all. Once you've beaten it, you'll want to delete the game and start it again. And it's just as fun the second time, the third time or the second. O must be proprietary to any Nintendo 64 owner, and it's a reason in itself to own a Nintendo 64.
