The year is in 1964. Ernesto "Che" Guevara, who has been a Cuban citizen over the last five years, disappears from the face of the Earth, leaving a stingy Fidel Castro to announce that he is probably dead when Cuba is actually left to move in Bolivia to live an assumed identity. While living in La Paz, Guevara proposes an idea to overthrow the corrupt, bourgeois government there. Once again, Steven Soderberg starts if "Che: Part I" leaves (only better this time). Pacing is more on target, the task of acting is always so fine (including a return by a patient looking for Benecio Del Toro, like Che Guevara). Suffice it to say that it is probably best if you see both films to get Guevara's true story and what kind of man he was (I had the opportunity to see both movies in a single visit) about a long journey !). As in "Che-Part 1: The Argentine," this film does not have a MPAA rating, but contains enough language and violence to easily defeat an "R".
