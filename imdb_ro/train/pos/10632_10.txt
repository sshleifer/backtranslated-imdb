This is a movie for entertainment; I do not think the world made a social commentary from a small movie. I personally find this funny, bold and memorable movie. It's a fantasy that does not look like a girl who turns into a princess. This film was very well done, I could add, in the 1970s, a moment of the best experiments in the film, with the possibility of mentioning a person's sexuality. This film is not about a person who is homosexual or not, but about love in all its strange forms. This film shows some of the realities of being homosexual in the 1970s in Hollywood or California. Guys pretty cared for older men who are not so cute. Women who had to remain deeply locked in the emotional closet or risk not having a career. Bathrooms were an integral part of the homosexual community. Then fantasy begins! Let's mix a lesbian with a homosexual and add some liquor and what do we have? Well, this movie, which in any way was better than that terrible royalty "The Next Big Thing". Perhaps someone should have asked the entire crew to see this movie and then try to do better. I liked this movie when I saw it in the 70s and still smiled my lips now. I advise everybody who wants a funny and delicate film - to dress up some popcorn and have fun. Some people need to be relieved! And this is the movie you should do with! <br /> <br />
