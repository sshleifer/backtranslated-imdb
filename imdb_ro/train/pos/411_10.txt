This movie is well done on so many levels that I am very pleased that the score is just as low (5.9 / 10 (576 votes) from this writing). This movie has incredible special effects, a true epic story, a complex interaction of characters and mental battles - must be seen to be believed! The only complaint I have is subtitles on the HK DVD version I received (some lines have not been translated - ???). I do not understand when I read and hear from various sources: "he has a confusing plot ...", "I could not follow the story" ... or "Characters came from nowhere ...". From the first time I watched this movie, I understood it, I followed it, I knew why the characters were there and I loved it absolutely! I've seen it almost 8 times and every time it's pure pleasure. Oh, and that's not just my opinion, because I showed this movie to many Americans (people who have never seen a HK movie before) who feel the same. None of them succeeded in following the story, and each person declared their love for this film. Man, why can not we have stuff like this coming out of Hollywood? At least the Lord of the Rings had a beautiful marriage of special effects, character development and story. This does not come from an amateur film lovers from Asia, either. I have a vast library of Asian movies and I have to say that this movie is one of the biggest DVDs. When you watch it, you will be blown away by the amazing special effects and epic sense of this film. You will be attracted to this fantasy world and you will not want to go! I have seen both the 1983 and 2001 versions (both by Tsui Hark) and 2001 is much better compared to the IMO. Besides subtitles, I have a further complaint about this movie: I did not want it to end ... I beg you, Mr. Hark - can we have a sequel?
