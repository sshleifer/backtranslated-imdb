I saw this movie 12 years ago on TNT. It was Susanah York's birthday and featured this film as a double feature with Tom Jones (1963). I have not seen this movie on TV since then. I was interested in seeing this movie because one of the stars is very funny and talented Jim Dale, just like Lusty the sailor. I think Dale is now making Harry Potter's narration on Casette, but it's pretty funny anyway. This is a quick comedy. It's not on VHS or DVD. Columbia Pictures should go through their film collection and consider restoring and releasing this movie on DVD. Christopher Plummer is hilarious as Lord Fopington, Ian Bannen is also quite humorous as the Ramble sailor. This is an unpleasant comedy, the kind of movie you no longer see, with high production values. *** 1/2 star from ****
