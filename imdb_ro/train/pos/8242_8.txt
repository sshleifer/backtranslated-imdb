I watched FIDO on a movie channel and I have to say that I became an instant fan. The film feels like a comic book that perfectly surprises the appearance of the 1950s, you know the healthy decade when they danced to Elvis while throwing nuclear bombs in the desert just for her heel. People were so naive then it is frightening and the idea that those courageous people would be normal to have zombies as pets actually works here. Kudos to this Canadian production, colorful and excellent cinema, including Carrie Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Henry Czerny and the baby. It's a shame that this movie was not a big hit. It deserved more recognition. It's much better than Tim Burton or SHAUN OF THE DEAD. Good. However, it is an instant classic.
