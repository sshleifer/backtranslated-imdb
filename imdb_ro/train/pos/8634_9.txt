LOVE AT THE TOP - the US title completely useless for the French film "Le Mouton Enrage" (which means, I think, Oul Rabin) - is an original film, the fact that dates back to 1974 seems to be all the more astonishing. This film was long before his time; Even by today's highest standards, it does things that seem rich and new. Filmed by highly underestimated director Michel Deville, he rather defies the description in combining social critique, comedy, mystery, love, sex and satire in a completely original mix - leaving a major but subtle surprise to make all they passed before it was suddenly sad and easier to understand. The distribution is splendid, just like the writing and the theme. But it is a delicious tone of Deville, keeping you constantly a balance, but charming, really pushing this movie "lost" to a very high level. (The interview written with the director on the "Special Features" section on DVD definitely deserves to read if you have time.)
