A pretty funny vehicle, Jim Carrey, who has a news reporter who temporarily receives the power of God and destroys chaos. Carrey returns to the familiar field and seems to have a good time, and Jennifer Aniston, like putting her girlfriend, is also charming and affectionate. The story is predictable to the extreme, but the cast (including Morgan Freeman as "God") is great and makes the movie worth capturing. Degree: B
