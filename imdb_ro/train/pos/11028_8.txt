I honestly did not like this movie when I saw it for the first time. But I think the problem is I did not see her in a theater. Big mistake ! Because the best thing you see in Cliffhanger is the settings and number 2 is cinema. Try to see this movie on the largest possible TV and an excellent sound system. Music is good and puts the film to a higher level (and commercial potential). The more I see it, the more I like it. It's definitely one of Renny Harlin's best movies. This guy knows about the action. Die Hard 2, Long Kiss, Farewell, etc. And it is particularly good in this movie. The special effect is great and spectacular. Stallone really needed the movie to come back. You still have to see it!
