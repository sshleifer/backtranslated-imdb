This is one of the best military films ever made. And it is wonderful because of its concentration on values. It is a great story of human interest that turns into a commitment of honor, loyalty, love and determination. Gooding and DeNiro are superb in their roles. It is wonderful to see that the chief executive racism evolves towards respect and love through the determination, leadership and sense of honor of Carl Brashear. The title indicates the source of their link. I have never noticed until the last time he was looking at how brilliant Carl Lumbly portrayal of Carl's father, Mac Brashear. In a way, it is a cornerstone of the film that is Carl's memory of his father who helps him take him in hard times. I'm selective about what movies I buy. This is one of the rare ones I want on my shelf. Will be seen many times in the future, I'm sure.
