This is not a critique of the film, but rather a comment on how blind we are in our past. <br /> <br /> Recently I watched the Winter Soldier, and AdevÄƒrul de la sol was like watching a remake or a sequel - unless it was Iraq and not Vietnam. Like the winter soldier, thanks to his unilateral message, both films illustrate how gladly we are in a hurry to engage in false-based conflicts and allow the young and courageous (and often naive) to bear the weight of this greedy wartime profanation. Both films actually show that the mentality forced into the minds of young people and willing to make them effective killing machines, but training fails to teach the diplomatic and police skills necessary to actually win the hearts and minds of the people they are supposed to fight for. This is ultimately what lost the war in Vietnam and will probably lose the war in Iraq. <br /> <br /> My only negative comment is that the movie is so unilaterally that it could easily be pushed as left-wing propaganda. Not me, remember you, but those who seek to discredit the film and the message. A more balanced viewpoint would speak with a wider audience.
