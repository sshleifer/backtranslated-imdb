Be careful with this. Once you get your mitts on it, you'll change the way you look at kung-fu. You will be happy a plot of all kung-fu movies now, you will miss the depth and character development, you will be mystery and unpredictability, you will demand dynamic room work and incredible backgrounds. Unfortunately, you will not find all these aspects together in a kung-fu movie, EXCEPT FOR Deadly Income Five! Easily the best kung-fu movie of all time, the venoms blend into a rich park, full of overturnings and transformations, with colorful (and developed) characters along with some of the finest roomwork to get out of the '70s. The success of a person who likes the film depends on the spectators' ability to decipher which character is and who specializes in what venom. One is Centipede, two is a Snake, three is Scorpio, four is Lizard, and five is The Root. Each character has features, features, strengths and weaknesses. Here is the hook, we learn with the pupil's character, and find out what these different people are. We are in shoes (so to speak) and we have to choose who we trust and who does not, as he does. We learn with him. Not only is it plotting, characters and camera work, but also the fun to look at, which in my book makes it more valuable than almost any other film of its kind. It's worth a few hours to pick up everything that's going on. Venoms are a lesson about what Kung-fu can do really ... do not expect many other kung-fu movies to live up to her monastery.
