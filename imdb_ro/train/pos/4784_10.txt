It's nice to see a movie with real people with honest feelings. Sissy Spacek is so compelling as a simple, yet pleasing daughter to Robert Farnsworth, who ultimately, in his last role, gets to show what a good actor he was. It's hard to believe this is a David Lynch movie. It is slow and uniform, sweet and on the move. One of the best, unless you like car rides, sex scenes and violence.
