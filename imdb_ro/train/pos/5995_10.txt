I'm not sure whether it was okay or not, but I read through other comments before watching short.I have to say I disagree with most negative comments or problems people have had with it. a director / producer "Lone Wolf" for the first time, I like to see things I can aspire, not necessarily from professionals but from people who just get wet feet like me. If indeed it is also from a prime timer, as I read, applaud the effort. Work then work on that! There have been some comments about music. I thought it was pretty nice for the play. Some say it was a kind of wandering over time, but we found it created tension without being necessarily aware of it, and when the gun and the guitar started cleaning the accords, it was as if we knew there was a train on the track, but realizes it is moving now. Yes, there is a 180 degree sliding / clip there, but shi * is happening. If anyone else sees Hugh's dirty shirt become white (near the end in the rain) in "Australia"? Look how much money and people were behind this movie! Give the child a break for God! In general, I think it was very well done. Only two things I would have remembered are not worth mentioning - Do not go to a shiny brass frame with the camera and I just showed the splashes at the beginning of the photo at a shot yet, so people would not I do not necessarily know what it is. <br /> <br /> My experience so far has taught me that it's not hard to make a movie, it takes time to learn how to do it, then time to do it, and then you better have more time to think about all the details you need to be shot before calling "post-production time!" IMHO, it seems that director / writer Ryan Jafri has done his homework and if this is his first report card, I would give him an "A". The rest of you report to the main office for a question.
