Under no circumstances a masterpiece and far from the best Errol Flynn, Istanbul still has much to do. Locations and beautiful technicolor cinema bring us back in a long time. Errol Flynn shows moments from past glory and is fine as Jim Brennan, a past pilot, is back to haunt him. The image is in fact a remake of "Singapore" in the 1947s, and the story seems greatly contradicted and clung by current standards. Also, many of the support distributions seem to be simply "going through the moves" of this image. Many people also compared him to one of the best, CASABLANCA. While watching the movie, I could see many similarities, but hey, Casablanca inspired countless imitators, so take it for what they deserve. Finally, if you are a fan of Flynn or old love stories, you might want to give this movie. Otherwise, I would recommend Casablanca, or The Falcon Maltese, as a good introduction to some of the classic Hollywood ....
