Call me adolescent, but I really think this is a big series. If you did not have the chance to experience some episodes from the latest Star Trek series, you should definitely watch this. Perhaps more appealing than Voyager's Caretaker, who released the series with Captain Janeway, Archer's adventures are completely different but strangely familiar ... The music is also appealing. No true Sci-Fi fan can go without seeing at least one Star Trek episode - and these rates make it worthwhile.
