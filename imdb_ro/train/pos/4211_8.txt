I watched this last night on TV (HBO). I have to admit that the tension in this film was unmatched by most of the films in the FN era. I liked the way Chip would be quiet for a moment and then VIOLENT the next moment. It was classical. Ahh yes. The ladies, the villagers, the cigars and the wandering policemen! He has everything. This movie gave me all the goods. I especially loved the way communism mixed up in the plot, very common for this era of the film. Very daring, since the black list was popular in those days. I rate this movie one of the best I've seen in the genre FN!
