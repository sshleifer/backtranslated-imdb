<br /> <br /> I just bought this movie on DVD and I saw it for the first time last night. I've been a fan of Tolkien's work for almost four years since I left high school. I did not grow up on this movie ... maybe my mom kept me away from her. It is definitely not for children. Not that it is bad in a graphic sense, but that the themes would go even over most of the 10-year heads. Generally, the animation was excellent, as it was made in 1978/1979. I thought the story followed the book pretty well in a weak sense. But it bothers me that Bashki has not added yet another 40 minutes and managed to play the songs "King's Return". That would have done the final movie. I was disturbed by the steep end, and when I heard the return of the suck king, I was disturbed even more. Too bad it was not a great animation movie. There could have been a bigger vote for me. I give her a 7. I can only hope that Peter Jackson will make the books right with the new LOTR live action.
