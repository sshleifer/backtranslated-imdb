This is an amazing film, made in just six or seven colors. When it came out 15 years ago, it astonished the audience with the color scheme, being so different from anything else that was ever put on the film. These colors, at least for me, make this movie absolutely fascinating. There are literally thousands of scenes that they want to freeze and turn them somehow into a painting to study for their artwork. The characters and the story do not match the magnificence of the photo, but they are all over the head, especially the villains. Celebrity actors who have played here have a lot of fun on "Flatop", "Pruneface", "Lips", "Mumbles", etc. At the same time, Warren Beatty and Gleanne Hedley are good as Dick Tracey and Tess Truehart's girlfriend, and she is as sweet and soft as her name. Another good addition is Charlie Korsmo as the delinquent boy Dick and Tess take under their wing. Other colorful characters are played by Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, William Forysthe, Paul Sorvino, Mandy Patinkin, Madonna, and other names you know, but there are too many to present them here. Check the full credits on the main page and you'll be amazed. The only negative I found was the voice of Pacino, who comes back after a moment, Madonna's singer's voice and the fact that the movie was better cut for about 10 minutes. These "mistakes" are all minor because, overall, this is a fun movie ... a cartoon strip coming to life in an incredibly colorful manner ... like anything you've ever seen.
