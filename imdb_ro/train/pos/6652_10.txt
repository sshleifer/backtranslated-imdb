I saw the movie and could not stop my tears. The tragedy that India has no such leaders after freedom, who dare to do justice to their children when they do not behave properly. In the current generation, politicians bring their children into politics without measuring their caliber and abilities. The Gandhi Dialogue "What kind of society do we want to create / do with such people (about Harilal)?" No wonder it will be a dream that India will hardly have such a leader in this or the next generation. Einstein was right when he said about Gandhi that "50 years would hardly believe that such a person with body, soul and mind Gandhi) has ever lived on this earth.I honestly want to thank much for Anil kapoor, Feroze khan and for the film actors / actress for this wonderful film about the person and the relationship with his son. father and son should watch this movie once and take some lessons for both roles.
