What a surprising feature is coming to late television. If I just read a short description of a plot on a TV before seeing the movie, I would have passed. The idea of ​​a movie about a man who saw her - a psychiatrist - who wants to leave the business and fall into love ... sounds alive. But the movie works. Since the beginning of the film, it is clear that the man wears a weight on his shoulders, before even saying a word. The look and feel of the film are perfect. dark, but not so obnoxious. Apart from the homosexual aspect that offers a source of surrealism, Macy's character struggles with his marriage and control of his father. Macy has a repressed sadness, and talks with his baby are just amazing. The boy shows a lot of acting skills over the years, and the interaction between father and son is so natural, personal and loving. This is one of the best movies I've seen in a while, and I can not believe I accidentally met her on late television.
