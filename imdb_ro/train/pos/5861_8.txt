Generally, I agree with Ebert's review. In a sense, I feel I should not even comment because it's so much a veteran movie and I'm not a veterinarian (I was a resister). The failure is that Martha is seriously underdeveloped and does not act consistently. I think Stephen Metcalfe is a vet himself and spent too little planning time on her character.
