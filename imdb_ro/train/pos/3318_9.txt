A very cute movie with a wonderful background from Boston and Fenway Park. Like a baseball fan and light film addict, he hit a homerun for me. Lots of laughs and a lot of authentic baseball scenes with real players and real references to Bosox past failures. And how pleasant was watching a baseball movie without having to handle a highway Kevin Costner who wanted to make the believers come out of a critical audience? Jimmy and Drew did a good job as a young couple hit by love, who suffered from Jimmy's "jones" Bosox. It was a bit strange in the left field, but really there are Sox fans who are that fanatic and live their lives through the wealth of their beloved teams. The film was running at a rapid pace, and the end, though predictable, had the charm and sentiment of many other popular films without being too pretentious. <br /> <br /> Also, the pleasure was the return of Willie Garson on the screen. I miss the popular "Stanford Blatch" from Sex & the City. He is always funny, even when he does or says very little. <br /> <br /> So buy two boxes of boxing, some popcorn and get ready for a fun time. "Fever Pitch" is a winner.
