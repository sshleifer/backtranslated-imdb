and this is a very disturbing movie. I may be wrong, but this is the last film in which I considered Burt Reynolds a real actor who turned the role and gave a message. Jon Voight and Ned Beatty are also excellent. They are unsatisfactory and do not know; business people who want to enjoy the country. Few knew what would happen next. The photo and the sets are realistic and natural. That was before Wes Craven's day. What is most disturbing about this movie is that there are still such places. In America, people in the country still dislike people in the city; is almost a century and a half since the civil war. <br /> <br /> You will enjoy this movie. It was filmed in the rural sections of South Georgia that still exist. Do not drive to Mobile, Alabama; This area has not been repaired since Hurricane Katrina. 10/10.
