Otto Preminger's classic noir model works almost like a flip-top of LAURA ... while the film was brilliant and has the appearance of Clifton Webb high-quality, this movie is a lot of attention. Dana Andrews is a less good policeman than accidentally killing a man just to fix the father of the girl he loves. The premederator keeps things moving in a quick moment so that logical disappearances are easily overlooked. Andrews is pretty good (less wood than it was in the past) and amazingly beautiful Gene Tierney is amazingly beautiful! Creepy Craig Stevens plays the unhappy victim. Where you have to see the top of the movie and an extraordinary piece of companion to the Premiers, as crazy WHIRLPOOL (also with Tierney).
