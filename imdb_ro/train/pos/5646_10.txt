Recently, when I was shopping, I saw the set of American Gothic speakers and I thought "I remember that!" I used to get the alarm to come back and watch this when I was on CH 4 in 1996 at 1.30am (I was 14). I remember especially because it was really scary and weird, no person would have been so frightening as Lucas Buck (with a B!) Nobody has ever been. <br /> <br /> What annoyed me was that they did the same thing on box-set as on television. Episodes in funny order, I thought when Dr. Matt was finished ??? - they were so confused. <br /> <br /> However, it is not wrong for writers, producers or directors (the television people in the money makers' foundation do the same thing-look at performances such as Carnivale and Farscape do not like originality in studios !!!!!) To finish - If you have not seen this and you call Sci-Fi Fantasy, Horror, supernatural drama .. FAN = MUST. They actually said the same thing in SFX when reviewing the set of tapes.
