I just took it to the DVD and watched it again. I like bright colors and dark images. He is not a big fan of Beatty, but this is an excellent popcorn movie. Pacino is amazing, as always, and well, this movie marked the time when Madonna was the sexiest. I would have liked to stay for a longer time on "Breathing". Charlie Korsmo has the very first important role, other than "What about bob?". The effects of the makeup have been on the edge and then remained for the most part. The beautiful landscape and mood transports you directly into a comic book environment. Cars, cabinets, buildings and even street lights are a great tune, not to mention the perfect lighting, though the scenes with a lot of red can have an annoying effect because it tends to fade a little. You just want Beatty to have the chance to do a sequel. In general, a fun for a few hours.
