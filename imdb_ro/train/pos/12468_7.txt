OK, this movie starts out as a brown film of life and does not get better anymore in the movie. The scenario is full of "cheese" and "puff", and the distribution is not well routed for the most part. For the first half of the movie, the little girl lost my nerves. I do not think this is one of the best jobs. The only reason I bought the movie was that she was on sale and had Ellen Burstyn in it. It's great, but it's not one of the best concerts. The story is based on real events and helps the film. In fact, I did not even like the movie and was disgusted when I saw photos of the balloon traveling, I mean ... to be where we are supposed to go and end up with that! But everything is forgiven when it reaches the destination and the story is coming to an end. If this does not bring a tear to the eye, nothing will be! It's a crude and predictable solution, but it makes you feel good again in the world.
