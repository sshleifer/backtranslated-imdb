You do not believe all the negative reviews that this movie receives. Yeah, it's cheap. Yes, the gore is ridiculous. And, yes, the act is sub-par. However, this is an example of a manuscript of an early movement, and if it is "the thing" (mine!), Then you will enjoy it. There are enough good aspects for this film to offset the disadvantages. For one, the score of an unknown then Christopher Young is very creepy and heavily accentuates violence. The ending is a welcome break from the predictably optimistic end of most of the films. And last but not least, the setting is what the movie made for me. Producers of this film could have done a much better job of "dressing" the set to make it more credible than a college dorm. However, if you can overlook this defect, the setting is great. Four colleagues alone in a huge, abandoned, convicted building waiting to be torn ... react to the possibility. When you look at yourself, let your imagination do some of the work and you can enjoy this movie as much as I do.
