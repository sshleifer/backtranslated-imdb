Director Sam Fuller has something to worship, especially in Europe. However, most of his films are more than just forgotten. Still, he made a wonderful movie in "Pickup on South Street". Made early in his career, the films that followed were very inferior. From the first to the last frame, "Pickup" works at all levels. The film is filmed with impeccable fluidity, providing fine performances throughout the game. Richard Widmark and Thelma Ritter, both players with a top-of-the-line performance, are at the top. Widmark, who was not a stranger to playing bruises, while really meaning the core, still manages to reveal only the smallest humanity that makes his fascinating character as well as the fact that Jean Peters's character falls for him the more credible. <br /> Fuller does not have any dagger in this really tough movie. There is a scene in which Jean Peters wanders about Widmark. It's really shocking in its reality. This is not a case of photography with careful choreography. <br /> <br /> Less self-conscious than many noir movies of the period, this remains a great example of gender.
