After a slow start, BRUCE ALMIGHTY is a very funny movie that had something positive to say. It was not one of Jim Carrey's best performances, but he was still fine. Morgan Freeman was right as God. Jennifer Aniston had some good moments. I miss Steve Correll on "SHOW DAY!" I like the choices of director Tom Shadyac of movies. And he did LIAR LIAR, ADAMS PATCH, and NUTTY PROFESSOR. In all three and in Bruce Almighty, he takes a great comedy star and tells a human story with him. A director who knows the comedy can get the talent he receives and can tell him a meaningful and intelligent story hard to find. My biggest complaint is that she should have used several biblical references. I only remember three specific biblical references and were the three funniest parts of the whole movie. I think the first drafts of the script had several biblical references, but they were cut because the producers were afraid to offend people. This is too bad because I thought it was a missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> My degree: <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
