I went through watching this version of "Samhain", and even if I still like it, there is nothing like the cut cut I have. If you check the message board, you will see an excuse from the director for this cut-out version of 79 minutes, and he says he has nothing to do with this editing edition of R, with a completely new ending. The Christian does not need to move away so much because the gore elements still rise, even if they are very inclined. This is a shame, because this has had the potential to be one of the most amazing and best gore films for years. She still has porn stars, and the link and some of the extreme gore can be at least partially seen. I'm glad I have that "raw cut", because for me it's a jewel for any gorehounds library. Christian Viel certainly has the ability and vision to deliver the goods, and we hope his next project will be better off. The idiots had a classic almost in their hands and deceived them for everyone. "Samhain" can be one of the most controversial and wrong horror movies of all time, and too bad gorehounds have not come to see what the director intended. <br /> <br /> *********** ******************************* ** Only you know what you missed, this is my review based on SAMHAIN's "hard work". The movie runs just over 90 minutes and does not stop any chapter. There is absolutely no musical soundtrack and some of the scenes have no sound in dialogue because they think they are meant to be introduced later. However, most of the movie has sound that affects the sound and when there is no effect or scene, a message appears as an insertion hint when the movie is completed. It is exactly as it says, a "Rough Cut", but the only unmistakable version of "Samhain" that you will ever see. The reason, because the gore is extremely graphic, much more than a NC-17 would allow. Yes, there are some porn stars, but they are just there for killing, and to add a little sugar and spices. The story is quite standard, American tourists on a holiday in Ireland and get to stay in a house in the middle of the forest. An area that is hard to folk, involving the old Druids and the Samhain celebration, or as we call it Halloween. (frightening) The film starts with a large dose of gore because a couple is being attacked by one of the local inbred mutants. This is a great scene when the guy finds the little girl hanging from a rock with her helpless cry. All he sees is his head, his arms and shoulders hanging in front of him, and when he pulls it, he is completely cut into two. This is what I would call EXTREME GORE, with the entr√©es, blood and limbs cut everywhere. We're here in Herschell Gordon Lewis territory, except that the effects look much more realistic. I just want to ignore the story, because it's your standard strain and kill the plot. The next gore scene is something to look at, as the friend of the first killing is taken to a cave like the location (TCM-2 stuff), and linked to a table. This geek then cuts all the limbs (outside the room with a clue to enter a scene) and then we see his trunk on a barbecue pit, slowly turning over a fire and the trunk has a big weight (if you can thinks that). Yes, taste very bad, brutal, terrible, you will find the right word and probably will fit too much. Later, Jenna Jameson, her beautiful body and everything, is cut from the neck to her feet and all her entrails are extracted in serious charts, and her blood drains into a pot. Yummy, a real return on huh? But the best gore scene happens inside the house, and I have to admit, this is one of the best gore scenes I've ever seen. This guy (no matter who) is trapped behind a geek, and cut open at the bottom hole. The geek puts his hands inside and breaks all the beatings, intestines, and what the hell is anything else, even from his wretch. This happens for FOREVER because the guy screaming and more and more candy are taken out across the bathroom floor. This is so extreme, so above that I woke up laughing everything in hell. Obviously, you will never see this scene on an appropriate DVD, IMO, along with most other extreme scenes. Well, first of all, even if I doubt this movie will ever be released in this totally smooth presentation, it makes this "Rough Cut" a rare gem for gorehounds. Yes, it's a bit difficult at first, without a soundtrack, a few scenes that still need to be included, and credits with names that are missing everywhere. But that makes this so unique and not sell it for anything now. Extreme gore, yes, extreme extreme gore. This makes Haute Tension look like a Disney movie.
