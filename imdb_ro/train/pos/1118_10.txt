Well, it could be one of the funniest movies of all time, and Sandy delivers a power-up performance! Unfortunately, her career never took off, but she will always be remembered for the first three photos: The King of Comedy, Dallas Doll and Without You I'm Nothing. She is given to various New York characters at Diana Ross to create a strange and hilarious critique of popular culture in America. Sexy and fierce, delicate and sensual, philosophical and melancholic, she convinces the audience in every scene, and she is actually "very beautiful." Watch it (if you are not from Iowa), you will definitely enjoy it!
