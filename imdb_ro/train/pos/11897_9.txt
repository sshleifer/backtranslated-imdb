This is a small horror film that indie movie fans will really appreciate. It has good action, a lot of gore and a decent plot. One will be remembered by films such as The Hills Have Eyes and Pumpkinhead. It is obvious that the budget was not so big, but the film is made with the atmosphere and solid performances of the actors, which seems to be lacking in many of the special effects movies with a big budget today. The movie really moves and there is a great direction and good work of the room. There are no lost scenes, so the length of the movie is short. In addition, it seems that the end leaves an opening for a sequel that would be very interesting. So take some popcorn, turn the lights and enjoy it.
