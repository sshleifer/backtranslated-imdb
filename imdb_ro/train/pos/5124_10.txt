This is a wonderful movie I do not think has enough credit like Saturday Fever or Grease in John Travolta's career. He plays a man who is in love with a girl, but he is too piging to admit his feelings for her. Instead, he wants to engage in mechanical riding because he thinks he will show his man. Even though it was made in 1980, it is today in time. The great country music is terrible. 10/10
