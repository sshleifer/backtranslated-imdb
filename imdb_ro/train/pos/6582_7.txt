Okay, so there's a frontal view of a Checker taxi, probably late in the 1930s. It has thick triangular headlights. There is also a DeSoto cabin in this black and white color, character driven, almost a musical love went wrong. The real story here is the look in the 1940s of the interior of the room and fashion and hotel lifts. Hair styles, men and women are great. If Dolly Parton had Victor Mature's hair, he could have done it great. There is an artist's attic that would be the envy of every Andy Warhol wannabe. If you watch this by waiting for a great story Casablanca or Sound of Music oom-pah-pah, you will be disappointed. There is a wonderful story under the runway model approach in this movie. My DVD copy with another $ 1 movie was very visible. The title sequence was nice, but not up there with Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World or The Panther Pink. This was an RKO movie, but it did not have the nice RKO logo I used to. I liked Victor Mature in One Million, BC, and Sampson and Delilah and especially in violent breasts. See if you can find him. He was great in comedy with Peter Sellers called Caccia Alla Volpe or After The Fox. Richard Carlson continued to do it, and I drove three lives on TV in the early 1950s. Vic Mature was offered Sampson's father side in the remake of Sampson and Delilah. He is supposed to be asked if he would have trouble playing the role of his father, since he was so well known as Sampson. Victor replied, "If the money is right, I will play Sampson's mother." <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
