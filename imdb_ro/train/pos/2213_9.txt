Wow this movie was totally captivating I could not believe I started so late to look at it but it came out for a long time Uncle I started to forget I could not stop that it had a whole range of very well-expressed members wow even Eartha Kitt and Ruby Dee Forrest Whittaker and James Earl Jones and many more famous actors and actresses, was more than a glance in history, it was an opening of the eyes in another part of society that people do not know and may even be embarrassed to speak. I have never heard of a book or a movie about it before and this is something that black history never refers to just looking down because they were mixed and mixed race, I highly recommended this movie
