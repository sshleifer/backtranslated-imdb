As in this movie, we watch the uncluttering adventures, if you always train the two main characters. But while C + J shaves sex for a giraffe trip back in childhood, this pair enjoys their carnality even to the point of exploring homoerotism. Most genders that you get from innocent or unwilling partners, yet despite their profound non-PC behavior, everyone seems to smile. Like C + G, through it, they remain innocent in the heart, rebel against the daily, bourgeois, restrictive. As somebody else commented, I would not want to know these 2 and it's a great marvel that their trip brings comedy scenes and very little tragedy (and why it can not be put to the door) and so for this reason left me comforted, but with a sweet taste in his mouth. I dare say that only the French can get away with movies like this. And that's part of their genius.
