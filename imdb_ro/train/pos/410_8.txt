We rented this DVD movie without knowing anything about it, part of a winter marathon watching a movie every night. After some awesome American action adventure films (Ballistic, Daredevil, Cradle of Life), Zhu Warriors struck me like a brilliant cinematic production. The story is a complete nonsense, but I found the film's sincerity, kindness and total lack of refreshing ironing, and the film looks spectacular. Sure, the special effects are not as technically awesome as those produced by Hollywood, but filmmakers are more interested in color, composition and motion than realism, and so many of the photos are stunning. In one shot, two of the superhuman characters are on the rocky spirits of rock, a huge moon ahead of them, the image perfectly balanced by the three elements. In another, a princess warrior crosses the heavens behind his shining sword like a rocket looking for heat. And the colors explode from shot to shot, used to express emotion rather than to represent reality. Characters have the same simplicity and directivity of the characters of comic books that do not provide depth in itself, but refer to deeper resemblance arches. From a physical point of view, some actors are amazingly beautiful. They play their roles up, without irony or torment, and they are credible. The strangest of all, in spite of the collapse of the plot and of the thin characterizations, I found myself very close to tears at the end, moved by the superb simplicity of the actors and the frightening vision of the original, the director's goodwill. <br /> <br />
