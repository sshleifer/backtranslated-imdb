This is one of the most adorable episodes in the Twilight Zone, with fun and entertaining fun and funny characters to break the tension of some daunting moments. Is there the usual blonde vampire dancer (what happens to Serling's love for that character, so he continues to appear in different episodes?) And other assorted characters, but Jack Elam's "old man" who steals the show. I think this is the funny version, accompanied by "Monsters are due to Street Maple" - or perhaps a 20-minute Twilight Zone parody of "The Thing". In another note: I thought the young boyfriend of the episode might be someone who eventually went to other things - familiar, but it seems that "Ron Kipling" disappeared after just two TV credits for his name.
