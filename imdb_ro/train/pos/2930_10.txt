The film is on the side that spreads from the beginning, Eddie seems to bring that uniqueness on stage and makes the most elementary fun thing about having a baby ice cream on the old family tradition. The movie is very rare in this country, but surely the availability in other countries I've searched through many websites and I'm still not lucky, phone companies that are looking for rare videos and there are waiting lists for years. SO HINTS ARE WELL WELCOME. If someone likes Eddie Murphy as a comedian and you see the movie, he deserves the money and can not go too bad.
