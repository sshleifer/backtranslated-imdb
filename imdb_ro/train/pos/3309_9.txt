This is a great movie. If this is an indication, Hong Sang-Soo is indeed "the best guarded secret of Asian cinema." It is very similar to the Tsai Ming-Liang style and Hou Hsiao-hsien and it covers the theme theme a lot, but I think I enjoy it more than anything else than any of their films. The obvious minimalism is less pronounced here than in their work, although it still fits perfectly with that style (the camera does not move even once) and somehow I found the movie less conscious of "slow" than Tsai Ming-Liang Hou Hsiao-hsien, who think it's part of the reason I enjoyed more. Besides, he does not keep his subjects as detached as Hou. I felt that the movie was also somewhat more "complete" and less open (just barely) than part of their work, though that does not mean it had much of something like a plot on the move. It would be hard to believe that Sophia Coppola was not directly influenced by this film for "Lost in Translation" (scenes of a young woman who wanders alone around her and caresses herself in her hotel room, wearing pants punk, familiar).
