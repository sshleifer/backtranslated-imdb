Watching this movie really brought some wonderful childhood memories. 34 years ago, I have not seen her since I was 12-14 years old. I almost forgot this movie, but when I looked at it again, some scenes literally brought me a tear! Small Robot "Jinx" (friends forever!). It was like reviving my childhood. It was an absolutely amazing experience for me. I will always cherish this film for this reason. I hope some of you, the readers, can refer to my experience, not to that movie, but to any movie you have not seen for a long time. Very nostalgic ... <br /> <br /> -Thank you for reading
