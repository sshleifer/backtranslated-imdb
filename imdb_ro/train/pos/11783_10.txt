Rock Star: INXS was the best TV series I've ever seen! It had some of the greatest rock n'roll songs ever written, performed by 15 highly talented singers / performers. It also had (in my opinion) the most intimate senses, good sensations, surprises in all the televisions in reality. It actually made me pour tears of happiness for the winner! Throughout the 13 weeks of the television contest, the audience became acquainted and familiar with all the competitors. After 30 episodes, the remaining competitors seemed to be friends rather than just a few strangers who were fighting each other in a reality TV show. And the fact that INXS has been and is still one of the biggest rock n Roll EVER has just added to the emotional tension created by this series of wonderful reality. If you do not have the recorded series, the ROCK STAR: INXS DVD is an excellent alternative.
