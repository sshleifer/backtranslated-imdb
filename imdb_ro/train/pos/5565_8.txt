I am a fan of C & C, returning to their recordings and liked this film, but at some point in the mid-1980s, on cable television in San Jose California, it was broadcast with an alternative plot line destroyed the whole point of the movie. All references to marijuana have been replaced by "diamonds". The bag that "Red" leaves Chong has diamonds in it instead of marijuana, but the conversation remains the same ("... worth ~ $ 3000 / lb"). There's also a subplot where extraterrestrial clips have been added to a ship, observing C & C and talking to each other about diamonds. In the end, instead of "coke of space", there is something else. I'm not sure who created this version, but it was horrible and obviously trying to make him / her friendly with the family / child. It would have been better if this network had not broadcast at all.
