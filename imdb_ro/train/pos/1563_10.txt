I liked this episode. It's so great that all five of them equip and stop LutherCorp and save the world. I also love this episode because Kyle Gallner (Bart Allen / Impulse) and Justin Hartley (Oliver Queen / Green Arrow) are the guests who play in it! I just hope that Clark will join the League of Justice and we will be following this group of heroes on the globe! =) It was very exciting and keeps interested viewers because of what's going to happen next. I think Chloe should join the team as the Watchtower, which would be so strange for her to do it outside the Daily Planet because she has no super powers. I also want to find out what types of Lex topics they use for 33.1, I wonder what other types of powers other people have in the world!
