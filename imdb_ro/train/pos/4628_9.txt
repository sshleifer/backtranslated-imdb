One of the best parts of Sundance is to watch movies that you would have almost certainly wanted. Unless you are a true art house follower, you probably do not get much documentation. Only one hand gets any recognized distribution. Fortunately, Sundance has increased its commitment to documenting in recent years. Shakespeare Behind Bars is a powerful documentary about a dramatic production group at Luther Luckett Correction Complex in LaGrange, Kentucky. Every year, a group of inmates present a Shakespearean game. Director Hank Rogerson and his team watch the band, the role being self-selected, played, repeated, and eventually accomplished. The film is full of fascinating revelations for those of us who have not been exposed to prison environments. Despite the labels we know (convicted, offender, killer, etc.), we began to appreciate and respect these people as a sense of thinking about human beings. Serendipitously, songs chosen for the shooting year were The Tempest, with its penetrating concentration on forgiveness and redemption. The actors struggle with the relevance of the play for their lives, finding patterns and parallels with their characters and the meaning of drama. For a documentary, like a book, the best things to be hoped for is that we are experimenting with something that changes our lives. Shakespeare Behind Bars was a personal revelation to me. "A new courageous world that has such creatures in it."
