Jane Eyre has always been my favorite novel! When I came across this movie version in the late '90s, I was ecstatic! This is the best and the most complete version of the movie about the movie! This version is a bit long to sit in a sitting, but it's worth it. Timothy Dalton is amazing as Rochester. I was glad they threw an ordinary actress (Zelah Clark) like Jane and not a glamorous person. I like sets and location. For anyone who is a true fan of Jane Eyre, this is the version to watch! For those you are interested in, I just found this version on DVD. I've almost seen my VHS copy close to breaking, so I was thrilled to find it on DVD.
