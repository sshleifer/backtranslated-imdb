The person who wrote the review "enough with sweat and spitting already" has no meaning on what is cultural, literary or psycho-critical. He rejects Zizek's interpretations because they do not seem "in line" with what the director initially intended. So what? The importance of the intention of a director (or an author) is not important in critical theory. This is known as the intentional "Fallacy" of the author and should be avoided. Http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_fallacy A text or a movie can be analyzed through a series of theories, many of which disagree with others, and completely ignore the intention of the author. This is the most fundamental idea of ​​critical theory. For this reason, anyone who wrote that text wall lost much time and effort to insult Zizek. In fact, anyone who will study the theory will immediately discredit this typical opinion (I suggest you should have it too) because it is completely out of the way. <br /> <br /> That being said ... If you are all interested in Freudian, Laconian or Kristevian Discourse, this film is a necessity. Link these theories to a popular movie, making them much more palpable and enjoyable than simply reading or thinking.
