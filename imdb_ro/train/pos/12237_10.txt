Mating is a charming, wonderful movie from the past. Hollywood must consider a charming remake of this film. My wife and I will go see her. It's a great romantic comedy that my wife and I have watched the AMC. This movie has Tony Randall at the best. Debbie Reynolds is great, as always. <br /> <br /> I liked it. We plan to order DVDs to add to our growing collection of movies. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that Hollywood does not make such movies. <br /> <br /> Hey Hollywood .... time to dig some of these types of scripts from the old safe, update them a little (without destroying the original movie and the script as you did with other remakes ) and hold a distribution call. A remake would be a big hit on silver screen, DVD, and cable / SATTV. SN Austin, TX
