I honestly think this was the best version of the world war I've seen. It was fun, but it was also educational I learned the whole movie and if I could have this movie. my favorite part was when the soldiers killed the robot and another came right behind her. in the last war of the world I think it should have been more like the first and it would have been better. but any way I give this movie 2 fingers up. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ,
