I saw this movie on real movies (which made me skeptical), but actually - it was good. Why? Not because of stunning plotting or amazing dialogue (of which there is little), but because, in fact, despite what people say, I thought the film was correct in describing teenagers who were dealing with pregnancy. Dawson's Creek, they are not graceful, wonderful witch characters who are bracing through sexuality with effortless knowledge. They are children and behave like children. <br /> <br /> They are confusing, weird and annoyingly confused about everything. Yes, this could be accidental and could be just bad actors, but I do not think so. Dermot Mulroney gives (when he does not try to be cool) a very credible performance and I loved it for that. Patricia Arquette is tormented and annoying, but was she pregnant and adolescent? The combination of the two is not exactly lavender on the pillow. The plot was VERY predictable, but what? I believed them, his stress and his inability to cope - her brave attempts but easy to deceive to bring them closer. I think that the characters, acting by anyone else, would have been really annoying and unbelievable, but they were not. She reflects the surreality of her situation, she's in the classroom and she's on the campus with her baby. I felt angry about it, I felt angry that she was such a child and that I was blaming her. I felt it all. Finally, I liked it and recommended it. Beware of Dermot Mulroney's scene deriving from the disastrous counseling session - career performance.
