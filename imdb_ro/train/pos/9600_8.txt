This movie is a moving story about an adventure by Darius Weems, 15 years old. Darius has Duchenne muscular dystrophy, an unnecessary illness that took his brother's life at the age of 19 and is the number one killer in the United States. He and a few close friends travel across the country to Los Angeles to customize his MTV wheelchair, Pimp My Ride, one of his favorite shows. The journey begins in Georgia, where Darius grew up and never left. The headband is heading west for a trip that all participants will never forget. Darius arrives for the first time in a boat, travels in a hot air balloon, swim in the ocean, and visits the visits he has always wanted to see as Grand Canyon and New Orleans. The directors here clearly have an emotional bond with the material. They do not make money from DVD sales of $ 20. $ 17 goes to disease research and $ 3 goes to make more kids. The film has won over 25 awards at festivals and I agree with Variety's quotation, "Is It Mixing Hearts?"
