This is a real candy for the eyes. A world of floating islands and flying in ancient cities. Giant monsters, whose favorite method of attack is to move cathedrals to their opponents ... Who can resist? An ancient prophecy, a heap of heroes and a cute princess looking for her hero ... sound familiar ...? Yes, I've heard that song before. But you will forget that while looking at the spectacular scenery. This movie is fun to watch while it lasts. But once you've left the cinema, you'll miss a lesser story. What's behind the 30-year circle? What led the crazy knight? Who built all these fabulous monuments, castles and cities ... and why is it collapsing? And besides that bunch of farmers, where are the people? Indeed, this image seems so interesting, but it's not Lord of the Rings.
