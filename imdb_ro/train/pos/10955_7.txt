I initially marked Sarah's show with a beautiful fat of eight, but I fought a little with her late humor and a thin 7 is what is set inside. I'll explain. You will want Sarah's humor or not. If not, I doubt someone can convince you. You know who you are and is perfect, but you know that too. Going forward, the first season gave us fantastic bites about Sarah, her friends and family, and her quests alive. In a memorable episode, she is "pulled" by the officer Jay she meets for the first time. - Do you know why I'm staying here? he asks. - Because you got all C in high school? responds oddly. It sounded like a real question. - It's funny stuff in my book. Sarah can come to you from strange angles. In another episode, her relationship with God was particularly amusing. God being small and jealous has added wonderful joke. It's smart, it's a resounding view, but it would show us the truth in humor and I laughed. Then came the second season. While I still did not miss a new and inventive comedy, I seem to get somewhat out of junk jokes and joke simply. I have some good laughs here and there, but much of it looks like stuffing, while she and the writers are trying to capture some original materials. Sophomoric and tiring are the feelings I have for episodes lately, but I've destroyed it for the stones they find (the turtle) and waiting for her to turn her back. I was a fan of her routine "Jesus is Magic" and I would like to think I understand what she is capable of. Let's get back to this.
