I saw this movie of luck, just because I'm going through a phase in which I had a new admiration for Bill Pullman and I wanted to see all his recent movies and thank God for doing it! This movie has stayed with me since then and remains one of my favorites! The story revolves around two girls embarking on a dramatic journey into a foreign country where they will learn the true meaning of freedom. Alice and Darlene were just trying to spend a holiday together before going to college, but their journey ended up in a much more complicated story. The struggle I'm going through is arrested in Thailand and becomes prisoner is very moving and intense. The actress is stunning, the extraordinary images, the soundtrack is fantastic and so correct for the movie and the message is definitely transmitted. In fact, I can not even find the right words to describe how this movie makes me feel every time I watch it. I know some people did not appreciate as much as I did by rating the movie, but I swear you have to see! I promise she will stay with you!
