An interesting way to look at how often we behave as we usually are blinded by our desire to attain perfection, that sometimes we destroy the foundation of what we are trying to achieve. It also addresses the issue of how we tend to ignore those of us who are not as bold, and thereby lose a great opportunity. Comedy Injection also makes viewing the movie a pleasant experience. I have to see for anyone who is interested in a reflective but comic look at life. I look forward to the next product. I hope you will continue to provide us with quality entertainment services. Excellent work ...... Joanne
