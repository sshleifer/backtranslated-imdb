An amorous melodrama? thanks in particular to Ronald Colman's central performance, who won the Oscar? about a frequently treated theme: the nature of acting and how it can overcome the perception of reality. In this case, do we have a well-known spectator who approaches "Othello" to Shakespeare, so that the last third of the film actually takes on the genre of the thriller? with Edmond O'Brien (who really happens to be sued with Colman's co-star and former wife, Signe Hasso) "investigating" the actor's possible involvement in the Desdemona-type strangulation of the waitress looking for celebrities Shelley very thin Winters). The theatrical / New York theater of the immediate post-war era is captured alive by scriptwriter Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon and legendary actor George Cukor (all nominated by the Academy); the incident attracted a second Oscar for Miklos Rozsa's eclectic score. Colman, forever a suave man, blessed except for a soft voice, does Shakespeare quite well? gaining the conviction that even his character slips into obsessive jealousy, murderous rage, and ultimately a paranoia; however, he is not disappointed with a cast that includes director Ray Collins, reporter Millard Mitchell, detective Joe Sawyer and coroner Whit Bissell. Although the middle section is a bit tense, the film faces any deficiencies with an expressionist denunciation of remarkable maneuverability.
