"Atlantis: The Lost Empire" was all that the preview indicated it would be. You will not often find this. Most of the time, previews show only the best parts and then the rest of the movie is terrible. It's not like that. I was delighted with the original plot, even if the sub-parcels were not. The animation was not broken as "Shrek," but it was good, though. The plot and story line were well presented and there were only a few slow points in them. That's what interests you. I woke up enjoying it. "Atlantis" receives and keeps attention. You also have to think a little, but not too much. Once you think a little about this, you can figure out what's going to happen, but you really do not know how it will happen. Casting was also good. Michael J. Fox, because Milo was an excellent choice. His personality fits nicely. Commander Rourke, who was upset, was well-chosen with James Garner. His character reminded me of the show in "Maverick," which I also liked. I really liked the casting of Claudia Christian as Helga Sinclair. Her ability to play a personality without nonsense makes the movie more exciting. It's too bad he's a bitch. Everywhere, you certainly deserve it while (8 out of 10).
