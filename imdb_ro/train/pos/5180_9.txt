There is this private camp in Plymouth, Massachusetts, which was around 1959. My grandparents were among his founders, my parents had a site since 1965, and the two brothers have sites there. This has nothing to do with the movie, carry me with me.) I spent the summer at Blueberry Hill since I was 5 years old when I was 18 years old and it's for people like me talking about this movie: those for whom a group camp in the forest was, as my fiancé says about me, "good and happy place". If you have never experienced your lifestyle, Indian summer will probably be lost for you; do not bother. It does not have fast rhythms, it does not have quick cuts, parcels are in no way complicated, have no explosions, a dramatic tension as there is easy, there are actors A-list, there is no kind of torment to show how clever the screenwriters (other than Kimberley Williams's killer about how her fiancé should not "toss her toys"). It's not at least about what this film is about, anything other than the godfather is a bad blow just because it has a lot on the screen gore. But the Indian summer is the opposite of the polar God. read more, just do it. <br /> <br /> For me, this is a 9/10 movie.
