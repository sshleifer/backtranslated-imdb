Being an Austrian, this was a straight shot in front of me. Fortunately, they do not live anywhere near the place where this film takes place, but unfortunately portray everything that the rest of Austria hates about the Viennese people (or people close to this region). And it is very easy to read that this is exactly the intention of the directors: let your head sink into your hands and say, "Lord, how can it be possible!". No, not with me, club scene (in my opinion) totally exaggerated, uncensored, is not necessary, I'm looking at pornography, sure, but in this context I was rather disgusted than sitting in the right context. > This movie tells about how deceitful people suffering from a lack of education or bad company are trying to survive and live in a world of layoffs and dull horizons. A girl who is treated as a slut by her super-jealous lover (and still returns), a female teacher who discovers her masochism, putting the life of the super-cruel "beloved" on the line, a couple a cycle almost every day of mathematics (she is the "official replacement of her ex-husband"), a couple who has just divorced and the former husband suffers under the acts of his ex-wife, obviously having a relationship with her masseuse and eventually a hitchhiker asks his drivers the most unusual questions and stretches his nerves through mere over-annoyance. After you've seen it, you feel almost nothing. You are not really shocked, sad, depressed or feel like you're doing something ... Maybe that's why I gave her 7 points, made me react in a way I never reacted. If it is good or bad it is up to you!
