This is not a love song. One of my summary words for this movie would be "excellent". Probably will not appeal to the public watching movie? is a movie that forces you to participate. You notice, think and ask questions. Comparisons could be made with Deliverance and perhaps with the Blair Witch Project for a general shooting style. > <br /> However, this movie is unique against the two. <br /> <br /> The effects of cinema (solar, frost, blur, etc.) have been seen before, but they are most effectively used in this film to support the natural tension of the story. The action is gross, threatening and completely credible. The real theme of the movie is about friendship; the title really offers the game away. It is probably not the kind of friendship we have experienced or even want to do. It's a love song.
