Wow. I loved the whole series and am shocked by the comments of some people who thought it was bad. Perhaps it has filled a little in the seasons 4 and 5, remaining better than anything else on television. But 6 and especially 6b were beautiful permutations on themes developed in the first three seasons of the muscles. <br /> <br /> 6B started with such a gloomy attitude and Janice's intuition was always eager for family aggression - that line full of doctrine about knowing Tony's inclination to sit and look. Anyone who has lost his implications for the rest of the series does not know Tony. Melfi's discomfort over his psychiatric study and his references to the self-deceiving self-deception of a pet and animal pet sociopathic return to the first episodes of the series, saying that Tony's panic attack on ducks leaves his pool and resonates with "bye" at his grandchildren before the final episode's graceful blow (not to fall into Chase's dark humor). We could go further, but I will add that I thought that finally, starting from Vanilla Fudge's opening strains, to deliver the irony prefect ("You Keep Me Hangin 'On") until the end moments in which Tony retiring in childhood with his family in tow or separate explosions like AJ's SUV or Phil's head were totally perfect PERFECT. The best TV ever. <br /> <br /> Pretty good in a dying environment that pathologically delivers fantasies of "jack-off fantasies" AJ derides (and then he succeeds promptly). A hint of pork plates to Mr. Chase.
