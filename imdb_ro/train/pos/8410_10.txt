In this really fascinating, dark film, a young poor student sells his soul to the devil for a lot of money, but the devil takes his picture in the mirror (this is done brilliantly in the movie and pressed when Balduin, the student is earlier practicing a sword in front of the mirror), a visual metaphor for a "man in war with himself", which represents his immediate future. The student enjoys his money, but the woman he loves is untouchable (he made a pact with the devil, is cut forever for love and other riches of the soul) you can have love or you can change your soul for money , you can not both. Baldwin is haunted by his double (the intertitle expresses this beautiful as the action.) Some of the scenes are incredible, the sense of doom when disappearing with the devil of Balduin is amazing, as is the sense that his pact has cut him forever from human society (the scene where he runs away from his double and ends up in the "deserted countryside" on the outskirts of the city is no longer entirely human (loses his soul) he is like an animal hunted outside human society Who is an actor and a director amazing, my cultural hero who helps you if you know a little about German history at the time of this film and about the German doppelganger Traditions (do not find google, get a correct book) Remember, it's a very early film , is a little bit stingher, but considering what has to say and is tragic, it is one of the best ever!)
