DO NOT judge this production of the 2-hour version that was launched on VHS in the US, which is a mess and incomprehensible misery. I was pleased to watch the full 6-hour version available on DVD in the UK and was scared. The deliberate rhythm and the growing sense of threat are fascinating, as does the amazing visual and aural landscape; this is an old Rome I have not seen before and much more authentic than the biggest one. Director Franco Rossi was celebrated for the 1968 The Odyssey mini-series, and this mini-series is just as strong. Just as Bekim Fehmiu has become Ulysses' best screen, Klaus Maria Brandauer may be Nero's best screen. Now I hope to see Rossi's version of The Aeneid (Eneide) that was broadcast on Italian television in 1971. I am anxious about what version of QUO VADIS is stronger, this or the Polish mini-series since 2001; each has different virtues and in many ways they complement one another. Of course, any of them turns over that Hollywood championship with Peter Ustinov.
