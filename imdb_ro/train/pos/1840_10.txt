Great scenario and some of the best actors the world has ever produced. Montand gives the concept of police detective "a single wolf" a new dimension of intensity and, most importantly, credibility. When a typical childhood hero in Hollywood loses his family, friends and pets to kill him usually given a minute of pain. But when it ends sixty seconds, he gathers himself, packs his gun, and joyfully casts his enemies one by one. Marc Ferrot of Montand, however, is devastated - by the murder of his girlfriend, of course, but also by having learned that he has another lover. In his confusion and wrath, no revenge is sought, but he must continue to find the true perpetrator of a crime in which his fingerprints are everywhere. Thus all his actions become inevitably logical. This is the main reason why this film sticks to our places but is not the only one.
