Stewart is a distinguished bachelor and a successful executive who is about to marry Janice Rule's fianc√©e but instead gets involved with a sensual (Kim Novak) art dealer who turns out to be a Village witch Greenwich? Novak wants to love him with seriousness and intensity, but he can not feel it ... Stewart falls in love with her and looks for a way to free her from her witch spell ... Novak resembles her well-intentioned concern, just like like her Siamese cat, Pyewacket ... Still, Stewart continues in her attempts to change her into a loving woman, feeling she aspires to marry her ... <br /> <br /> Keeping her way, are such talented actors as Novak's brother (Jack Lemmon), a fresh and charming sorcerer who can walk through the walls; a terrible author who writes a book of witchcraft; and the Head of the Witchcraft Association in Manhattan, none other than the incredible Hermione Gingold ... Novak's Queen's Aunt (Elsa Lanchester), unlike her other relatives, is a witch who accepts that nothing must hinder the course of true love. She helps and motivates them to turn Novak into Stewart's dream woman for a happy ending ...
