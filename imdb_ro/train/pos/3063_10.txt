A director for the first time (Bromell) gathered a small but powerful cast to look at the world of a middle-aged middle-aged man, a depressed man and his struggle with his father. This film in less than 90 minutes presents an incredibly interesting contrast in human nature. David Dorfman, as a son of William H. Macy for 6 years, is the coolest little actor I've ever seen. Macy is brilliant in a part that almost seems to be written for him as a single torture struggling to break the reins of his father and his business. It's always great to see Donald Sutherland and here's great as Macy's father. The alternative audio track of the movie deserves to hear the director explaining how he chose the pieces, locations, and filmed the movie. Dolby 2 Dolby Sound is suitable for this movie and is well recorded. Cinema creates a mood along with a very subtle musical background. Any director or observer of human nature will enjoy this, especially if he is a fan of contradiction.
