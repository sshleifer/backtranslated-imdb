This cartoon is short on the fence, but it's a stunning piece of view. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> /> More, withdraw. Both the gnomes and the storm have their own songs. That's pretty much the plot, as it is. But this cartoon is not related to the plot - it's about color and animation. The visuals are exceptional. Back in 1936, such a bright color was still something new and there is an incredibly inspired work here. My favorite moments of shortness surround the movement of liquefied colors through pipes. At more than one point, there are a series of pipes aligned in a row, from the shortest to the tallest, and the colors move through the pipes, and the musical piece seems to make the row a pipe organ. <br /> <br /> The images of the struggle between emerging greenery and the winter storm that refuses to leave quietly are extremely well executed. These types of shorts were things that Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising know, but probably contributed to their final departure from MGM because this cartoon probably exceeded the budget, and MGM decided that they can control the costs more well if the animation department was administered by someone less aware of the costs than Harman and Ising were. This is really a beautiful cartoon and it's worth seeing. It's available on the character's Attack DVD of the 1930s. Recommended, especially if you like the good animation.
