Cowboys James Stewart and Walter Brennan take their flock from Seattle to Alaska and Canada to make a complaint. Once there, they have to face a seductive, disturbing businesswoman, Ruth Roman, and an overwhelmingly frustrated ice-cheater, lucky lucky James McIntire. John Wayne can talk about more, but his good friend, Stewart some excellent western, with strong edges, some with the great director Anthony Mann. Honestly, I would take this with robust action sequences and fine melodrama, across the North to Alaska any day! Far Country has some amazing landscapes and cinema that should have been shot in wide screen. <br /> <br /> There is also strong support by Brennan, Roman (who is awesome), incredibly cute Corrine Calvet and James McIntire, who play one of my favorite kind of bad guys, do not get too seriously. This would make a large double invoice with another highly recommended, Mann / Stewart, located in the northwest, Bend Of The River.
