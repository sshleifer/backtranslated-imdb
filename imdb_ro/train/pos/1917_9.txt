It was an amazing comedy with an extraordinary cast. John Ritter and Katey Sagal were perfectly thrown as parents, and the children were great too. Kaley Cuoco was a good choice to play Bridget, which was Kelly Bundy's toni-down version from Married to Children. Writing and performance were such a premium. Unfortunately, John Ritter died during the series, and put a damper on things. They had to struggle to change the show and to bring more casting members, and obviously it was an inconvenient situation, but they treated him well. James Garner was a good addition. It could have taken longer if Ritter lived. I loved it especially when Ed O'Neill brought it to a guest place. Was awesome. <br /> <br /> *** from ****
