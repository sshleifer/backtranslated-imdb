I've seen the fair share of comedy and stand-up movies, but it's so original, so fresh that it will make you wonder why you've always been on the right in the video store. Murphy has some pretty jokes, but it's too fun to get through. If only every movie could be so funny. should be called "107 minutes of the most incredible comedy" Murphy is a comedian genius in this movie and will make you say "this is the guy who did Dr. Doulittle!" Talk about ice cream man, mothers throwing shoes, aunt with mustache, racism, and anything else you could think about and what you could not do. Please, if you ever see a comedy in your life, that's if all the movies could be Delirious.
