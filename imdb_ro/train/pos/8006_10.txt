This is a great game! Okay, maybe they did not have some of the features they should have, but Digital Anvil has yet to come up with a good game. There is a certain resemblance to Elite (you can trade, pick up weapons and cargo from destroyed ships, go on missions), but this game has a very scenario mission. It's a great mission. The control system is different that your mouse is using! In principle, you fly in space around a system and make your way up! The game has pretty good graphics even though it was made in 2003. It should work well even on a modest PC specified. The story features a great voice from John Rhys Davies, George Takei, Jennifer Hale (she appears in every computer game). Stick with the story gets better and better as it happens. There is even a race section where you and your opponent have to bend your spaceships around a course (involves passing through the rings). This section took me a while to knock. This adds variety to the game. Some sections are a little harsh here and there, but generally you can beat this game. The game has an active fashion scene on the net. Choose a few ways to expand the game. I have not played anymore. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, a continuation of this has been canceled, a shame!
