This movie has improved my opinion about Errol Flynn. While Flynn is, of course, best known for savoir-faire and sprezzatura (to throw some European terms!), This film gives him the opportunity to stretch (albeit a little) as an actor, a social climber with an ego great and a sense of nerves to fit. The supporting tower is excellent; everyone seems to be well-chosen for their roles. The story is moving sharply, and though it is not particularly profound (it is perhaps intentionally losing the opportunity to make social remarks about the massive uneven distribution of income at that time), it certainly distracts and satisfies. From what I know about Jim Corbett, the story is also quite faithful to history. I also enjoyed the wonderful representations of the 1880s in San Francisco. Generally, it's a bit you do not like this movie ... it's worth a lot of time to watch it.
