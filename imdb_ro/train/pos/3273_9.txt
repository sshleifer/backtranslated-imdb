I give only 9 out of 10, because I have to see it again in a more current thinking frame to have a new perspective. What I remember is an amazing psychological thriller that smiled at my brain and eyes when I looked at it. I would forget every time he came to HBO that day (probably in 1990 or so). I could even record it, but this record has been gone for a long time, I'm sure. I've written to GreenCine to try to get this title, it's not the one to wear. I hope I can find her at a local movie store. We highly recommend trying if you find her somewhere. It's interesting at least. If you enjoyed movies like Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, Gummo or anything else weird and along these lines, try this.
