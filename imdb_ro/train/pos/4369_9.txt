I liked this movie. The landscape was stunning, the plot had some beautiful breaths, and the characters were well rounded. On two fronts, however, "Rob Roy" scored well above the media. First of all, I rarely saw a "popular" movie in which the quality of the dialogue was so great. There were many verbal hits and tractions to accompany spirits with brilliant choreography. I could give you many examples, but why should I do that? Just watch the movie. Secondly, this film understood a rarely recognized principle. For a drama to succeed, she needs not only a hero, but a true credible character. If you do not have one, there is not much joy in the rooting for the good boys. And "Rob Roy" has none, but three - the Count of Montrose, Kilairn's fool and Archie. Not one-dimensional bastards, but, all in all, very strong and very ugly. It takes more patience than "Braveheart" - there is more dialogue and the accents are a little harsh, but it's a much smarter and more subtle piece. (As I said, I liked this movie!)
