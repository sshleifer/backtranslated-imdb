Now this show looks like most of the other shows of its kind since the mid-90s, but the only thing about this is that it's different, they use a lot of comedy and action in this and maybe a bit of drama also. I personally thought it was a good show, I do not understand why it would cancel it. The best thing is that the fans of this show are still alive since 1997 until now. We hope the BM will bring back the show or even make a movie that I know will make it impossible to do, but hey does not hurt to dream, is it? Anyway, I would recommend if you did not see it to find the DVD of the 13 episodes, because the characters are wonderful, the story lines are good, the comedy is good and good, the whole show is great.
