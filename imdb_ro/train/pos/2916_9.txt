Of all the movies I've seen and which are most of them, this is by far the best accomplished, which is first of all in terms of US navies (Blimps) during World War II. Yes, there are other good LTA videos, but most use special effects more than any real-time photos. This man's marina has a more real-time real-time recording with balms, etc. True, a lot of corny dialogue, but that makes even more interesting Hollywood movies, even today. P.S. We spent 10 years (out of 20) and we had more than 5,000 hours in all naval marches from 1949 to 1959. A proud member of the Naval Airship Association, etc. [ATC (LA / AC) USN Retired]
