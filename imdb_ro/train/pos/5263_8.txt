Netflix should mention this short feature on information about silk stockings. Superior in all respects to excessive bread produced. This was much better with Cole Porter's songs and much more energy. Silk silk proved to be a great disappointment. Fred had become too old for such things, though the dances and the Cyd are wonderful. I'll be on the clock for the Garbo version - Melvyn Douglas from Ninotchka. Was Peter Lorre ill during silk stocking - does he seem to be very passive in more active numbers and with fewer lines? I'm glad I ran over Paree-Paree for a crash. It made the whole experience much more enjoyable. Bob Hope, as a simple "song and dance man," is pure joy.
