I did not know anything about the movie before watching, and I think it was the "no-expectation" factor that helped me endure at the beginning and later as much as I anticipated. The setting was interesting, weird but interesting. The story had goals / leaps that I think cast the audience on the legs. There is no great soundtrack to play in the background, creating the "romantic" ambience. BUT they have not disputed this. The chemistry between Emma and Luis was simply refined. It was an unexplained strange chemistry that I could not withstand; I fell in love with this and from here, I write this review. The subtle image of love by the two actors was superb and I think it is the core of this film. This movie is not a romantic comedy everyday; in fact, we will not all appreciate this. I had to sit a little and then I began to understand the things I did not get at first. I can not guarantee everyone will like it, but I hope you do that.
