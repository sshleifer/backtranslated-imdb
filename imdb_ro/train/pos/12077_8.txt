He enjoyed this thriller movie about the mysterious young man in 1945 about a young woman, Nina Foch (Julia Ross), who does not work and has fallen into rent and is willing to find her job. Julia reads an ad in the London local newspaper looking for a secretary and is quick to try to get this position. Julia gets her position and is hired by Mrs. Hughes (Dame May Witty), who asks her to live with her employer in her home and wants her not to engage with male friends, and Julia tells them she has no family and that she is free to dedicate herself to this job all the time. George Macready (Ralph Hughes) is Ms. Hughes's son and has some strange wishes to play with knives. It was a low budget film, and most of the scenes were close to avoid background costs and landscape costs. This strange family lives in a huge mansion on the English Channel in Cornwall, and there are secret doors and lots of suspense.
