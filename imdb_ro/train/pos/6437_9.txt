A prominent ruler decides after a heart attack to return to the village where he was born to live a peaceful life. There, he comes in Dutch with the choir of the local church, which will change his life. I have no expectations when I first saw this film yesterday; I love watching foreign movies that are not English and I have already seen some Swedish movies in my life, but this was the best so far. Where should I begin? In my opinion, this film is a jewel, thanks to many things, one of which is a remarkable action. Michael Nyqvist is perfect as conductor Daniel Daréus, thoughtful, almost shy and dedicated. The beautiful Frida Hallgren is delighted with her beautiful smile and her subtle actor. Choir members are well-developed, exciting characters, each with their own story. This film tells a beautiful story about music, love, pain, memory, death, about a man who has devoted his life to music and who is trying to create a calm existence in the village where he was born while trying to make peace with the past and the way he lived his life until then. Kay Pollack shows us that the Swedes are remarkable film makers. Go see Så som himmelen, it's a movie that makes you think of life and love, and that's also comforting, somehow.
