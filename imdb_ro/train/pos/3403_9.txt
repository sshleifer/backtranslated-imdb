The superb Techicolor product tells the unusual story of romance between a woman with strong religious faith and a trapist monk who left the monastery in violation of her vows. The film opens in a monastery in Europe, where a former student prays - a marvelous beauty in black called Domini (Marlene Dietrich). She is advised by the Superior Mother to go to the desert and find herself and lose her pain to her dying father recently. In the train car on the road to the Sahara is next to a very, very troubled man (Charles Boyer) - our former monk. She is soon at a hotel next to an oasis of palm trees, where she sees our mysterious young man again, who is troubled by what she has to do when she is confronted by a very seductive dancing girl. Domini becomes friends with him, though he does not know anything about his past - romance will soon follow. This film is sentimental, melodramatic and different (somewhat surreal and even a bit camouflaged) it was fun and fun. The photo in this sense is really exciting - it is full of extreme wallpapers and beautiful color images of horse caravans crossing the desert, silhouette figures against a sunset sky. Marlene Dietrich gives a wonderful interpretation, though retained, and looks gorgeous. Charles Boyer - is not usually one of my favorites - he is actually pretty good at it, I think his side fits and he looks pretty young and beautiful too. Vasile Rathbone is fine here, except there is not much to do. Another great orchestral score by Max Steiner helps to keep dramatic shooting - as a whole, a very pleasant film.
