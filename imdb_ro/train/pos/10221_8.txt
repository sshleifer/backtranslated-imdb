Faith and Mortality ... seen through the lenses of an Ashkenazi Jewish-American gentleman and an younger African-American Jewish gentleman who reconsiders between being in contradiction with each other and with clear discussions about how they took place their lives over the years. . <br /> <br /> Mostel's character is a tailor with chronic back problems, and a sickly terminal wife; Belafonte's character is a career enthusiast who never carries a regular job and a fatal car accident leaves him in a strange Purgator - he has to persuade Mostel to renew his faith because he has failed together with his wife's health) .. but Belafonte's Levine has her own problems as she penetrates for her girlfriend she left behind. Belafonte's character leaves the movie before it's apparent, and the end is cryptic, and the film somehow suffers from its ambiguous ending. This is not a "typical" Hollywood movie about ethnic relations or the crisis of a person of faith. It is worthwhile to look at and appreciate the excellent performances of the main actors. .
