Hey, now I can not claim to have seen all of Jesse (Jesus) Franco's movies, and there are a lot of them, but that's one of the best (and heavier) of the lot I've ever seen. I would most probably say he was in his first back in the late sixties and early seventies and nothing lately was a little strange to me, and it takes a long time for me to declare this. However, this is a great dream, where some seem to happen at different points. This woman is an actress or something, she plays it in a theater in Berlin where "false" torture acts are made for an appreciative audience (?!) And it seems she has this problem with dreaming. Capturing what is real and what is not in this movie is, apparently, the real thing is in the spotlight and dream things are not. It seems to be in a vu already. I will not say that this makes sense, but it is quite wild and weird and fun. Shots of Berlin make it seem like a lonely and creepy place to gather in the atmosphere. The end is extremely steep, yet the movie is over and the tape has become black, I do not think I should let you know it was over at that moment. My copy was from the Euro-Trash collection in Anchor Bay, and I say, give me more Euro-trash, I can not do enough shit. But it is good shit.
