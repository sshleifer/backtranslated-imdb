I like to buy those cheap and unpleasant DVDs from Alpha Video. One day, I happened to buy it. It's the perfect science fiction movie of the 1950s, all sexes. Fearing with all that is unknowing, girls dressed in shadow and a lot of melodrama, it's a nice movie for those who appreciate such things. And if you can suspend enough confidence, you can do it, not just the psychotic head or the beating of things in the closet, but all the way to the "perfect body" character. It's so . . . . what other word for mind?
