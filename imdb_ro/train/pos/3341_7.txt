I saw this movie on Thursday night after we had a very boring day. We had no expectations, the ones we had were rather negative. Being the only movie I've ever watched Jimmy is the American version of Taxi with Queen Latifah (?) ... do not ask why! But seriously .. this movie is so cute! Drew Barrymore is always sweet, but I almost fell in love with Fallon's character. Why can not I meet a cute madman like that. :) Movies like this are excellent. Simple, sweet and necessary. Sunday on Thursday. I'm not even a sports fan, but there's something about American baseball movies that fascinate me. Probably the fact that we do not have this sport in Norway. <br /> <br /> (My first ever comment.) Haha
