What if Marylin Monroe, Albert Einstein, Joe Dimaggio, and Senator McCarthy come together in a revolting evening of relativity? This delicious Roman Ã  clef never uses the real names of the characters so thin veils and damning expressions not only for the individuals they must have been, but also for what they came to represent in time. If you are confused by the allegory or if you like your movies served up to predigested and mushy, you will not enjoy this movie. It is a pretentious opus that rewards many spectators with intelligence to appreciate it. <br /> <br /> Rather dropping the rigorous avoidance of using the real names of the characters, we see Einstein on the verge of conveying a pacifist speech to a United Nations because he was Marylin Monroe after filming the famous "Seven Year Itch" which some say has led to the end of his marriage to Joe Dimaggio. They have a delightful interface in which Einstein stops with a proper professional quit around the probably innocence of the greatest symbol of sex in the modern age. <br /> <br /> Introduce Senator McCarthy who thinks Einstein is a red. He is determined to extract Einstein's assurance that he will support the activities of the Unamerican Executive Committee while delivering the ultimate weapon for peace. Adding Joe, a surprisingly fragile and vulnerable person, is probably not perfectly expressed as Gary Busey, who hates Marylin's exhibitionism and thinks Einstein has become her lover, even if Marylin just wants to show him Einstein understands the Special Theory of Relativity. <br /> <br /> But there are more. <br /> <br /> Like every one of us, these characters have the deepest fears they reveal one by one in flashbacks. These weaknesses finally give humanity to figures we can only help seeing almost exclusively today in the abstract. Finally, we see the shocking terror of Einstein's vision, and the assertion of the film becomes clear. It is a powerful and memorable moment. Insignificance is one of my first five films of all time. It's absolutely amazing.
