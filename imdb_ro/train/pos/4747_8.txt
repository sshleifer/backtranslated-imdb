Anyone who has never seen such battle scenes in The Matrix has never seen this movie. The battle scenes were co-chaired by the action psycho's Yuen Woo Ping, who also fought The Matrix. And battle scenes are something. Li plays a supersoldier who does not feel any pain, who is now living a life like a pacifist librarian (you took me). When other evil supersoliders start killing local drugs to take over the drug trade, Li joins with his police friend to stop them. There are some absolutely crazy things that happen in this movie badguy takes his arm clogged with a glass glass and hardly notices). The battle scene is full of blows and blows; the body count is up there. Li was rarely better and surrounded with a bunch of beautiful female suits (Yip hits a serious foundation like a supersoldier). Anthony Wong even makes a cameo as a drug master (does not overlap there, makes a cameo in every HK movie). It is regrettable that they do not do such action movies in the US; I should not stand by all these horrible doubling things to see what action they want so much. Recommended.
