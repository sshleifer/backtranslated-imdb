I saw this in Detroit in what must have been the initial run. I literally went into the aisle of the theater. It was funny. I have not seen it since, but I would love it. Where do you get a copy of? Anyone who says anything about being dated or mad is, for my money, just a bunch of pose. Each skit is either stupid, erotic, or perversely hilarious. Every! Not a weak one is included. The opening sequence, for example, which parody 2001, has go-go-dancing gorillas with pendulous breasts. Felinni would have filmed her if she were the bad son ... If you come to this film with an open mind and a gentle, gentle heart, you will make it to the best list.
