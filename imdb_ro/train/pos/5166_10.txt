Indian summer! It was very nostalgic for me. I found myself funny, imaginative and absolutely loved! Anyone who went to the camp as a child and sometimes wants to return to "Ole's good days" for a short period of time really needs to see this! Starts after 20 years, a group of old campsites returns for a "reunion." I will not comment on the story anymore, because you have to see it for yourself. The actors were wonderful and contain a cast of stars. Everyone in her played a wonderful role. You really felt it like you were part of a movie watching him. Alan Arkin was especially good at his role as Uncle Lou. He plays a kind of guy that everybody wants in their lives. This is also a good family movie for the most part. I would suggest this to anyone in a heartbeat! Highly recommended!
