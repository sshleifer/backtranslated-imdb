This documentary about Schlockmeister William's Castle takes some cheap photographs in the native environment of the 1950s-60s, in which he made the most characteristic work - look at funny people, nonsense with ghost glasses - but he is also affectionate and lively, with a particularly bright commentary from John Waters, who was absolutely the target audience for such things at the time, and the daughter of Castle, who adored her father, and is also quite perceptive about how he left his craft. (We never know what happened to the other descendants of the castle.) The films were not very good, it is clear, but their marketing was brilliant and it seems to have been a sweet and working family man. Fun people continue to appear, such as Diane Baker's "Straight Jacket," which looks great, and Anne Helm, which she replaced at the instigation of star Joan Crawford. But Darryl Hickman, despite the happy memory of working with The Tingler Castle, has a pretty giggle feeling and we have enough imagination to give us an idea of ​​Castle's talent - not very big but very energetic. A pleasant look at a time when the audience was easier to please and makes you nostalgic for simpler shooting days.
