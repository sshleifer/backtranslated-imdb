This is a great action movie, with a great line from Arnie! It is made with style, with plenty of tense actions to keep a person satisfied. The characters were wonderful, and Richard Dawson is very menacing as the main villain. Yes, it has tons of plot holes, however it is very fun, with a great end as well. She had a great story too, and Arnie and Maria Conchita Alonso had a great chemistry together. Developing the character was also pretty good with some superb performances. The direction is wonderful! Paul Michael Glaser, has a very good job here with a wonderful use of colors, keeping it stylish throughout, great camera angles and generally taking the film at a very fast pace! good job. There's a little gore. We have a few wounds of fire, an exploded head, shaped neck, chain bloody slices, skinless corpses, blood and an impulse. The action is great! Arnold Schwarzenegger is amazing as always, he is excellent in the acting department, has tons of hilarious one liners, hits that ass, and as always is a great physical presence!, And it was tons of fun to watch! (Arnie Rules!). Maria Conchita Alonso, she feels good here, she was very cute and had a good chemistry with Arnie! Yaphet Kotto, is decent here, with what he has to do, which is not too much. Marvin J. McIntyre, he's good as a geeky guy, it was cool! Richard Dawson is great as the main villain and was very threatening and it was fun to look. Jesse Ventura, Jim Brown, Erland van Lidth, Gus Rethwisch, and Professor Toru Tanaka do all they have to do as well as stalkers. You generally have to see! **** 1/2 of 5
