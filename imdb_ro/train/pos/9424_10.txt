For me, this is the most perfect film of Ealing Studio - half a century more fresh and relevant than the day it was released. As a satire on the economic notions of "growth" and the in-built built-in commercial need, it may not be much higher. And from what other film can it be said that the hero simply carries the plot? Oddly, there are parallels with the Jurassic Park, where confusion with the environment will literally turn and bite you. But Spielberg escaped the taste of the brilliant center of the book to get some crap about the "kids." Hmmm. In "The White Man", Alec Guiness plays an idealist scientist who comes with a cloth that never gets dirty and never consumes. Suddenly, workers and mill capital in northern England, where they work, are united as never before in the protection of their livelihoods. Of course being Ealing, it's a comedy, but it's not necessary. The complex interaction of the acquired interests (should they be right?) Beautifully behaves as all parties realize that "progress" is a threat and that decommissioning and waste are what leads to the twisting of the war. But yes, this is a comedy - though one shown - and in the midst of political ironies are delicious performances and some good old-fashioned laughs. But yet that resists - dazzling and white.
