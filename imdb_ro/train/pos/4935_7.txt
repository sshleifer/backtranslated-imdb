In New Orleans, an illegal immigrant feels bad and leaves a poker game while winning the little criminal killer Blackie (Walter Jack Palance). He is pursued by Blackie and his men Raymond Fitch (Zero Mostel) and Poldi (Guy Thomajan), killed by Blackie, and his body is thrown into the sea. During the autopsy, Lieutenant Commander Dr. Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark) of the US Public Health Service found that the dead man suffered from pneumonic plague caused by rats, and that he had to find out who had any contact with the man in the forties - eight hours to avoid an epidemic. The mayor of the city allocates sergeant captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas) to help Dr. Clint find the killers who are infected with the plague and inoculate them. "Panic on the Streets" reveals a simple story, but is still effective with a big villain. The hired land did not become dated after fifty-seven years. Jack Palance plays contemptuous in his debut, and the camera works while trying to escape with Zero Mostel is still very impressive. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Panic in Streets"
