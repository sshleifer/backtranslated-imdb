"Match Point" and now "Scoop" convinced me that not only did Woody Allen do a pure job doing movies in England (and that Scarlett Johansson is a good member), but he corroborated what I've known for years: Let's focus on the new rich neurotics. In this case, Johansson plays Sondra Pransky's journalism student, whom magician Sid Waterman (Allen) puts in the box of disappearance, where he meets the ghost of reporter Joe Strombel (Ian McShane), who tells him that serial killers which was committed by millionaire Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). So she knows it, and ... well, I do not know how much I can tell you without giving it away. But I can say that this is probably Allen's most funny film for years. There is his ubiquitous style of humor (especially the line about his religion). <br /> <br /> So you're sure you like this movie. If not, it will make you fall in love with London. But above all, it's so dizzying. Even if you do not like Woody Allen, you should like that.
