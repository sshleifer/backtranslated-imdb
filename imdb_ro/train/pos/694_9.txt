A nightmare of Insomniac is the story of a man's madness in madness. With chronic insomnia, Jack is affected by hallucinations; causing him to try to determine what is real and what is not. We find out interesting things about Jack near the end and I think until the movie is over, we'll have a "happy after" ending Hollywood. Wrong. This is New York City, the place where no one sleeps. Tess Nanavati (Writer and Director) has a good film in "A Nightmare of Insomnia". A talented screenwriter and scriptwriter (she made this film right after graduating from high school) has real potential and will be one to follow in the near future. As I looked at this short film, I was constantly inconvenient; between music, grim landscapes and realistic portraits of insomnia by Dominic Monaghan (like Jack), I desperately wanted to disable sometimes just to get rid of her.
