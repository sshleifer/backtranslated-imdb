An adaptation of the book "Finding the Fish". This story is about a young troubled sailor Antwone Fisher (Derek Luke) who painfully tells the story of his past to a psychiatrist Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington). A brilliant debut show by Derek Luke and an always amazing performance by Denzel Washington. This movie was incredible on so many levels and I was disappointed that it did not win an Oscar, I think it was because it was released in a bad time, so it was overlooked. We recommend this film to everyone, you will be touched by his story and really will make the audience become empathetic with this young man, who is Antwone Fisher. If you like real inspirational stories, then watch Antwone Fisher. <br /> <br /> Thank you
