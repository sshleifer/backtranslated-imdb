This 1939 film by director John Ford and writer Lamar Trotti tells a fictional story about young lawyer Abraham Lincoln, about his literal attempts and his troubles. It's a sentimental film, reasonably realized, but it's hard to breathe. Casting Henry Fonda as Lincoln seems to be a mistake, because while the actor has the right qualities for this part, even a few centimeters of makeup and a fake nose, it's too nice for honest Abe, which was famously homely. It's a good test from Fonda, which is nothing, if not honest, but his move throws the whole movie. The support style is excellent, but includes Alice Brady, Ward Bond and Donald Meek. But Ford is too reverent in his treatment for Lincoln, who is presented as just shy of a saint, and in the final scene the movie goes higher.
