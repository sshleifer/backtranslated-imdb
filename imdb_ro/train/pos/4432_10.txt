I happily admit that I am a sucker for a great movie and that the moves and camera angles that are sufficiently inventive can be enough to keep my interest in a long film. It is not, however, a length of Gojoe, although it has some of the most remarkable cinemas that I have seen from the Korean song MUSA. However, Gojoe provides much more than beautiful pictures (like MUSA ... which does not involve a contrast) - is the second great power is a gorgeous action and a fascinating story with a very black philosophy. I have to admit I do not really know what she wanted to do in the end, but it certainly causes some thoughts along the way. Vaguely but surely thoughts: A department in which the film could have been better is the action. There is an extraordinary amount of blood in the film, but the action is filmed with hyperkinetic shots and frequently hidden by objects in the foreground. She creates some very intense and impressive visions, but it would have been nice to see some more realistic moves, something that made it more credible that the villains could only go through the whole armies to degrade them all. <br /> <br /> However, the movie is certainly one of the most exciting and beautiful movies I have seen for some time. Recommended!
