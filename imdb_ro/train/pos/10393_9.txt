Let's cut a long story. I liked every minute. A generous fantasy in the true Arabic-night style. There is a bad magician, a beautiful princess, a djinn and everyone lives happily afterwards. Modern Hollywoond certainly has one or two things to learn from this classic. Just searches: Special effects are quite dated (Sabu loved with his djinn's leg, though!)
