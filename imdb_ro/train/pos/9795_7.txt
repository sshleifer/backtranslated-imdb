I've always said that animated movies from Batman were much better than live action movies. I have seen all the animated movies, but the group is the poorest and disappointing. <br /> <br /> "Fantasma Mask" would be the best, then "Best in the World," then "Sub Zero," then "Return of the Joker" <br /> In this animated film the newest, there is a mysterious new batgirl in Gotham and Batman has the intention of discovering whether she is friend or foe while she sets out on a search for revenge. But as Bruce gets involved with three young women, he begins to investigate and discover what the new batgirl is. The tone of this movie is unusually easy, as most films are grim and dark, which was quite disappointing. Bruce acts strangely beyond the character, most of the time, the villains are re-used in the latest movies and, while action scenes are exciting, they are really nothing new. It also misses the dramatic impact of other films, especially the "Sub-Zero," which was hard to develop in dramas and characters. Everything in the movie feels quite recycled, and the supporting characters are charming, but no one deserves to be rooted. All the time, I really liked this, I had an explosion, and the identity of the new batgirl is surprising, but it was not as exciting as I was hoping. <br /> <br /> (** half of ****)
