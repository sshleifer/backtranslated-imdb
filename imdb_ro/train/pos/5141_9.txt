I have to admit I did not expect to see this movie in my Japanese film class, but the movie even let go of me. The director does a wonderful job following his film, portraying really a picture of madness. I think the fact that this film is silent adds to the likeness of madness, helping the spectator to experience the characters of the inner world, rather than the world beyond his mind. This movie has just added to my feelings about silent foreign movies vs. Americans, in the sense that foreign movies work much more to exercise your mind and make you think rather than go to the fluffy film always with the happy ending, exercising little imagination.
