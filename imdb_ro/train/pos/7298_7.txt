This is a crazy scientist who creates half a shark - a half-man culture on an unexplored island, then calls all his old business and academics to come and see his creation (bad laughter) but he really wants the shark to kill them! There are a lot of bad GCI, plotting stuff full of bad luck and babes sweating in tight jerseys. These monster films follow a similar formula, but this smells things with a bit of humor; those who did this had tongues firmly planted in the cheek), not to mention sex sexy. But let's mention those sexy girls - some hot babes in tight jerseys, sweating deeply. Someone's in her bouquets from the beginning, the other at the end. Thanks, thanks, to the bad movie makers! The land is full of naked stuff, a guy driving a jeep, hitting him in a tree, then offering everyone on the island to fly on a helicopter. Yeah, well, how to think a little about that; we will return to you. Sharkman is hilarious - either a terrible CGI or a guy just as comedic in a rubber suit. Crazy science offers quite good performance; he is evil, this is his motivation, he is not excused. Generally, if you want a stupid movie, FUN B, it should do the job.
