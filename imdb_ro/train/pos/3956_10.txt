HUSBANDS BEWARE is a remake of the classic BRIDELESS GROOM from Shemp. The new movie cooking scene at the beginning of the movie is great. Hooks are always funny when I cook them. However, after the first few minutes of recording, I cut off the original film of BRIDELESS GROOM. One thing I noticed about remakes from 1953 to 1956 is that they fit the new story. They make a hit if the old story line does not match. SUSPENDÄ‚ BEWARE has a new end, but I will not give it away to those who want to be surprised. <Br /> <br /> **** of 4 stars.
