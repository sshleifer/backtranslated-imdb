I did not expect too much, but I have to admit that I was walking on the ground laughing a few times during this movie. If you are not offended in the first ten minutes, it could be a movie for you. If you are the type who would love to watch Amanda Peet shuffling cards for an hour and a half. It's certainly not an important comedy work, but given the low-budget genius, this is great. To set up a game field for comparison, imagine all the studio movies with cut budgets with a factor of 100 or so and see what you get! Kudos to Peter Cohen and his network to see this. I look forward to the next effort.
