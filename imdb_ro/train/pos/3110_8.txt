The third and last part of the Bourne trilogy (duh), is a little missing in the stories department, but covers it with extended action scenes! Twi, in particular, takes a part of the running time and make this movie better. The director and star (Damon) agreed that it was difficult to find a story for the last part, because the end of the second film was quite ... advanced by the story. How did they get around it? The scenes of action for once, but they did something else that I can not reveal, because it would be a spoiler. But if you watch the movie, then you will notice! Fortunately I read that adaptation of Bourne's books is the least exigent of the three films .. if that means something to you: o)
