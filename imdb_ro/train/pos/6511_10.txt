Like many here I grew up with Scooby-Doo. Unlike many who did this, I love this show! I think it was very well made and thought through. Everything about him marks this as a spin-off that is not meant to be taken seriously. The formula is simple - it is a parody of other cartoons with only one bad guy trying to get the better guy better. Using the best-known Shaggy and Scooby-Doo characters, it's much easier to engage the spectator with the humor of the parody at the beginning of each 30-minute episode. There have always been Scooby-Doo spin-offs that upset the fans. The classic Scooby-Shaggy-Scrappy scooters in the 1980s. These spin-offs had their place: They allowed the sale of new content, created new fans, and kept the Scooby-Doo merchandise on the shelves. I would agree that "Shaggy & Scooby-Doo: Get an Idea!" does not fit into this traditional role, but it's probably what we always wanted to be Scooby-Shaggy-Scrappy Scooters: a action-packed show that focuses on the best / most fun Scooby-Doo characters! Good features of the show: animation, voices, attention to detail, bad boys, "best friend" relationship between Shaggy and Scooby-Doo, constant humor! Bad Features: None, although the Mystery reincarnated car is pretty close at times. Well done Warner Bros. Animation! One of the most appealing cartoons in a long time!
