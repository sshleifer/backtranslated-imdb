TIGERLAND / (2000) *** 1/2 (out of four) <br /> <br /> By Blake French: <br /> <br /> Over the years, audiences have seen and understood war films with every possible point, and somehow producers and writers always come up with new and innovative ways of portraying different soldiers on the battlefield. Joel Schumacher ("8MM," "A Time to Kill"), easily one of the most dangerous directors who are currently working, was similar to "The Red Slim Line" in the way his new piece "Tigerland" is heading to the shoes of an individual soldier. This movie, written by Ross Klavan and Michael McGuther, has more courage and irony than the "thin red line" or even "Private Ryan Salvation". Although the dramatic impact of the film is a little reduced due to the perversity of the present material, it certainly illuminates a new perspective of the young people who train for the war. <br /> <br /> I would like to know Joel Schumacher's experiences with the army. Are men really old and brutal? I'm sure some of them are, but the film looks at the world uncompromisingly through the eyes of a young man named Roland Bozz (Colin Farrell) who rebelled against the ideas of war. His personality contradicts immediately with several characters, one who becomes his best friend, Paxton (Matthew Davis) and another, Wilson (Russell Richardson), whose infatuated temper often exasperates Bozz's tension with the idea of ​​going to war. The war described in this production is not on a battlefield, but on the training grounds of a Louisiana-based training camp, between the conceptions and fears of the soldiers who are preparing. This movie is especially about preparing for war, nothing less. It ends when the soldiers finally end up in the war, a kind of disappointment, since the confession of the characters in action would have served as an advantage. <br /> <br /> Shooting at the location in about 28 days, using a 16mm stock and a tiny budget, Joel Schumacher accurately displays a penetrating, perverse, cruel and immortal atmosphere using manual cinema, unique lighting techniques and direct sound. Schumacher's grained and blurred images make the film feel like a documentary feature. This unusual shooting style only contributes to the tough realism of the film, quite graphic in the use of rough, perhaps a bit disturbing. Words of four-letter words hit the audience, some in shock of what I hear. Even the extreme amount of vulgarism does not keep dialogue from predominantly torn, true and emotional. If anything, "Tigerland" gives us a minor appreciation of the number of soldiers passing through us for the country in the early stages of the fight. Such courage must engage in the army during the war, knowing the hardships and risks that are being taken. Such provocative thought ideas are possible through the unimaginable performances of young aspiring actors portraying different interns. This movie is not for all audiences, but one that youngsters should look at before joining the army ... and the adult audience should seek to appreciate the courage needed to do so. <br /> <br />
