The problem is that the film went on the coats of the concept created in the 1960s that comic books could be made only as a "camp" (ie the Batman show of the 60s) for television and film. So you have battle sequences with subtitles (you'll be!), Un Doc Savage without blemish (she did not feel comfortable around the women in the pulp, not an idiot), Monk Mayfair in a nightclub (a scene guaranteed, you give yourself nightmares for more nights), and the hokey ends with the bad bad guy embedded in gold like an Oscar-winning Herve Villechez. And when I do not make countless scores of Sousa, the little "funny" music underlines much of the drama. Even so, this movie is ... fine. It's fun, and when it's serious, it's a very accurate representation of the pulp. Except for Monk, as I mentioned before: he is muscular, not obese. And Long Tom, who is supposed to be a grumpy little guy with an attitude, not Paul Gleason with an (unexplained) scarf. The green death sequences, for example, are remarkably terrible and not something Recommended for children. But I'm very close to the pulse. When writers and producers are right, they are right - I will give them this. But if the producers would have done DOC with loving care and scripting, for example, the first Reeves two Superman movies, think about what we might have then. I think the problem is the schizophrenic of the film. There is a clear feeling to try to pay tribute to 30 years, but they also try to give up the attitude of "heroes must be camp" that Batman has created. One has the impression that there is a first, trembling story in the pulp style, then someone came and said, "Hey, let's make fun - he worked with Batman 8 years ago!" But Doc lives thanks to Earl MacRauch and Buckaroo Banzai. If MacRauch does not pay homage to Doc Savage in that movie, man is really demented. So, when the series is actually on TV (assumed in the middle of the season in '99 -00), Doc Savage, updated in the 1990s, will live again.
