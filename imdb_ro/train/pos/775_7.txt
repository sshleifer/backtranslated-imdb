It's a weird, yet impressive story about love. Personally, I have never experienced such a story in real life. But, I can imagine there is. It's a story that promises to be "sick" in the title. But after watching it, I did not get that sense of "sickness" that I certainly would have had with the rules of society. It's something beautiful in this movie ... something impressive ... that I can not contradict using moral or social rules. The film focuses mainly on the relationship between Kiki and Alex. You can see how this relationship starts, evolves and eventually ends. Feel the moment when this love flourishes, the first whispers, touches. Feel the connection. And no moment, though this is immoral. You really think it will not crash in the end ... it can not break ... it's not right. You feel the pain of being finally broken ... But I have to add a negative spin to this comment ... I do not know if the story is not * shown * to give the feeling that these relationships are sick only in shape, but not in content. You do not have the whole story, it's just fragments. When the film started, the relationship between Kiki and Sandu was already in place. So, no idea about the nature of the relationship. You feel just a tension between them ... a struggle between the need for love and the desire to break this relationship. I think this line of Kiki to Sandu says it all: "I want to stop ... and if you love me, you will do as I ask you". This movie will probably ask questions about what love is and what it needs to be moral ... and where is the limit between them. I do not know if the idea of ​​this film is "love conquers all ... even social and moral standards" or "love is beautiful ... no matter how or where." But, in my opinion, this movie is already a success for the simple reason that makes you think ...
