A river is based on the true story of two brothers, Norman and Paul (Brad Pitt and Craig Sheffer) whose reverend father (Tom Skerritt) is a corrupt man whose two passions are his faith and rowing; and, for him and his sons, there is a fine line between the two. This story describes the slow evolution of the lives of the brethren and the way their lives separate in two different ways. It's an appealing film, narrated by director Robert Redford, who plays in the elderly Norman and reflects long and long dead people. Some themes reappear in the film, such as memory, death, eternity, and dreams. Most of these themes revolve around Paul's almost tragic hero. He is a capable, charming and brave man, but he has his fatal defects. The closure lines sum up the "point" of the film: "Then in the Arctic Arc of the Canyon all the existence fades into a soul with my soul and my memories, Big Blackfoot River sounds and a four-constant rhythm and the hope that a fish will rise. Finally, all things are intertwined in one, and a river passes through it. The river has been cut off by the great flood in the world and drifts over the stones in the basement of time, some of those rocks are drops of rain without wind, stones are the words, and some of these words are theirs, I'm haunted by water.
