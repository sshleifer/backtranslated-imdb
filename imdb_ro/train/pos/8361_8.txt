I had mixed feelings for "Les Valseuses" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching her, but I got to like it. I would not call it vulgar ("Dumb and Dumber" is vulgar, "The Sweetest Thing" is both vulgar and unforgivable); I would say it is shocking and offensive. I understand why many viewers, especially women, would not want or even hate it. It is the epitome of misogyny (or so it seems) and the way the two antiheroes treat each woman they encounter seems unclear. But the more I think about it, the more I realize that, to some extent, it is lost as a delightful jewel. I'm fascinated how Blier succeeded in escaping with her. The film is very fun and very pleasant: it is well written, acting by everyone is first class and the music is sweet and melancholic. In fact, when I think about it, two buddies did something good to the women they met: they prepared a woman on the train (blond blonde blonde Brigitte Fossey who started her film career with one of the most impressive debuts from Rene Clément "Forbidden Games" (1952) at the age of 6) for the meeting with her husband, which she had not seen for two months; they found a man who finally managed to get a frigid Marie-Ange (Miou-Miou) out and thankful; have lighted and educated the young and very eager for Isabelle Huppert (in one of her first appearances on stage). The meeting with Jeanne Moreau raises this comedy to a tragic level. In short, I'm not sure I want to meet Jean-Claude and Jean-Claude of Gérard Depardieu Pierrot in real life and invite them to dinner, but I looked good at the film and two hours flew - it was never boring.
