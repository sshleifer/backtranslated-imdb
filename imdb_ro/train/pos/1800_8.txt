All dogs go to heaven are on the same level as Watership Down for frightening infant movies. Both were dark and quite sinister, but at the same time, the most fascinating experience a child may have. This was one of my favorite movies as a child. I was in love with Charlie and at the early age of about five or six I would admit ... I had a passion for a cartoon dog. All the dogs tell the dark story of Charlie, the lover of Charlie and his partner in the Itchy crime. The story begins with the fact that Charlie escapes from death and beats the nearest club to make some gambling. Of course, as a child, I did not understand the concept of this movie. I liked the songs and the animation, but as I grow older I start wondering why I was not disturbed by this film as a young man. It deals with adult themes --- gambling, murder, hell and jail, but in a world of Disney-Goody Goody movies, it's something every child should watch once. <br /> <br /> Yes, there is a kind of crazy crazy crocodile scene and hell scenes scare me more now that when I was little but offer such a moving message that should not be ignored by parents!
