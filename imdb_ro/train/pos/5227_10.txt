The "White Men" movie is definitely one of the funniest, if not funny, comedy films I've ever watched! (and I've seen it quite a bit!) It's two garbage that become "white men" and then stop an invasion of space. It is also a parody of many classic movies, such as "Men in Black", "Star Wars" or "Dr. Strangelove". Anyone who says this movie is stupid, has something wrong with his head. There are tons of fun jokes and jokes here, and you could actually hurt your mouth too much (it happened to me!). If you can watch this movie on TV, watch it now - you certainly will not regret it!
