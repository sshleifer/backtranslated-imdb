Tho for 35 years, Tube groove looks a lot like today's television! Niche Networks (Nude Sports), a TV show about stoner drug distributors called Dealers (ala Weeds and even before Cheech & Chong Up In Smoke in 1978), strange beer commercials (Butz Beer, no less bizarre than Bud Bowls) - a Koko child clown (the nuances of Pee Wee Herman), even Chevy Chase, which makes a humor of sadness (a violent vocal duel) a year before his debut in Saturday Night Live 1975. And because of the infamous opening sequence that Groove Tube won a first X-rating, I can still hear Move On Up by Curtis Mayfield without thinking about naked dances hip-hop ---- Similar Movies sketch, see TunnelVision, Kentucky Fried Film, Amazon Women on Mood, Monty Python Beyond Fringe, Chicken Dynamite, and all you know about Firesign Theater is wrong.
