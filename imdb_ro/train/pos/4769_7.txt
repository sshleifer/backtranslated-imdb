I'm sure this is a show that nobody knows about and who might not think well about it; after all, it is close to Baywatch Hawaii. With the cast, the director's style, and his advertising? shows women walking on the beach and all that. No wonder people have a misconception and decide not to look at it. It was wrong for them to do that. Because after I decided to watch the show, there are actually more things that happen, real sucky stories and conflicts, prove to be very interesting to watch and pretty much ?? addiction. The story of the hotel clerks, manager, owner and their complicated love life. Also enter the hotel's disturbing visitor and the strong man who tries to steal the hotel. It's actually more interesting than it sounds here. I will not deny that the act sucks, but it's not so bad to look away. The story is not so consistent, but good enough. The soundtrack fits pretty well with the script, and the action is all the time. I took a few episodes before something really happens, so be patient. Recommendation: I really enjoy seeing this. Zillion Times Better Than Expected. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7.5 / 10 (Grade B) <br /> <br /> Please rate your opinion after reading it, thank you.
