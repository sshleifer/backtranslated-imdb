My remarks: The vamp at the end is ravishing and wonderful, exotic and fantastic. Jeanette did well and even got Nelson naive. The boat that collapses in his balcony served him right. The costumes of her female mafia costumes were surprisingly well designed, especially with current standards. The costume designer of 1942 did a great job. The main song is just awesome. Attention to negative posters: 1942 was the Second World War; Pearl Harbor happened a year before. US, just out of the Great Depression; he had to come out and spend his hard-earned money on the fantastic fantastic fantasy dance, dance and fantasy. Despotic dictators try to exclude RL by releasing freedoms. I thank the goodwill that the audience had these fantastic plotting films to attend. The film was a privileged treatment in those times depressing. When you, negative posters, become actors or even see the movie, then you have a place to talk and critique. Jeanette and Nelson's films are testing. <br /> <br /> Wonderful golden wings, the real angel. RL wings at the costume party not so hot but great on Jeanette considering SL. Singing beautifully with Jeanette and Nelson, as always. Jeanette's dance was pure pleasure
