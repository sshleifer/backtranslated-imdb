The midnight Cowboy made a fuss when he was released in 1969 with an X rating. By today's standards, it would be difficult to see an evaluation of R. Jon Voight, who was better, competent in the role in the role of Joe Buck, a hick from the city who wants to make it bigger with the ladies of New York City. He meets a street driver named Ratso Rizzo, who tries to join Buck for his own purposes. The two finally make a connection that is both simple and pathetic. Like Ratso, Dustin Hoffman just shines. Hoffman was often brilliant, but never more than in this portrait. He is so charismatic that all the other things around him are paralleling in comparison. Losing the John Wayne Academy Award is one of the most ridiculous decisions ever made by the Academy of Arts and Sciences of Cinematography. Director Schlessinger has a hand in his production, but this film has a grungy undermining that leaves a bad taste in the spectator's mouth. It's worth seeing Hoffman's performance.
