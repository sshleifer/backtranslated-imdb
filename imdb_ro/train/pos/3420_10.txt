This film is a mandatory film for all. Congress should see this veritable documentary from the point of view of the soldier, just like anyone in America. The previous reviewer has completely missed the point - the point is to reveal the truth about teaching our soldiers to kill people who are NOT terrorists but who only live on our "enemy" territory and what it does to soldiers. We have to support troops by bringing home IMMEDIATELY before another person is killed or injured. This also demonstrates that the government does not help veterans, mentally injured, with post-traumatic or physical stress disorder, with lost limbs. Julie A. Roberts, Streamwood, IL
