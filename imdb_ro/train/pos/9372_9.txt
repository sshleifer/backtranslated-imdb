Red Rock West is one of those rare movies that guides you all the time about what's going to happen next. Nicolas Cage is confused with a contract killer as he enters a small town trying to find his job. Dennis Hopper is the bad guy and nobody plays better. Look for a short appearance after the country that plays Dwight Yoakam. This is a serious drama most of the time, but there are a few lighter moments. What matters is that you will enjoy this low, but high quality effort!
