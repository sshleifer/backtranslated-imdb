Given that it was made at a low budget, ZIUA TIME ENDED manages to make the most of its budget with some surprisingly good special effects. The story involves a family who are about to move into their own solar - they took home to an isolated part of the Mojave desert in southwest California, just to find that they were destroyed - by motorcyclists, they think. But their youngest daughter (Natasha Ryan) began to see mysterious things - a green pyramid, strange humanoid figures, and so on. And just recently light from an explosion of triangular stars caused auras extremely unusual to appear in the desert sky. Thus, the family, led by Jim Davis and Dorothy Malone, are faced with strange strange forces that put them in a temporal and space warp. Blending the 2001 Elements: The ODYSSEY SPACE and the close-ending of almost three days, despite its obvious flaws and uneven action, remains exciting due to the special work of David Allen's special effects. The desert setting is well suited for the close encounters of this film; and while the film can not really be compared to either Kubrick or Spielberg films, TIME ENDED DAY is much better than many other 2001 / CLOSE ENCOUNTERS knock-offs. I give credit to director John 'Bud' Cardos, whose 1977 thriller, The Queen of Spiders, has made an interesting precursor to ARACHNOPHOBIA because at least he tried - and on that basis, I give 7 out of 10 days.
