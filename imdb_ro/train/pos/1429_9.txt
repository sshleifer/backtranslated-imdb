I liked the way EARTH is doing. His photo is incredible, the edition must have been an exciting challenge, and Patrick Stewart's voice is PERFECT. In addition, playing music and sound makes you watch EARTH a profound experience that you do not want to miss. You are actually on a journey to the place where you will probably never get alone. <br /> <br /> And although, at first, I was quite surprised by the laughter of the audience as we see the animals in their daily struggle for survival, I could not help sometimes laughing. Nature just seems too impressive to understand. But, rather than the need to laugh, I left the cinema with a profound question: "How 200 years of industrial revolution can destroy the natural systems that have been here for thousands and thousands of years?" Considering this question, you will understand how I felt somewhat bitter and powerless after I saw EARTH. I felt the immediate need to change the world, to help all these animals in their struggle, to undo the changes we have made in the last few centuries and to stop the global warming instantly (all that is not an NGO activist!) <Br /> <br /> So I immediately visited that site at the end of the movie to see what I could do to save the fantastic planet (and the polar bear) from her depressing fate. (www.loveearth.com) I was a little disappointed that I can not find any direct answers to my questions there. However, it was very interesting to find out more about the movie and the struggle that her team managed to get. I hope I will reduce my energy consumption. I do not know how else to shorten the distance between polar bears have to swim to reach the ground before they drown or attack the animals they can not beat in their exhausted state ... An inspired film is, I did not let the cinema to feel very happy.
