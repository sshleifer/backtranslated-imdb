While I wanted to make this movie since I first saw the movie, I was in full surprise for this film. While some of the elements and actions of the characters seemed a bit too "cartoonish", the dark nature of the film really makes a very different experience. Instead of a good-hearted good-luck story, this film takes you in another direction that proves to be uplifting but also disturbing. Most children will not understand some of the darker moments in the movie, which makes this movie more visible to adults. I was also impressed by the cinema, using animation and digital animation to create a seamless network of pans and tilts. The musical score was once again solid, proving that Hans Zimmer is the "go-to" type when it comes to animated scores and I never thought I was enjoying Brian Adams's music.
