And yet another run of South Park is over. It was not such a strong episode, as I had hoped, but homeless Night of the Living was a stronger finisher than Stanley's Cup, Tsst, Bloody Mary or World Day. Still can not have a candle at Woodland Critter Christmas and Goobacks, but few episodes can. The night of homelessness is a doll of a zombie kind, made in a way just South Park would think of. Instead of eating meat zombies, the entities are homeless, asking for change, and seem to survive. Randy and other residents are stuck in the Community Center, though this time on the roof, where they can investigate the scene. A particularly funny moment is when a member finds out that his home has disappeared and has become homeless, leaving Randy no choice but to shoot him. Meanwhile, the four boys have decided to solve the problem, the story behind homeless takeover is trying to convey a message, but being seriously uninspired. South Park is the best of times when it's ridiculous. Matt and Trey played safe this week, and did not really criticize the homeless problem, they lit it. The shock moment of the episode comes when a scientist shoots himself in an attempt to avoid homeless people. This is the first time a suicide in South Park is wrong and we forget that the poor man lacks the brain and then tries to shoot several times as he dies with pain. Another moment inspired by South Park. Generally, the episode was funny, but it was kept not great by keeping any real comment on the homeless and the straight stick with the shtick zombie. The conclusion is somewhat amusing, but it's nothing new. Now we have to wait until October for the next batch of episodes. It's a long way, but South Park needs to be applauded because it ran. The show seemed to have fallen out of steam last season, but now it's back in shape.
