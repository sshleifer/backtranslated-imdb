As one of the previous commentators said, it had the foundation of a great movie, but something happened on the way to delivery. Such a loss, because Collette's performance was dizzying and Williams was credible. I just waited for improvement. I do not think it was a bad editing or if I needed another director, it could have been just the movie. It appeared as a Canadian movie, something like the first seasons of X-Files. Not cheap, just hokey. He also needed a little more suspense. Something that makes you jump from the chair. The movie touched that moment, then disappeared; like a fake climax. I can see how he was too tense with the "reality" of the story, but I thought that part was reached when Gabriel was in the hospital looking for the boy. This movie must have a reduction in the director who is trying to fix these issues.
