The movie can go a little, but if you like the show is what you expect. It's not a bad movie; actually is pretty good. If you do not like the show, you do not see the movie. It starts a little slow, but then it rises and turns out to be quite funny. There are even some "heart-fierce" scenes to the end. After all the protagonists have gone through these things, I get to you. Jerry also casts his opinion on why his show troubles people and justifies the existence of his show. It has a pretty good point. He cares so much about the particular details of celebrity life, why it is wrong for these people to tell their privacy and national television. If they were celebrities, we would not mind at all, I would eat it. We do not like the guest to do so just because they are poor white garbage and reminds us that there really is poverty in this world and not just stars rich in glamorous films living in a "Let Beaver" world?
