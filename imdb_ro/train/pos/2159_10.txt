First, there is no such thing as the remake is just as good, because Japanese society is quite different from ours and plays such an important role in this film, as explained in the opening narrative. It adds to the humor as well as the warmth of this movie. There are a lot of different characters / personalities. Everyone is part of this wonderful movie. This movie is full of comedy that is not vulgar, anyway, like most comedies today. Still, you can still laugh aloud. The reality is that in real life, you have no choice among who you work or go to school with ... etc. This film really highlights this and shows that the natural good of people can overcome the minor differences. Not to mention, it does for a great sub-plot and a great deal of humor. This is a story about dance that actually has a story, and a good one about it. There are some stories that are not out of place, but I actually support the main story. Really a well-written film. And the dance is great. I happen to be a fan of any dancing film of any kind, for that matter. However, this film goes further than any other dance, in that it is a first story and it just happens to be written about dance in Japanese society. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 10 of 10.
