It's not a bad movie, with Sanders, Barrie, Hale, Cowen, Hamilton, Gargan, Fitzgerald and even Willie Best, we could be with Charlie Chan, Moto, Falcon, Blackie, Holmes or Saint. In other words, you have the opportunity to spend an hour in the company of old friends, from the plains to the city, to kill and be killed - always a pleasure in my book. Barrie is a hard-boiled mother to take revenge and cleanse her dad and a dead, a police detective planning and carrying out a series of assassinations from the world of interlopes. Which would certainly have the opposite effect! Sanders joins the fun simply by dancing in the right club at the right place in the right city at the right time, with the proper illumination falling both on him and the first killer (at the right time!) And killing him. > <br /> <br /> The story and the action are OK, the only flu I have is near the end with the hasty and almost ridiculous discovery of who was the evil genius (Waldeman) - have they almost forgotten his relevance in the plot? That being said, a solid entry into the series.
