This movie blows you up. This debut film from Tom Barman (known by the Belgian rock band dEUS) introduces you to 8 intriguing people, which is a blockade of a convincing mosaic movie. Each of them survives one day and one night in the Antwerp metropolis. The bartender dips his characters with much power and completely blends his individual stories, a tour of force that recalls the best work of Robert Altman and Paul Thomas Anderson. The mosaic of anecdotes surprises, moves, amusements; dialogues are so natural, they seem to be improvised. Some extraordinary performances by Matthias Schoenaerts, Natali Broods and the extremely fun duo in Ghent, Jonas Boel and Titus De Voogdt. Sam Louwyck is the memorable "Windman," a bizarre guy who danced throughout the movie. Sam is also responsible for stunning choreography, and of course, Tom Barman himself took care of the ultra cool soundtrack. We were seriously impressed: any way Wind Blows is a movie that hits you.
