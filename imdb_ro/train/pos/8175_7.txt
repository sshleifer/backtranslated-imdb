Before I start, I'm afraid of dentists. This movie gives me creeps and even makes me wander. That's what I like this movie. The movie is kind of boring. That's why I'm taking 3 stars! Spoiler Alert * The film revolves around Dr. Alan Feinstone, who just learned that his wife is deceiving him. Soon he begins to suffer hallucinations and begins to torture patients, killing colleagues, and even tortured his wife to death and killed the man with whom he had an affair. <br /> <br /> * End Spoiler * <br /> <br /> The film is very bloody and upsetting. I would recommend it if you are in gore. I give this 7 out of 10 movie. Dr Alan Feinstein is not your everyday Dentist!
