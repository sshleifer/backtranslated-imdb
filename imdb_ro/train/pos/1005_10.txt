Verhoeven's film was a complete and complete garbage. It's a disgusting shit of a director and he should be ashamed. By his recognition, he read 2 chapters of the book, got bored and decided to do everything from scratch. Heinlein would NEVER support that trash if he had been alive to see it. In fact, they steal the name, beat the politics of the book (which is a good part of it) and throw in some T & A, so the American idiot does not get bored. This anime is not perfect, but it is at least highly accurate, as I can best say.
