I recently saw this movie. 2 hours later, my head still hurt from laughing. The part was great, the jokes were so bad, but what I did not rely on was: 1. The two scenes before and after the movie they presented Pat and Jay (which caused more than enough laughter). 2. The blow through the windshield that beheaded the evil one. This movie is about 20 times better than the Rush Hour series, and my copy even came with a disclamer saying if you did not like the movie, send an HBO certificate. While we considered it, the date you had to send it was in January 1991 (which also caused wandering).
