The soldier is not as bad as many who have done it. I found the movie to have a sacred and cynical humor, as is the case with Paul Verhoven's Trophies. Lack of dialogue and top action is deliberate and adds to the comic book atmosphere. A special trivia is highlighted for me - Todd has the name of a few tattoo warfare campaigns on his chest and one of these battles is TANNHAUSER GATE. For the blind, the Tannhauser Gate is mentioned in Roy's last elective lines Batty in Blade Runner Let's just imagine that Todd could have been fighting alongside android troops, like Roy, it's great to say at least, maybe screenwriter David Peoples was nostalgic, and I'll give it 3 of 5.
