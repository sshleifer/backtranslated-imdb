I just came back from a pre-release viewing of this excellent SF movie. Style is definitely unique and very well done. The film is filmed with real actors, but transformed into a black and white comic style you have never seen. It goes one step further than Sin City, and it does well. It is a successful combination of French comic and film cultures. Story and mood reminisce about the Blade Runner, and if you liked that, you will also love that. The story is smart, it's never boring and has some tiny breaths. This movie is a must-see for any cinefil, except for those who, of course, do not like science fiction or b & w.
