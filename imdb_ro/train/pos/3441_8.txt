This movie is incredibly realistic and I feel great justice for the crime that many people do not understand because of lack of experience. Many people who think I can understand what goes through the victim's mind are arrogant. As a victim, I feel that Dawson did a fantastic job in her role as Maya. I agree that this movie is incredibly courageous. This concerns rape from a different point of view, more realistic than any other movie I've ever seen on the subject. The end has gone a little, but I know that many victims imagine such a justice because the chances of an attacker being sent to prison for their murder is around 1%. It is good to see a film that is more lacking in reality than most would dare.
