As someone born to a German mother and English father (who spent five years in a war prisoner's camp) come from a unique position. One of them has to deal with the different Nazis from one part of the family and WW2 wins, on the other. This miniseries can not bury every part of Hitler's psyche and must give the viewer a general flavor of the situation at the time and, at best, be able to master Hitler's mind. In this series he does quite well. Carlyle is very good as O'Toole, but I would like to have more information about relations with others in the party. Because Hitler did nothing alone. He had people around him who followed him to the letter many times undoubtedly and no doubt later in his killer career. What had passed through the spirit of Goebbels, Goring, and Hess? It would have been helpful to see more of these relationships. But I hope it will make people study the subject more. It could also make people understand why a person like Saddam Hussein can not be allowed to continue in power.
