In a word ... amazing. Initially, I was not too keen to watch Pinjar, since I thought it would be another film wept of partition and would show prejudices to India and Pakistan. I was so wrong. Pinjar is a touching, emotional and intelligent film with no visible vices. I was haunted by her after I watched her. I have been in my mind for so long; the themes, the pain, the loss, the emotion - everything was so real. This is truly a masterpiece that you rarely see in Bollywood nowadays. He has no prejudices and did not give the partition a human story. Here, no country is described as good or bad. They are evil Indians, bad Pakistani and good Indian and Pakistani. The cinema is excellent and the music is melodious, meaningful (thanks to Gulzar sahib) and haunted. Everything about the movie was amazing ... and the act took my breath. Everything was perfectly thrown. If you are interested in watching an intellectual and truly wonderful movie ... do not look anymore. This movie offers everything. I wholeheartedly recommend it. AMAZING can not describe how excellent it is.
