I have just finished watching this movie and can honestly say that this is a work of art. I was very surprised to see the overall rating as 5.2. Not only does Guy bring together ab (ish), but also turn them into glorious characters, he gave us a film with fantastic lines of story far left to imagination. Many people want movies with a plot that can be understood and handed over on a plate ... though these are the movies that become poor because they are far too predictable. This movie is special. Get it now!
