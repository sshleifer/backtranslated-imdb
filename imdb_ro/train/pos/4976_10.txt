A Frank Capra movie WONDERS OF LIFE. Keeping the pumping blood through the veins is the responsibility of HEMO THE Magnificent. In the mid-1950s, AT & T and Bell Science collaborated with renowned Hollywood director Frank Capra to produce a series of CBS television science films to educate the public about the universe around them. A cry away from the black and white feeds, so often hindered by young scientists, the Capra films would teach and entertain with life-rich scriptures and visual images shown in Technicolor. The four films - MR. SEM (1956), THE COSMIC RAILWAY CASE (1957), HEMO MAGNIFICENT (1957), GODDESS UNCHAINED (1958) - quickly became the favorites of the schools where they were presented endlessly in 16mm format. /> The star of the series was Dr. Frank C. Baxter (1896-1982), an English English teacher at the University of Southern California. This acoustic pedagogue proved to be the perfect film instructor, giving his audience brilliant facts sometimes complex in a manner that never made them boring or boring. Dr. Baxter, who won a Peabody Award for his accomplishments, continued to produce high-quality films after the end of the Capra Quartet. HEMO The Magnificent, produced, written and directed by Capra, the story of the heart and the blood circulation system, using animation and gentle humor. Starring Richard Carlson appears as a fiction writer, helping Dr. Baxter vigorously tell Hemo's story. Mavens will recognize Sterling Holloway as part of the TV production crew and the voices of Marvin Miller, Mel Blanc, June Foray & Pinto Colvig as cartoon characters, all uncreated. The devotional scripture that begins the film is in accord with the tone and tone of production.
