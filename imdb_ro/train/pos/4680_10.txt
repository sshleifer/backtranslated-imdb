The heat film with a slow start - give it a chance to start cooking. The story develops in interest and complexity. Characters and stories undermine expectations and cliques at all the right moments. The extraordinary locations in New York City - are a fantastic antidote to the commercial imperatives of "Sex in the City" - in fact, the whole movie is an antidote to the notion of HBO / Hollywood in New York City, sex and relationships. It's a rare film that treats their characters so sincerely and compassionately. I LIKED! Big cast with notable shows by Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson and his love interest (forgot his name!).
