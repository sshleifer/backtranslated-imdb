This is a low-budget movie with a cast of strangers and a minimal localization. The Philippines are replacing Thailand and nobody goes to Hong Kong. Launching a Cathay Pacific water jet at the old airport makes the perfect transition. This film proves that you do not need either mega budgets or a star head to produce an excellent movie. It does not contain the gaps, nor the excesses that young filmmakers often make. Strong workmanship from people who know all aspects of filming and who understand the compromises between art and box office. A great work!
