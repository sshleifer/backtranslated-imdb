Perhaps not the most original way to tell a story, I've seen all this before in many movies .. but .. I liked October Sky anyway anyway. He received something, an excellent direction and a good action of all parties, especially Laura Dern (teacher) and Chris Cooper (father). I want to be a rocket engineer!
