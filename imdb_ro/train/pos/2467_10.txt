Why did not he get an Oscar bag? It's an amazing interpretation of a often-shot piece. The visuals are amazing (especially in widescreen ... pan & scan really kills the wonderful cinema of this movie and sets). Every frame is a picture. Amazing. The song is almost completely intact, and Branagh's passion for this is evident from the titles of opening. There is no Zefferelli here, a wonderful story about how only the movie can, but seldom does. Jacobi is particularly perfect as Hamlet's killer uncle: he does not play it as a wicked mustache villa, but a charming politician, letting us see why only Hamlet suspects the wrong game. Branagh finds the subtlety of the line between Hamlet's false / real madness and the burning revenge inside him. And many cameos are pretty good, all Billy Crystal and Robin Williams to Gerard Depardeu and Charlton Heston, discreet if you suck in Branagh's vision as we were. A fascinating piece.
