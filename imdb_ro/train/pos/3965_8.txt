The film is fun and Jimmy Stewart is excellent as Chip Hardesty, with well-made co-stars of Vera Miles and Murray Hamilton. But the film, directed by legendary director Mervyn Leroy, has been constantly checked, and the approval of the script, as well as every aspect of the film, to clothing, has been closely watched and controlled by J. Edgar Hoover. Not that J. Edgar Hoover had nothing to be proud of. His leadership from the 1924 office to his death was created by the best investigative services in the world. But by 1959, Hoover had already started to worry about being forced, and had already begun collecting strong people's files to secure and protect his little kingdom. And he was determined to make sure that no one showed even a single mind about the office. The films show only success and continuous glosses over the failures that have taken place and the role of the office in the witch hunt in the early 1950s. Enjoy the story, but with firm language in the cheek.
