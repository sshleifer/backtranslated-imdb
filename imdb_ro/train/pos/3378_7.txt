This movie came to me highly recommended by Matt Groening. In fact, I watched both The Simpsons and Futurama and I got a mention in both, so I thought "what the hell". The movie brings home a few "what if", which makes you realize how fortunate we are in this day and age where we take simple things such as soap and water for ourselves. Interesting though, in 2022, men still laugh with a single blade of safety! Beautiful that the responsible ones did not load the film with unnecessary special effects, rays, etc. Some "furniture" looks nice once you figure out what it means. Please note that "Tuesday is Green Day of Soya"
