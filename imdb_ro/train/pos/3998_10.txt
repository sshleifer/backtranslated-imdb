Somehow I got off the movie when it came out and discovered it by the end of the week, due to the recommendation of a friend. I can honestly say that I do not remember another dramatic intimate movie that does so much so well. The writing is clear, realistic, nuanced and even narrow. Cinematography and editing are underestimated but inspired, allowing visual narrative to dominate through wonderful novelties and framing of images, capturing loneliness and alienation in the most memorable ways. The actor is also wonderful, with all the characters becoming real painful and vulnerable in the most aggressive ways a movie can offer. They reveal their most intimate weaknesses with unprotected and gross vulnerability. A true triumph for Roger Michell and Hanif Kureishi and for the rest of the team. You have to see for the serious movie lovers.
