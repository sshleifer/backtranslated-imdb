Those who hire the camera from the beginning of the century need to realize a little of their potential very early. This is a good story of a type of playboy who needs money and sells his soul to Satan for a lot of money. Unfortunately, the soul is his doubles, and he has to confront him frequently, pulling his life out. There are some wonderful scenes with fools and, of course, scenes when the two are on stage at the same time. The middle part is a bit dull, but Faustian's story is always in the mind of the viewer. One thing I have to mention is the general unattractiveness of the people in the movie. They have also gone a long way from the action that would have given at least something. I was first informed about this movie 25 years ago and I finally managed to see it. I was not disappointed.
