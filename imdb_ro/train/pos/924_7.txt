Father of pride is a pleasant surprise: it is funny, full of witchcraft and has strong voices. The show is about a lion's family that acts as the attraction of Siegfried & Roy's performances. Indeed, all these are stereotypes, but that makes them so funny. FOTP is not a cartoon for children, but includes a thick adult humor, but in a very easy way. It's full of popculture references and celebrity camouflages, and most are very well executed. I would say that I will give the performance 7 out of ten, because it is quite well executed, but not very original, I have seen most of those stereotypes several times before, even in that particular order!
