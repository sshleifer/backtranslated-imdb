I watched Pie-lette last night and the word that comes to mind is "original". This is a word that is not used too much on television because everyone tends to copy what the rest of the network does and get to seven nights of crime, unpleasant comedies and reality shit. The first thing that hit me like a brick was the presence of Jim Dale. Those who are not familiar with the British series "Carry On ..." or those who have not listened to a Harry Potter book may be unfamiliar with Dale. I'm not sure if his presence as a narrator adds or distracts attention. I have to find myself more, but it gives the show a "Harry Potter" atmosphere. Maybe it's a good thing. Lee Pace (Infamous, White Countess) has a gift. He never explains where he did, but he can bring someone back from death for a minute. He collaborates with Chi McBride ("Boston Public", "Roll Bounce") to solve crimes using this talent. Everything is good and funny until she meets a childhood love, Anna Friel (Objective, the dream begins, Timeline) and things are really complicated. She can not send her back and she can never touch her. Boys, that would make a difficult relationship. I'll be tuning to see if this series goes on expecting it will continue to have fun.
