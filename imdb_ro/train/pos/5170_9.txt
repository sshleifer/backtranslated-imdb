I hired this movie when it came out on a video tape and really enjoyed it. I had the opportunity to buy it on the DVD a few weeks ago and I followed it several times since then. I should have liked to agree with the others when they said Indian summer was a nostalgic film. When I look, I want to be 10-14 again. I think that's why we all like the movie to some extent. We all want to be able to relive our lives as children with the wisdom / knowledge of adults. Would not it be nice for all friends / parents to be young again? You do not have to worry about work, being a parent etc ... ??? I know I want to jump into a De Lorean and come back in time. While I really liked my favorite movie movie, though it's Meatballs with Bill Murray. I want them to be able to make a summer version of India.
