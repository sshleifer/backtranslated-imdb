Many honest readers of happiness, Cage and Hopper have met and fortunately not in a Lynch movie, because RED ROCK WEST is much better than any Lynch movie? Nicolas Cage is a third actor, the porcelain is a fatal surrogate woman, only the Hopper father is as good as ever? RED ROCK WEST is, despite the tribute role, one of my favorite American thrillers; in a word, a thriller with some twists. We notice mainly the taste, the beautiful rhythm, the emotions, the beautiful suspense, Lara Flynn Boyle's cute butt, Cage's enigmatic physical form (although doubtless ugly with sharp bird features, thick eyebrows and thin, rare Cage hair did Hopper's final hopper routine, a few moderate but really funny moments, Cage's play with his intentional character, Hopper's psychopathic sliding, Cara, Cage looks like a roamer, the archetypal roamer of the cinema noir, hunger, rough, if necessary, naive, dirty, tired. Lara Flynn Boyle behaves like a cold seductress, Walsh as her heartless husband and Hopper as the Lynchian man he has already done. The Cage looks really big or dizzy or very confused and has a severe hangover. But this could be his regular appearance.
