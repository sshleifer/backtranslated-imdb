I've read many reviews on this site, criticizing The Blob for being cheesy and campy. The film was accused of amateur effects and weak special effects. What would you expect from a group of people whose only experience was in the production of low cost, local Valley Valley PA products. Let me tell these critical criticisms that this film has never taken everything so seriously. This should be evident from the inappropriate thematic music, supplemented by silly verses that played over the opening credits. Because what was supposed to be, this movie is great. I have seen some of the recent very low budget attempts, Blair Witch's project being one of those who have no value of entertainment or smart thinking behind their plot. BWP was a pure excrement. The blob, on the other hand, was well thought out, well scripted and very funny. The scene in which the old man encounters the meteorite and shot the table contained with a stick was excellent made and really horrible. The scene from the doctor's office, with the Blob moving slowly under the blanket of the gurney while consuming the old man, was a cinematic horror masterpiece. The bottom line is, I love this movie. I've got someone out there to take $ 120,000, swollen for today's dollar value, and make a movie anywhere nearby as fun or as successful as Blob. It simply can not be done. PERIOD! <br /> <br /> Thank you for taking the time to read this review.
