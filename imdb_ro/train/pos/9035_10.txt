The actor in this movie was superb. Like an amateur rocker, I found very few mistakes. Being a human being touched my heart and soul. To watch the actors, you would think they are the real characters. Laura Dern, a favorite actress of mine, has left nothing out of her performance. Young actors playing Rocket Boys have shown talent beyond their years, especially young Homer. Homer's father inspired the eternal relationship of love / hatred between father and son so that he feels real. If you do not get a piece in your throat and you do not drop a tear when that first successful rocket raises or when your father and son come to a contradiction, then get your pulse checked (you may be dead).
