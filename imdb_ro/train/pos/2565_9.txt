I really liked this film about the relationships that sometimes occurred between American soldiers and Japanese women in post-war Japan - as well as the obstacles created by prejudices. Brando goes because of contempt for the Japanese (which is natural in the context of the Second World War) to fall in love with a Japanese woman and marry her. His performance is fine (I'm not a big fan of his acting style) and the movie is great all the time. Red Buttons received an Oscar for his performance by tapping another GI who falls in love with Japan (though the Japanese women playing with him have also done a remarkable job). I do not want to ruin it, but the movie is good to watch with a box of tissues. This movie manages to say GOD and be fun at the same time. A very understated jewel.
