First things first! This is not an action movie, although there is a lot of action in it! I think you can compare it to American sports movies! If a team of very bad players succeeds in inconceivable, winning a game or a tour beyond expectations! In this case, it's not football or baseball but Taekwondo! At first, these street bumps seem to be good for nothing! But soon, we will find out that they do not want to be bully and get something alive! It's nice to see their fight and training! I was surprised at how fun this movie was! From start to finish you will laugh at your pants! Young Korean actors are very convincing! Go see this wonderful movie feel good!
