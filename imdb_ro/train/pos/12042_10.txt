........... just like I was when I saw this movie.) I will not watch this movie again, not because it's a bad movie but because it scared me so much! As I said, I was 14 years old when my English teacher decided to show us this; the reason for this is that I read an extract from the book. All the girls in my class were TREATED when the Black Woman comes through the window and floats over Kidd's bed, though, even before there is something that scared us, when Kidd found the toy soldier under the pillow, and he hears the voice of a baby saying, "It's for you." This scene still haunts me until today, almost 7 years after I saw the movie. If you are easily scared, avoid this movie !!!!!!!!
