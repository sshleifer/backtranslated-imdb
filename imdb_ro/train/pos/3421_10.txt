This shorter film is the expected result when the imbecile runs the asylum. It is sad how the future of these young people evolved into a craps table, when neither Saddam Hussein nor the people of Iraq, God, rested the souls of the 350,000 people who were killed, has nothing to do with terrorism and al-Quida. <br /> <br /> Following this movie, the viewer will have to pick up or download a copy of Free Shift. This movie is available for free on the internet until Bush's cable blocks it by clicking on the title, as indicated in brackets. God saves our country. This will not be done by pursuing the Christ-fascist fear that has controlled the Congress Hall for over 10 years before November 2006!
