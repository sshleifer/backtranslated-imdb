There are too many new styles of the sitcom, but the one that works best is the old way with an audience and an interior set. The 70's exhibition is a wonderful example. When the show arrived in the air, no one really heard of Kurtwood Smith and Debra Jo Rupp, much less the teenagers played awesome by Topher Grace and Ashton Kushton (both leave the show this year to pursue other interests) I want Topher to stay because the show began about his character, Eric, and his circle close to friends. Ashton is already John Travolta of our time. You remember when John was in love with Diana Hyland at Eight is enough, think of Ashton with Demi Moore. The cast of actors has never been known to us, which is a good thing for a celebrity casting member to hurt him. I miss Mo Gaffney who played Don Joanne's girlfriend. I miss Lisa Robin Kelly as the original Laurie, the replacement can not match her and I'm sorry for that. I liked Tommy Chong's casting as the figure of the lost father but loved Steven Hyde. I liked to see Tanya Roberts next to Charlie's Angels. I loved Brooke Shields by playing Jackie's mom. He even showed his talent before going to Broadway. This show was a pleasure with many surprises. I hope this show lasts longer, although two of their members have gone, but I hope they will not stay too long for too long. I wish the creators of the show, Bonnie and Terry Turner, who created my other favorite show, Third Rock from the Sun, have been more successful on Fox than on NBC who sabotaged their show. Turners are not dummy and I hope they will create more shows like this in the future.
