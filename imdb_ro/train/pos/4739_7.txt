Very good martial arts movie and Jet Li is the best from Commander himself Bruce Lee. He is excellent as the key librarian / cop that saves all the time and again. He has a presence and a look that is riveted and credible like the kung fu king he does not mess with. Francoise Yip is simply beautiful in that original original way, which is unique due to her mixed heritage, has an innocence and amusement at the same time that I found unforgettable. The villain, the man with sunglasses and the long hair was very good, but I can not find my name in credits, can somebody help me with this? Thanks! Enjoy Hak Hap or Black Mask in any good language!
