I do not know much about the rat pack, and Frank Sinatra always seemed too self-conscious to me. So when I call this one of my fables all the time, it has nothing to do with a tribute-band mentality. As another reviewer says, "Mad Dog Time" is about symbolism, not about realism. He is a Kafka (a sin Kyle MacLachlan is probably the weakest of a very powerful crowd when he was as good as Josef K), he is elegant, knowing, sardonic and smooth. Jeff Goldblum navigates his way around a variety of characters, trying not to get shot and acting skillfully, rather than dorkily, trying to stay up to date with what others know and not, whom he can outshoot and which he can not. Gabriel Byrne and Richard Dreyfuss (his best performance) have a ball and the supporting part of the sustained shootings. Symbolism, settings (on an outdoor blow with Jeff Goldblum walking steps seems really strange, after so much room lizardry), dialogue (style, not practical, is the order of the day) it's about characters that interact, not even gangsterism. Fun to watch, it must have been fun to do. What critics have done is really a mystery ...
