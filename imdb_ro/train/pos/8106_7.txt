This film is hard to follow in our fast 21st century culture, but it deserves to be for the messages it conveys, especially the consequences and consequences of technology on society, especially when this technology is used for war. This movie presents a complete cycle of circles of dehumanization and rehumanization, influenced by the emergence of technology and the subsequent deconstruction of civilization, and therefore serves as a warning story against the abusive use of technology, but the circle is complemented, familiar themes and feelings appear again to present self-serving modes rather than self-destructive, so that mankind can use technology. Brilliant for its time, image and sound quality can be a challenge for some, but as a landmark in history, development and evolution of the SF genre, it is a necessity. Ultimately, free will and free choice are once again raised for mankind as a means of controlling our own destiny, rather than serving us for someone else or even the state of society itself, as they were shaped by world events. Those who are horrified by what life has shown them sometimes tend to remain so, but yet there is always a light of hope and continuity that remains, as this film shows. <br /> <br /> As far as the qualification as science fiction, one of the greatest common demonisers of the genre is speculative nature. We ask ourselves questions, what happens if these events happen this way and what effect they have on the society or the individuals inside it? How do we react? As for influence, this film projects those speculative sciences that make sci-fi as unique as it is and asks us those important questions.
