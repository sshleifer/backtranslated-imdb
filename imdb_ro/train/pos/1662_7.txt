Artemisia's film can be considered treason or a true artistic license. <br /> <br /> Artemisia Gentileschi was over and said she was r *** ed, as Mary Garrard and Gloria Steinem said eloquently. In the film, under another torture, she refused to condemn her beloved / violator. How can a movie deviate so much from the history you received, but still inform the heart of man? The answer is not so difficult to find. In the film, the director and cast have filled a hole in history with the power of imagination. This led to a conclusion that differs from registration. <br /> <br /> So be it. I found the movie and the film as convincing. In both film and history, Artemisia was a painter, above all. <br /> <br /> For that vision, framed in the composition of the composer (sic), I am really grateful. I rarely saw a movie that forced my eyes so much. David Broadhurst
