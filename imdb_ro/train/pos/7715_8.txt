First of all, you think this movie is almost fifty years old! Still, it still stands as one of the great movies of all time. I wonder how many of the celluloid throws over time will be discussed in 2050? The story is simple, but solid enough, and the effects are only phenomenal for this day. I remember the first time I looked at this as a child, when the monster enters the force field that protects the ship and you must see its contour for the first (and only) time. If I was trembling, I can tell you. The look given today, but more than effective enough. Tiger scenes show their age now. You can see the outline where the tiger has been dressed in photos with Altaira, but these are just visible. Also, the effect through which the creature melts through the Krell doors is greatly done. It's also amazing to see Leslie Nielsen (better remembered for Avion and Naked Gun) as a young but still mature. He was 30 years old when this movie came out! Nearly 80 years! All this, a good film, which will continue to be a favorite for the coming years. Timeless.
