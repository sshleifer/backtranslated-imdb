This was one for originality. I'm very tired to see Hindi movies that are a stick of a bunch of Hollywood and Brit movies. Some flaws were inevitable, however, this film is a must-see. Surya's display of the clean, conscientious policeman (unlike those hungry for money, hungry for money, which we normally see) was great. It has been a long way since his work in Nerukku Ner. I liked the movie so much that I had to hold it. They are not usually in the type of mindless violence movies, somehow I actually felt for each character and therefore I can not mean calling him "mindless" violence. I do not appreciate the excessive melodrama and the sentimental scenes that go hand in hand with most Hindi movies and tamil. I loved this movie absolutely because it is the same. Anbuselvan ACP's reaction to losing his wife is not over-burdened, is worsened by the heart, and makes me want to cast my eyes out. There are certain moments when I watch a movie when I want to press the FF button. Often I wanted to do this in a cinema hall. He never wanted to do this when watching this movie. I hope that Ghajini will be released soon.
