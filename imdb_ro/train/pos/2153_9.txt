This movie was charming. An accountant wants more of life than conventionally approved success. What makes it work so well and makes it so different from the standard dance film is that it really is not about becoming "big" is simply about finding a way of expressing oneself. The great triumph at the end is not winning a contest, not discovering a completely new lifestyle, but the simple joy of doing what you want to fulfill the other parts of your life. No one discovers their passion, they find their soul quiet. The Japanese background makes the subtle suppression and "secret life" of dance in the ballroom, so comprehensible and personal. We can all see each other.
