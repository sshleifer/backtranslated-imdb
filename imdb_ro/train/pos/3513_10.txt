Actor Herman Jos√© plays the role of a footballer of a football entrepreneur who acquires the passage of two African players and tries to sell them for very little money to Benfica's rival club (FC), FC Porto, so these players did not play well he wanted the FC Port to be wrong. But what happens is that these two players are, after all, good and FC Porto sells them for a lot of money to a foreign club, doing a good deal. The film, for a small country like Portugal, with no big antecedents in the big movies, is a very good and fun comedy, showing all the rivalry between northern and southern Portugal (FC Porto / Benfica). Highly recommended
