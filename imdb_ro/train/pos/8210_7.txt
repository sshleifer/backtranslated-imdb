Clint Eastwood resumes the role of Dirty Harry, which is the case with a vigilante (Sondra Locke) who kills the people who raped her and her sister at a carnival many years ago. Eastwood is doing his part and the movie is mostly more action, then talking, not that I'm crying. Sudden Impact is really a nice fun.
