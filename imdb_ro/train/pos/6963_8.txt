A big surprise, probably because I was expecting to suck. The comments were quite reluctant, even though they all seem to have agreed that the concept was gold: a man discovers his new girlfriend is a super hero and finds out when she wants to break with her that she is a kind of psychopath. I expected to fall apart but never did. Of course, he does not behave as much from his wonderful premise and could be short when it would have been better to extend the universe of the film. But I can not blame it for that. Uma Thurman is great as the bipolar super-hero, G-Girl. And I discovered, after a few years of despair, that Luke Wilson can be absolutely perfect when distributed as a schlub. He gave two of the best comic shows since 2006 (the other in idiocracy quite unloved). I did absolutely the expressions on his face when he and Thurman had sex first. It's one of the most fun sex scenes ever. My only real complaint is that they make G-Girl a little too much of a psychopath, almost unbelievable. Maybe with some background I could have taken it better. I can forgive my defects, however, because I had a very good time to watch. Underrated, sure.
