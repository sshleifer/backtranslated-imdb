Had he made this film just a few years later, I would have scored the score a point or two because the sound quality was pretty poor. Sometimes the movie seemed to be a silent film during inter-scenes (normal ambient sounds are missing). But given that it was a French film in 1931, this is quite ineligible. Especially since this is also happening in the later French films - in the end, the sound difficulties would have had to be fully solved (as in L'Atalante in 1934). Well, besides some minor sound problems, this is a nice movie about a winning lottery ticket and a long list of people trying to get it. And, while searching, there are plenty of wonderful songs that can only help you to please them. A beautiful charming "all-in-all" movie.
