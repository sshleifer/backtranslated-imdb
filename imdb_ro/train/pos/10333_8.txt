This was a great American propaganda film that is extremely creative and openly discusses Nazi atrocities before the entire detention camp is revealed. While at the end of 1944 and 1945 would reveal how wicked and terrible they were, this film, unlike other Hollywood films so far, is the most brutal honest film of the era I have ever seen to Nazi atrocities. The movie begins in a courtroom in the future - after the war (the film was made in 1944 - the war ended in May 1945). In this fictional world court, a Nazi leader is tried for war crimes. Wilhelm Grimm is totally unhappy and is named one by one to reveal Grimm's life in 1919 in a series of flashbacks. At first, it looks like the movie will be sympathetic or explain how Grimm was pushed to join the Nazis. However, after a while, it becomes very obvious that Grimm is just a sadistic monster. These episodes are amazingly well done and definitely keep your interest, and you also make the film look less like a piece of propaganda, but a legitimate drama. On the whole, the movie does a great job in view of the film actors a second time. There are many scenes and convincing performances - especially the extremist scene of extermination of the Jews towards the end that can only help you bring you close to tears. It was also interesting that around the same point of the movie there were some super-creative scenes using crosses, in a way you can not see at first. In general, it is a must-see for history lovers and anyone who wants to see a good film. FYI - It's not a serious critique of the film, but Hitler was called "that paper hanger." This is a reference to the myth that Hitler had made with the money putting on the wallpaper. In fact, this is not true - before being a "starving artist," a homeless person, and served well in the German Army during the First World War. A horrible person, yes, but never a piece of paper!
