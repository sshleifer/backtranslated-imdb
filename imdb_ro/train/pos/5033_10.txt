This is one of those movies that, after watching it, you will continue to think and come back even after a few months after watching. The actor is spectacular because he played two children (usually I hate movies with a child acting as a child). Bill Paxton is great, his directorial debut is even better than what I expected from an actor whose most memorable line is "Play over, man!" (From "Aliens") The best part of the film is the dichotomy of those scenes in which the actors play a family and when they do their "work." It really makes the film credible and memorable, keep it alive, Bill, and I'll wait for more movies to love!
