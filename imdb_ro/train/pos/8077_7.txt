A film made for the contemporary audience. The masses get to see what they want to see. Action, comedy, drama and, of course, sensual scenes. It's not really a movie that someone would feel comfortable watching with the whole family. It's not for the children's eyes. I had to advance quite a lot of scenes. If it's just about the entertainment you're looking for, then this movie has it all. The songs are attractive. A generous production, I have to add. <br /> <br /> However, the film's message is not universal. Emphasis is placed on the idea of ​​karma. That is, if you do well, you get good. And if you do bad, you're going to get sick. The fruits of good deeds are good, and the fruit of evil is evil. <br /> <br /> In real life, this is not always true. It is well known that most people are not right in this world. Although it is true that some evil people meet with a bad end, there are many who escape. Then there are many people who do well and yet instead meet a bad end. If you do not care about the message and all you want is an escape from worldly reality, this movie is a good animator.
