So this has done for TV movie scores just a 7.6 on this site? Bah! Humbug! Undoubtedly this version of Dickens in 1984 is the best ever made. And yes, Hound saw the 1951 version that was also good but not good enough. Lack of color is probably the biggest drawback of this version, although the acting was great. George C. Scott is simply incredible like Ebenezer Scrooge. We all know the story of this dirty businessman who is haunted by the ghost of his dead partner, then by three other spirits later that evening. Scott is scary like Scrooge. Too terrible, in fact, for some critics claiming to be unable to present the new glory he wakes up on Christmas morning, after the spirits teach him a valuable lesson. But hey, that's George C. Scott. He will never dance on the street in joy of joy. He has too much dignity, and Scrooge designs his emotions in a realistic way. Supported performances are excellent uniforms, such as costumes, music and scenery. The 19th century London returns to life in the visionary style of Clive Donner. The film even bridges itself with a fright in several scenes involving spirits. The important story of morality shines in every frame, though. <br /> <br /> You will not often find this version on TV and this is a disappointment. The 1984 version of a Carol Christmas should be a mandatory part of the celebration of each household of the holiday. When the decorations come out of the basement, this film should find its way into the DVD player at least once during the season. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Hound.
