To be honest, I watched this movie only because of my puberty needs. I mean, I could not bring my women to my age (I was 9 or 10 years old), so I thought to watch Elvira's spit was the closet for sex. I have come to have fun with this classic cult comedy about horror, Halloween parties, humorous feelings and a sexy evil displayed by Elvira. They do not make such movies ... It was the feeling of an amateur effort mixed with a host style with the late talk talk show. The truth is that it has generated a lot of fans because of its humor and the ability to play Cassandra. <br /> <br /> This is classic that reminds me of the good days of USA Up All Night.
