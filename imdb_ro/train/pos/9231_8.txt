FREVIA THE HERETIC is a strange entry in the "nunsploit" - the equal parts are hospitality, feminist travel and "history" as we follow Flavia on her strange journey. We start with Flavia in a monastery. . She is not too happy where she does not believe in all the "rules" and the macho-ism dominated by the men of the world around her and escapes from the monastery with her Jewish friend, Abraham. Eventually, both are captured, and Flavia is brought back to the monastery, where he joins another "unbelievable" nun in hurrying the Muslim invasion. Flavia comes out with Muslims who take over the monastery and take care of the nuns in a strange set of scenes. Finally, the launch of Muslims and Flavia are punished as a traitor of Christianity in another brutal singular scene ... This has almost all the things that I like to see in an explosive film of the 70s - a gore good, including mothers' removal and a beautiful leg scene, a decent nudity - including the need for a full front and a decent story. I will say that sorta has been dragged in a few points, but not enough to be really bored with it. I would definitely recommend this to the fun / 70 fans exploitation ... 8/10
