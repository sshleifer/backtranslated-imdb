Director Douglas Sirk scores again with this, the grandfather of all family dysfunctional films. This lush, trashy saga is a masterpiece, combining nicely all the elements of Sirk's newspapers and placing them strategically in a single film. "Written on the Wind" has clearly influenced the TV series "Dallas" and the "Dynasty" in the 1980s, as this is basically a version of the characteristic length of these night soaps. , plays the role of Lucy Moore, secretary of New York's marriage to the baron of oil, Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack). Mike Wayne (Rock Hudson) is also unknown to the two, being in love with the quiet but sexy secretary. Everyone returns to Kyle's family mansion in Texas, where we meet a white sister, Marylee (Dorothy Malone in an Oscar-winning tower). Yipee! Sparks start flying - from romance to fighting, it's a trip to the plain. Not only does Mitch have to fight with the feelings she has for her best friend's wife, but Marylee tries to sleep with everyone because she can not have a real love that's Mitch. Closing everything, Kyle learns she's impotent, but somehow Lucy is pregnant. This is pure soap and pure melodramatic entertainment. How do you dislike it? This film marks one of Universal's most popular films and one of Sirk's best works. Some of the dialogues are absolutely sizzling and visual metaphors are thrown in any way - the whole theme of the wind is great. The distribution is great, although Bacall is totally unused despite having earned a top fee behind Hudson. Oscar's loss from Stack to devastated. He considered this to be his best performance and obviously was not too happy to lose. And he did a fabulous performance like the damn alcoholic. What amazing movie! This film proves what I'm thinking about - Sirk is the master of classical melodrama. Where's his Oscar? <br /> <br />
