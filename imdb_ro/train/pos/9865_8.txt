I saw the movie with two raised children. Though he was not as smart as Shrek, I thought he was good enough. In a cinema surrounded by children who were in the spring break, there was no sound, so I know all the kids liked it. Parents also seemed involved. Death and apparent death of the characters led to the pressure and corresponding comments. We hope people realize that this movie was made for children. As such, he was successful, although I also liked it. Personally, I liked Scrat!
