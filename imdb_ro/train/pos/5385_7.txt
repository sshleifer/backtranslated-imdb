I never watched the show "The Next Hero of Action" and until I read the other comments here, I did not know that this movie was the "prize" of this competition. I was just flipping through the channels and came over this, and I found myself watching, dare I dare, to the end. Yes, the plot was made (the most dangerous game, etc.), but I hoped and almost got "gotcha" - how the protagonist would finally defeat the hunter. I think the high-tech technology has been overwritten (GPS) and gave me a cold sweat of Night Rider, but it was not too much. The basic problem I had with this film was the degree of SOD (Suspicion of Unbelief), which was demanded by the viewer. Do you really think someone flying in a helicopter could lobbish countless incendiary grenades at a public bridge and do not show COPS to investigate? Could a limousine do countless donuts in a Las Vegas intersection and appear NO COPS? Pleeease. Too much of this kind of thing - fun to watch, but keep it at least plausible, thank you very much. The final solution was good, but the conclusion was disappointing with the taste of an evil Star Trek episode. At least now I understand why the actor was so blonde - except for Zane, who is not so close to the work IMHO deserves - were winners of a reality show. <br /> <br /> Knock me out.
