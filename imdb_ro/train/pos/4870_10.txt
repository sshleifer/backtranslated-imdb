The film celebrates life. The world is headed for innocent and pure souls and everything has "Happy End," as in the final scene of the movie. <br /> <br /> The film has a wonderful soundtrack, a mix of Serbian neofolk, Gypsy music and jazz. This film is a very invigorating visual poetry piece. I was sucked into another colorful, romantic and sometimes tough world. <br /> <br /> Like Mr. Kusturica's movie should be.
