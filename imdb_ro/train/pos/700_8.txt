An insomniac nightmare was an incredibly exciting, well-done film. I liked the way he throws you in the main character's subconscious without burying the spectator ... the act was top - honestly, I would have been watching Dominic Monaghan read the phonebook! - but all the others, especially the little girl, were wonderful too. I was very impressed with the film's look. Usually, "independent films" have a granular film, I-shot-this-on-my-cam-cam, watching them, but this director knows what he's doing. Lighting, cinema ... quality work. I look forward to long-term work from Tess Nanavati!
