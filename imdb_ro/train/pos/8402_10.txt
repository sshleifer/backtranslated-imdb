VAN is a simple adolescence image, made especially for the unit that comes out of the way to make you feel comfortable, giving you many opportunities to laugh and cry with your friends. Danny Devito has a small, but very rich role as a car wash manager and almost steals the show! All stars are well-behaved, complex characters and directions quite competent for this type of image. An international Crown launch.
