I can admit that the script is not very good and has some slow parts, but all the critics of this movie have to learn how to have fun. First of all, the shows are wonderful (Michael Douglas, Kim Basinger, Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria) and Michael Basinger plays a very interesting role in Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria's wife, playing the dynamic duo, both adding their incredible talent at the pot, and secondly, this movie is the most fun I've ever had in a Theodore, simple and simple, if you want to go to movies and have a lot of fun see, The Sentinel .
