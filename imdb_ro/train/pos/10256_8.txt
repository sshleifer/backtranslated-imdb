The first installment of this series of notorious horrors is presented as if it were a snuff film discovered by the producers and was set up as an amateur video tape, complete with a digital timer at the bottom of the frame. She presents a woman kidnapped by a gang of black men who tortures her a few days before killing her. The unhappy victim is beaten in the wild and thrown with raw meat before her nails are pulled out, her hand crushed with a hammer, the pierced eye with a needle, and so on. In the most nasty scene, women's captors burn it with hot water and throw the living worms into burns. The series received great publicity when American actor Charlie Sheen, believing that the series contained a real crime, tried to ban its distribution to the United States. An FBI investigation showed that movies were just what they seemed to be for most viewers - sickly re-creations with ugly but obvious special effects. The script made by Japanese artist Hideshi Hino, who directed the third and fourth episode, is a great way to delete all but the most tolerant cameras. But perhaps the Gorehounds will find nothing special.
