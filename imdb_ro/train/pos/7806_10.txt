"Cry Freedom" is not just a movie. It is a historical story, a heroic story and a perspective on the cultural background of a major event in history. Not only does Denzel Washington do a great job of behaving as a motivating, determined hero, Steve Biko, but he sends a message to the public about the horrors of South Arfrican Apartheid. The story of Biko, an influential leader, and his main "influenced," Donald Woods, is a heart-filled one. But the ultimate success of his life can go beyond the atrocities committed in South Africa. "Cry Freedom" manages to communicate to the audience the optimistic appearance of the seemingly disturbing plot. Because of such great movies as this, the audience can become educated on terrible events in history, the great leaders who have tried to end it, and how we can never afford it to happen in the future. Due to this importance, "Cry Freedom" is a great movie that should be seen by all.
