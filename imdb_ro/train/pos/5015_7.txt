Very a masterpiece. It's not so well written. A beautiful movie I do not believe. This movie was not too terrible, but it was not much better than average. The main story dealing with extremely immoral teenagers should have focused more on banned romance and why it was ... we should have really entered it instead of overturning the surface with "because my mother says we can not". Some parts should have been abandoned altogether or be restored to be of greater importance to the situation of the two main characters. Several times I was wondering if the writer / director was a fan of George Lucas's classic Graffiti American. Not that it's wrong to be a fan of that movie, but to make the movie sometimes look like that, I mean! The worst part of this was that Madchen Amick had such a small part, I mean he doubles! It was the only one or two lines that actually attempted a southern accent. (Listen well, she was there, even if her character was from California!) Perhaps if she could have been followed by others she could have been followed and had a much more authentic film. Well, what can you do when you have a director who is just a director and not an artist as well. Sin. Generally, they give this B - and that's a little generous because I'm partly Mrs. Amick.
