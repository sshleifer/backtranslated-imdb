I really enjoyed seeing this movie about Delany's sisters. I knew about them, but that was all. This film opened my eyes to bravado and courage. What a pair. What sacrifices they have done to live life in their terms. This is not just a film for African Americans, but for all Americans. It's a history lesson and documentary wrapped in one and combined with a fun film biography. The acting was superior to all those involved, and we really managed to see the difficulties these two sisters have experienced for many years. Both sisters are quite different from each other. They came from a very loving and very strict family, with high perfection standards, perhaps impossible. It's sad to see Sadie's father refuse to let his daughter continue to see her boyfriend because of a possible misunderstanding. I recommend this movie and I'm glad I got it on TV the next day.
