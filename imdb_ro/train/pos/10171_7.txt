Once in college and having an international fair, the Russian section had a Soviet-era poster saying "Ne boltay!", That is, "No gossip!". I translated it for the "generation" of televisions like "Do not be Gladys Kravitz!" (referring to the old neighbor on "Bewitched"). However, when you see the result of gossip in Pvt. Snafu short "Rumors", you see it is not a thing of laughter. In this case, the perpetually witless soldier hears something about the bombings and immediately assumes that the powers of the Axis have attacked the United States. So, he tells someone who says to someone else who says to someone else and continues. As in the "Russians come, the Russians come," the story becomes more and more disproportionate every time, so when you return to Snafu ... well, you know what I mean! Yes, it is mostly the propaganda of the Second World War - supplemented with a derogatory term for the Japanese - but I have to say that Pvt. Snafu trousers were actually quite funny. Of course, since they wrote Dr. Seuss and Mel Blanc with the voices, it is not surprising that they went out pretty cool. Worth seeing.
