I struck myself tonight tonight at TCM. I have not seen him since it first came out, but I never forgot. I completely forgot how wonderful and talented Signe Hasso was when she was still young, just like Shelly Winters before she was bloated. Ronald Coleman, however, was the Chinese state actor of his time - I was reading Othello in high school English - and I hated him. After seeing "A Double Life" I read it again and finally I understood what the game was. The Gordon / Kanin writing team was at its peak when this scenario was made - A great movie worth remembering and rewatching,
