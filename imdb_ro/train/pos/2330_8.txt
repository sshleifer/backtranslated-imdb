This show is good. I like the bits of actors, their fun and their courage. The actors, Lee Pace, Ann Friel ... etc, all did well in the show. The show began very well with its funny and illogical idea of ​​bringing the dead to the first series and sincerely, as people have said, the first few episodes of the second series were a bit disappointing, but later they returned good anyway. And now I really hate it being canceled. Why ABC does not let it finish by the end of the year when all episodes are already done? I really want to know how the story will be. I think she should be given a chance because there are still so many viewers who love her.
