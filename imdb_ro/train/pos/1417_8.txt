I saw this movie with my family and it was great! This film is more than a documentary (offering no more than real facts) with long mono-duologues and a lot of diagrams ... The complete "power" of this film comes from impressive pictures underwater, air or Arctic . With this movie you can learn more about our planet than about reading a book, it shows that we are embedded in the circular flow of life. This film is not only for "environmental fanatics", although people who want to show a good film with a message should look at it. This movie taught me that we are not only living on the earth ... we live with and through the earth and all the plants and animals grow up and die with us.
