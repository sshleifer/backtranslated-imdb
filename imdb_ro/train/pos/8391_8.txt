Fassbinder's most generous production sacrifices little of his talent for identifying and deconstructing a locus of long-term, mobile mobbing, which in a way acts as social encapsulation; here is more evident, because the story takes place in war-worn Germany at the end of the Second World War, and the central character is a woman (Hanna Schygulla like Maria) who exploits the vulnerabilities (both economic and gender-related) she faces the ladder of a prominent textile body. which makes coveted goods such as lederhosene available to indigenous workers (as once). Married in the midst of allied air raids, Maria and her new husband Herrmann are cared for a short honeymoon before they are shipped to the Russian front. In her absence, her despair is great: she spends the most days at the station, waiting to return. When reported dead, she suddenly stops pain and takes a job as a barman / prostitute in a brothel dealing with US GIs. When he returns, things become very messy, because the circumstances of noble self-sacrifice) conspire to keep them out. The message is M.O. Fassbinder. "Love is colder than death," but not only Mary struggles with her own sanction and a husband largely incapable of loving her, but a deep flowing country with no telling light at the end of the tunnel. Fassbinder makes a statement about post-war Germany selling to the greatest bidder, but as with all his films, I tend to block these elements and focus on the unbearable passions exposed: Fassbinder is evoked by his characters; his films, as filtered through their connections with Fassbinder. Taken together, his films can be either unbearable or indescribable mesmeric, often suddenly, this falls somewhere in the middle, though certainly closer to the latter. while I did not like as much as the bitter tears of Petra von Kant or Katzelmacher, Maria Braun certainly has a wider field, and moreover, I felt my passion and authentic details about human emotions.
