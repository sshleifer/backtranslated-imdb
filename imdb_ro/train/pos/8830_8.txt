This is a masterpiece shooting in 35mm B / W film. The movie makes you see a strange way to start the day at 7:35 am in a bar and how many things can happen there in 8 minutes. Shortly amazing, it makes you into a complex story using very few elements, and step-by-step makes you realize that something is not absolutely right. It expresses a lot, makes adrenaline go tall with subtle details and is incredibly easy to understand by anyone, not just the critics of cinema. But I know how it looks: European short, black and white budget. Do not let that scare you. It is really worth seeing no one, not just experts of the kind. There is really more to say, because the movie only takes 8 minutes (exactly), and I do not want to spoil it. But I just saw it online and I did not understand why nobody spent a few minutes to post a comment about it. It's worth watching. 10/10.
