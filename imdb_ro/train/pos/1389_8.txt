The Williams family lives on a farm in the middle of the desert. They find themselves in considerable danger when the place is suddenly pushed into a whirlwind of time in which past, present and future collide in a chaotic and unpredictable wild manner. Director John "Bud" Cardos begins the film in a totally mysterious note and gradually allows things to become brighter, more insane and more interesting as the story unfolds. In addition, Cardos fills the screen with lots of dazzling images and makes it a pleasant job to create a genuine sense of wonder and wonder. The admirable actress from a play cast qualifies as another major plus: Jim Davis, the patriarch of the heart, Grant Williams, Dorothy Malone, as the eternal wife Ana, Christopher Mitchum as Richard, Marcy Lafferty, as Beth's wife, Natasha Ryan Jenny , and Scott C. Kolden as Steve. Funky special effects provide a combination inspired by great miniatures, animated monsters with stop-motion animation (the creatures include a small guy, no hair, a big beast, a freak and a lizard lizard) and dull paintings. Richard Band's orchestral ribbon that really touches the penetration really touches the point of shaking. Also, John Arthur Morrill's crisp, sunny cinema makes a trick. A fun movie.
