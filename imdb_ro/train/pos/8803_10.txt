I just watched the Sundance channel recently. The idea of ​​the film was to bring many filmmakers, illustrated in their own country, to make short films, eleven of them, in a film, focusing on a single subject: September 11th. this movie could tell why these directors were wonderful in their country because they had all the elements of a great movie. The film begins with a film in Iran where a teacher strives to teach students about what happened on September 11th, which they can only do later. The second film in France involves a deaf woman who writes a letter to her infuriated lover, while she does not know what happens as a TV plays. The next film in Egypt involves the director himself talking to a dead soldier about recent events, not just about September 11 terrorists, but about bombing in other places. <br /> <br /> The next one comes from Bolivia where a girl learns about the September 11 events and thinks she has to mark them. <br /> <br /> The next in an African country where a group of boys follow a man whom they consider to be Bin Laden. The next comes from Mexico where nothing is but the sound of that day. <br /> <br /> The next one in Israel that involves a reporter at the site of a bomb trying to get a report, but it's often said about attacks. There are other movies I can "Do not remember at this time, but they are all strong. It will bring back your emotions that day."
