From the beginning I knew I was going to be for the best movie that follows the experience of my life. The idea of ​​two giant robots, equipped with brilliant men, fighting for control of the world, was the most intense and well-thought-out plot I ever experienced. I can not even begin to describe the brilliant script of acting and written writing. Let's just say it compares to Lord Lord of the Rings, combined. The academy had a serious oversight not to celebrate the joy that is ... ROBOT JOX.
