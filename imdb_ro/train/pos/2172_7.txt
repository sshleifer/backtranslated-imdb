"The Crazy Dog" Earle returns, alongside his sad father, Mary, and that fluffy Velma. So I'm Babe and Red, Doc and Big Mac, and even on the mutt scene Pard. The only thing missing is a good reason for the resumption of High Sierra to Raoul Walsh, 14 years later, without rethinking a line or frame, making it with considerable talent a step or two down the scale of the original . (Instead of Walsh we get Stuart Heisler, for Humphrey Bogart we get Jack Palance, Ida Lupino Shelley Winters and so on.) The only change is that this time, instead of black and white, it's in Warnercolor; Unfortunately, there is an improvement in that. Did I die a thousand times can be useless? and inferior ?? but at least it is not a transvestite; the story continues to work on its own terms. Earle (Palance), fresh out of the stylus near Chicago, heads west to drive a great job created by Royal Lon Chaney Jr. knocking over a post-mountain station. Along the way, he almost struggles with an oak family when he is beaten with their niece; the battle is maintained even when it discovers that it is a laceration. Arriving at the booths where the rest of the gangs opens, he finds hot-amateur hotkeads at the other's neck, as well as Winters, who dive to him (like pooch). Time to a call from their hotel in the hotel, Palance (up to Winter's noise) offers to pay for an operation to heal the deformation of the face, a gesture that returns. Then the surgical strike against the resort turns into a blood bath. On the palm, Palance moves more in the cold Sierra ... It is a fairly absorbed story, with skill, lacking the distinctive character Walsh and his cast in 1941, the year of Bogie, with this role and Sam Spade's role in The Maltese Falcon has become a star. And a last heretical note: These mountains look beautiful
