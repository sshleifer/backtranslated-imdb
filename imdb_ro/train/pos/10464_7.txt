For all those who do not speak in Swedish: the Swedish title [original] of this film; "Rånarna" translates into "The Robbers". This is the main problem I have with the movie, because it's not about thieves at all. It's a young woman who works for the Swedish police looking for robberies. A regular office would think, but this girl is soon on the ground taking things in her own hands as the story goes, even shooting one of the thieves ... Exactly: I've seen this before. The fact that there is a pretty interesting twist of the plot halfway does not really help, because the end is as cliché as the first two thirds of the film. What saves him from being just another mainstream movie is that he is masterfully executed in all respects, that the actors are as great as they are not, and that the director really manages to keep it so thrilling as for most of the story. /> <br /> One thing I really loved about this movie is that music sets the right mood when needed but is absent for the rest of the time, which gives a nice sense of reality to shooting and car expulsions were spread in the movie. A nice touch! The fact that Michael Persbrandt is one of the few Swedish actors who often tend to be printing takes the film badly because you know he will not just play the heroine's lover and be a backing character in the background, but that's something he has to neglect. Everything is a fun movie that steals more money in its plot than time from you. 7/10
