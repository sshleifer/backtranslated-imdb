Successful successful businessman, Harry Mitchell (a superb interpretation of the flag by Roy Scheider), has an adultery with a sweet young Cini (gorgeous Kelly Preston). Harry was blackmailed by a trio of expensive low-cost traps - Raimy (a splendid thin John Glover) porn star, young owner Leo (well played by Robert Trebor) and crazy Pimp Bobby Shy (a brilliant Clarence Williams III) - who recorded their video with Cini. When Harry refuses to pay, the bonnet kills Cini and makes her look like Harry did. This, in turn, ignites a dangerous battle of spirit and will between Harry and the hood. Director John Frankenheimer, adopting a rough script, based on the novel of Elmore Leonard's crime thriller, keeps a charming rhythm, offers plenty of tension and effectively creates an impressive atmosphere. The leaders are all equally excellent, with roles backed by Ann-Margret as negligent wife of Harry Barbara, Vanity as bad prostitute Doreen and Lonny Chapman as loyal business partner Jim O'Boyle. The narrow statue does not keep viewers on their toes. The deeply profane dialogue, Jost Vacano's glossy cinema, Gary Chang's shaking score, the harsh tone of amoral, and the dreadful conclusion are still on the money. As an extra bonus, both Vanity and Preston take off their clothes. A very large and satisfactory number that deserves to be verified.
