I saw this in the early 1970s (when I was 16) and, despite many slowdowns, encounters, riots, etc., once the desert section began, all fell into context and I loved it. (Still aging very well.) At that moment, I was in what seemed to be a small minority. All the critics seemed to focus on the lack of action and the narrative. Luckily, I'm no longer in a minority. He looks skillfully (in somewhat prophetic way) the political splintering, the anxiety, the confrontation, the brutal repression, the commercialization and the deception that stand before. The appreciation of this master film has grown, and I'm glad of that.
