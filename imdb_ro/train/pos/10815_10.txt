Now, many would think I'm away from this movie just because of the title. If you do not have a stomach for empty movies, then what are you reading this review? Anyway, I borrowed the video from a friend of mine and I immediately fell in love with this movie. This movie is full of wonderful gore, plus other regular ingredients that make up a movie b-add up to a hell of a viewing experience! If you are a lover of good quality experiences, then by all means, watch this great movie!
