I enjoyed Albert Pyun's "Nemesis" for his brunette action and semi-complicated script. A lot of people complain about the "confused" plot of the first film, which is probably the reason why "Nemesis 2: The Nebula" has a bad plot like rocks with the same super action to carry it. <br /> <br /> This gives the name of the first movie hero, Alex, of a super-feminine shadow sent to the past to save the future. It is raised by a tribe in Africa. Much of the movie has only a dialogue in an African language without subtitles, which I liked because it made it look somewhat authentic (how often movies of this genre try to do that?). It does not take long for wicked cyborgs to travel back in time to find her and try to kill her. Do not get me wrong, is a piece of nonsense first was something great). There are subplots that involve African political anxiety, treasure hunting and tribal fighting. The image is very short on the brain, so none of these things get very good treatment. The image is, in principle, a struggle with some chases that worsens up to mouses-babe vs. cyborg. It has entertainment value, you do not expect quality or nothing in the first movie.
