I have to say that Higher Learning is one of the first three movies I've ever watched. It has a brilliant cast and a brilliant director. Singleton shows how life can be in the university. There are 3 main story lines, skinheads, African Americans and homosexuals. I was intrigued by all the stories, but the one who gave me the most was the story about Kristen, fighting her feelings about another girl. The end was wonderful. After seeing the movie 25 times more, I still cry. I would have given a 11, but I have to sit at 10/10.
