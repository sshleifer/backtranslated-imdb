This is probably Karisma at its best, except Zubeidaa. Nana Patekar also offers the best, without even trying. The story is very good sometimes, but to the end it seems to shoot, especially when Shahrukh comes in the picture. Which made me the leaders' performances, the delivery of the dialogue, and the story, for what it was. It could have been better directed and edited. The support case was really great, including Karima's mother in law, although she only had a brilliant moment, it was great to watch her. The sets were also pretty good. I did not like the portrait of a Canadian family very much, but once they stepped into India, it is just as true as he is. In general, I would give a big finger!
