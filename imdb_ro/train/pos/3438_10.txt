The film was remarkable despite the NC-17 rating and disturbing scenes. In reality things like this happen and that's why this movie shows many of them. It all starts with Maya (Rosario Dawson in a superb show), whose faculty has recently started having everything going well for her. He meets Jared (Chad Faust in a great performance) at a brother's party that turns out to be a real gentleman and sweet. He invites her to dinner. He looks at the stars on a bridge and ends up going to his apartment. I speak and I go to the basement if they get flirted with each other. He's trying to end it, but it's raping her. This scarp incident. She goes to a club meets a bartender / DJ Adrian (played with great success by Marcus Patrick), who sees that he gets drunk and helps before he goes away. They hit a friendship. He also makes drugs and Maya begins to use it as well. In other words, it introduces it into a different world. She starts going back to school and works as a Teacher and sees Jared as one of the students. As the students take a Midterm, she catches Jared cheating. Jared tries to talk Maya well, but she still has her upper hand deciding to invite her to her place. Will history repeat? Or Will Maya has a surprise for Jared? You will watch the movie. Excellent A. Rosario Dawson plays the role with focus and resilience. Chad Faust does not like being a rapist, but he does a great job like Jared. Marcus Patrick is very brilliant at the man who saves the Maya and trains her into a new world. This film deserves a prize.
