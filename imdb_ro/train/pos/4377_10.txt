The beginning of the mid-1990s was a turning point, in my opinion, for the historical drama. The last of the Mohicans, Braveheart, Rob Roy - all represented a distinct passion and intensity during those periods. Rob Roy has been a unique and exciting taste for a time and a rare place for the film. It really has everything - exciting story, extraordinary action, remarkable dialogue and breathtaking landscapes. I was particularly impressed by the seemingly authentic dialogue. I imagine that this is how the eighteenth century people spoke and behaved. Another thing that surprised me was the vulgarity expressed by the characters. It seemed more repulsive and shocking, though often more subtle than those found in modern-day films. The film had a very rational and sexually loaded edge, which was unique and very likely very realistic in the context of the era. The rhythm was very tight, with a difficult moment to confuse. There were many political intrigues and insights that complicated things a little, but they did not destroy the main story. The action was also very well done and tight. Something I will find forever remarkable is that there is no soundtrack during the movie action. It's a very tense sequence because we have no musical clue about the direction and resolution of the scene. Rob Roy will always stay high on my favorite list of movies. I would recommend to everyone.
