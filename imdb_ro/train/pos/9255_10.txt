If you want to have fun with a lot of subtle humor, then you will enjoy this movement. I do not understand why somebody will not enjoy it. Take it for what it is: a vehicle for Dennis Hopper to mess up with your head and laugh. It's not Shakespeare, but it's well done. Ericka Eleniak is absolutely beautiful and possesses her in this - better than any episode in Baywatch - and shows a talent for subtle humor. It's a shame she did not have many opportunities to expand on that. Tom Berenger perfectly fits his role as "true sailor", and William McNamara makes a solid job as a wizard. <br /> <br /> Throw Hopper in the middle of searching for 'Cherry on this Sundae' and you have a movie that has kept my attention and kept me laughing. I bought it as soon as it was available. <br /> <br /> Brain candy.
