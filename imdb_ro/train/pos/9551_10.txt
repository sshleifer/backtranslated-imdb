I have to say, I was surprised by the quality of the film. It was much better than I expected. The script and the acting are pretty good. The director did a good job too. Although some scenes seem a bit clumsy, it's a decent film. The idea was certainly brilliant, and the truth was not revealed to the end. The atmosphere of the mental hospital was quite good. The plot was clear, consistent and well thought out. Some people may find it a bit boring, though the story line is very focused and takes time to develop characters and storytelling. The moral of the story, is a decent film for his genre and is amazingly good.
