This is a very fun movie. One of them can sit down and look at your mind as the plot gets more and more twisted; more and more fun. Sally Field, Teri Hatcher (in Hei-Day), Kevin Klein, Elisabeth Shue, Robert Downey, Jr ... All these well-known quality actors act as if they were soap makers / manufacturers. If you've ever watched a soap opera and you thought, "How did they come up with this idea?", You'll love this movie. I have seen it several times; and every time I follow her, the more I appreciate the humor, the more I realize how well she really acted. Do not expect the Oscar. This is a fun movie to have fun, not an artistic attempt to find the "man of the inner man", etc. Stay back, relax and laugh.
