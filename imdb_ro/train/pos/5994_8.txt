I was pleased to watch the short film "The Cure," by first-time director Ryan Jafri. What really impresses me is working with camera and music. I think many young filmmakers (like me, I am one of them) would experience hard time with cinema when it starts making an indie. We see that production is not exactly what we imagined or under our ambitions. But this film, the directorial debut of a young director, did very well on the screen. The movement, the color, the light, the composition of the room contribute to the story and the emotion of the film. And music, as a key element of the film's language, also helps a lot. <br /> <br /> It's hard to portray a woman's heart, her desire, her fear, especially in a short time. But still, I must admit that I am not a fan of v / o (narration), especially when the film is advanced through narration, instead of photos and cuts. My personal sense of a narrative part is, I suppose the narrator has tried a little too hard. So energy pushes the audience back from the emotion of the movie. Generally, it's a nice short film, I could see a director's contribution. Thanks, Ryan! Hello from China, look forward to the next. <br /> <br />
