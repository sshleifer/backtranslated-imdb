this movie is great. if you have a chance to see it, then you should run to see it. even though the film has almost nothing to do with its original 1932, Pacino does a wonderful job playing as Tony Montana to get around. Pacino has this way about him where he can say anything anyway and makes the sound great. if you think Pulp Fiction was good with the jury words (if you saw it), then you should also see Scarface to see another angle to the way an actor can tell them. (pretty sweet), even if the movie has a lot of action and the plot moves very fast over time, it does not keep the real-time real-time aspect ratio, it's still easy to watch, but you have to keep your eyes busy at all times to lose nothing. personally, I discovered that watching this movie makes three hours look like a breeze, it's really that big. This movie is one of thoe films that is acted and guided so well that you not only forgot that this movie was made in the 80's, but that it makes you a root for the bad guy ... "So you say good night type BAD "
