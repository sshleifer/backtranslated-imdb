This was one of the best episodes of time. Officer Sean Cooper was killed in his patrol car in the '68. A dying prisoner in the state penitentiary reveals he stole a block of heroin from the car after shooting. His case is reopened with the assumption that he was corrupted as a policeman. Further investigations into him as a police officer and a human being reveal a war veteran involved in a forbidden love. This type of love was considered shameful and at least kept hidden at that time. While this kind of love I personally supported, he was still a policeman and a human being and should not have been killed for that. The soundtrack was excellent (it keeps me looking at the DVR) and the selective use of black and white colors mixed with color to accent an object or to give a certain feeling to a scene was particularly appealing. I will follow him on a number of occasions!
