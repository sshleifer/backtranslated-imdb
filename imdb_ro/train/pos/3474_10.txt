This film is worth seeing for Jared Harris's extraordinary portrait of John Lennon. It does not matter that Harris does not look exactly like Lennon; his manners, expressions, posture, accent and attitude are pure Lennon. The best scene: Lennon in a local verbal sparring caf√© with a stuttering fan on the fact that Paul McCartney & Wings "Silly Love Songs" is worthy of status # 1 in America.
