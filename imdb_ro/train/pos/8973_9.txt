I saw this movie when I was a little kid on TV (thanks to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) and I have had nightmares about it for years. Trnka was one of the mentors of Bratislav Pojar, one of Canada's best animator of the National Film Council. Pojar was, in turn, a mentor and collaborator for the great Drouin. If you like Trnka, you should see Angel Angel. The symbol is obvious, but it is used with skill. The opposites of beauty and life (the plant) are in opposition to the anonymity of the glove. The poor puppet hero is condemned despite the lack of a political agenda. What I remembered most was the feeling of oppression in decoration. The small room where action takes place is the whole world of the character. Invasion by hand is a complete violation of this world. Beautiful and haunted movie. I found a copy of this and other shorts from Trnka at the public library and showed it to my children. I need to see.
