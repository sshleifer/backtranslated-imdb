Ladies Man laughs loudly with a very varied distribution, as well as some very stupid but excellent scenes (including the most funny love song ever written). Ferrell is his usual quality self in a shining. <br /> <br /> Tim Meadows plays a surprisingly good idiot and has written some of the funniest lines you'll find in any comedy there. buying as they follow it every 6 months or so will lead to still laughing as hard as you did the first time. I am distracted to think about the time of writing that it has a small 4.7 / 10 and I urge you to vote! <br /> <br /> And remember your kids- "More Motion in the Ocean"
