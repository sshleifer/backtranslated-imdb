This movie was great and even with a less convincing end, it's still good to see. The movie begins as Claudette Colbert is about to marry Robert Ryan. When the minister asks if anyone has objections, a guy goes up and announces that Colbert can not marry because he's already married! Colbert insists this is not true, but when they investigate they find that Peace Justice and many others remember her wedding and that there is even a signed wedding license! Slowly, it becomes obvious that Claudette's mind slips, and people around her doubt her earnestness. Then, when the alleged husband is murdered, all the evidence and suspicions fall on Colbert. The film is an exciting film of mysteries, as we have just described the first half of the film. The following is amazingly intelligent and exciting. Unfortunately, the conclusion is a bit disappointing, as the driving force behind all these things turns out to be "even in the left field" - and it is confusing because it was so unexpected and impossible to guess on the basis of the information provided viewer. However, despite this, the movie was so good, I can even excuse the end of limp. In particular, Robert Ryan did a great job as a fianc√© "whip", although, apart from him, the other shows were also excellent.
