"House of Games" is a blueprint and one of the few movies I've seen made me look at the screen, amazed by how smart and unexpected it is. I saw it for the first time in a few years after reading the review of Roger Ebert, who proclaimed him the best film since 1987. I had doubts, mainly because he is not as well known as other films of that year . Boys, I was surprised. This was one of the smartest and best-written movies I've ever seen. The script is quite a piece of work, not just about the plot (which twists and turns and pulls the bush out from under you only when you think you've found everything), but also in terms of character development. At the second watch I began to realize that Mamet's script succeeds not only as a smart suspense film but that each development of the plot contributes to the understanding of their characters and motivations. The climax of the film is particularly effective, because it is absolutely inevitable. It comes naturally from what we know about the characters and therefore is much more than just an ending of arbitrariness. The performances of Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegna also add enormously to the film. I can not imagine any other actor, except Mantegna, who plays Mike, and Crouse plays the role with a suitable amount of collapse to suggest a repressed criminal mentality. Their work, plus the extraordinary script of Mamet, combines to create one of the greatest movies of the '80s. It's really a necessity.
