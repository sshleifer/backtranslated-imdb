Before going to politics or public service, Glenda Jackson was one of the most beautiful actresses in the UK. This film shows its talent, despite having a supporting role in a star cast, including Julie Christie as Kitty, the wife of a royal British captain who has lost her memory for the last 20 years, and Jenny played by to American Ann-Margret in an unrecognizable role as a sister sister. Alan Bates plays the captain who suffers from memory loss triggered by Shell's shock during World War I. Mr. Ian Holm has a smaller role than the doctor treating him. See familiar faces like Sheila Keith, Patsy Byrne and Frank Finlay. You can not forget that Glenda plays a dowdy housewife and the Captain's first true love, but they came from different classes. It's not the biggest movie, but it's good to see Glenda's amazing talent. She is still a fantastic actress, a comedy or a drama. It makes Margaret Gray a nice character and see why a royal captain fell in love with her.
