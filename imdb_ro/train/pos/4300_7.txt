This movie could have been one of those common "soaps" that refer to the daily events of half the families whose lives are interwoven ... broken relationships, building new friendships, street busts, near accidents, hopes and dreams and even the discovery of a child thrown under some shrubs! What a mix of events! Fortunately, the film maker goes beyond those day-to-day events and puts questions that you can consider, although there are no satisfying answers. Wonders in this chaotic world that things are happening, it's just luck when things turn out to be good or, with a fatalist view, is a person predestined to be in a certain place at a certain moment and thus get involved in event and its future has a new perspective? Most of us have had this extraordinary experience. Is that our super-ego that makes us think we are so important? As a character says? he stood once on the edge overlooking the Grand Canyon and came to realize how infinitely small he was. This is not one of my favorite films, but it's a good study of human relationships. Danny Glover is remarkable in a nice role.
