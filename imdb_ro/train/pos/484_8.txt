Alexandr "Sascha" Luzhin (John Turturro) is a former chess player who tried to return to a touring hosted by Italy. His glow is undoubtedly, but his obsession with chess has slowed growth in all other aspects of his life. Natalia (Emily Watson) is a beautiful heir who came to the same village as her mother, Vera (Geraldine James), to express her marriage partners. Vera is heading for a nice number, but, surprisingly, Natalia is more fascinated by Sascha, whom she met in a walk. Sascha is also taken along with Natalia and proposes marriage at the second meeting. But with the concentration that Sascha has to give to chess matches, and with other events in its past, it still causes problems, will it win the heart of Natalia? And maybe he's the chess champion? This is a wonderful film, based on a novel by Nabokov. The actress is stunning, with Watson very well as the beautiful and rich girl, and Turturro makes the perfection as a shy and uncomfortable enthusiast. James is pretty nice because the arrogant mother and the other members of the casting are wonderful. As for the aspect of the movie, it could not be better. The scenery is a variety of stories, vintage costumes are gorgeous and cinematography deserves a lot of applause. Yes, the story is unusual and told me when using flashbacks, sometimes making a movie that everyone will not appreciate. Then, and the end is bitter. However, if you love love, vintage pieces, an excellent adventure, a knockout decoration or a beautiful art of movie making, do not miss this. You will be defenseless in resisting the multitude of charm.
