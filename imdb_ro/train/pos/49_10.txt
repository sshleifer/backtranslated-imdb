If you do not have it, it's magnificent. If not, it's decent. Please understand that "getting" does not necessarily mean you went through a shooting school. There is much more to this film, which sometimes makes the film less insignificant. Above all, it is a film about accepting, both superficially - a traumatic event, and people who are different, for whatever reason. It is also a film about the inerrant pain and the way people are different. In this case, the contrast between Alicia's anger and Deanna's obsession creates an atmosphere of such palpable anxiety that, halfway through the movie, we ask how the director could pull a happy ending out of his hat. Fortunately, the audience is credited to be human beings; our intelligence is not insulted by a wild, unpredictable moralist end. In addition, I'm trying to keep a clear head about movies that are fiction and all that. Still, I have to admit, I cried like a little child lost during this film. There were certain things about this that hit very close to the house and opened some old wounds that were never healed. But that is not necessarily a bad thing.
