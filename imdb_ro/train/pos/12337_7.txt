Poor Ivy: Although in the way she was born, she had the misfortune to marry a charming wastrel (Richard Ney). As the movie is set in the 20s or 30s, when rigid class Victorian ideas begin to break out, this uncertainty bothers him unjustifiably. Gretoxies (because they are so called) do not know where their next shilling comes from, but there are yachting parties and fantasy balls that are kind of fun to tempt him. When Ivy (Joan Fontaine) becomes acquainted with a wealthy older man (Herbert Marshall, who must have been born a middle-aged), she sets up one of her extravagant monks. Fortunately, one of the beaux she's still collecting (Patric Knowles) is a physician whose consulting cabinet supplies a poison cache, with which she favors her. The fact that Knowles is involved does not make it in phase, even if the hours are leaking until he's hung on his throat until he's dead. Change of plot depends on police inspector Sir Cedric Hardwicke; Knowles's mother (Lucile Watson); and Knowles's loyal caretaker (Una O'Connor). Sam Wood adds some subtle touches to this melody far above the media; Fontaine's bright face ensures the rest.
