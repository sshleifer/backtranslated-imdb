I complained to ABC about the cancellation of six degrees. If enough people do the same, then it would be enough to get back to this fabulous show! Just go to the official site, and the rest is pretty simple. I do not understand why the show was canceled. What a fantastic show, cast and characters. The whole concept is exciting viewing! I am amazed that my favorite show ended in one series. Why this? Six degrees are phenomenal, it's better than so many other TV programs out there! Until I heard I was stopping from a friend, I did not even think it could happen.
