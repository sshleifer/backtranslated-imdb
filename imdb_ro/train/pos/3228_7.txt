David Webb The peoples meet with Paul Anderson ... if it seems strange to you then you are right, because it is. The peoples are known for its scenarios with moral implications of what is good and bad, the value of life, etc. He has covered these issues in Bladerunner, Unforgiven, and quite a lot in all his scenarios there is something about it. Paul Anderson's first successful film was a violent thriller. It is not surprising that they have all his other movies! And here is a violent thriller with moral implications! The scenes of the people are quite obvious in the first half of the film. Soldiers trained from birth have learned to kill and have never had a normal life. They are replaced by more genetically engineered soldiers, and Todd, one of the original soldiers, is left on a planet and left dead. There they have to deal with a group of refugees, others let them hang on to others, and there is an interesting drama here. But then ... <br /> <br /> ... Bullets begin to fly as the new soldiers move to the planet for a military exercise and try to kill all people. Strong, violent and powerful actions take place, and the people's screenplay turns into an Anderson action event. It's hard to believe that the script was originally written this way, but the final product is better than I expected. Directing, to a certain extent, though not very, causing thinking and excitement once the action begins. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Rated: a lot of violence
