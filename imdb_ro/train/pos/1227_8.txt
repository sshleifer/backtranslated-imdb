I caught this movie on my local movie channel and I enjoyed watching the movie. She has all the elements of a good teen movie and more - this film, apart from relationships with boys-girls and sex and the like, deals with the issue of using steroids by young people. <br /> <br /> The film has that real life feeling it - not the loud music, no special effects or scandalous scenes - which, for this film, was right. This sense makes it easy to relate to the characters in the movie - of which we probably know where we live from. Generally, a good, fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> 8/10
