A wonderful movie. Lansbury and Tomlinson are perfect, the songs are wonderful, the dances, with a special mention for "Portballo Ballet", are wonderful. As for the animated section, the match between animals has become an instant classic; the climax of the army attack is cool and fascinating. I recommend you view the restored 134-minute version or at least the 112-minute video. Here, in Italy, we only have a 98-minute version, although the movie was presented in its original version, with a duration of 117 minutes. If possible, watch the German videocassette: it was generated from 98 minutes of operation, but it is missing from every reference to World War II and all scenes between the English and the Nazi invaders!
