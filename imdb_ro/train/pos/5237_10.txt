Are we all creating our own reality or not? This is the key issue underlying this very original and artisanal examination of the illusory nature of reality. Combining oriental and Buddhist philosophies with the visual chicanity of M.C. Escher, this fascinating treat succeeds in taking the rather cerebral question "Who are we and who is our place in the universe" and transforming it into an exciting and fun 100-minute. The film focuses on Bart, a writer struggling with his screenplay, "The Sea Thinking". While sitting on his computer, the work begins as a description of his computer session, writing the script. Before long, he is stuck in a veritable roar in which everything he writes becomes reality. Director Gert de Graaff approaches his subject with a sense of humor and conceals the viewer with a series of astonishing visual tricks that are confronted with the nature and validity of our perception. Eventually, Graaff's film challenges the audience on several levels to ask whether something we see, touch or taste is really what it seems to be, or if the whole understanding of the universe and our place in it is just a trick played by our senses.
