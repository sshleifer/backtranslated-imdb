All the comments here about how much ZP plot does, the act is wooden, the orgy scene does not make sense, etc., all lack the main point. To be honest. This is a film made in the hard times of the late 1960s and early 1970s, Los Angeles. This is a film to watch while you are H-I-G-H in your mind on a certain psychedelic substance. Find some buds and smoke, or get a slight acid blast. Seriously, these straight and sober reviews of ZP lose the point. You can not take anything out of this movie into a right frame of mind. Until you've looked at this movie on the big screen (which I'm lucky to have done three times in the 1990s when ZP was quite rare), because you have no idea what this film is about . If you insist that you do not look at him, you can not appreciate the end when the carp blows up to the soundtrack of Pink Floyd's wonderful remake of "Watch that ax, Eugene," "Come to number 51, your time is up ".
