"The fear of a black shirt" is all that should (much weaker) "CB-4". Rusty Cundieff's satirical eye is ruthless, he slides, spins and mutilates every aspect of hip-hop trends and culture. "FoaBH" resembles Spinal Tap? Yes a little. Is it derived from the Spinal Tap? No, not really. The goal is more focused, satire is better focused and, to be honest, is more fun.
