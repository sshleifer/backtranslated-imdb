I did not look at all walking. People really did go places then. He borrowed an air of authenticity to this epoch and a perspective on Martian technology. I was also disappointed with the effects, especially the "Thunderchild" scene, which I consider to be one of the most interesting in the book. But I can not boast this movie pretty much for its faithfulness to Wells story! It was about time. The actors are pleasant, and the performances are charming. Also, this movie is worthwhile to see just to hear Jamie Hall's musical score. It was interesting to see the same actor role, both his writer and his brother in London.
