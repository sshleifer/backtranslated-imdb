Just joking about weight loss; well, you may lose the weight you never know. Anyway, what can I say, I like this movie. He has the same sense of youth and innocence found in films like Stand By Me and The Goonies. Jake's lug shows the beauty of the simple things of life and how often we look at them. The film reminds us how to see the world through children's eyes and all the magic, mystery and horror they perceive. Jake's closet presents a unique human story in his compassion that anyone with a childhood can relate and fall in love with her. Look with your friends; watch him with his loved ones; build a fort - voluntary wine.
