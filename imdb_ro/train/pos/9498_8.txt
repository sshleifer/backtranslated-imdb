"Painting I see, then remembering you better than you have seen." This is how Dick Heldar (Ronald Colman), the painter from The Light That Failed. The film is in the old Hollywood style with Ronald Colman and a brave lover who supports the cast including Ida Lupino in her first major role, the reliable character actor Dudley Digges (who also starred with Colman in Condemned.) And performance solid actor Walter Huston. The title and opening sequences of the movie give quite a lot of the fact that Dick will lose his sight. He is blinded by powder-like shavings as he and his beloved child Maisie (Muriel Angelus) play with a gun. Later, a wound while struggling in Sudan is a catalyst for his blindness. He becomes a famous painter, but he is already blinded by ambition and does not reach his full potential until he leaves his vision. Go to Bessie's face (Ida Lupino), and his destruction is set in motion. Lupino is very strong in this role and plays Colman very well. Her bad cake reminds me of Bette Davis in "The Bondage Human". <br /> <br /> Well acting and well-directed, this is one of my favorite Colman melodies.
