We chose this movie based on the plot summary and the critics' quotes behind the box. I'm not great in foreign movies and I do not know what to expect. I do not really care about subtitles. But I loved him absolutely! It has a simple, pleasant quality that lets you feel good about life. I woke up laughing loudly repeatedly. I would recommend this image to anyone, even to those who are looking at foreign movies with subtitles. This is worth the effort.
