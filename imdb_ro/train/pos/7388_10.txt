The seventh Oscars was a very good one. Whoopi's work as EmCee was very fun and easy. I personally liked her last appearance, which gathered some cool reviews because of rude language and jokes, but that's good. The audience seemed to like it. Halle Berry, Denzel Washington, Ron Howard, Woody Allen and Sidney Poitier have made this an Oscar show to remember. <br /> <br />
