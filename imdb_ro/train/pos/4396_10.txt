I really liked the detail that went into the script. Jonathan Rhys Myers (wrong) and Jewel were outstanding in their supporting roles. Like Jeffery Wright. Toby McGuire offered a good job as ever when he had to amputate the best friend's arm, knowing he would die without procedure. <br /> <br /> Attention to details, with good dialect coaching to catch the South's incredibly well. Why this movie was swept under the carpet by the Hollywood promoters, I can only imagine. I have strong suspicions. Which makes it more appealing to me. I gave a dozen DVDs for gifts. Completely neglected film. Rent it or buy it and give it your full attention for a few hours, then judge it.
