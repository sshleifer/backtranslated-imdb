The best serial in Zorro and one of my favorite series, period. This is a serial period established just after the birth of Mexico. The new nation relies on the gold produced by this city to keep the republic solvable. However, a golden god, Don del Oro, shakes the Indians and steals the gold for himself. Zorro and his band of men for salvation. Reed Hadley is a winning Zorro and cuts off an elegant figure as he enters a beautiful selection of debris (most of which are reused later by Zorro series as well as other series). The story moves and it's not good what the real bad guy is. There's a reason I've seen this most from any serial I've ever seen, just a great adventure action movie. The only thing I can compare is Mark of Zorro with Tyrone Power or one of the other wizards of the period. Super and highly recommended.
