The brothers with psycho-kinetic powers (yes, indeed) duel not only for Debra Winger's affections, but really over a childhood secret that has left them in contradiction with their powers. Surreal touches act like a chorus in Greek), but there is humor, intelligence and love. The soundtrack is also great. And, like the way the American Wizard of London used every Wolf song very good but with fire and I do not think I'll ever forget Dennis Quaid (mmmmm Dennis Quaid), setting up his own trailer and rocking it Madame ~ invaluable;) <br /> <br /> The best missing line in btw ~ quotation section Once you have a clown, do not go back! <br /> <br /> I love this movie (I only ordered the DVD in the US) and if the written comments of the kind of people who would be happier with Legally Blond 3 did not put you down ~ give it a try :)
