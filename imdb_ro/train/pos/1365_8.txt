He-he-hello !! This is a very fun movie. Practically, in Party Girl, you have an independent funny chick since the early 90's, New Yorker. Together with her party friends, she meets a mature Turkish provider. It's an age story for those new adults who are looking for what they want to do. It is comforting to see a weakened woman develop into a mature woman. Hope is given to all who may feel the only skills they can have to keep them while they have been knocked and a thorn for throwing good parties. On a side note, Parker Posey makes this wonderful movie. I've never been a big fan of her, but this movie makes me want to just watch all her movies. There are subtle manners that have perfected their character. If you want good laughs and a fun time, make sure you watch this movie. Repeated views are a must.
