I was not a fan of seeing this movie at all, but when he phoned me and told me he had a free passage of advanced screening, I labeled just to see eva longoria and laugh at jason biggs antics. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was actually better than expected, but not much. this was like a hybrid of how to lose a guy in 10 days and just like the sky. a romantic comedy with the moments I suppose. the film was pretty short (about 85 minutes), but it was enough to tell the whole story, build character development and have a happy ending. The whole idea of ​​the ghost that haunts the former husband was an interesting plot to follow. Eva did a good job of keeping sarcasm and ruddy paul, and the rest of the supporting parts (especially Jason Biggs) kept the laughs coming at a smooth pace. Overall, I liked the movie just because she had a lot of laughs to keep me otherwise it would have given this movie a lower rating. hey is a chicken movie and I review this movie from a good perspictive guy, it would be more of a fair fight if the women reviewed this movie and gave thoughts there about it.
