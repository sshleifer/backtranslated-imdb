William Wyler should have directed Moss Hart's adaptation of Moss Hart's Broadway hit with poster-live music / recruitment, but his military engagements went to the least likely executioner: George Cukor. The "Director of Women" has a secure attitude to many Air Corps-like documentaries, and invests it with more unprejudicated humanity than the genre generally allowed, especially during the war. Of course, bad luck (and whites, except for a Chinese-American unipline) is better and healthier than real life, and the talk about home and mother and wife and child becomes rather thick, but it is effective propaganda and undoubtedly stir. It is also remarkable for the military male cast, some of which have not recurred for years: Lon McAllister, Edmond O'Brien, Martin Ritt, Red Buttons (in love as Andrews Sister), Peter Lind Hayes, Karl Malden, Kevin McCarthy, Gary Merrill, Lee J. Cobb and Don Taylor. Also, for a brief look at Judy Holliday, which does not appear up to an hour and a half in the picture, but has some good sequences, such as Brooklyn's husband worried about O'Brien's illness. Too bad that his rights are in a mess, and the only print someone knows is 16mm; obviously, after Twentieth Century Fox launched it (on a considerable success), the rights returned to the army, and if there's a good 35mm print there, it's probably somewhere in the Pentagon's intestine. It is disingenuous and horned in spots, but it also captures the rigorous military preparations and the terror of the war and deserves to be seen more.
