A modern, original, romantic story. Very good action of Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin. Miss Kidman does a beautiful job immitting a Russian accent. Ben Chaplin is also good as a shy, boring clerk. For men (and for some women): miss Kidman looks fantastic and is very sympathetic. I forgot what a beautiful woman is. It's not hard to imagine John falling in love with her. Some unexpected transformations in the story are good for suspense. Although I hoped for a happy ending, the last part of the film was a surprise to me. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: movie good. <br /> <br /> Les Pays-Bas: points huit.
