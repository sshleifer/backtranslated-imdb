Well, if you are one of Katana's filming movies (like me), surely you will appreciate this metaphysics, the bloody Katana, spitting action of samurai action. Daisuke (Kagemusha). This samurai war between Heiki's clan and Genji's clan reaches the zenith in the last showdown at Gojo Bridge. The number of bodies is countless. Demons, magic swords, Shinto priests versus Buddhist monks and beautiful visions offered by Master Sogo Ishii will do the rest. A good Japanese move a rainy summer night.
