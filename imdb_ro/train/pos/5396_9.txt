Simple, meaningful and offers an emotional blow. I regularly go through short films, and it's always nice to meet something that has a simple, luminous message, with no complacency or self-indulgent guidance. A boy at school has to attend a lesson when his boyfriend is playing and has the most important lesson of his life, just to find out that when there are not enough kids to go around he has to share school bully. Unlike most short films with children or actors, these children keep their own and are credible. The soundtrack complements the song's emotion and the punchline of the movie works well.
