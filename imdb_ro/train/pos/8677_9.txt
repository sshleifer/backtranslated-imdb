This movie seems to be well remembered as the moment when Tom & Jerry signed a peace treaty. Things are idyllic for a while, but, predictably, it is sour. Perhaps the most memorable moment was the endless battle that involved a pipe, a skillet and a baseball bat that the two plus Butch, the dog engages in the beginning and end of the short. I liked a bunch and you should try to catch it on Cartoon Network.
