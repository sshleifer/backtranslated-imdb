I give this movie 7 out of 10 because the villains were interested in their roles, and the strange mocker creates an interesting "guess who" game. The film, however, needs more Robin in it. He appeared in the film at first and sporadically in the rest. I always thought that the new animated series did little to the new character Robin, not to mention Knightwing. This movie just continues that bad tradition. The film spends too much time on Bruce Wayne and his love story, which would not be so bad in a movie if romanticism was not so incredible. It's still a good movie if you're a Batman fan and I'd recommend watching it.
