If Endwalks is pretty good movie-Noir crime murder and is shot well in black and white and on location as well. Copper accidentally kills a guy who is suspected of murder, and to protect himself, he covers this and blames him for another person who does not like who has committed many crimes in the past. But until the end, he holds, but not before he falls in love with a woman he meets who is the lover of the person he murdered ... The cast includes Dana Andrews (While the city is sleeping, The Curse of the Demon) Gene Tierney, Gary Merrill (Mysterious Island), Karl Malden (The Streets of San Francisco beyond the Posidon adventure) and Craig Stevens (The Deadly Mantis). Good parts at all. If Endwalks deserve to check if you have the chance. Excellent. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
