This movie is exciting, bold and the music is very good. The Moonwalker movie was meant to coincide with the Bad album (1987). I'm Bad.It is excellent (*****). "The Man in the Mirror" on stage. Michael's history, from his beginnings in Jackson 5 to the Bad age. Oh, and Badder is also good (Badder is a music video parody of the music video for Bad single). Then show the Speed ​​Demon video. The song and the video are really great, just because you leave me alone, which comes afterwards. Then he shows the movie Moonwalker. after a few minutes, he plays a troublemaker in a club called 30-year club, like when he does lean.howway, nice to see you.
