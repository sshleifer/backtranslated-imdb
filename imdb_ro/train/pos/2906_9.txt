A funny action comedy in which Damian Szifron enters Díaz's life, a policeman whose wife cheated on him. He lives in a hotel that feels guilty of his wife's unfaithfulness, falling into depression, stopping care, running to red lights just for fun, feeling bad for himself. And Silberman, a psychiatrist Jew during probation, a left-wing liberal who has no confidence in the cops. He was told to accompany Díaz to his daily duties, unable to refuse because of the test conditions. Soon the situation comes back when Silberman himself learns that his wife inserts them and gets to be comforted by the person he should be helping, a person he did not trust at first. A nuclear conspiracy, machine thieves, international spies, a hysterical wife. Strange characters in a delightful comedy about friendship and heroism.
