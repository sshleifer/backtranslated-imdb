Maybe I'm a bit, but this is the sweetest movies ever! I saw it for the first time when I was four or five years old and I cried out. Meanwhile and now (embarrassed at the age of 15) I have seen it more than 25 times and we cried each one of them. Do not worry about tears of happiness! And it's not all! There is also a lot of humor and comedy in it. Usually the whole thing about animals talking can be a huge drama, but this film is not the case. My only word of advice: Even if you like this ... You do not see the next ... cornyness! I suggest that everyone check this ... you will not be bad, no matter how old or you are!
