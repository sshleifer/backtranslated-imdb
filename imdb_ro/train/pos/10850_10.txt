What a good movie! Finally, an image that reveals an unknown side of rock: illusions of fame. Well-known Rockers aged and did not watch, not music. And with a good sense of humor. Have you ever danced Bill Haley's Rock around the clock? Anyway, Still Crazy is probably the best rock n'roll movie I've ever seen. Much better than Spinal Tap, for example. Why? Because in Crazy Style people are mature. They have a different view of rock, love and life. They want to catch up with their crazy youth that they lack so much. Beyond the story itself, we see characters with their own personality, weaknesses and dreams. Like any of us. Spend a good time watching this (listen to awesome background music!) And, finally, thinking about your future. <br /> <br /> Pa!
