This movie hit me home. When I'm 29, I remember the 1980s and my father worked in a factory. I imagined that if I worked too hard, if I were proud and would never give up, I could have my American dream, the house, some children, a car to call me mine. However, I noticed that without a diploma in something (as opposed to my father who gave up the 9th grade) and a sense of greed and laziness, you can not get anywhere. I'd like to know if anyone has this movie on DVD or VHS. It's done for television and I just saw it an hour ago. You can not find her anywhere! I would like to show this to my friends, my pseudo friends, family and other relatives, to see what they think and remind them that once Americans work for the sake of feeling honor and that we are proud of what we achieved !! I think the feeling is still there, but in a spiral down, with many things done abroad ...
