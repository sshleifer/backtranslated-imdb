Okay, we've overrated it just to compensate for at least one of these relentless reviews. But I liked it. I did not laugh out loud, but it kept my interest and they fired me without letting me go at any time. The story was built. Yeah, you knew he'd have a happy ending-this guy always. Meanwhile, it was strange with gags that he might lose, so be careful when you look. Stiller and Black again gave him a great experience. Good team. They should work together more. I do not know it will be a classic cult, but it was certainly a fun walk. It's not as good as what about BOB, or DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS but what is it? Still worth it to get out of your way a bit to get and watch this movie.
