I've seen Insomniac's Nightmare not long ago for the first time and I have to say, I did look pretty good. If you are a fan of Dominic Monaghan, you will love it. The hole movie takes place in his mind - or not? Taking action from anyone else is a bit hurried and unstoppable and some scenes could be cut but eventually it works. DVD extracts are just as wonderful as the movie, if not bigger for Dom fans. He has a lot of sincere moments from the stage, outtakes and a great interview with the director. Anyone who went through making an independent film would like to watch Tess (the director), Dom and everyone else in the very close personal set trying to beat this creepy triptic movie. It was pretty nice and I'm glad I got into my collection.
