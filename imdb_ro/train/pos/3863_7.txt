This is an exciting series that takes real-life people (Jesse James, John Wesley Hardin, etc.) ... and dramatizes part of their real story, with a continuous series character, taking part in that story. Matt Clark's track detective - has a role in following famous legends in the Old West in stories that are based, at least in part, on real accounts. In this sense, there is almost a series of anthologies and, as someone else has pointed out, this strange structure presents some chronological conflicts with real events, but it is a fun series with a lot of actions to meet an audience from the 1950s, still more it's pretty good 55 years later. Clark cuts a strong figure in his Western gear as he heads against evil baddies in history. His brother Frankie is a kind of food. If you're a Western fan, make sure you check if you have a chance.
