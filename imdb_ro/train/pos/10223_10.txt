* some spoilers * I was pleasantly surprised to find unwarranted harsh criticism (action, dated dialogue, blurry story). Belafonte is awesome as a Brandoesque, threatening, swearing spirit who has to win his wings, but is realistically inappropriate in his past life to do so. He learns too late how empty the materialist life without love. Mostel is also great as a man puzzled with his wife dying Fanny. Despite his prayers for a miracle, his bitterness prevents him from accepting (or believing) in one. The two social worlds that the characters represent are alternately the collision and the completion of the other, the result being hilarious and emotionally sad. After watching Belafonte everywhere, Mostel looks up to see a falling feather, and he gets frenzy for him as though he is finally willing to believe in angels and miracles. But Belafonte was not allowed to finish his miracle (either to restore Fanny's health or to Mostel's faith), so he never took his wings. Feathers float from Mostel's trap, a metaphor for men's life: it's too late and you do not get a second chance. As "A Wonderful Life," this movie is magical, wonderful, funny, but very tragic.
