It was provocative of soul! I am an Iranian and I live in the 21st century, I did not know that such great tribes live in such conditions during my grandfather! You see this today or even in 1925, on one side of the world, a lady or a child could have everything for him or clean and on demand, but 80 years ago, people ventured their lives to go somewhere with more Grass. It is very interesting that these Persians bear the difficulties of finding pasture for their sheep, but they lose many sheep in their own way. Praise the Americans who accompanied this tribe, were as tough as the people of Bakhtiari.
