I love this movie. My only disappointment was that some original songs were changed. It is true that Frank Sinatra does not have the chance to sing as much in this movie, but it's also nice that it's not just another Frank Sinatra movie where I did the most. I thought it best to use Marlon Brando's voice because he has the matching voice and I did not see anyone with this great voice in his voice. "Sit Down, you rockin 'the boat" is a foot-tappin, "it's a long song I love. It's a tough thing to follow with its version and I still like the best." Vivian Blaine is just excellent in this part, and "Adelaide's Lament" is my favorite song. <br /> <br /> I thought Jean Simmons was perfect for this part. Maybe I would not have thought of her before, but after Michael Kidd's choreography is timeless, and if he were re-organized in 2008, I would not change anything. "I found that something was often lost from the stage version to the movie version , but this kept the sensation of the scene, even if it was on the film. I thought the movie was well distributed, I played in regional versions of this, and it's one of my favorites at that time.
