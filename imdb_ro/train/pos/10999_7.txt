This movie is about this boy who decides to become a spy for a company of high-tech charm called Digicorp. This terrible guy, Morgan (Jeremy Northam) is unhappy with his unfortunate suburban life and his demanding wife, so he decides to become a spy. He has to go to conventions from other high tech companies and find out all the plans of the companies. Instead, Morgan feels attracted to a beautiful woman (played by Lucy Liu) and is almost doubled by these two companies that force him to become a double agent. How's Morgan going? Can she trust the beautiful but mysterious Rita Foster (played by Lucy Liu)? More importantly, maybe Morgan can make her alive? Wow! What a great movie! I was completely aspired after 15 minutes of watching this movie. It's very suspense, and you can feel Morgan's fear and confusion because he's doing his best to stay alive. The scene in which they put this horrible lie on Morgan's head to wash his brain is brightly creepy and frightening. Morgan goes slowly through a transformation of personality, which is not so obvious until you think of it after the movie is over. From a boy with his hair and wicked glasses, he turns into a man who actively fights for his life. The end, wow, end is incredible! Twisting is so fun! I was panting and astonished as crazy! Good performances from all corners, especially from Jeremy Natham, Lucy Liu and Nigel Bennett. I recommend this film!
