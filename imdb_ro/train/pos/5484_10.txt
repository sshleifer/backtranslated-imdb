This film is essentially a documentary of the series of chronologically ordered events that took place between April 10, 2002 and April 14, 2002 in the Venezuelan Presidential Palace, Caracas, Venezuela. The patron of the film is real and it feels the pain, sadness and joy of the people who have lived through this unsuccessful coup of President Hugo Chavez. One comes from watching this film that Hugo Chavez is truly a great historical figure. Hugo Chavez's person has brought the Venezuelan people to overturn the 3-day armed junta and restore the democratically established government of Venezuela. It is evident from the film that George W Bush helped and urged Venezuela's coup. That mass media helped and urged George W. Bush is not surprising. What is surprising is how few people have seen this movie and how few people are doing the total corruption of the American media. <br /> It took only 20 years for Ronald Reagan to abolish the Doctrine of Correctness in 1986 to turn America into an orbiting and kinship-free state. Hugo Chavez opens the eyes of patriotic Americans to the truth and beauty of the true American vision.
