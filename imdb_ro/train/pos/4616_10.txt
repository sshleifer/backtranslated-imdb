The title of this movie is taken from a party game called "Seven Minutes in the Sky". The game was popular among my husband's friends when he was in Brooklyn, NY, and he describes him as "Spin-the-Bottle", "Lifesaver Relay" and other kissing games. According to the rules, the name of a boy and a girl will be drawn, and the chosen ones want to enter a locked closet together and stay there for seven minutes. Meanwhile, there was speculation among party guests about whether or not the two had their nerves to hold their hands, hug and / or kiss each other in the privacy of the closet. At the end of the seven minutes, the game leader would say, "Time is up" or knock on the closet door, and the couple will get out of the closet. After being summoned by the other guests, the couple would have to admit what they had done during the "Seven minutes in the sky". Then other couples would be chosen to enter the closet until all the guests had attended. The couple who admitted that they would do the most would be the winners of the game. Such games have served as "icebreakers" for children and adolescents, but can be embarrassing and intimidated by shy individuals. The film received this title because it deals with the early experiences of adolescents with sweets and romantic love.
