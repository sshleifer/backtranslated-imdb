I like this movie because I grew up around the race. Pat Boone behind the comfort reminds me of my father, who was attracted by the trotters, because, unlike pure-bred jockeys, men of normal height and weight can be drivers. <br /> <br /> Yes, the 1944 house in Indiana is a better movie, but it's also a very different movie. April Love is easy and easy to watch, a good movie. (Disappointing that Pat Boone's religious / moral opinions forbade him ever to kiss his little girl!) In a house in Indiana with Walter Brennan (shot in black and white without suggesting that someone will ever sing in the song ) captures stress and fights better, thus making the final achievement more satisfactory, but requires a greater emotional investment.
