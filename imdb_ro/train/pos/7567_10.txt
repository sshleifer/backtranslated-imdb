An excellent film that illustrates cross-currents in the life of a multi-ethnic mix of people who are not so accustomed to the northwest of the Pacific. Strong direction and writing along with fine action, especially the performance of Kwami Taha and Dan Stowe. Interestingly, this movie was made in the same year as "Crash," with great success, written and directed by Paul Haggis. The action rate can not be as frenetic as the one in Los Angeles, and the characters may seem better known to each other in "Apart From That," but the characters' personal relationships are just as erroneous and troubled and stories as resonant as any of the Crash. For those viewers who appreciated the movie "Crash," you have to watch the movie. Also, fans of Jim Jarmusch and John Cassavetes will want this movie.
