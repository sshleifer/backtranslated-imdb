As Rome becomes mad, he celebrates Hitler's visit - uniforms, troops, parades - two strangers are at home, in a large building and meet. She is Sofia Loren, who is the wife of a brutal public servant and mother of six children. He is Mastroianni, a radio speaker who was fired because of his homosexuality. Both need a company and an understanding, both of them find one in the other. The film covers a few hours. The colors are faded and everything is done with a sound track of military marching and hysterical radio speakers. Quite strangely, the Nazi hymn - Horst-Wessel-Lied - becomes a romantic musical theme. Beautiful film, great recreation of a special epoch in Italian history and a tangible and sad story. Mastroianni is just as good as we expected, and Sofia Loren is doing a great job, far from being the driver's ordinary driver character, the Neapolitan fish characters. Do not miss.
