A visit of Hitler to Rome is the backdrop of this story of love, friendship, homosexuality and fascism. Sophia Loren plays housewife and mother of six children who stay at home while the whole family goes to the military parade in honor of Hitler and Mussolini. He has to stay home because the family can not afford a maid. She would have wanted to go, however, because she and the entire living complex in which she lives is a burning admirer of Il Duce. But there is an exception. Beyond the courtyard, Marcello Mastroianni is sitting on his chair, thinking of suicide. The reason? He is homosexual and for this reason has recently lost his job as a radio station. The movie really starts when these two people meet by chance. Mastroianni is desperate and needs a friend. Loren, frustrated by her deceptive husband, misunderstands Mastroianni, and in a shot, pointing and acting on the roof of the building complex she gives her body only to be rejected. The original face is soon replaced by its hunger for this man, this anti-fascist, this homosexual, this other world, who is so willing to give her everything she wants. This is a beautiful artisanal film with two of the most talented actors ever. Loren proves here that she is a caliber actress when she is well guided. This is a simple but powerful film about fascism, love, ordinary people and, most importantly, the human condition. Despite its sad end, there is hope in the end, things will change, somebody understands.
