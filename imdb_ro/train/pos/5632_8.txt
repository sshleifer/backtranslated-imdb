The riveting story, written by William Mastrosimone on stage, where Farrah Fawcett plays Marjorie, attacked the kidnapper Joe (James Russo) in the car. She manages to escape, but the cops tell them they can not do anything. But he realizes that Joe has taken his wallet and knows where he lives. When Pat (Alfre Woodard) and Terry (Diana Scarwid) are gone to work, Joe pays a visit to finish what has begun. After Joe humiliates and degrades it in a variety of ways, he has the chance to hit him and load him. Knowing well that he is in another situation "against your word against you" and that no technical rape has occurred, she does not intend to relieve him until he confesses to Pat and Terry what his intentions are. > Finally, the movie stands up for a showdown between its two opponents. As it happens, Marjorie shows such reluctance that she must wonder if she has not become so dissatisfied with her nemesis. Fawcett does a job that is credible, while Russo is really great as a depraved creep who does his best to manipulate the situation. With just two characters on the screen for much of the running time, the film has an intimate nature that suggests it would work even better on the stage. Director Robert M. Young does not move away from the uglier and most exploiting elements of the situation; the movie gets awkward to watch sometimes. And until Marjorie has his upper hand, things change enough to make it so easy to encourage her to go for blood, and hope that Pat can make her see a reason. The extremes, "I felt, was a pretty good film that kept at least some interest and a high level of intensity. Woodard and Scarwid are both in their support (Scarwid has a wonderful time when Terry finds herself a a victim of rape) and the rhythm is consistent. Given, the dialogue is not always very sharp, but the material is convincing at every step of the way. <br /> <br /> 8/10
