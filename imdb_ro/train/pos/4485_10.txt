This is my favorite Tom & Jerry cartoon from the early 1940s. The original version of Mammy Two Shoes is on the Tom & Jerry Spotlight Collection 2 set, disc 1, and features the wonderful animation of the early animated cartoons. Gags of this genre are not all in the crazy Avery style, but more subtle and target anyone who has ever left until late watching scary movies (or radio programs)! Tom listens to a creepy radio show, and Jerry decides to play a string of tricks to frighten him. The nine-life gag is well done here and I do not know how many times I tried to make a vacuum and a scary sheet when I was a child. When Tom's owner is ashamed - Mamma was not a maid, it was his home - he has a surprise of joy with a big laugh. Get your pause button ready, it's worth it!
