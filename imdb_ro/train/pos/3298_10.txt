This is definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen - it's all - a truly emotional screenplay, good actors who make subtlety a beautiful art to watch, a love story (it's a shame like that guy romance just does not exist), beautiful songs and lyrics (especially the final song), an artistic score, costumes and sets that make you want to live in them. The conclusion was just a disappointment in what I expected for a spectacular film that had a brilliant ending - but it was more wonderful than the vast majority of the movies there. Check this movie for sure - always and repeatedly. There are many details you miss for the first time when it's worth a second look.
