This is another great movie that I was lucky to see for the first time on the big screen (thanks to Rick Baker and others). Back in the late 80's I was a newborn relative to gender and only really new about the three big JC, SH & YB. I was not sure what to expect when I paid my earned money to see this in a "Triple Bill of Classics" at the old scale. I do not have to worry, I was out of the air with this movie. If you are a fan of Hong Kong Action / Kung Fu movies and have not seen this movie, do this NOW!
