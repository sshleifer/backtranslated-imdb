It's not really a big draw in the box office, but I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. James "I did some things at Farrah Fawcett" Orr co-wrote and directed this film about an average, middle-aged guy named Larry Burrows who believes his life It would have been incredibly different if he hit a Homerun at a key baseball game when he was 15. But thanks to the mysterious and magical bartender < Mike, Larry gets his wish, but soon he realizes that his new life is not exactly the way he hoped it would be. <br /> <br /> I have to say, this movie really impressed me. Critics have mixed up, and I have to say the concept is very interesting and pulled well. Yeah, it's a bit standard, but enough packs funny moments, theater and acting great to really do it. James Belushi (I think) was an Oscar worthy of his role. Jon Lovitz is perfect, and Linda Hamilton plus Renee Russo shines in their roles. Michael Caine is perfect as a bartender. It's just a good movie with a good lesson. If you have not seen it, we strongly recommend checking
