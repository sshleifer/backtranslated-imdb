He saw this as a naive young punk when he was released for the first time. I should have been like a child when I left the theater, trying not to let anyone see. So when I saw her again in '07, I knew what to expect and the sighs were ready and prepared when the right time approached. Fortunately this time I was home. What I did not remember about my young view - or perhaps I have not noticed because of it - was the technical shine of this film. Use flashbacks that say so much story without having to use dialogue. The working room seemed to bring the spectator together with the characters in the scene. Think of the opening when Joe crosses the street to the house, the room is behind the woman and the child sitting on the bench in the foreground, framing the street scene. <br /> <br /> The story itself, and the characters - seedy, sad and brutal real. It's very exciting to be attracted so tightly in a human drama, like this with the people most of us will probably break. And again, Joe and Ratso could be any of us. It must have been 70 when I saw her. I remember that when I left the theater, I had to find a company of friends. All these years later, I'm glad I'm not alone tonight. This is a great movie.
