With this film, it's about style, atmosphere and action. True, I did not believe all the scenic developments but did not dispute - the terrible act, the unexpected breath of the plot and the wonderful atmosphere brought me there and took me for a walk and I had a long time. Kenneth Branagh is not only a great actor, but a master of accents, and proves it again with a Georgia-free accent. He is surrounded by so many talents in supporting roles (Robert Downey, Jr., Embeth Davidtz from Schindler's List and Fallen, Tom Berenger, Daryl Hannah and Robert Duvall) that I was just blowing away. I recently bought a copy of this movie and I never got tired of seeing it. Simply one of the best thrillers of the year. If you ignored this movie (and you have chances), we suggest you check it out.
