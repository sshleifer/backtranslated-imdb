Although this film is cheesiness at its best, it is pulled perfectly. This film must undoubtedly be considered a modern classic. There are, in principle, two types of movies I like - deep-seated films (chicken films, if I must blame my wife for that) and mindless comedies where I can sit and relax. This film is a perfect example of the latter. A friend of mine turned me into this movie shortly after his release. Considering me somewhat superficial, he told me: "You have to see this movie, it's just your movie type." Before the insult, I began to look. I know they mentioned Ramones a million times, but when you see them, I said, "Hey, it's the Ramones." My friend replied, "I do not know they were a real band." I had my moments of glory. This movie, though now somewhat dated, must be for Ramones fans - or anyone else for that.
