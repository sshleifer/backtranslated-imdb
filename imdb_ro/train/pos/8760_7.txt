It's refreshing to see a movie that you think will end up happy like almost any other American movie, then be surprised when it does not happen. I like a happy ending as much as the next guy, but sometimes it's better to portray things in a more realistic way, and I thought Brokedown Palace did it very well. The end, with a friend, basically sacrificing for the other, redeeming his earlier poor behavior, which brought them to the first place, was very moving. I would rather have done it without the last line, which proved that she did not actually do the act she testified, because she would have made the film more about the friendship between the two girls and less about the crime. Whether it did or not, it was not so important. The story itself clung to the clich√©, but the actresses kept my attention with their excellent performances. Very realistic, very captivating. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10.
