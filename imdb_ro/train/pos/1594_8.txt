What I love about you is one of those series you have to see but you are not sure you will see, the beginning is cool and sucks you in the series just for fun, the second part and the 2-3 season that are outdated, come and go what you want. what happens in many series is that it does not end with something special because the second part of the series always goes down in the drain, this has happened and to some extent, the third part is to ruin and destroy The whole series, usually but not, this end is perfect for the evening, it fits perfectly, actually I was pretty upset about all these guys in Val's life, actually I wanted to end up with Jeff in the end, but later changed, they chose to take Vic in the series after almost 3 seasons without him, and this was the biggest surprise and also what made the series go on top. you see the series is really really cool just don do not expect the second part to be so good it is not, but the third part does what it takes and made the series to one that deserves everything, I'm happy to I say I was happy and happy about the series and now I'm going to see two guys a girl and a pizza place when I see the whole series I'll be back ...
