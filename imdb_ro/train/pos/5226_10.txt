What is all the European comments (especially England) here? All I have to say is that when I first saw this movie for the first time I was 13, I thought it was wonderful. Of course he's stupid. That's the point. You have to watch Dr. Strangelove and Black Men in order to get the whole joke behind this movie, but come to the people, what would you expect to see? I can think of many movies that are far worse than these, and they were Hollywood expensive movies with real actors in them. What they deserve, white men is a very stupid and funny movie. And with all the stupid and funny things England has done over the last half century, I am shocked by all the negative comments. Our stupid Americans love our stupid humor. P.S., see "America's Team: World Police" for some real laughter that Europeans will most likely want.
