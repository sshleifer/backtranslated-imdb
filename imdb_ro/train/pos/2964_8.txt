BASEketball is a tremendously funny movie that offers action that generally makes the movie more fun, a comedy material that is more than just shit in your funny pants and a pretty good plot, despite its classic weakness vs the rich evil guy. and the only thing I did not like BASEketball was that the kid was not really needed in the movie, but if the kid was not in the movie, some funny scenes would not have existed. If you've read any pro reviews about this movie, exclude them all because practically all commentators did not like this movie.BASEketball is a great comedy that gives everyone what they want.8 out of 10.
