I first saw this movie in the theater when I was 8 years old and still cramps me. Muppets are so cool and headed for show-business in a nagging laugh. My favorite scene is when the rats start a whispering campaign in the name of Kermit at a fancy restaurant. This is a smart and funny movie for both children and parents. You still live Kermit, Miss Piggy and the rest of the gang.
