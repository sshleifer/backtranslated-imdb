The "Protocol" is a successful and missed image of Goldie Hawn as a cocktail waitress who one night saves the life of an Arab who visits an assassination attempt. The woman immediately becomes a celebrity and gets a new job for the US government. Will the corridors of power be in the nation's capital as well? Hawn is excellent as usual, even though the "Protocol" is not as fun as his best film "Private Benjamin". But it's still a good movie and I laughed a lot. *** (out of four)
