Okay, I saw the movie as a child and I loved him very much. My parents did not buy the movie for me, but I think I will go and buy it now. I'm a slap for animated films before 2000. Anyway, on the real review. What I liked: It was a real portrayal of heaven and hell, one of the few that I've seen in animation films. Character development has existed! It's easy to classify the characters in this movie (ie: Charlie is selfish, Itchy is cynical, but he thinks Charlie, Carface is obviously the helpless bastard, etc.). I also loved the song of King Gator. I've always loved strong, annoying, flamboyant boys. The song may have been random, but it was so fun. Finally, the animation details were beautiful. You could tell Charlie he was a gruff and stuff, and the background was beautiful. What I did not like: The real representation of the sky: The way Charlie reacted to her, "without surprises," she actually did, seems very boring. He denied a place in the heavens and must return to him in the end. I remember a few lines of songs like "... you can not keep a good dog", "... make music forever" and "... welcome to be dead", but can not remember most of them. The songs were not so appealing to be honest. Whippet Angel: It's annoying and that throat! AUGH! WHY THE PARENTS CAN NOT ANSWER: There are some frightening images (depending on the viewer) of Hell on the movie. Carface is quite threatening. Beer is also implicit, but not actually DUBBED beer. Gambling is a key element in the movie. Good man dies. GENERALITIES: I LOVE this movie, even if sometimes it is sometimes forgotten. More scary children's animations are always your favorite. This was created at a time when producers and writers were not afraid to make children from time to time. Currently, the PG would have probably been evaluated. Children under the age of 8 (or children with difficulty in destruction) should not follow this. Besides, I'm giving him 9/10. :) <br /> <br /> <br />
