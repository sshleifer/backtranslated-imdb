Everyone in the show, from Sugiyama to Aoki and Toyoko, is a person we know in everyday life. They were so natural, and Sugiyama's transformation is incredibly credible. The score is so moved that it brought me to tears. The choreography was beautiful without appearing athletic. His graceful dance and grace gave me some pockets. Tamako is a wonderful character. You can almost see the charming school in front of her as she reminds her that she saw "The Emperor and I". Aoki's character is so hilarious and pitiful. Masako is so overwhelmingly natural as your amazing wife, you almost want to embrace her to make sure everything is okay. This movie is truly a shepherd.
