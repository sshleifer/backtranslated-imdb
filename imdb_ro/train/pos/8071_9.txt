This film refers to Irish rebellion in the 1920s and, more specifically, to a man's life after informing a friend about the reward on his head and subsequent consequences. Watching the movie, I have the feeling that you could take the scenario and with just a few minor updates, do it again, and unfortunately, it would still be according to the contemporary events. But the remake would not be as good. A magnificent performance by Victor McLaglen (for which he earned Oscar's merit) and an overall film that includes most, if not all, Hollywood brochure actors at the time, most recognized characters either at that time. A very good movie worth watching. Highly recommended.
