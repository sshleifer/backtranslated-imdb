Definitely one of the smallest of the Astaire / Rogers musicals. It's just very badly plotted and paced. It runs just a few minutes longer than Swing Time, for example, but it feels a lot more. This is partly due to secondary romance between Randolph Scott and Harriet Hilliard. Scott is rarely interesting. I like Hilliard. She's cute and I like at least one of her songs: "But where are you?" ("Go Behind My Satan," her number, is a weak rest of Top Hat, happily cut off from that masterpiece). Fleet tracking would actually be a bad film, if not for at least three shining dance sequences between Astaire and Rogers. The dance contest is for the first position of any number. Dance is fantastic. "I put all my eggs in a basket" presents the two rehearsals of a dance that they have not yet perfected. Its imperfections make it perfectly perfect. And "Let's face the music and dance" is easily one of Irving's best songs. So, the movie deserves to look for its great moments.
