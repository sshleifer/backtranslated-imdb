Chang Cheh "Shaolin Temple" could be very good brand of water in the movie Shaw Brothers movie martial arts. This kung fu epic that multiplies has an astounding cactus - a true who is who in the Shaw stable. Although the plot is quite standard and the choreography of the fight is superb as usual, Cheh's manipulation of the subject makes this film remarkable and enjoyable. The feeling of reverence displayed for the history and traditions of the Shaolin Temple is palpable in every setting. It is not unlike William Keighley's spades for the fabulous "Fighting 69th" in the same movie with the same name or for John Ford's greeting to West Point in The Long Gray Line. Cheh's Shaolin theme is a drayly crafted owl in the same style. The cultural correlation I'm tempted to do is compare the Shaolin Temple with the Alamo. Watching this movie will give you the same feelings of admiration and nostalgia you have experienced many years ago in school history when you learned of the courage and sacrifice of those Alamo condemned heroes. At the end of the movie, you too might be tempted to cry, Remember the Shaolin Temple!
