This is not the typical Mel Brooks movie. It was much less a slapstick than most of his films and actually had a plot that could be followed. Leslie Ann Warren made the movie, is such a fantastic, underestimated actress. There were a few moments that could have been further developed and some scenes that might have been cut off to make room for it, but overall it deserves the price to rent and see it. The actress was good overall, Brooks himself did a good job without his feature speaking directly to the public. Again, Warren was the best actor in the movie, but "Fume" and "Sailor" played well.
