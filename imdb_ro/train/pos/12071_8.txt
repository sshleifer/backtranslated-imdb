Nicolas Roeg's projects are very varied, but they are no less interesting. "Insignificance" is obviously, first of all, an adapted script: it is word and quite "room-related". BUT, it's worth watching this movie several times: the underlying themes are not presented openly, and moreover, it takes a while to adapt to juxtaposing and reversing the roles of the four protagonists: Einstein, McCarthy, Munroe and DiMaggio. <br /> <br /> Einstein is destroyed by guilt against Hiroshima, yet he feels the simplicity of a sexual bond with Munro; Munro is ill to be seen as a bimbo and wants intellectual faith; Senator McCarthy is at the height of the witch's powers, but he's an impressive snake; DiMaggio is uncertain about celebrity, self-obsessed, and prone to violence. Each of them contains the seeds of their destruction. Each character has a troubled, abusive / abusive past and a questionable future. Gradually, we see that obsession itself is the central theme. America's obsession with post-war cultural icons and heritage; the obsessions of protagonists for something that can not have: peace of mind and / or happiness. Compared to the theory of relativity, a unified field theory, and indeed the cosmos itself, all the aspirations and interactions of Roeg's protagonists seem insignificant. However, these aspects of the physical universe (it is quantum, believe me!) Affects us when applied to the development of the means of destroying us. Monroe's mention of the principle behind the neutron bomb (without naming it as such) is not an anachronism per se, but can only be understood by a contemporary audience. Indeed, ALL of the scenario references are only accessible to a well-informed audience: one with the "50s / personality cults and how it affects us in the 21st century. This film and its script are either very, very clever, extremely opaque and pretentious. Ultimately, however, probably insignificant. <br /> <br /> lived a lot and thrived :) <br /> <br />
