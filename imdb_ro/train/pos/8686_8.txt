The second official episode of the "Columbo" series ("Murder by the Book", filmed later, first struck the waves). Robert Culp, who will match Peter Falk's detective in several future installments, is terrible as the head of a sophisticated private detective agency that kills a client's wife when he refuses to join the blackmail scheme. The two stars are well suited to this intelligent cat and mouse exercise, which is one of the best in the series.
