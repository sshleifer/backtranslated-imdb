Baghdad's thief is a treasure. First of all, it's a good story. Although the primary exposure of the four children to this story, the most famous story of Arab nights, comes from Disney Corporation, the thief of Baghdad has kept his interest to the end. The story moves at a good pace and includes a twist or two that reduces predictability. Sabu, who plays the young thief, Abu, also measures up to any of today's adolescent actors in appeal, judging how many times I've heard my oldest daughter say, "It's c-u!" <br /> <br /> In 1940, the film won the Academy Award for Cinematography and Special Effects. Today, of course, these effects seem very high ("Look, it's Barbie flying through the air," my daughter said at the glance of the flight of genius). However, they fit well into the story. The film is, after all, over 60 years old. Effects match the scenario. Moreover, what is seen in Baghdad Thief has remained pretty much the latest generation for the next 25 years. Just compare the opening episode of a 1967 Star Trek episode to see this. In this sense, it was a pretty big achievement. This qualifies as a family film, although there are some penetrations nearby. The action is so obvious, and so bloody injuries as those scenes almost as artificial as the animation. Generally, a fun movie worth watching for either a pure entertainment evening or the historical value of the effects. I recommend it.
