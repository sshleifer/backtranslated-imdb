This place in England during 1940. Three orphans (Carrie, Charles and Paul) are sent to live with Miss Price (Angela Lansbury). He does not want them to take them reluctantly. She seems to be studying to be a witch through a course of correspondence with the College of Witchcraft. (OK - I realize it's a family movie, but - Witchcraft College "Come on!") Before finishing the course though the college is closed due to the war (???) and she's looking down Professor Browne's head (David Tomlinson ). She and the kids travel around them on a bed with the help of a magical patron. I saw the first time I was 9 years old and I vaguely remembered she loved her. Definitely not as an adult! The story is silly (even for a fantasy), kids are terrible actors and one of them (Charles) is incredibly unpleasant. Also, Roddy McDowall is the third bill and only appears in two short scenes! There is also a trip to Naboombu Island, which is led by animated animals. I thought it might be fun, but the animation is poor (for Disney) and has a violent and too long game of football between animals. There are some rescues here: Lansbury and Tomlinson are wonderful; the songs (useful) are nice; the long dance sequence on Portobello Road is very colorful and full of energy, and the Oscar-winning special effects are still quite impressive at the end. But the story of poor story, bad animation and children who can not be opened really pull it. I have heard that the extended version is even worse! I can only give 7.
