My friend had the idea of ​​watching the animated LOTR after seeing King's Return of Peter Jackson. So I finally bought it from e-bay, thinking right from the start she was supposed to suck. In fact, it really was not as bad as I thought it would be. The animation was good for its time, they used a unique method to mix live action with animation to create some interesting effects, and the guy who made the voice for Frodo sounded somewhat like Elijah Wood. the greatest adaptation of a book, but believe me, I have seen much worse. She absorbs quite a lot of things because both the Fellowship and the Two Towers are compressed in a two-hour film. Definitley deserves a watch, children may want, but yet, absoutley no comparison to the Peter Jackson trilogy.
