I happened accidentally over this movie on TV one day. It was broadcast in the middle of the day on a channel that is not famous for broadcasting good movies. This, however, was nothing more than good. October Sky tells the story of Homer Hickam, a boy inspired by the launch of Sputnick to become a rocket scientist. He and his friends are starting to build missiles. His father is not pleased that his sons have found a new hobby and will rather see him become a coal miner as himself or go to college on a football scholarship like his brother. The story is well written. A little too predictable maybe, but that's good because it does not focus too much on those parts of the story. It is an important part, but where the inner action is evident, the action between the characters is concentrated. The story is good. It has some clich√©s, but it's okay. It's based on real events, so you can not give up those cliques. Characters are very good. If the story is in a descent, the characters are removed and manage to maintain the action and quality of the big movie. You will know these characters and you will have sympathy for them. They are well written and credible. This is a good movie. The sets and style of the 50's are solid and the images are well-composed and well-lit. All this is very good at the film. The actor is very good. Jake Gyllenhaal offers extraordinary performance because Homer Hickam and Chris Cooper are good John Hickam. As for the rest of the distribution, they are good too. All together make a fairly strong distribution. Overall I'm glad I got this movie. It was first after I saw that I found out that it was based on real events. If I knew that when I saw it, it would probably be even more interesting. October Sky is a good and exciting movie. It's a movie I think everyone can enjoy. It's kind of a good movie. It's not bad at all!
