Well, if you're open enough for your Barber Shop, you'd love this Canadian movie. If your mind is as closed as Fort Knox, then you will give it the current score: 2.5. This is a movie for anyone ready to watch movies outside their own racial grounds. She is engaged, it is true for life, for two or three occasions you lose connections between scenes, but often, especially in the end, you find yourself having a tear or two in your eyes and that just because it so often mirrors what be life. I like and I recommend it to anyone who opens their minds beyond the traditional American film.
