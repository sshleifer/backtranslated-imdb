... I saw this on cable back in the late 1980s because I was a big wrestling fan since 1986. I saw this on VHS in a "selling" bin and bought it. In 1998, I began to train as an Air Force fighter and I would always go back and follow this to see how it was a very precise representation of people involved in battles (families and friends who would not understand us, the trip , etc.). Henry Winkler is funny and sometimes sad to forget, because no one else can understand what genius is creative. A great way to separate from Fonz's character that he played on happy days. In addition, watch the distribution ... William Daniels (Knight Rider), Polly Holiday (Alice), and fighters Roddy Piper and Chavo Guerrero Sr. If you have a chance, watch it.
