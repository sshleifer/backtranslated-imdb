Let me first say that although I have seen every episode of StarTrek at least twice, I do not consider myself Trekker or Trekkie. These are people who live in the basement of their parents and participate in conventions wearing costumes with sharp rubber ears. I gave this film a seven by throwing away historical fictional errors. The actor was better than average, but the plot had no surprises. They have tried very hard to reverse technology engineering, yet the special effects were just a great temptation. Now, as far as historic errors are concerned, if you call it, the first captain who ran the Enterprise was the April commander, then Capt. Pike, Jim Kirk, etc. According to a statement made by both Riker and Kirk, we have discovered the Klingons and educated them and gave them technology (that is why the first directive was created), but, as I said, there is no no reason to discredit this fine series. I hope the plots will be deeper and then special effects may have a back.
