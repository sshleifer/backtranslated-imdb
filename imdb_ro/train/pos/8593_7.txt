The Sentinel has a kind of running at the mill and suspense / mystery, but it is exalted with some good and extended action. These stories have already passed through so many permutations that we can endure, so what we have left with us is how good the act is, how smart the settings and the bad guys are, how well the main art is, etc. ... so the Sentinel has a solid job given its content. Michael Douglass and Kiefer Sutherland keep both bravado and good attitudes on the screen. Eva Longoria (the first time I saw her on the screen) offers satisfactory support. The whole story of this story is totally implausible, but it deserves little, but it deserves to be weak. It's worth watching if you like the genre.
