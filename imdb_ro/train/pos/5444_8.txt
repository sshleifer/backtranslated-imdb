The Reunion is a highly underestimated comedy. It is 1982 and the Lizzie Borden High class in 1972 returns for a 10-year meeting, including regular stereotypes, bits, babies, fat and bad type etc., but the former students are in a bad night, one of her classmates are Walter Baloer, a class school who has been a comedy joke by the rest of the class on the graduation night and has since been in a mental home, Walter escapes and now plans to avenge his humiliation, <br /> <br /> Despite the dark premise, it's really just an excuse for a lot of very funny gigs and fixed pieces. To say that too much would destroy the movie, but if you liked the Naked Gun & Airplane movies, would you like that and what other movie does a Chuck Berry musical chuck offer? A great comedy that deserves a wider audience.
