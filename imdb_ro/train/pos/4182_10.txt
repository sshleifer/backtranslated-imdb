I saw this Australian movie about 10 years ago and never forgot. The film shows the horror of the war in a way that Hollywood usually glosses. The relationship between the soldiers of the two conflicting countries is evidenced by the differences between culture and the ultimate knowledge that, ultimately, we are not all entirely different within. If you can find any kind of copy of this - buy or rent it. You will not be disappointed, just wonderful.
