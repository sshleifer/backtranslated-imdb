This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. My parents come from rural India and, to some extent, have seen the lives of the villagers. Peoples are really poor and have financial and social problems. <br /> <br /> The film reflects exactly the same thing. Full credit for director and actor. They did a great job. I just wonder how I can watch Lagaan and Paheli go to the Oscar and not to Doghi. I do not understand the criteria on which the films are selected. It's the money that makes the difference or have big names in the movie, which makes the difference. I hope to see more movies like this in the future.
