"The Haunted World of Edward D. Wood, Jr." is the definitive documentary on human life that brought us films such as "Glen or Glenda," "The Bride of the Monster" and, of course, "Plan 9 in Cosmic Space". This refined film far exceeds the fact that other documentaries such as "Look Back in Angora" and "Companion Plan 9" have failed. He surrounds his surviving entourage, many of them have died from filming and offer an honest review of Ed Wood and his work. Nostalgic in looking back at the darker Hollywood corner before, sentimental in the director's treatment (up to haunted music), this documentary is absolutely necessary for anyone who loves the director who failed in his day. All the two hours of the film together with love and retrospect together Ed's life and premature death for the spectator. Best watched at 3 o'clock in the morning while wearing an angora sweater.
