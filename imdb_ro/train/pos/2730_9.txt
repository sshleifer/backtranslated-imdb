I saw this in the theater during its initial release and it was disturbing when I'm sure it will still be. It was the first part of the '68, and this was still to make rounds in the cities of America and there was recently a mass murder in my hometown where I saw this if a man went on a shooting rampage. The prosperity of this near-home event combined with this dramatized true story made for a very disturbing theatrical experience. She has brought to life the excellent action of Robert Blake and Scott Wilson. I was familiar with the novel based on Truman Capote's true event, and Richard Brooks's script and direction brought Truman's event and interpretation into an impressive cinematic adaptation. Quincy Jones's music really evaluates the story. I've only seen this a few times. It was too real. Almost to witness the crime itself and go with the murderers. It would give me a 9.0 possible 10. Society is so desensitized against violence and crime today that this seems probably slow and neat and could be seen with a lower effect but for anyone over 50 this will be a fingerprint in examining the psyche killer.
