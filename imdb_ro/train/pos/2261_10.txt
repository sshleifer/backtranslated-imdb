I saw this movie and the play and I must add that this was the most exciting story I've ever seen. Until I saw the movie, I was not aware of how dreadful the life was, and it is probably still for the children and adults of South Africa who lived and lived in that era. It has brought me tears in my eyes and sadness that any human being should fight so only to stay alive And to bring the children from that area and to teach them to act and to preform and transform them into the freedom to tell their story is simply amazing. This simply goes beyond a five star star, I appreciate it as a ten. I thank Mr. Mbongeni Ngema for such an amazing story. Although it has been twelve years since this story has been told, it is still one that struck me in the heart. If there is a VHS or a DVD there on the game, please tell me as soon as possible. PS There was nothing wrong with children who want to become aware of their problems and conditions in the attention of other countries in the hope that some would have a heart and provide assistance.
