I did not like Chandni Bar from the same director. I did not look at his other movies. They came and gone. But Page-3 is well done. It looks real. Like Satya from RGV did. The mental illness of the so-called high society is the film's summary. In the middle of the whole illness, difficult to lead a normal life that the protagonist, Konkana Sen, does. Serious movie, do not look at the kids or wait for your wives. Page-3 of newspapers is the usual place to report the activities that take place in the parties of the rich and the elite who dwell on much more dirt than what is reported. The way this page-3 is also a business perspective is presented in the film. Event management companies are paid to organize parties and make people rich but not famous, celebrating overnight by clicking on photos with celebrities invited to the party. Western culture has slipped deep into the high society of Mumbai. The film looks bold, does not get stuck. Madhur Bhandarkar begins a new journey here.
