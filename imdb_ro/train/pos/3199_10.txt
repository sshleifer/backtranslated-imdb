OK, I do not really think Trailer Park Boys has bad lines because they let go. They just ... conflict with each other. For example: Near the end of the movie, he shows Ricky and Julian saying "Patrick Lewis" to put the dog down and leave. Then, in the end, he shows that Ricky and Julian say they have been in prison for 2 years. In the TV series pilot, the first clip he's showing is the same clip by Ricky and Julian shouting at Patrick Lewis. But in the TV series, they are supposed to have been in prison for 18 months. They also give us the impression that the story line of the movie and the story line of the TV series are linked (due to the shouting scene between boys). But some actors have totally different characters. Of course, Patrick Roach plays "Patrick Lewis" in the film, but in series he plays Randy. Sam Tarasco plays one of the boys who pays Ricky for an extermination, and then plays Sam Losco in series. Also (again ... I know, I have a lot to say) in the movie, boys snort coke instead of smoking hash. The thing is that it never confirms that the two story lines are connected anyway, other than the shouting scene. We're sorry to continue stuttering.
