As I was thinking of "The Great Escape," I allowed my mind to go back to this gem of a movie from my childhood. I read and re-read the autobiographical novel of 1949 that inspired him, and when he came to the unique cinema (I never used that word then, in fact) in the city that was showing "foreign movies", I was first on the line to buy my ticket. As someone brought wartime news and propaganda films during World War II, I had a firm interest in exploring the realities of this conflict, reflected in the memoirs and stories about the men who were there personally. It subsequently extended to a firm desire over the years to buy a book on this subject, and finally to read the equally convincing novels of Hans Helmut Kirst and Erich Maria Remarque, which offered sensitivity and deeper. The versions of the film, however, did not differ from this because they rarely delivered the products. The black and white film environment has never been served as well as in those years. I have never seen a technical version of the war that seems as authentic as the deep scenes of films such as The Horse Wooden. If it is true that we are always destined to be captive to the images of our childhood, then I confess it freely. And there will never be another such as Leo Genn as the emblematic British film war hero. Not even Sir Alec.
