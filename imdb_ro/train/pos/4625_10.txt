Shakespeare Behind Bars was the most surprising and delightful movie I've seen all year round. It's a jail program, somewhere in California, if I remember correctly, where the detainees repeated and performed a different Shakespeare play every year for the last 14 years. The film follows their production of "The Tempest" from performance casting, and during this time we learn some amazing things about these men, who are all the best for the crimes. The truth is indeed brighter than fiction - if someone tried to adapt this story to a fiction movie, the audience would never have bought them, but knowing it was real makes it amaze you to look - literally; I hated it aloud when I learned of a killer murder in particular. It's like an embarrassing episode of Oz, and all the more fun because their bizarre characters and stories are real.
