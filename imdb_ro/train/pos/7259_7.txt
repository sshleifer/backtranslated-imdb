How can the evaluator for this movie be just 5.4? Only the lovely young man Alisan Porter should start automatically at 6 when you decide. James Belushi is good, and in this, his first serious role, I liked nothing but Last Night until now. He was pretty good in the Gang related to Tupac as well. Kelly Lynch, you have to love her. Well, I do. I wonder just what happened to Miss Porter? I gave Curly Sue 7
