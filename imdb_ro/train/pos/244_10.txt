I did not know what to expect from "Ned Kelly," but I absolutely liked it. It was dark, dramatic and grasping. Also felt very authentic, I felt that I had been transported back in the 1800s. I have never been a fan of Heath Ledger, I've only seen him in adolescent films, yet he is quite convincing in this role . Ledger plays Ned Kelly with dignity and intensity, showing us how a great boy has become Australia's most notorious killer. Naomi Watts is great in a supporting role as a lover of Kelly's society. Highly recommended - and that's from an Aussie!
