"Journey of Hope," tells of a poor Turkish family and an odor of hope spiraling down in despair as they travel to Switzerland in search of prosperity. Although this Oscar winning film is quite well done, it is devoid of substance and has many implausibility. Most of the film's 1.7 hours of execution is taking the bus, taking the bus, getting on the boat, getting out of the boat, getting into the van, getting out of the truck, etc. .; time that could have been better spent or eliminated. The story has a predictable conclusion, especially for those who have an awareness of the common crime of trafficking illegal immigrants. An amazing and reasonable watch of fun but over-rated.
