MPAA: Rated for violence, language, nudity and short drug use. Quebec Rating: 13+ Canadian Home Video Rating: 18A <br /> <br /> I saw Coonskin today. This movie is also known as Bustin Out and Street Fight. After watching Fritz The Cat, I Wanted to I see more of Bashki's films. I saw Cool World and I thought it was mediocre and I saw this. When it was released for the first time, the film was very controversial. He was considered a racist, and Al Sharpton wanted the movie to be banned, he even led protests outside the theater where he was the movie. The film was released only on VHS under the title "Street Fight". It is now considered a classic cult movie, and African-American celebrities such as comedian Richard Pryor, director Spike Lee and rap group Wu-Tang are said to have enjoyed this film. I personally thought Fritz The Cat was a great movie better, but this is very nice as well. Worth watching for fans of Bashki or Blaxploitation. The film combines live action and animation such as Who Framed Roger Rabbit. I would have preferred it in full animation but wh atever. The film begins with a reverend, and another man struggles to save two of their friends in prison. While the prisoners are waiting, the oldest tells the story of three men she knew. The film then turns into animation, blacks who have sold this man's house. They decide to make their names in Harlem. As a leader, a black rabbit, kills a great player in Harlem and he is basically a big blow. The film moves like an Italian mafia wanting to go out. The mafia involves the godfather, his three sons who are homosexual and an Italian clown. Song is an animated animation movie worth checking out if you can find it.
