It was a pretty good movie. I'm not sure if this is considered a spoiler's comment but I did not want to take a chance. However, near the end of the film, the prosecutor reads a verse from Scripture and then cites another one in memory. I do not remember the first passage he reads, but the second one is Genesis 9: 6. He says he is Genesis 9:12, but actually quotes verse 6. This is a common passage that many are using for to defend his capital punishment. It's too bad that prosecutors do not dare to quote the Bible today. Has anyone ever heard of John Jay, the first justice of the Supreme Court in the history of this country? He said the Bible is the best of all the books. Too bad I missed that vision in America.
