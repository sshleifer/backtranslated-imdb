Okay, I have to admit that I've never seen "Rhoda" and just one or two episodes in "The Mary Tyler Moore Show". Even though I do not know anything about this comedy talent duo, I really enjoyed this movie. Mary returns to work. Rose is trying her luck to be a comic. Rhoda struggles with a photo career. And Meredith ... what's he doing again? These three stories we are watching over two hours are fun and entertaining in their own way. When the two friends get together for a long time, it only makes the movie better. <br /> <br /> I was surprised at how well the writing was. The little jokes thrown by Mary and Rhoda were fun. The script itself was well put together. I've seen Moore and Harper in other movies in recent years, and I thought they were very good. But I had no idea they worked well as a team. While both actresses are doing their part to fulfill the title of this film, they never seem to let me down. (During this movie.) Joie Lenz and Marisa Ryan play their roles well, but nothing wonderful. The rest cast like Jonah, Cecile and ... all the others also work well together. As this is a reunion, you would expect a fan of each show to enjoy this. From a non-fan, I enjoyed this little meeting yet. Good story lines for each character and the two main characters are what makes this movie really good. (The new version of MTM theme song does not last any.)
