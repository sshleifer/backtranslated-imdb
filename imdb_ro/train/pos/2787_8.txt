I initially rented this film to my daughter because she is interested in football - and I did not disappoint it this way (except that the script interfered with football scenes). As a father I think I was a bit surprised at the introduction of lesbianism - but I have to admit that as a parent these problems are fully accessible to children nowadays (no matter how I feel about it). In a way, this emotion was a direct segma in the main premise of the film - that at a certain age you must trust your children to make your own choices. This dilemma is introduced by a young British young girl - Jasminder (Jess) - from the Indian-East heritage that dreams of playing professional football. The marriage of her older sister in a traditional Hindu marriage offers many rich opportunities for her to explore (in a beautiful way) her hopes and fears for her future. <br /> <br /> The multicultural challenge was a very exciting technique to explore Jess's frustration with her parents' expectations for her - again, with no substance different from most parent-child relationships. <br /> <br /> In SUMAR, soccer scenes are GREAT (much to learn in slowmo) and while you did not need the story - something was necessary to keep the movie going.
