Star Pickford and director Tourneur - together with his two favorite cameramen and his assistant, Clarence Brown, who are editing - bring great beauty and intelligence to this story of isolated Scottish islands, the same territories that Michael Powell shared twenty years later his first big success. Wind and wave visions, lovers' silhouettes of love not only complete the story, they are the story of the fight against the weights. The actors bring the dignity of the proud people to their roles, and Pickford is brilliant as her character struggles with her duties as the head of the clan, slipping between comedy and thoughtful, here with her father's wretch, scrambling the islands in the church, they walk in her hand like a scepter, discussing her lover played by Matt Moore. See if you can pick the future star Leatrice Joy as a whole. I tried, but I did not.
