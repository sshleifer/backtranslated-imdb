This movie gives us an interesting reminder of how easy it is for so many to be trapped in the busy occupation of doing nothing. We, as a people with African descent, owe us to make a change to this cycle of "all talk and no action," and to begin to achieve to make a change, we need less speech and more action. It is a strong affirmation of our people's divisions about our small issues and our failures to recognize the greater image and the need to unite to make the difference ... Despite the black community, all viewers can learn something from the message on which this film is looking to portray him.
