This movie has excellent fighting scenes. Now it's true that acting is a bit tough. But if I wanted to see a film based on acting skills, I'd be watching a movie like Cheesy Like American Beauty. But if you want to see a movie with true martial arts in it and stunning stunts, without the use of threads and flying thrown air like many movies around now that are over killing the array. Then look at this. Now is the two main stars of the show where the power directors show in the child, and another member of the show has a small role in this film. But the battle scenes are enough to make Jet Li his pants. And the waterfalls are pretty worthy for Jackie Chan to hang out and admire it.
