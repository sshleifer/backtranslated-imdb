This is probably the best rockumentar ever - a British, better This is the spinal. The characters are credible, the plot is great, and you can really empathize with some of the events - such as Ray's problem of fitting into the tape. The soundtrack is great. Real-life stories, even if they are in the same affair, will crack a few of the songs. What I liked was almost total British distribution, with some favorite household names. Ray's wife is priceless ... The movie never pulls, it just goes to the right pace and has some really funny sections. A generator of some very good words to catch! It's a hidden diamond.
