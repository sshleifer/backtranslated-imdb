Soylent Green we found an excellent movie. If you like Logan's Run, you like this. Yes, the movie is old and there are no special effects and some of the acting may somehow be best described as "cheese", but the story is excellent. The story of how the world can be and its impact on society is very painful. <br /> <br /> At the end of the mystery was not a mystery, but the story unfolded in an easy way at the most appropriate pace. The closest equivalent everyday would be the "Black Angel" in terms of how the US looks like a third-country country.
