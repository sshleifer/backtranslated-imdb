This film can be played on several different levels. Do not listen to the other observations of the movie and tell them it's a story again or not and that it's about drugs. It has superficial superficial superficial metaphors about drugs; however, the rest of the movie (and why I think it was done personally) is not at all about it. It is indeed a psychological mockery and condition of society. It turns out, for a second second, that the main character's brother is watching online sick videos. Why? My interpretation is that we have to prove that all this dissatisfaction we are exposing makes it easier to be a mechanic in our professions, instead of seeing people as people. Regarding the stage of logic, it also addresses intelligent 1% intelligent people who are confused and frustrated because life is not as predictable and mathematical and logical as it may seem at a macroscopic level. You must apply Heisenberg's uncertainty principle (along with all the other laws and principles of uncertainty), not just for physics, but also for life, and leave room for you to change your plans and adjust yourself on the road. One of the best movies I've ever seen. It could go further than the head; it is not for you is for those people who are in difficulty to deal with life that does not work as a math problem. When you critically review a movie or write a critical review, try not to first read the back cover (written by marketers and parapsychologists)
