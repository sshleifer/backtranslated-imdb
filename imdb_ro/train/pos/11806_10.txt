Everything has been better in recent days. Even children's television. And Fraggle Rock proves my point very easily. At the time of writing this commentary, I'm fourteen years old, but even in the years of adolescence I can not resist the Fraggle Rock charm. For those who really have lived under a rock (haha!), Fraggle Rock is about a playful and hilarious creature called Fraggles who live - amazingly - on a cliff. But they are not the only creatures. The rock is inhabited by many other species, such as hardworking doctors and countless living plants. Outside the cliff, on the one hand, the inventor-scientist Doc and Sprocket's dog (who is still in love with Gobo Fraggle) lives on, on the other, a family of alleged gorgiers of the universe. The five main brothers Fraggles Gobo (fearless), Mokey (artistic and peaceful), Wembley (indecisive and friend with Gobo), Boober (a pessimistic internal god) and Red (love everything that has to do with sport and general anger ) in some strange situations each episode while at the same time singing and dancing their worries away. Fraggle Rock is definitely a family show - parcels can have complicated details that children can not do well, but the song - and dance routines will keep their attention. The characters are strong and pleasant, their conflicts are credible and their thrilling adventures. Gorgians are scary, Doc and Sprocket lit, Uncle Traveling Matt hilarious (the segments of the postcard are very 80!) And the final episode, Change the address, really touching. Let's go back to Fraggle Rock!
