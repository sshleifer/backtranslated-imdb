From these Pokemon films (which are in order of the best for me): Pokemon The first movie, Pokemon 4Ever, Pokemon Heroes, Pokemon 200 and Pokemon: Ente and the Unknown, probably the most environmentally friendly, the most beautiful and the most calming. Whether they are good points for you or not, "Pokemon 4Ever" still has many fun. Besides the three points mentioned above, this pokemon movie includes good humor and good CGI (as well as anime). The theme of the time that travels the film is represented in a good way, and Team Rocket ends up with pretty good gags and they become more characters than sidekicks. <br /> <br /> Defects are, as always, violence and action quite useless, and Baddie is quite uninteresting, even more than a few Pokemon movie wicked. <br /> <br /> A strange pokemon is being watched by a pokemon hunter in a forest. A boy tries to save the pokemon and takes him somewhere ... Meanwhile, Ash, Brock and Misty enter a big forest ... Curious? Watch the rest ... Good for all Pokemon fans and "anime" American fans, enjoy "Pokemon 4Ever"! :-)
