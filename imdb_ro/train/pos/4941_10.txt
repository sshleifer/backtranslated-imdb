I think a lot of people appreciated the film, NOT because of the lack of quality. But it did not follow Hollywood's standard formula. Some conflicts are not resolved. The conclusion is just a little too real for others, but the journey that the characters rich and long list of supporters they provide is both challenging and fun. Even cinematography is excellent given the urban atmosphere, directing is also excellent and innovative. This is a book in 10, this movie will take you to the normal and expected scenarios of Hollywood. They took some risks and did a few different things. I think it worked well, try deliberately to avoid any direct reference to the movie, because they see it for yourself is the best answer, without accepting someone else's interpretation.
