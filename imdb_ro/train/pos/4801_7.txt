I watched this with my entire 9-year-old family in 1964 on our black-and-white TV. I remember my father noticing that "this could have happened - Adam and Eve." I clearly remember the scene when Adam finds Eve, her eyes blackened. I asked my father why the eyes were dark and she told me because she was tired and hungry. I have not seen this episode in 45 years, I still remember alive - the TV is transmitting back and forth with the home planet, bomb scenes shaking the headquarters, with the final scene of the two going out, Adam wearing the package and Eve following. Perhaps it was not a theatrical artwork, but it sure gave me the impression all these years.
