With mixed reviews this was not expected too much, and was pleasantly surprised. It's a very exciting, exciting movie with exciting characters, excellent, written portraits that are bleak without glib and good rhythm. Looks good and funky. It seems that people enjoy either this film or I hate it, and I'm the one I liked.
