Wonderland is the fascinating film that chronicles John C. Holmes's star movie in Wonderland's brutal murder. The promotion of the film misleads the image of a Romanian porn portrait in the Boogie Nights Valley and that is not the case here. In fact, except for a few references made by reporters that John Holmes is a porn star and a short fit of John Holmes's real-life film, this film is a strict drama about the involvement of a fallen celebrity with the killing and how it happened. Despite being cheated, the movie is actually hired. The act of all the castings is excellent and I would like to say that Val Kilmer is amazing in his ability to lower all John Holmes manners. I was quite convinced that I was looking at what John C. Holmes probably looked and acted as in real life. If you are a fan of John C. Holmes or like Hollywood stories, then I think you will enjoy watching Wonderland.
