And my children love him now! I may be able to see it now and realize that the animation was not so great and that the plot is tricked. Hey, if each villian came forward saying, "I am DAAAARRRKK HEEEEAAARRT" I think he might laugh, but for young children is a moral story with appealing music. So appealing music, think, I still had the words I saved after I did not see this movie in 20 years. I would certainly suggest this to younger children.
