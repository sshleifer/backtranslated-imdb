Six degrees made me be. I was looking forward to coming and was completely disappointed when the Men in the Trees replaced the place I saw. I thought he was just hiatus and would be back in early 2007. What happened? All my friends were really surprised that it ended. We could refer to the characters with real problems. We talked about each episode and we had our favorite characters. There was no one in the show I did not like and I felt that the acting was superb. I always find myself seeing programs in cities where you can identify local areas. I would like to protest against the cancellation of this show and ask you to bring it back and give it another chance. Give him a good place, do not continue to move from that day to that day and advertise so that people know he is.
