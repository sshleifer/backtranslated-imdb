All in all a good film and better for the fact that the movie was not made the story could remain hidden to the masses. Brosnan does a good job as the native American with a hidden past and the photo is amazing. For some, this may be too capricious, for others boring - for me it is a gentle, well-told and perfect story to watch the family. Now it's not something you've done recently.
