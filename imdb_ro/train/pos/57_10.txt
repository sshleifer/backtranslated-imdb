I have to say that this is one of the best movies I've ever seen! I was bored and I looked through t.v. and found "Home Room" and it was already in about 5 minutes, but I got it. It was so exciting and moving. Show what can happen in someone's life. I give him a 10 more, if possible. The director / writer and the actors did an amazing job. I think adolescents should watch this movie and learn from it. It was wonderful, drama, mystery and more. I've been crying for hours! I think the director / writer should write more movies like this one. I liked! I did not even know about this movie, which is sad because it was so good. I would have wanted to go into movies to see more people.
