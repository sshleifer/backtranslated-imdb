I just saw this movie, saw it for the first time when I was 7 years old and I could remember the end. so I saw her like it was 10 minutes ago and (may have looked like a baby like me 12 ha-ha) I started crying at the end, I forgot how sad it was. I think I was mostly sad for Anne-Marie because she said, "I love Charlie," and also, "I miss you Charlie," just made me really cry ha-ha. must be one of my favorite movies of all time, it's just a movie worth watching. WATCH IT ha ha, that's all I can say XD <br /> <br /> but I like this movie, it's a classic one. <br /> <br /> xx Maverick xx 10/10
