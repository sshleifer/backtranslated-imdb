Just like Ishtar and the King of Comedy, other great, unimaginable comedies, Envy has great performances by two actors who play in essence, losers (it can be a tough word, I will call suburban subordinates). This movie was a dark comedy gem and I'm not sure what people expect. I'm glad to see a great studio comedy that is not full of obvious humor and I think the little moments in this movie deserve it. Looking at Stiller's face when he sees the dog disappearing for the first time captures a moment, a moment that most people should be able to recognize in himself. Yes, it was a fairly simple story, but it examined the root of envy in a very interesting way. There were a lot of great scenes (J-Man's lake cabin, Corky's unfortunate burial, Weitz's wife and Walkman's J-Man - all the wonderful stuff.) I stayed on those who received IMDb movies and ruthless when not have no idea what to do. I'll take Envy on almost all the top ten comedies of the year (except for Napoleon Dynamite), and a nice, gorgeous gem. Remember this people ; Often, Popular is not equal to Good.
