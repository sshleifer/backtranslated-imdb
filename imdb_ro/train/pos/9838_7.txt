Born Again is a good episode of Season 1. The little reincarnation, in my opinion, is cold. The more I follow it, the more I like it, but it will never rise above "Very good" for me. Even if it is not very memorable, I will always remember it as an episode of reincarnation. Anyway, now I will say what is good and bad about this episode, Okay: Oragami. Oh yes! The fish tank was nice. =] <br /> <br /> Thrown from a window. Very stylish. x] <br /> <br /> Evil: Marry the best friend's wife! O_O <br /> <br /> What a random choice to recharge. Why did not the guy who died by hanging the scarf die, try to take his scarf instead? <Br /> <br /> Conclusion: The episode is fine, not very memorable. 7/10
