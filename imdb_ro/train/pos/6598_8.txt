I saw this movie when I was traveling to Brazil. It has been hard for me to truly understand Brazilian culture and society, because it has so many regional and class differences. To see this movie in Sao Paulo itself was a revelation. It shows something in the everyday life of many Brazilians. On the other hand, sometimes it's a little dramatized. And this is the only negative comment I have on this movie. It's sometimes too much, too much sex, too many murders and too much cynicism for a movie. The director could film some things a bit subtler, make the movie more effective. In spite of this, I liked the film and the way the story unfolds. Characters are complex and resemble a lot of people in real life. Not quite American actors and actresses with a lot of cosmetics, but people who might be ugly and beautiful at the same time. This makes the movie realistic, even when the story is not so compelling.
