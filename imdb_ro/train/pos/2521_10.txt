I have to admit - the only reason I bought this film was that I was a big fan of Gackt and a big * fan of Hyde. I was expecting a good movie, with lots of pictures that would, to say, be pleasing to the female eye, but a slightly crude story. The synopsis really sounded there. And now that I have just finished watching her - I feel the need to tell the world its glow! Hyde and Gackt have made unimaginable performances, and my eyes are still hot from the cry that lasts the last half of the movie. You have entered the story and you really feel for the characters to the end. The element of vampirism - which I love, but which is very easy to overdo or destroy a movie - is subtly mixed in the story to make it something exotic, normal in this frame, rather than a random add-on to the story . I ranked 9 to 10 at the beginning ... and then I turned around and tried to think why I did not give that last point. It came with nothing. So, ten out of ten are. After all - I'm not too critical - that it bothers me to write a review means I do not really like the movie or even love it. Can you tell me where I am with Moon Child?
