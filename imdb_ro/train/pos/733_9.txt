How can you be wrong with the amazing Ramones? What murder that two of them are already dead. It reminds me of Dennis Leary's jokes about big musicians who die in kitchen fires, and the needy ones live forever. I paraphrase here, but you have the idea. ROCK AND ROLL High School tells the story of a group of disbanded children struggling against their oppressive high school administration. There are extremely silly things, but there is an optimism about it, which is refreshing (even if they resort to the building). Who knew that this would in fact become a concern for students around the world? ROCK AND HIGH SCHOOL is an age-old age capsule when people still thought music was important and could make the difference to the larger society. It is full of children who know that authority does not have the right answers. Rather, rock-roll is the only thing I can trust. But the most important is pure exploitation. She does not take anything seriously. Just get in and have a good time. Unless it was high school life in the seventies, then it should have been.
