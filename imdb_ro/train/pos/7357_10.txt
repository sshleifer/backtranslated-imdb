OK where do I start? ... This movie changed my life! The plot was no problem. James Cahill did it alone. Initially, after a first view, I was disappointed I did not see it on the silver screen. However, this was before exploring many DVD features !!!! My god Jakes Cahill's comment on the film was almost as unclear as his act. he said about the secrets of the film industry that you only get with the experience. I was so impressed by the other actors. The scene where the cops talk to the girl from the hall reminded me of my favorite blue (pornographic) movies. I am surely Gangsta when he expresses his disappointment without continuing. I'm still scared with every view of the martial arts skills involved, just matched by the sign indicating the location of the library at school ... and probably the guy who plays a retard! All in all a timeless classic and the best movie to get out of Europe in years! where my Oscars at dawn !!!!!!!!!!!
