I caught this film accidentally in the middle of it and I had to rent it to see its fullness and I'm glad I did. I was right about the story and cared for the girls involved. Naive high school graduates, the best of their childhood friends, make a trip to school and are taken by a cone called Nick, which brings serious problems. They are used as a bait sacrificed in a heroin smuggling ring. Taken in custody, the girls learn to face imprisonment while trying to find a way out of their troubles. Everything that tries to help herself fails when the Thai criminal justice system is failing, and the girls end up in more trouble and lose the trust of their American lawyer, "Yankee Hank." Hank quits trying to defend them after he feels betrayed by Alice (Claire Dane). However, Hank's hometown Thai wife smells a rat in this case and does more investigation work and finds the girls really were victimized. The end of the film when Alice makes an altruistic act of saving Darlene (Beckinsale) made me tearful. I really liked this movie and I would recommend it.
