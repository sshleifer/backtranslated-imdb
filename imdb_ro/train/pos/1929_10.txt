I recently had the pleasure of seeing The Big Bad Swim at Ft. Lauderdale Film Festival and I have to say that it's the best movie I've seen all year round and the only movie I've ever inspired to write a comment / review. This movie was beautifully directed and combined a scenario with realistic dialogues, great action and an inspiring message. The ordinary life gathers in an adult swimming class and becomes extraordinary in a celebration of the diversity of life. This is illustrated by the imagery of the first minute of this exciting film, where we see only the legs and trunk of individuals in different shapes and sizes that enter a water basin. This movie is brilliantly guided as actors are placed and positioned in exciting scenes that allow you attention and imagination.
