this short track trailer is mainly based on the fact that Superman and Batman are working together and forming an unpleasant alliance. Obviously, the two characters have very different views on how to deal with crime and what constitutes punishment. to get along. I will not enter int the story here.but I will enter into acting which is terrific.everyone is well cast.the two actors playing Superman and Batman are very suitable for their characters. made Batman: Dead End and Grayson also made this short film from the three, I probably liked this at least, but I still thought it was well done.for me, the best in the world is a 7/10
