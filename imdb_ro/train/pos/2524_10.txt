I did not expect Gackt and Hyde's performance to be as good as they were, and I did not expect them to be included in such a well-developed artistic film with enough plot to keep you interested and enough of great diversity to make it original. This movie was an unexpected masterpiece for me and I will be looking for the next movie like this one. I especially like being a vampire movie, but it was not a cheesy vampire movie, nor did it adorn it. Characters had human traits. The way you look at character growth has been incredibly tasty, and it actually makes you feel bad for the rest of your life. I give this film two fingers so high. Definitely the best movie I've seen in the last five years.
