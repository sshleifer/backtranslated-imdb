So often we are talking about cinematic features - Kane, Na≈üul, Bout de Souffle. But a movie is too often overlooked by "serious" film critics. Of course, I'm talking about the classic Savage doc (M.O.B.). This film is not only interesting, but it also explores the exploitation of developing nations seriously by American imperialism. Not to mention kung-fu. He also possessed the best soundtrack in the history of the film (until, of course, Queen's work was amazing on Flash Gordon). Although a little rarity, this movie deserves to look - it will pay you ten times the effort of your search.
