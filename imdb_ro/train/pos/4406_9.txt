Oddly enough, this movie never reached the big screen in Denmark, so I had to wait for the release of the film. My expectations if they are high, but if in no way disappointed. As always with Ang Lee there is fantastic action, a smart and thrilling plot that guesses you all the way and superb shots. Together with Unforgiven this is easily one of the two best Westerns of the 1990s. People who expect something along Mel Gibson's line of Patriot (crowned) or Braveheart (acceptable) will be disappointed, and everyone who appreciates the abovementioned qualities will have a fantastic opportunity to pursue it. 9 of 10.
