Especially for a time when too much scientific literature was not filmed (1973), it is an extraordinary vision of a future where everything went wrong. Too many people and nothing works. The only people who can live in comfort are the rich. It is located in New York in 2022 and I think it reminds you of the worst vision of Calcutta. I appreciated the role of Charlton Heston after seeing him in Touch of Evil by Orson Welles. He (maybe) is capable of portraying a series of heroic or semi-heroic persons. Here he is torn between being a policeman who is just a little corrupt (living rare treatments from the rich) and being totally corrupt (actively condemning evil). <br /> <br /> The film seems to be taking place at night, and the sweat drops everybody, except for one of the rare air-conditioned apartments. Even though I have not seen it before, I knew the famous end (which will not be revealed here), but the end is certainly foretold. Great scenes with Edward G. Robinson: a council (made up of old Jews with heavy accents, it seems), where the truth is revealed. And then you go to Thanatopsis to check out. Gritty, pre-Star Wars sci-fi science fiction.
