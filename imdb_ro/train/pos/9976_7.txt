Sure, it was camouflage and meaningless and sometimes corny, but at least the directors did not try. While most TV films are at the limit of mediocrity, this film has in fact some ransom qualities. Cinematography was pretty good for a TV movie, and Viggo Mortensen portrays Aragorn's nuances in a movie about a man who played by his rules. Most of the retrospective sequences were a bit cheesy, but the mountain lion scene was intense. I was a little mad at Jason Priestly's role in the film as a rebellious shock, but again, it's a TV movie! Despite all the good things, the soundtrack was atrocious. However, it was nice to see Tucson, Arizona prominently featured in the film.
