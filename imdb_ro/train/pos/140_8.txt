Normally, I do not like the series. All of this is predictable and tends to become boring and boring very quickly. These series are, however, well played, the story is followed by all the episodes, and even if you miss one, the story will continue to attract your mind. The episodes are all filmed in a hospital and will further and further take you to the secrets of dark and old secrets that lie just below the surface of the powerful hospital.
