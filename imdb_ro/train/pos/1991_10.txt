Yes, as incredible as it can be, in 1968, a musical won the Oscar for the best film - and was the third musical to win that prize over a five-year period, the first being My Fair Lady in 1964 and then The Sound of Music in 1965. The difference between My Fair Lady, Sound of Music and Oliver! yet it's Oliver! is incomparably better! No comparison. The first two films are wet noodles, compared to Oliver! The act is great; the songs are wonderful; the story is great and the dance is great. This movie is dynamic, up-to-date, relevant to human experience and, unlike the New York quirks, Oliver! offers a portrayal of poverty in London, England, of the nineteenth century, which evokes sympathy without being condemned. Oliver Reed was a great actor and he proves it in Oliver! The other actors and actresses, especially Ron Moody and Shani Wallis, are just as wonderful and offer powerful portraits of characters that evoke sympathy and warmth without caricatures.
