A very interesting fun with the charm of the old movies. Tarzan faces the greatest dangers without hesitation, if the moment demands it and we all enjoy his success. The most interesting for me is a man without special powers who is confronted with the problems and only beats them with human abilities (he was a great swimmer and had a big cry)
