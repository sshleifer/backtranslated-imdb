From the excellent acting of a very impressive cast, to a cleverly written script (and very cozy), from the generous cinema to Carter Burwell's beautiful musical score, Rob Roy offers a rarity in the movie's experiences: one almost impossible to find fault in any area. Several comparisons were made with Braveheart, which came out in the same year. With all that Mel Gibson gave me credit, Braveheart struck me as too much of a self-conscious and preaching episode to rival Rob Roy as a movie that I would love to see more times. While Braveheart works hard to be a serious epic, Rob Roy attracts and absorbs you in the storyline. No scene is wasted. Rob Roy has the perfect balance of dramatic tension, action, and even occasional humor. The characters are well dressed, transmitting the vernacular perfectly and the manners that anchor them in their authentic period. In addition, they are not caricatures of good and evil that we too often notice in the modern movie. For example, while we hope heroic Rob Roy predominates, we realize that his warnings are the product of his own pride and sense of honor. Tim Roth plays one of the worst bad guys in the history of cinema, but there are times when we can understand how they turned the events of his life into what he is. Rob Roy has a level of character development, which makes his story even more credible and oppressive. Rob Roy is a delightful treasure that presents one of the greatest battles of ever-choreographed swords and a final climate worthy of all tense expectations.
