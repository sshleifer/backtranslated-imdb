Back to roots with "like in heaven" - what are the real values ​​of life? These Swedes create a message that addresses each heart. I have seen it twice in a cinema that I packed in the last place: pure love and joy in the music of a choir that is simple but powerful when everybody finds its inner tone. <br /> <br /> From fame to the youthful school, now empty and ready to adapt as his new home after collapsing on stage, Daniel wants to start listening and being drawn into simple, warm and good in the north. He wins hearts with music and gains the ability to love and to be loved unconditionally. You're not going to see if you've been normalized to Hollywood. This stuff does not contain extra, just laughter, compassion, tears!
