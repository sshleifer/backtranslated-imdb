a bit slow and boring, the story of an old man and his wife who lived in a unbuilt building interacting with a fixed cast of characters like the postman, the brothers on the porch, the smoking smoker. The photo of the river is wonderful, just like the decoration of the inner period. If you like decorating Banana Republic stores, this is a must.
