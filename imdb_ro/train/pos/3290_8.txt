Anna (Charlotte Burke), who is at the edge of puberty, begins to have strange dreams that affect her in real life - especially with a boy named Mark (Elliott Spiers) she meets in her dreams. <br /> <br /> Very unusual fantasy with really terrifying moments. Despite the fact that it's a teenage girl and a PG-13 rating, it's not for kids. Also, if you hate fantasies stay away. But if you're a game for something different, this matches the bill. Well directed by Bernard Rose with a nice music score and a few beautiful, terrifying blows. The only thing that prevents him from being a really great movie is Burke - she is not a very good actress (no wonder this was her only film) and the film hurts. However, everyone else is very good. Spires are very good like Mark; Glenne Headley is very good because Mom and Ben Cross are as scary and as sympathetic as Anne's father. A hit that was hit when released in 1988 has since disappeared. It's too bad - it's very good.
