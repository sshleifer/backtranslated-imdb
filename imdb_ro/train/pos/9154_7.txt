Very well, except for the end which was a huge disappointment. The script was very good as acting. The visuals were often very granular, but this was somewhat added to the film because the snow features were in good places, which helped create a disposition for the film. This effect was destroyed by the extremely incredible end. <br /> <br /> I was going to give this movie an 8 out of ten, but the end beat it at a point to 7 because it seemed to move away from the first 75 minutes of the film and it seemed quite forced to make filmmakers look smart. <br /> <br /> But this movie was much better than movies with big budgets and seemed to be filmed as a home movie with some extra equipment. Not too much in terms of the special effects as they go, but for suspense was very good.
