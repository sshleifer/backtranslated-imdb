Criminal Diagnosis is one of the programs I regularly watch on TV now. The way all the main characters have something to do in each of the episodes makes it so different from today's presentations where they focus on 1 or 2 people per episode, and everyone else is pushed sideways. The way the brand's brain works is also so obscure that you never really know what he is thinking and if you think you do, you're wrong. Criminal Diagnosis has addressed a wide range of subjects, not just in cases, but in each of the personal life characters. Everything from racism and adoption to terrorists and technology. How about it's for the elderly? I am 24 years old !! I do not think they can be classified as old. I just want to know when they release all 8 seasons on DVD (not NTSC), so I can watch them in order. It looks like I'm doing it with a lot of other programs in the same era so they can hurry up a bit!
