This is a great movie! Do not consider the low rating here. I really have no idea where it came from, then have to discuss a different movie. Because I loved her absolutely and found a little hidden treasure. <br /> <br /> The story was so original and charming. I really can not think of anything bad to say about it. Perhaps it must be your "kind of workman," but I saw this with my sister and my mother and we were all taken by her. The actor was also very good, and that is hard to do in a movie like this one. But I found all the characters very interesting and sympathetic. <br /> <br /> I was always very in love with Dougray Scott and I found his role as "dark" very interesting. It's really hard to make me like a bad guy, but I have absolutely no problem with this one this time. Even more, I worshiped him. <br /> <br /> Everyone who loves a good thriller / drama that also has a good dose of love and tragedy should definitely go to see this movie, no question about it! Anyone wanting to see a 80% bloodshed movie should rent something else, though ... But I think the title already does. This is a love story, not Saw 3. I gave this movie 4 out of five stars !!! Good job! <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
