Darius Goes West is a film describing the American belief that everything is possible if you try it a lot. This wonderful fun and sometimes uncomfortable film shows a young man who never expected, but wanted to see what was outside the city of Athens, GA. Darius wanted to see the ocean. His friends for a long time, Logan, Ben and some good friends have decided to make Darius's desire a reality. They started small - Ben & Logan's mother started an e-mail campaign to get to know Darius's state: Duchenne muscular dystrophy and to raise funds for Darius not only to see the ocean but to see these great American states . To say that young colleagues managed to bring hope and awareness of this terrible disease would be an understatement. They realized Darius' dream and then some. They put their lives on hold while showing love, caring and a lot of fun to Darius, helping Darius see how he can, in turn, show the same traits to others who suffer from DMD. Darius continued to volunteer for the Red Cross - sitting in his chair collecting money (along with his friends) outside a local grocery store. His wonderful smile tells the world that dreams are fulfilling - all you need is hope and a group of college friends to support and care for you. Give Darius and all the guys an Oscar - no one else deserves more. Martha Sweeney.
