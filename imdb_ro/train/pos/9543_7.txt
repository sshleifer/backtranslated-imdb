Japanese cyber movies have never done a lot for me, but for a hand I have seen, most of them were at least visually interesting and at least rather entertaining. MEATBALL MACHINE is no exception. The story is about a species of parasites that take over the human hosts, take control of the bodies, turn them into "necroborgs" and cause them to struggle with each other for the sole purpose of eating one another - apparently a "game" for joy of the mentioned parasites. The film revolves mainly around a shy and gal who collapses for each other, but whose love affair is cut off by both being infected with parasites and being forced to fight each other. It becomes a test of human will vs. controlling the parasite on physical bodies ... MEATBALL MACHINE will invariably be compared to TETSUO (like most cyber-punk movies) and for good reason. There are certainly some thematic parallels, although the films are certainly different. There are moments of fun, splattery in the MEATBALL MACHINE, and the creature / borg FX are definitely the culmination - a mixture of TETSUO-meets-GWAR, which are both elaborate and inventive. Depending on your taste for these types of movies, MEATBALL MACHINE may or may not be your thing. If you enjoy cyber-punk hyper-kinetic films with a healthy dose of splashing - this is for you ... 7/10
