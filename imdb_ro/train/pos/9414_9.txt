Although most Americans have little knowledge of his work than Star Wars, Alec Guinness has produced an amazing body of work - especially in the 1940s and 1950s - ranging from dramas to strange comedies. I really like comedies because they are so well made and look so natural and real on the screen - much different from the usual Hollywood rate. This has been said, this was the movie that has prompted my interest in these films. The park was so weird and strange that it is unlikely that the movie will be done anywhere - except for Ealing studios - who have had a certain boldness for "small" movies like this. Guinness is a nerdy scientist working for a textile company. He wants to experiment to create an indestructible synthetic fabric, although he does not work for the company as a researcher, but for janitorial work! So he tends to sneak into the labs (either during the day if no one suspects or at night) and try to invent his hand. Repeatedly, he is caught (like when the lab exploded) and gave boots until one day he actually succeeds! Then, despite the importance of the discovery, he starts a completely unexpected event chain - and then the fun begins. The film is a great satire that has fun in industry, trade unions, government, and people in general.
