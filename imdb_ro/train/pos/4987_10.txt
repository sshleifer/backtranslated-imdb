Although I like Doc Eight Smith's books and David A. Kyles' books about Lensman, the anime, which is freely based on books, is a fairly fun and somewhat innovative fair. seem to be known in Sci-Fi / Fantasy, such as a kid on an isolated planet, inheriting mystical powers and avenging the death of his family, is still quite fun. In addition, Lensman was the first animated animation to use animated CG animated animation. Sure, it might seem a bit overtaken now, but it's still an innovation. If it was not for Lensman, none of this would ever have happened (personally, I think Computer Graphics looks better in animation acting in action.) It's a shame that they only released it on DVD / few countries in the world (especially on formats that are quite foreign and different). I just want to release the movie and the Lensman TV series on DVD / VCD in every part of the world, not just certain parts. Adjust the rules! I just think it's so amazing and looking just as good.
