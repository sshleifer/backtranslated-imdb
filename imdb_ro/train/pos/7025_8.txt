I considered this to be a charming, very lively and entertaining adaptation. Except for two major errors, the distribution is great. I have to recap a few of the previous comments - Chynna Phillips is a horror of teens. At age 27, she is too old (and, yes, looks) and does not have music "singing" for Broadway-style music. Vanessa Williams is a decent singer and, for a non-dancer, she is fit. However, she is not Latina, and her character is for sure. She is also very STRIDENT throughout, which becomes tedious. Conrad Birdie's sweet Sweet Apple fan club girls really shine - with special kudos for Brigitta Dau and Chiara Zanni. I also enjoyed Tyne Daly's performance, although I'm not generally a fan of her work. Finally, Shriners dance is a riot, especially those three times in the bar. The film is suitable for the whole family and I strongly recommend it.
