Overall, I was quite impressed by the pilot. The first fifteen minutes were worrying because they believed the creators were trying to create a science-fiction version of The OC, but this fear is rectified when a terrorist incident occurs and shows the show on topics and situations that I rarely see television. The BSG dealt with themes such as monotheism, existentialism, reality, death, and terrorism, but they were primarily a subtext for the viewer to contemplate or ignore if he chose this. Here, on the other hand, these subjects are the focus of the show, and I personally found myself evoking such works as Ghost In The Shell and The Matrix as reference points while watching and being surprised at how well discuss the themes. I think if you are a fan of the two that I just mentioned or other movies / TV shows that deal with the topics I have mentioned, I think you will find at least something here. a starting point to explain how the situation we have come to know in the BSG I think they treated it in a very interesting way, I particularly liked how they explained where the Cylon creed came into -a single God, and that Caprica's creation had quite advanced and contemporary technology thrown to make it appear in the future, but not completely foreign to us as spectators. The only real weaknesses I noticed were the relationship between the parents Greystone and the actress playing Lacy Rand. While I personally like Eric Stoltz and Paula Malcomson, together, their scenes seem to be lacking in chemistry, at this point they might just be able to develop their characters, but I think work is needed. I also found Magda Apanowicz unconvincing in her role. This may be again the experience and time to develop, but during the episode, his act has emerged forcefully and not entirely confident. Based on the pilot, I look forward to seeing where Caprica's future goes, and we hope to achieve the greatness that BSG once did.
