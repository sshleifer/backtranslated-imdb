I am from Romania and I will try to speak in English. All I want to say about this movie is that it is and will be my first time. He has seen at least 30 times and will see it for many years. It has all the small things I like in a movie, it's very moving makes me cry. Displays a lot of twisted things of love and questions about love and reality, and about the real things that matter to different people. It happens that for me this matters most, the love, the soul of a man, the inner being, and that is what I see in this film. Perhaps for me it's more than just a movie, it's proof in my mind that it could really exist, and that you do the best of the best of every moment in which you live with your soul. It's a long way from reality to sci-fi, but ... if it were. If all capitalism disappeared and the economy fell, would it fall? We are all preoccupied with other issues, and my thought is that in your dead bed, the bigger thing you remember is not wealth, not adventure, not the countries you've visited, and the people who remind you . But true friends and your true love and the hope that after you die, everything will be damn good and people would be good and will take more care. CALL THIS MOVIE and will probably guide you in your life as it did to me :) Save from Romania
