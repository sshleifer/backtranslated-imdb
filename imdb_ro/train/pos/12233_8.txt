Astronaut Steve West (Alex Rebar) and his comrades engage in a space mission that sees them fly through Saturn rings. His comrades are killed instantly, but they seem to be the lucky ones. Steve returns to Earth a constant mass of humanoid pulp; when he turns into a wild killer who melts at every step, he is pursued by his friend, Dr. Ted Nelson (Burr DeBenning). This is often so funny - with plenty of absurd lines and situations to do - that it's hard for me to think that laughs are all unintentional. It seems to me to be a kind of effort in low-budget gender efforts in the 1950s and 1960s and, as such, is an extraordinary fun movie. This healthcare sequence is simply hilarious. We are even treated in a sequence of sequences that add nothing, but it is still a gas to be watched. Writer / director William Sachs deserves credit because he came up with this ingenious idea; its ultra-slim character is indeed a memorable one. I think his rhythm is a bit off; some scenes (such as the one with elderly couples) continue a little, but eventually offer film B with a panache. The climax is especially fun. Arlon Obers' music is not fun at all (but also funny in a few moments), and Willy Curtis's movie sometimes creates very good pictures. This brings me to the fantastic and persuasive effects of Rick Bakers, who make up an extremely respectable central piece for the film, even to the final melting. <br /> <br /> The armor is under heavy makeup for almost the entire movie (Sachs takes my praise because the movie has hit the ground) and does what she has to do pretty well. DeBenning is doing for a rather bad and bad hero, and Ann Sweeney is not that hot either as his wife, but Myron Healey, Michael Alldredge and Lisle Wilson are all good to their support. It's also worth seeing Cheryl "Rainbeaux" Smith, Janus Blythe ("The Eaten Alive" by Tobe Hoopers and "The Hills Have Eyes") and even director Jonathan Demme in a little while. <br /> <br /> This is a very fun midnight movie with enough gorilla, chills and laughs to appreciate it's worth catching for low-level sci-fi / horror lovers everywhere. <br /> <br /> 8/10
