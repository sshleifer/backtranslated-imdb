The "Father of Pride" was another good show that unfortunately does not have a very long life. And that's pretty sad, especially if you think almost all the worst performances are still in the air (I think in "Simple Life") I admit there are many similarities to this show and "The Simpsons," but despite the similarities, the show has its own merits. Animation is just appropriate, not incredible, but good. The best are the characters. All animals are very fun and funny, and even Sigfried and Roy have had their moments. The music was good, I liked many of the songs. Even if the show is not very original, I think this has had a lot of potential. Like "Mission Hill" a performance that is not very famous, but I really enjoyed it, it did not have the appreciation it deserves. What a shame .
