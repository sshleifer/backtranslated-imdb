An old family story said to the two girls by their grandfather is brought to life 16 years later, as he foretold. People are killed and the blood is shed, and the rats are scouring everywhere and the bare bodies are glad. Kitty (Barbara Bouchet) is the suspect, but we know he is not the killer. Is Franziska (Marina Malfatti)? Is Evelyn back from death for revenge? Is it a plot to steal an inheritance? The color is superb in this thriller by Emilio Miraglia, who just made another Giallo, as far as I know. The only thing that broke the movie was the fact that several frames were cut. Someone's calling the police and suddenly trying to save Kitty.
