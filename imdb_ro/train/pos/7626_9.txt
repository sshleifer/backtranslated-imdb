I've loved this movie since I first saw it in 1979. I'm still amazed at how accurate Kurt Russell portrays Elvis, how it moves on the face. Sometimes the frightening as he looks, acts and speaks like the real Elvis. Fortunately, this is released on DVD, so everyone who waited can finally have a great quality version of the entire movie. I've heard detractors who say there are some inaccuracies or some things left out, but I think considering that John Carpenter only had about 2Â½ hours of work and that this was shown on television (just two years after Elvis's death!) that he did a good job with that. Actually, I've never seen another Elvis movie that's coming close to it. Highly recommended.
