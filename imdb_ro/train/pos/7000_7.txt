When I first saw the title, I already deduced the theme of the film - clearly it was not a reference to the British currency, so it had to be Shakespearian and a few pounds of meat - to take or give them. Will Smith is a sensational actor, so serial killers are out. It could only be a man to give them, so it has to be that way. I pampered everything for myself, looking up and knowing the story before I looked, because the beauty of the construction is how parts of the main character's background are dripped to illuminate the audience slowly about who it is and why it does what he does. Guilt is a very difficult topic to do simply because it is deeply uncomfortable and sad, which is not an encouraging premise when you are hoping to travel with a roller coaster - you know it will be unpleasant. I would not say that the movie glorifies suicide; it revolves in the most extreme form of self-sacrifice - martyrdom. It is also full of symbolism everywhere, which is a sure sign, which says that the writings are intelligently thought in detail and led to multiple meanings and a deeply reflective nature. The most prominent theme that struck me was that he not only gave him the heart of the face he loves emotionally and metaphorically, but physically gave him the greatest gift he could. Decided to die, but his plan is worsened by falling into love - which is a complication of the second act. Absolutely master. Yes, it is very slow, but I am undetermined if it had been better introduced in a shorter timeframe. I did not feel the strain and the terrible inner terror as far as I could, but maybe I just ruined it for me in advance. Saying this is a profoundly moved and original movie, which is an incredibly powerful and challenging thought tragedy that deserves the prizes it will inevitably get.
