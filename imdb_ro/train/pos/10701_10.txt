Critics did not like this movie. He bombed in states and, as a result, received only a limited presentation in the UK. Which was a great shame because it represents British humor rather than American and should have been shown primarily in the UK. Nicole Kidman looks amazing and is a completely convincing shame. Ben Chaplin is the character of Dustin Hoffman from "The Graduate," and "Girl's Birthday" has at least 4 scenes that remind the 1960s (despite being a completely different story!) Are changing a lot from comedy to black comedy to thriller to adventure - but it's memorable, a fresh air is moving in comparison with a high-budget mid-size blockbuster. open mind!
