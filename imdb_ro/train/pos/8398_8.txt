A realistic picture of young love for the set of faculties, but also appealing to an older viewer like me. She has ups and downs, twists and turns and made me shed a tear or two. We rarely see movies with black urban characters that could attract older, non-black audiences and show a more realistic picture of young black adults. This movie takes place in a college campus and a city where two people meet and fall in love. In the background are known and friends different situations that affect them for better or worse. A typical plot could tell some, but this was really unexpected. <br /> <br /> I found myself rooted in the survival of the couple's relationship, seeing my own past in their story. Moments of deep thought and revelation broke out of actors' performances. <br /> <br /> It is a bright film that I would support for young people in heart and in love or who have ever been in love. Great movie. I'll look for a copy to add to my movie collection.
