It's so nice to see a great piece of art transformed into another without distortion or contrivance. I had no idea how such extraordinary literature could be recreated as a movie worth seeing. If you had loved Bulgakov's book, you would, of course, be afraid to see the misinterpretation made for an art film project rather than actually bring the deeper meaning of the story to the screen. There are some examples of this with the Master and Margarita. So complex and distant as the story, the film leaves nothing to it. It is as if the cinefil reads Bulgakov's work just as an orchestral conductor reads a score - without a missed score. Why can not we find such talent here in the US? So now, my favorite book and movie have the same title.
