Villian in this movie is a medium soba and apparently enjoys what he does, which is why I think he's doing so badly. I do not think most men will want this movie, especially if they have cheated their wife. This is one of those movies that ultimately resembles a lot. Then there, you have a candy that ends, which makes me look back and say, "HOKIE AS HELL". A pretty good movie to the end. The end is the end we would love to see, but not the end to such an important beginning. And then the result of what happened. Guess you can make your own mind about the true end. I felt that only one character would have survived at the end.
