Purple Rain is a great movie if you are a 40-year-old music lover who has played Prince's music in the 1980s. Story is a very used formula: ascending music talent must overcome personal and professional obstacles to find its audience and self-esteem. Prince is a bad actor, but his performance, especially the Purple Rain / I'd Die 4 U makes it worthwhile to stay in the movie. He is himself a showman, just as powerful on the stage as Mick Jagger or Michael Jackson, around the Thriller. Apollonia Kotero, the former Protector Prince, is beautiful and shows talent and chemotherapy with the prince, but her script does not leave her far. Day Morris and other actors offer comic elements.
