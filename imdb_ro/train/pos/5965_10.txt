I gave this to 10 out of 10 points. I like it so much. I am a child of the 80s and totally heavy metals for many years. These are the reasons why I like this movie so much. It's so cool to see those posters in that boy's bedroom (Judas Priest, Lizzy Borden, Raven, Twisted Sister ...) and his vinyl collection (discovering the bad guys of Exciter, Rise of the mutants by Shoaler Master Soccer and Killing is my Megadeth business). Also, the FASTWAY soundtrack is absolutely incredible and fits well with the scenario. If you're in metal then TRICK OR TRAT is your friend. Do not buy or watch this movie for OZZY or GENE SIMMONS because they are in the movie for a few seconds, watch it for the soundtrack and the story that will take you back to the glory of the '80s. You will not be the same person after.
