This is a remarkable piece of cinematic achievement. From the beginning, I was completely included in the story (true) when Lieutenant Viktor Burakov (Stephan Rea) is crying while doing autopsies on the remains of the children's bodies. This is the compelling story of Andrei Chikatilo, played wonderfully by Jeffrey DeMunn (The Green Mile). In fact, he plays so well and so sympathetic that the viewer almost starts to pity until we remember what he is. Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovski's psychiatrist, wonderfully played by Max Von Sydow, was completely credible in every detail, and the point he makes when he talks about paranoia in the Soviet Union is very obvious through the behavior of local Communist Commissar Bondarchuk played by Joss Ackland. But for me, the extraordinary show was from Donald Sutherland, proving once again what is a true character actor. I was almost teary when I told Burakov that the FBI had watched so much and admired her work. This film silences the Lambs in the shadow, from the atmospheric and gloomy Soviet landscape to the superlatives of all those involved. <br /> <br /> I rated this movie 10/10
