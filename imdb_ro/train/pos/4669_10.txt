If there were two charming artists in 1968 than Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith who appeared together in a more charming movie, I do not know who I am. I saw this wonderful satirical jewel for the first time 25 years ago at the age of 16 and I think any year I did not manage to sit down to see him again wasted. It is smart, quirky, elegant, full of feelings, sweet, slightly subversive and completely enchanting. The romance of these two social drawbacks is so richly comic and awesome - never more than Maggie Smith's desperate attempt to bring the right book into the bundle, a funny scene as well as a perfect portrait of loneliness heartbreaking. And that final freezing frame on Ustinov's anxious, worried and loving face, when he asks, "Are you okay?" - has anyone ever made the look and sound of devotion so perfect and honest? I would never want to know someone who would not love this movie.
