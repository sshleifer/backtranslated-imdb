Previously, I wrote that I loved "Titanic," they called at the end (often) and I'm a guy in the 1960s. I also wondered why this great movie, which won so many awards and was applauded by so many critics, has only received a 7.0 rating by imdb.com users. Well, I looked at the breakdown of user ratings. While 29.0% of the total vote gave it a rating of 10, 10.7% gave a rating of 1. These 10.7% of these irrational imdb users, in fact, scored the general rating to 7.0. <br /> <br /> In my previous comments, I blame this extremely unusual vote model (a sharp rise in 1 ranking with a 10 rating, only dropping gradually and then suddenly reversing the course and jumping to the level 1) on one thing: hatred for Leonardo DiCaprio. Believe me, I've set up in chat rooms enough to see the banter by young people (especially young) who defy it to the left and right. They absolutely hate the man and will not have any role to give him credit in "Titanic." (To answer another user: I DO NOT talk about someone who really does not like the movie and gave him a 5 or 6, etc. Everyone has and has the right to their own taste But no one can convince me that rating the imdb of only 7.0 for "Titanic," touched by too many ridiculous ratings, is a fair reflection of the global movie.) Allow me to demonstrate my point of view by comparing the model of the "Titanic" imdb users with 5 randomly selected boxes and critical "bombs" (there are many others, but these 5 will prove my point of view). "The Heaven's Gate" (1980) was quickly removed from theaters after a box office show was very weak, and the imdb rating of the voters was: 23.2% 10 and 9.2% 1 rating. "Big Top Pee-wee" (1988) achieved 4.3% 10 ratings and 9.9% 1 ratings (overall rating 4.5). "Cat People" (1982) achieved 6.1% 10 ratings and 2.6% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.8). Blind Date (1987) achieved 3.0% 10 ratings and 2.8% 1 ratings (Overall rating of 5.3). "Jumpin 'Jack Flash" (1986) achieved 4.4% 10 ratings and 3.7% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.2). What do these films do in common with "TITANIC"? ALL PERCENTAGES OF THIS RATES ARE LITTERS !!!! Than "TITANIC," and none of them have ever been nominated for a single prize. Again, "Titanic" earned 10.7% 1 ratings! Compare this to the other 5 movies I just mentioned. Can there be any explanation other than the hatred of Leo? <br /> <br />
