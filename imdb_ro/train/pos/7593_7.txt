The film is absolutely silly. But would you expect a high intellectual film based on a comic called Slam Dunk? Really? Jay Chou's act is not even the most moving thing I've ever seen, but I certainly enjoyed the film. Was it somewhere near the wonderful level that someone like Jet Li or Stephen Chow could produce? No, not really. Was it really funny if you only took it to surface value? Absolute. It's a movie about some Chinese-candy idols and musicians who can play basketball at an unreal level of expertise. There's a bad guy in the Triad style and a wandering guy that involves Jay Chou in all this. An interest in love. It's about forms, but it really suspends unbelief for a while. Come on. It's called Kung Fu Dunk. What do you think you signed up for? Do a favor if you follow her - I found a copy with some English subtitles that made the film close to unintelligibly wise conversation, but I had a great laugh at it. They seem to be extremely fixed on Jerusalem and numbers 1, 10. I laughed, I cried, I threw away. I would look again. Especially for that battle scene in the bar. Well, choreographed and well shot. I'm more pleased with the plexiglass pool table - I'd love to play one of these. Slick enough for me, but I dig into the garbage can.
