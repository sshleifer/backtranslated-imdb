This is one of those Westerns who, in fact, are virtually lonely in the unpredictable quality of their dialogue. Very few can handle it during a long journey. That being said, the rest is pretty bad. However, I give it an eight, because there is no other western with such a consistent dialogue, except "The Wild Bunch", "Junior Bonner" and perhaps a few. <br /> <br /> It's full of weaknesses, John Drew Barrimore's brightest. However, it has a truly memorable scene. Nothing is so. Even after Kid Wichita kills the sheriff, he goes to Jack Elams to try to beat him in the fight. Lovely things. Even with the best of any West.
