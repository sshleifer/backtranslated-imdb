Princess Tam Tam is devoid of the traitors of racism, in the way we think of racism in the United States, but there are even more subtle statements (to the American spectator) about ethnic identity over time. Be careful about placing Alwina (Baker) in photos, as she addresses the other characters, the settings around her describing her as a "wild" African, and ask yourself if Alwina has any kind of agency throughout the movie. I do not want to destroy anything, but finally, I pay special attention, the dichotomy between "Eastern" and "Western" culture is the least offensive, such a dictatorship is happily denied these days. The French have a caramelized past as an imperial force in all the areas described (see Les Markers, Meurent Aussi- 1953) and pay attention to the places visited by European travelers while in Africa and reflect on their attitudes towards the "other" . I give this movie a 7, because I'm a sucker for Baker, much of what she did in her professional career, like the prince Tam Tam, which is regressive, is certainly shadowed by her integration efforts, her work as strange espionage smile, I'm sorry.) However, the film for me is captivating because of its performance, apart from being a relic with mentalities.
