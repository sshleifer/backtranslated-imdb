It was an original decent film and a courageous move for everyone involved. I do not care if it's not the best feature film of all time, the fact that Eddie Murphy is doing something non-formic and I do not know what's going to happen next, makes him a favorite. I want more films to be as imaginative as this one, rather than the same old entertainment formula.
