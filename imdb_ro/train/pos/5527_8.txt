Probably there is a special reason why Fox and the child hit a special note in my heart. I just said goodbye to my new fiancÃ©e - a day ... for an unknown time, I was a little overwhelmed with different emotions and suffered the rain to put on the courageous face she was supposed to see. /> <br /> I watched some movies and TV shows, but my interest turned from what we left behind to what is there and what we have not seen. That's why I'll thank her for this movie. Being a lover of nature and having heard about the movie beforehand, I was sure I would like it anyway. But I just did not like it, I liked it. Technical mastery is breathtaking. How did they do it? How did the animals catch up like they did? Is awesome. The narrative's morale is good and while the end is oh so French and ambiguous, it's a happy / sad one. Again, they caught me a little. As a man who usually keeps his emotions, the conclusion was hard to get through while on a plane full of people I would have seen for the next 15 hours! Maybe because the end made me think about what I left. But for those few hours of the plane, I was happy to see something new and original. And that's life. Sure, there are those things you love and feel comfortable around ... but the great out there has many mysteries. So next time I see something unusual while going outdoors; I will explore it, I will observe it and embrace it. That's exactly what's happening in this movie and that's exactly what you should do with this darn movie / good nature movies too. <br /> <br /> It's two months since the plane's trip. We do not know when we'll see again, but we will.
