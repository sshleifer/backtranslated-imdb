CAT SOUP has two "Hello Kitty" cats embarking on a bizarre trip through the afterlife, where something can happen and not. This short Asian time does not use any dialogue, replacing the balloons with words. There is no way to describe this dementia cartoon, except to tell you to see it alone. And make sure no one under 10 is in the room. Dismemberment and cannibalism and cruelty, savagery and sudden death and lack of respect for others are common themes. Sincere. Perhaps the most memorable picture is that of an elephant composed of water that cats swim and in and also travel. But, like everything else in this movie, that stupid interlude, the picnic, soon comes to a horrible ending.
