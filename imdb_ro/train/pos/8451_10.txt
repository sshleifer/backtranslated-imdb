How did I get into it: When I started watching this series on Cartoon Network, I have to say that I have never seen it and it was the best. But when I started collecting the VHS series and later on a DVD part of Bandei Anime Legends collections. It was amazing and worth watching. He had a lot of explosive actions that will throw you out of the chair. And, of course, the theme songs "Just Communication" and "Rhythm Emotions" were the best. Characters and Gundams: My favorite characters in the show were: Heero, Duo, Relena, Treize, Lady Unde, Noin and Zechs My favorite gundam in the show I liked most are Wing Zero and Epyon and of course Altron and Deathscythe I and II. <br /> <br /> The significance shows: what also shows in this series that in real life, the wars are very heavy and sometimes we can win or lose. But peace can be difficult to achieve, and I think Gundam pilots do what they need and are trying to get peace in the world. But, however, this show is truly the best of the best. So, at the end of this review, after watching this show, you see Waltz Endless Movie.
