I saw this movie after I saw Blue Crush and other Michelle films. I thought he had a grim future in this business. I was extremely wrong after watching her performance in "Girlfight", I was amazed at the way she captures the excitement of a fighter but also a warrior. In this film the way she faces her father about her treatment and of her brother, how she conveys anger when getting hit.Her character learning curve in her cant movie has always put a wall and hide from love or that just because she has power she does not win. I think this role was perfect for Michelle, although he had no previous experience, the director saw the talent, criticizes me because I did not see the talent in it.
