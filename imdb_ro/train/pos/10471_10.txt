I liked this movie and yet I hated it because I wanted to help this guy! I am 50 years old and I have a lot of friends in the field of music ... who are still trying to become adults ... they are no longer the fans, the groups, the money, etc ... and they face so hard with time, a normal life ... when they see the new bands, etc., getting the spotlight ... it's almost as if it should start again ... this movie is a testament to what many old rockers of the '70s and '80 are going now ... and there I find the film sad and depressing. But portrays the life of an old rock star - abandoned and lost - in a credible way. The young woman who comes to his house reminds me of Hollis maclaren (Outrageous) ... and she is a lady in a movie that you will cheer up. This film is a must for people in the 1950s who saw the rise and fall of bands, people who met members and saw how they hurt them as their age sneaks and popularity vanishes. This is an almost perfect movie .... but in a positive way ... because of whales. MUST SEE!
