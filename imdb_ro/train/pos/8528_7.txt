I like Peter Sellers, most of the time. I have never seen him present a senior British before this movie. He's shooting pretty well, though you see pieces of Inspector Clouseau in the mix. It does not get interesting until Goldie Hawn arrives. I never expected Hawn for youth to provide a solid performance. Her moment was great, and her expressions were invaluable. The way she alternately throws the lecherous character down and seduces him is nice to look. Sparring verbal, as we have rarely seen in a movie of that era. The last thirty minutes of the DOS movie do not fall. It's worth to be disappointed just to see the sixty. Hawn is nude for some glorious seconds of time. Enjoy it...
