I saw this first in the cinema when it came out, and the crowd was really in the movie that made the experience even more fun. This is a great cast of characters, many big names in it, some of which were not as recognizable as they are now. I think it's a great idea if you follow any of these actors or you've loved them in other movies to add them to your watch list. Some of the scenes remind me of the kind of comedy well done in The Birdcage or even The Clue, a kind of strange comedy, apparently spontaneous, with a truly professional delivery from these dear actors. The film has done a great job, giving you an understanding, perhaps very realistic, in the culture of a soap during the day.
