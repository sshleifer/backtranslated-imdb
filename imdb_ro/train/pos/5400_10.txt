This film is a brilliant lesson about Japanese history, set at the end of Tokugawa Shogunate, shortly before the Shogunate had lost a great battle against the loyalist who wanted the Emperor to return to the throne to rule Japan. Indeed, I had to read a lot of history to get the whole background. Shintaro Katsu (also known as the original Zatoichi) offers superb performance like Izo Okada, one of the four Hitokiri (= Slayer man) in Bakumatsu. He is a simple samurai who loses all his riches. In order to have a good life, he becomes a retainer of Takechi Hanpei (played by Tatsuya Nakada = Ryonosuke in Sword of Doom). Hanpei is an ultra-nationalist politician who leaves Hitokiri's band to assassinate a lot of pro-high-ranking politicians to reach their political goals. Izo Okada follows his leader without really asking what they are doing. As long as he has money to go and drink and spend on the whore. Okada's crimes are becoming more brutal during the movie and he is proud to have a fear-based reputation wherever he goes. <br /> <br /> It's a splendid portrait about the life of a simple samurai who's caught up in political affairs, and it's really naive to figure out what's going on. First, after being betrayed and tortured and always having talks with Sakamoto (who is a samurai who rejects violence), he changes his ideas and visions of life. But too late .... Watch the movie to see the end of Izo Okada ... Shintaro Katsu and the rest of the staff provide a brilliant performance. Every actor reaches their role. The sword struggles with a unique and fast ... probably faster than more films nowadays ... Check out if you have a chance!
