I was watching this movie at the usual time, which is real late at night. Usually, if I do not care about a movie, I start to fall asleep and I have to change my fridge to stay awake. At first I thought that was what I had to do since the rhythm of the movie began slowly, along with the fact that its blows tended to stay with the character for a long time. But, after a while, I'm getting more into the movie, as more is revealed about the main character through his story. After all, you feel you've known him all his life. The movie kept my interest so much that I did not even know the sun was about to rise. Not much of Lynch's bizarre style, but there are plenty of strange characters to make this movie funny.
