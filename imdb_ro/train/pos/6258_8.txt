He may have skipped something from the beginning-I do not know why this is going to start in the Asian part of Turkey. If it were because, from the Mediterranean, it could have come close to modern Lebanon. One of the rooms and crews reach the Bakhtyari tribe, is the start of a stunning 48-day trip. 50,000 people with about 250,000 goats, camels, cattle and horses make this stunning passage over what seems to be a very fast Karun River. They use the floats that are kept on the waterline by swelling the goat's skin - you can see where your head and legs have been removed. The other "bank" of the river was very steep - assuming a 60-degree increase. Just forgetting it was incredible, but many others would come. To reach the pastures, they had to cross a major mountain that had about 4 feet of snow, if not more. Being able to climb this mountain was quite amazing in itself, but they (and all the animals) climbed this mountain barefoot! Yes, barefoot. One drawback to this documentary was some of the intertitles with poor humorous attempts. If you want to see a documentary from the silent era, or the incredible challenges that this tribe not only confronts but also conquers. This is just an incredible document of a little known group of people who face all sorts of challenges.
