From a cinematic point of view, this movie smells. So, a lot of acting. But I do not care. If there is a strong representation of what was in the 1980s (often we inside the city) and what hip-hop, Zulu, nation and dance break was really like. Great music, nice dance <br /> <br /> It almost appears as a documentary of the past when hip-hop was a way of life. It's also interesting to see New York showing as a zero point from a nuclear attack. Some viewers may be too young to remember that it was a poor city, broken down in the 1970s and 1980s. This is the best of all the hip-hop / break dance films that came out at that time. Of course 80 years are considered a joke now with all bad shows and bad movies, but those of us who have lived through it will always remember for a while when music, dance and graffiti were fresh, yo!
