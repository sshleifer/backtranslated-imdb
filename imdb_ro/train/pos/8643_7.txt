This was a scary movie. Brad Pitt He deserved an Oscar for this. A traveling novelist (played by David Duchovny from X-Files' fame) and his girlfriend pick up two passengers (Juliette Lewis and Brad Pitt) on their way to California. <br /> <br /> On their way they stop at criminal scenes infamated in a series of criminals to photograph scenes for a forthcoming book Duchovny's character works on, I know little that the most disturbed serial killer in the history of the country is sitting right next to in the same car.
