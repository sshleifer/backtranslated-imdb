Let me get to the bottom line here: I have 3 children aged 5 to 10 years. I think a trip to the theater is a success when there are no animals to talk about. We've seen most of the videos of our collections in our collection at least 72 times. I can tell you when the movie is reversed in the Oz Wizard, the eagle over 18 years old in El Dorado, and the tragic defect with the end of Rudolph Red-born Red. I could probably write the Nemo story from memory only. What makes me support my only child (varies) that suggests this title for the family movie of a series? In a word: The Washer. <br /> <br /> Moment of silence ... * Sigh *
