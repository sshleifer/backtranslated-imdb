Considering how these movies are, you have to think that it must have been fun to do them. The film focuses on a house that strangely shelters someone who lives there. The inhabitants were: the author Charles Hillyer (Denholm Elliott (with hair!)), Who is haunted by his own creation; Philip Grayson (Peter Cushing), who gets too close to a wax statue; John Reid (Christopher Lee), whose daughter's joy is apparently a facade; and actor Paul Henderson (Jon Pertwee), on the verge of getting a little too much in character. <br /> <br /> "The House That Emancipated From Blood" is actually worth seeing (good spirit, see Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee). In addition to being simply groomed, there may be some subtones: it could question the problem of real horror vs. alleged horror. As in "The Shining," one might wonder whether the house / hotel itself keeps a memory of past events. And if nothing else, Ingrid Pitt (like Paul's co-star) is HOT HOT HOT! During the time he left, he also starred in "Countess Dracula" and "The Lovers of Vampire" (and with Peter Cushing). Perhaps she - like Barbara Steele - will only be known as a queen of print, but she marks my words: She IS A WEAK REPRESENTATIVE! I'd like to see Ingrid Pitt and Barbara Steele in something. I think the only weird scene (so to speak) is where Denholm Elliott wears a pink shirt and a fluffy jacket. You read this right. What kind of name is Denholm anyway? Good. A very cool movie.
