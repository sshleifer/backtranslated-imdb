The origin of the bears and their cousins. If you have seen the original movie, you will notice a discrepancy. Cousins ​​are raised with bears rather than meeting them later. However, I have no problems with this, preferring to treat movies as separate interpretations. Kids are adorable and it's fun to watch them play and grow. My favorite is Swift Heart Rabbit. The bastard is a charmer of threatening ways. I could empathize with the three kids because I was never good at sports. Cree Summer is great as Christy. The songs are sweet and memorable. If you have an open heart, you love toys or enjoy the original, this should not be missed. 9/10
