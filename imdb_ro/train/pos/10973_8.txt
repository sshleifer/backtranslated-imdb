An excellent film showing the pathetic lives of the two old ladies. They could not live together or alone. Stuttering constantly, sometimes at the same time, they unleashed and resumed the past; to continue and to continue on what they could do. I woke up laughing sometimes, but mostly I was taken with how sad and abandoned the two women were. See this.
