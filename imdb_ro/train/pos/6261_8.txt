Fantastic documentary from 1924. This geography of the twentieth century in Iraq today was strong. Watch this and tell me if Cecil B. DeMille did not take notes before making his Ten Commandments. Merian C. Cooper, the photographer, later created Cinerama, an idea that probably hatched while filming the remarkable landscapes of this film. Werner Herzog's fans will find this film as a treasure, with heart-filled fighting stories compliments of the land around them, has no human ability to survive so clearly. The fact that this was done when not only the will of the subjects, but also the filming, was shown.
