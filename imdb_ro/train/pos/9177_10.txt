I have to say that this miniseries was the best interpretation of the beloved novel "Jane Eyre". Both Dalton and Clarke are very credible like Rochester and Jane. I have seen other versions but can not compare to them. Best for me. I could never imagine someone to play these characters. The last time I saw her was in 1984 when I was only 13 years old. At that moment I was a worm and I had just read Charlotte Bronte's novel. I was completely excited about this miniseries and I remember that none of the episodes was missing. I'd like to see her again, because it's so good. :-)
