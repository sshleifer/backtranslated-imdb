I bought this movie a few days ago and I thought it would be a crazy movie. But when I threw them into the DVD player, it surprised me in a very good way. James Belushi plays very well in the role of Bill "The Mouth" Manuccie. But especially Timothy Dalton plays a very good role as the sheriff. The "final" scene, in Bill's house, is great, works fine with the room, beautiful dialogues and great action. Bill "The Mouth" Manuccie stole $ 12 million from the Mafia. Together with his wife, he lives in South Carolina in a witness protection program. But the mafia is following him and wants 12 million dollars. Bill can only trust the only person he knows inside.
