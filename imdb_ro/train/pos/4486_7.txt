SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Tom and Jerry are a classic cartoon with a perfect idea and almost every short is a jewel. While I have to say that this is certainly a bit short compared to other classic Tom and Jerry pants, there is no way I can hate this cartoon. Sure, it's understandable that this is one of the worst of Tom and Jerry's first episodes, and I can say I agree but the fact is that all Tom and Jerry's episodes are great, but some are just better than others . Well, this would fit into "others". <br /> <br /> This is Fraidy Cat's plot. Tom listens to an old scary radio show and gets a little scared. Jerry notices how frightened he is and tries to scare him even more than he already was. He creates fearsome dilemmas for Tom, and Tom is scared of his intelligence and his life. Jerry then puts a sheet over a vacuum cleaner and controls it, making it seem like the vacuum is a ghost. Tom finds out that Jerry has done all this and is following him. Tom blasted the servant of the house by mistake. However, at the end of Jerry, one gets scared, after seeing his reflection in a cup of flour. Overall, this is far from the best Tom and Jerry short there but this is still a fun and fun piece of time. It makes me want more cartoons like this. The harass and the gags that make Tom and Jerry famous are as good as ever in this short, but I felt something was missing in it. He felt slower than most Tom and Jerry pants. However, this is a short short that does not quite deal with Tom and Jerry's other cartoons, but it's still pretty. <br /> <br /> 7/10
