I liked this movie because it basically did more with less. It might have been more interesting if it kept more in the studio (although some plotting elements would have been harder to develop). The guy who played the DJ did a good job of showing someone scared and haunted by his memories. I also found the dialogue quite funny with those who called. While some parts of the movie are seen coming a mile away, others do not expect them to look like they did. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a fairly minimal story of ghosts for the most part, focusing more on the live side of the equation. The last 5-10 minutes were pretty well done as everything is revealed. While it was a shorter film, he felt it was just about the right time to tell the story. More and would have begun to shoot.
