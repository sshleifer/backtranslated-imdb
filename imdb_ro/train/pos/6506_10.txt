Very brilliant. Strong and evocative. The most persuasive documentary series ever made about the war. Its tone offers a strong contrast to the often gung-world attitude of World War II, which the media poses. Rather than opt to cry about the horror of the war, Sir Laurence Olivier's silent voice takes its place behind the real images of the war: corpses everywhere, explosions, terrible citizens and soldiers, crushed people, indifferent politicians, mistakes which cost thousands of lives, the suffering of the innocent. Moreover, it truly brings home the fact that mankind is capable when all normal rules of "civilization" are eliminated. There is something distinct Hobbesian about man in a real state of nature, he will return to a more beast-able form of crimes that will still shock and fascinate for 60 years. Perhaps there could be a series of follow-up called "the century of war" for the twentieth century was truly the century of horrors. I feel that it is an irony of immense magnitude that there has been an event that has caused the death of 50 million people to produce such a compelling and excellent series as this one.
