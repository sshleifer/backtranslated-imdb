Johnny To's Election has good music on opening credits and a nice credit opening design, a Chinese kaleidoscope, and those Asian mobs who take a solemn oath or have some sacred things; in fact, the whole movie is well-marked. I found out about Bishop Serafim Sigrist and he was very eager to see a movie To. The one I started with, THE CHOICE, is interesting and interesting, and only moderately violent by the current standards - moderate and also essentially violent; the story of an Asian godfather's scheme uses a puzzle piece of elements, violent deeds in the lives of the mobs, the race for scepter, true details, and, as in Coppola's case, he expects to believe that some of the morally morally charged mobs are titled and beautiful and pleasant. The performances are reasonably fun and colorful. The choice is well done in the pleasant, little careless style of the Hong Kong fare; the end is bitter, true, right, and scares the children.
