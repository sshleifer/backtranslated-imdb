Very good western. He was the first writer Richard Wilson directed by a film, and it was the first for Samuel Goldwyn Junior as a producer. It's a pleasure to see a beautiful and beautiful Angie Dickinson like a saloon. Robert Mitchum comes to this city dominated by prosecutors and is hired as a tamer city, but people are worried that he will go too far as to the evil he will do for the city's affairs. There are some similarities in the "Warlock" story that was made in 1959. This film keeps a very fast and exciting rhythm, really keeping you at the edge.
