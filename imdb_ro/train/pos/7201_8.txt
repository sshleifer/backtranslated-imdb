Very good dramatic comedy about a playwright who tries to figure out how to keep his head above the water after he gets out of ideas. I can not say much about this movie without telling the story. I can say that the little one was the way you look at the picture. Everyone has their own agenda. A small surprise at the end - after the other surprises. Well written with good performance by all.
