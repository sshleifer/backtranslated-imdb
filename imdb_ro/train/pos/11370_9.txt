Spoilers - as far as describing their characters and their relationship to the plot. <br /> <br /> This is a quality movie. The subject is bold and tight. The persevering determination of Stephen Rea's character, Burakov, is simply captivating. With every apology to him, his constantly expressed hangdog serves the character well. He is, as we say in England about the character of the TV series Inspector Taggart, bound to be gloomy because he sees three murders per week. Well, this is not strictly the same as Chikatila has worked for many years ... You have a true sense of the inappropriate resistance of USSR bureaucracy, brilliantly presented by Joss Ackland this kind of role.) A key character (and I write this as a remake of body tyrant invasion is presented on BBC1) is the character of Donald Sutherland "Mikhail Fetisov." His quiet support by Burakov is steady. And he's headed for Perestroika and leads the FBI's involvement for profiling. Brilliant. <br /> <br /> This is a necessity for me.
