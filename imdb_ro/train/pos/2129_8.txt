Dramatic / romantic comedy about Stewart and Sullavan writing letters of love to each other without knowing who else is. Of course, they work together and can not sit together. You can guess the rest. It is very beautiful acting the entire cast (especially Sullavan, Stewart and Frank Morgan), has a smart, intelligent script and looks absolutely amazing. It takes place in Budapest and was shot at Hollywood, but I found myself thinking of seeing Budapest! Everything looks so perfect and dream. A movie of a kind. Do not miss!
