This show is about three little girls. (D.J., Stephanie and Michelle) Their mother is killed by a drunk driver, so their father Danny invites his brother-in-law (Jesse) and his old friend (Joey). So the whole show is about living. Girls go through the troubles of life and have life lessons. They develop sweets, lovers, and more. The whole issue is basically going to go with the flow. You do not have to keep some nonsense that you just have to let them go. I think this show is very good and fun to watch. I slept by looking at this show and still watching it today. I'm glad they're still broadcasting on TV. I follow him almost every day. I will note 10/10.
