The first time I saw this movie in the theater at a foreign film festival, I thought it was an interesting, fascinating, bi-sexual sensible artist. So, very European, so very Dutch! I recently rented it for a second view, and I could hardly laugh at the exaggerated theme of the mad writer with a complex of sexually oriented religious persecution. To master! This guy's a freeloader, lived outside society. I guess the real reason why these fantastic nightmares are about the spiderwoman is that his guilty complex hits after a year of ignoring the mom's advice to get into cars (and in bed) with strangers! Not only does it make scandalous amounts of prey (perhaps untaxed) to make stories (guilty trips), but it is too cheap to pay for a hair cut, hence hustles the beauty salon owner. Then she has the nerves to complain about the bill! But I also suspect that the world has changed a lot since this movie was made. On a serious note, it was fun to see some of Jan de Bont's chamber work and one of Paul Verhoeven's previous films. Hmmm, maybe the world has not changed so much, after all?
