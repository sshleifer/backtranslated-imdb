Club 700 offers a great insight into global events. Some described him as disingenuous or cheesy. I think the program is informative and inspired. It is normal for many to throw mud in a program that has proven to be so successful. There are very few shows that can indicate a 40-year record of success in the TV world, and The 700 Club is one of them. While Mr Robertson would be wrong to say that someone should be murdered, I find it curious that so many people will literally move over themselves to rise to the critical line. I have certainly said some crazy things in my life. I would certainly be willing to forgive Mr. Robertson since he's doing a great show.
