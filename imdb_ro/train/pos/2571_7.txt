Arrrrrghghhhhhh, some people take life too seriously! Watch this movie for what it is, sit back, relax and make a chicot. The film is not taken seriously, so we do not have to. If you like James Belushi, you will love this movie. If it is not a cup of tea - give me a wish. I like James Belushi, so I liked this movie. So simple, is not it? :-)
