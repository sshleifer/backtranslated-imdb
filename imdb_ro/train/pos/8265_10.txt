Just the name of this movie made me want to see what was going on, so I recorded this movie in the early hours of the AM. If you ever wanted to see what the miners had to do in the first few days and really see a dramatic scene when the mine collapses on men. This film wants to prove that Germany and France can work together and be friends after the First World War and how the Germans came to help the French miners to the French's unbelief. The actors were remarkable, with unusual scenes in the hand with a horse and a little boy who worked in the mine. There is an old old miner who retreats to lower his hand on the ladder when the elevator breaks. If you are a true film director, this is a movie you do not want to miss.
