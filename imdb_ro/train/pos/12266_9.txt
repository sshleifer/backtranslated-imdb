Imagine that I was about to lose this great cultural event at the Swedish TV station last night, and only because my girlfriend insisted on keeping the TV (to make it easier to fall asleep!) That I came across him he saw ever an announcement about it, but of course he forgot about him and looked forward to an "early night" ...). However - certainly it would be a rather unusual idea - to base a documentary on an interview with the sound more than 30 years ago. But with animation materials and other documentary material, a very good and witty portrait of one of the most appreciated 20th century literary artists - Georges Remy, also known as Hergé - is added. Of course I will read Tintin's albums with a different eye after seeing this film, making it easier to connect the variations in style and content to the different periods of Hergé's life (and I can tell you that I will get as few as possible did not have them). Of course, my perception of the albums has changed over the past 25 years that I have already read, and my opinion about what albums my favorites are, but this adds (at least) a new dimension.
