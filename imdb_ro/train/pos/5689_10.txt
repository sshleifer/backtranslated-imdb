First of all, this is a review of the two sets of discs that were accompanied by the DVD rental "Wonderland". The two films included rental, "Wonderland" and the documentary of Johnny Wadd, the myth created by "Boogie Nights". This myth being that the characters involved in the adult film trade were far more than the weak people who were doing something for money, in principle denying that they were nothing more than detestable suffering. This is amazingly similar to what the "Wiseguy" and "Goodfellas" made to fable "The Godfather" and most of the rest of the gangster romantic lore. Now, what irritated me most watching these movies and probably irk anyone who saw it liked "Boogie Nights" is how mad and naive presumed educated and sophisticated people can be. "Dirk Diggler" in "Boogie Nights" is undoubtedly John Holmes, who, unlike "Dirk Diggler", had no quality of redemption. Holmes was a criminal sociopath who abused someone close to him, was totally consumed by his self-satisfaction, and was undoubtedly a key participant in brutal murder on Wonderland Avenue in Los Angeles in 1981. The film reveals the great the lie was "Boogie Nights" and strengthens Linda Lovelace's description of the crude and pathetic business, known as the adult entertainment industry. This should be required for viewing, both features on the DVD "Wonderland", for anyone who has positive views on the movie "Boogie Nights".
