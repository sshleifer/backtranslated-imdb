I came across this film on the cable and I was completely excited. The story of a group of surfers crossing the great waves, waves that are monstrous, waves that would make any rational person run into terror is one that manages to be spectacular and makes you understand why people spend their lives looking for waves . There is nothing special about the film, other than bringing in very interested people who are in love with what they are doing and allow them to talk. Sure there are surfing scenes, but what makes this film so special is the people. Here's a bunch of boys who are so excited about what they're doing, that they're going to the people they're watching. Halfway through this movie, you'll want to go out and learn to navigate on it too. Some documentaries have managed to overwhelm the passion these people have and their ability to make us feel that this movie makes a wonderful movie. See this.
