This is an intelligent drama about living in a detonated Texas toner in the early 1980s. John Travolta and Debra Winger have two very credible performances like Bud and Sissy Davis. This film really opens the country music scene and helped introduce America into the bull. If you like a good romance movie, then you like this movie.
