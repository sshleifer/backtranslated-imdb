Before I start, I should point out that I know the editor of this film. We never met, but we belong to the same fanzine (those things that came before the messages) and I spoke on the phone, so I have a bias here. However, it is ironic how while the "Rat Pack" culture of the late '50s and early' 60s in the mid-1960s made a comeback in the mid-1990s, this film, from his son's original Rat pack, and was done in a similar way, it was a flop. Not only was it a critical flop; I think Peter Travers of Rolling Stone was the only one who did not save this (he gave me a mixed review, as I remember). And while I do not think this is the biggest film in the world and I'm not a fan of Rat, or a "cocktail" culture, I think it's worth seeing it. First, this looks elegant and moves along. For another, the basic performance is good. Richard Dreyfus is surprisingly remembered here as the head gangster who returns from a sanitarium and has a marginal edge. Jeff Goldblum returns to the ironic performances he made in his pre-blockbuster days, like THE BIG CHILL. And while Ellen Barkin just has to vamp the movie, she does it fun. Of course, it's not a great movie; the dialogue is mostly made up of word games and many of them do not work (like the entire Zen of Ben discourse). And Gabriel Byrne and Kyle MacLachlan are terrible here. Still, I was having fun, and if you like gangster movies, you might as well be.
