David Burton (Richard Chamberlain, good enough) is a lawyer who is more capable of taxing profits (... and suffers from unusual dreams that bother him to see this aboriginal man, shrouded in darkness) who is called to take a case regarding a group of aborigines accused of killing one of their Billy names .. we see that they are trying to steal stones with ritual painting on them and are killed when a leader of an aboriginal tribe called Charlie (Nandjiwarra Amagula) uses a "dead bone" to stop his heart. Meanwhile, while spinning around David, bizarre meteorological patterns influence Sydney, such as rain polluting polluted dirt and rock-like hail in the brilliant blue sky (no clouds, such as the one that hits a school in center of Australia), a "deformed" rainbow that is divided (!) into groups. When David follows the case, he finds that he is much closer to the strange events that happen than he might realize. An aboriginal named Chris (David Gulpilil) appears in a dream that has a bloodstone and finds out that this man is one of those he has to represent in the process! He discovers that it is possible, after strange encounters with Charlie and conversations with Chris, that he might well be linked to a spirit called the Mulkur, and that his dreams are real premonitions of the possible horrors to come. /> Absorption of apocalyptic drama builds his methodical story and is completely original and unpredictable. With Peter Weir, the movie is visually obscure when we see these overwhelming images of a possible civilization defect, but the film's most convincing angle is certainly David's journey to find the monumental truth that strikes him, ask Charlie and Chris countless at first to help his people descend from a crime they have not committed, and finally find out what has to do with something catastrophic that appears or could occur later.
