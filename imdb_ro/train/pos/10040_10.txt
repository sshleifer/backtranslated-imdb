For me personally this movie goes to my top four of all time. No exceptions. James Cameron turned out to be a master narrator from time to time. With films such as Aliens, The Abyss, and both Terminators, it is clear that he was a brilliant and confident director of action and science fiction. He sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film. But the Titanic is so different from other shots. The film moves exceptionally and offers space for surprises, stage development and interesting character developments in a story everyone knows. The story of the famous sailboat who sinks on his spring trip is legendary, so Cameron made a challenge to make a real, exciting, fun movie about it. The actress is wonderful that Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Jack and Kate Winslet who plays Rose has become superstar overnight with the release of this film and in most films I bother when the characters who support him do not get much to do except in this movie is more intentional because, as the story of an elderly person Rose (Gloria Stuart) tells, it is obvious that the story of Rose and Jack is the only one, no one else. From an emotional point of view, it is really satisfying and can not leave a dry eye in a theater or home. Music has become iconic and legendary. It is the best soundtrack of composer James Horner and evokes so much of the film and audience. The song has become annoying for so long, but I still appreciate it for the phenomenon it represents for this film. Only a problem, James Cameron's common problem, is the dialogue that is memorable, but in a bad way as in the way it is weird to points, but everything is aside. James Cameron has made a masterpiece and romantic epic that escapes you on a journey of a lifetime. My heart will not continue from that.
