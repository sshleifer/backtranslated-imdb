Such a masterpiece as the first of these two Snowy River films was the sequel to The Man From Snowy River, which should be the next. It does not move on the fingers of its predecessor, preferring to leave the legend that was the first live film in a unique immortality. The man in the river's second snow relies on Jim Craig's return to Snowy River after a three-year absence. The subtle film tells the story of the nineteenth-century change, Australian history, legend, and horses. The story demonstrates Hollywood's touch in lighter shades, an absolutely absent appearance in the first film, but this uniquely blends with a distinct sense of Australian patriotism. The land is much more vibrant than the first film, and more spectacular, with particular aspects of the earlier film incorporated, yet the man in the Snowy River II possesses every essential feature of the first film; sensationally beautiful cinema, a stunning highlight of the Australian High Country, the second most impressive record of ever-trained horses, and a fantastic and deeply moving soundtrack by Bruce Rowland, who is the first in all respects. Geoff Burrowes has done a great job with this film and is very worthy of recognition, especially with regard to the quality of the Australian film industry. The lead contest, from Tom Burlinson to Sigrid Thornton and a well-replaced Brian Dennehy, removes his tracks with so much passion and distinction as the first film. As for the sequels, "The Man From Snowy River II" is a masterpiece; a profoundly moving and inspired experience once again.
