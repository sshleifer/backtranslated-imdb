A great suspense movie with an extraordinary slow camcorder that adds drama to this makes you look and enjoy. Director Brian de Palma makes a super-Hitchcock imitation (called many "ripoffs") with this movie, and the 2.35: 1 wide-screen DVD is a must to fully appreciate camera work (and more scenes with people Hidden on Everyone Lost on Cassettes Formed For Television). The downside of the film, at least for anyone who has a kind of moral standard, is the general character of all the characters, including a policeman played by a pre-NYPD Dennis Franz (who has hair here!). <br /> <br /> The opening scene is still shocking, with a fairly long scene by Angie Dickinson, which is quite explicit, even 25 years after its launch. The film has several erotic scenes in it, while Dickinson (if it is really close to him) and Nancy Allen are not shy about showing their bodies. There is not much dialogue in the first 20 minutes and no bad language until Franz gets in the picture after the crime. The first 36 minutes are riveted, and although it is obvious who the killer is, it's still a good suspense and fun to follow all the way, especially for men who mirror naked women.
