Probably Jackie Chan's best film from the 1980s and the one who put him on the map. The scale of this self-directed police drama is evident from the opening and closing scenes, during which a village and a shopping center are demolished. There are obviously differences between the original Chinese versions and the English versions, with many jokes that fail to head to the latter. The latter is also impeded by stars that did not sound like their Chinese originals. In fact, the only thing that dubbing has been corrected is tribunal? At that time, attempts in colonial Hong Kong were performed in English, while the original has this scene in Cantonese! However, Chan's fighting style and martial arts choreography inject humor wherever possible, so the non-Cantonese audience does not miss too much. It is not, after all, the dialogue that makes a Chan movement, but the action and the pain. The story is easy to watch: Chan plays an unbeatable detective in Hong Kong, pursuing a gangland suitor (Cho Yeun) and appointed to protect a witness (Brigitte Lin). The action is superb from start to finish and there is not much time to breathe between them. You will never think, but a fun and tight film together. It can be said that this is one of the best martial arts movies out there.
