The Hanson-Andy brothers (apparently taking their act together) and Hank (obviously not having an act together) need money. Andy comes up with a scheme to get some dough that will have consequences for the entire Hanson family. This movie offers. This is a roller coaster ride full of blood-filled blood that knows exactly what it is doing. As a murder drama / thriller, I would be happy to compare it with "No Country for the Elderly". While both movies have a lot of dramas of characters and emotions, "Devil" is more on the thriller side due to its rapid rhythm. "No Country" is a cooler and thinner movie you can truly admire, while "Devil" is a bit more enjoyable. There is certainly less violence in the "devil" than "no country". The actor also delivers. Ethan Hawke, sometimes made of wood in the past, brings jigglers, sweat and deer lights - in front of the giant Hank. Philip Seymour Hoffman, as Andy, has the heaviest scenes of the movie and quickly becomes the actor who think he can do anything. In fact, it's not too bad with this movie. He jumps back and forth without being confused. Spiral events are out of control, but the movie never does - the writing (from Kelly Masterson's first stopwatch), the director (veteran Sidney Lumet) and editing remain as tall as a drum. In many categories, this is a matter of calibrating the prize, although movies such as "The Departed" and "No Country" have gathered it outside the spotlight. If you liked these, you'd love that.
