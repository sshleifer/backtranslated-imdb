Chris and Andre are two ordinary teenagers. Misunderstood by some and selected by others. But I sit together and everyone will pay. Together they form the "Army of the Two". They plan and plan the Zero Day. That day is when they decide to face high school and inevitably kill 14 cold-blooded men. The story on the bands that "Zero Day" made is just a fictional story of the Columbine tragedy. Zero Day is one of those movies that will make you head afterwards. The two main actors (Calvin Robertson and Andre Keuck) do a job so good that their characters seem to be almost any teenage girl dismantled by the street. Their performances were very credible, they enjoyed these guys very much and that was scary. Filled almost entirely from the perspective of teen, Zero Day feels very real and authentic, as if you were there. These children try to rationalize their actions on the viewer, and the actors sell it. But you have to be warned that it does not pull the tragedy from beginning to end and that the end is shocking and anxious for some.
