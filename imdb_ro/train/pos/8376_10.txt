One of the best movies out there. Yes, the cinema was not the biggest, but a great plot and concept. Great for time and brilliant and creative ideas. Something different from ordinary movies and enjoyable fun. One of my favorites and would recommend everyone who likes creative and imaginative movies. Post World War 3 and fighting in giant robots, actors have done great performance and have done everything worth the time. The sets are not amazing but simple and have worked for the overall look of the movie. This movie is very hard to find on DVD but also on VHS. Check him out because I loved him since he left. It's not a mainstream movie and not everything you've ever seen. Take a look and think like a child. It's a wonderful and fun view.
