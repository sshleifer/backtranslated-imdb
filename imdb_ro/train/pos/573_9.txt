I always enjoyed movies that describe life as such. Life has sometimes boring patches, no real plot, and not necessarily a happy ending. River Run Through It is the perfect name for this movie (and Norman Maclean's novel). Life fails and flows like a river and has rough spots, but it's a wonderful trip. Robert Redford brings a lot to the movie. His narrative has a friendly sense that perfectly matches the image. As a director, he is retained and calm and captures some incredibly beautiful scenes. As for acting, Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt work surprisingly also as brothers. I do not know how to describe the performance of Tom Skerritt and Brenda Blethyn, except that they really feel real. "The river passes through it" is a wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> 8.6 out of 10
