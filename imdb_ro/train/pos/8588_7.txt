It may not be the best movie in 2006, but it was just a movie to encourage and think. The Sentinel is a good political thriller film that looks similar or even borrows some elements from other political thriller films such as In The Line of Fire and Manchurian Candidate. The film's basic film is similar to other films like this: A plot for killing the President of the United States. Michael Douglas plays the role of secret service officer, Pete Garrison, who launches the operation just to find out later that he was framed. Kiefer Sutherland collaborates as a rival with David Breckinridge and Eva Longoria as Jill Marin, who is a rookie agent under the guidance of Breckinridge and Academy Award winner Kim Basinger as first lady Sarah Ballentine. An improvement for this movie could have been more action, as some sources considered as much an action movie as a Thriller movie, but a good thing about this film is instead an assassination plot for killing the US president. refers to a mole (traitor) from the secret service, who leads the president in the wrong direction.
