"Everybody laughs" is one of those little movies I always recommend to friends looking for something unusual. It is firmly rooted in the past traditions of love, but seems more contemporary. Even the decisive atmosphere of the 80's is not too much to meet. Bogdanovic keeps wisely the whole enterprise so light on his feet that reality never makes him fall on the ground. But, saying, this type of sweet film is based on actors to keep it, and "TAL" is blessed with a cast of dreams that understand the requirements of this type of story. It's a movie that would not be so memorized if it was not for the short moments of excellent distribution: Colleen Camp's orders shouting simultaneously at John Ritter and the dog; Blaine Novak unleashes all his hair under his hat; and especially when Dorothy Stratten falls for John Ritter and says, "How ... weird." It's a piece of puff that does not want to let them too much afraid to crush it, but it certainly leaves one with a light heart and a smile on its face.
