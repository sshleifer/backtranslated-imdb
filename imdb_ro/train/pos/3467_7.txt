I still wonder why I watched this movie. Of course, before we saw this movie, we did not know anything about battles. We did not even know all their names! All I knew was that they had a lot of fans, they had some albums that some of them claim to be the biggest ones ever, they broke up, John married Yoko Ono and John was killed. VH1 is not really my favorite music station, it's MTV. However, for one reason or another, I decided to pursue it, without waiting too long. Surprisingly, I really enjoyed it! The dialogue has been written and treated very well in the light of a slight disaster. This is very important, because John's and Paul's talk is pretty much the entire movie, though they are being pulled from the outside to explore more possibilities and to be able to follow you. Jared Harris and Adien Quinn perform well in general. The end was also very smart. I liked how the movie is moving about the performance of SNL, then it snaps over your head and makes you realize that it would be better if they let him go and finish it on a good note. My favorite moment is probably the scene on the roof. <br /> <br /> In general, I recommend this movie to almost everyone. It is a great way to solve your curiosity about what might have happened if, six years after the collapse, Paul appeared at the door of John. Which is probably the main reason for my movie to watch this movie, solving my curiosity about who the beats were really and what might have happened to her after parting.
