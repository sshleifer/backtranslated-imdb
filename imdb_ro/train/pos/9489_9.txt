I'm not tired of saying that this is one of the best political thrillers ever made. The story takes place in a fictional state, but obviously deals with Kennedy's killing. A lawyer in the honest district (honored by Yves Montand) does not think the murder was planned and executed by a single Daslow man (= Oswald) and although all other officials want to close the case he continues to investigate with his team. br /> <br /> The script is written tightly and quickly and keeps tension until the end. Only the part dealing with the Milgram experiment about the authorities is (though not uninteresting) a little less room. The final sequence - explaining who really is Icarus - shot partially at a slow pace and intensified by a soundtrack Morricone is the most powerful sequence I've ever seen in a movie.
