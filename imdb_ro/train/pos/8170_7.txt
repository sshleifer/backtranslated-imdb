As if most people had not already had an insulting outlook on the field of dentistry, this little movie will make sure that the paranoid patients are twisting. A successful dental hygienist confesses that his wife descends to the pool man (on their everyday anniversary!) And he does a lot in an angry breakdown. After pulling the attack dog's head, he walks on the job and ends up with marital aggression on the patients, planning to do what he needs to do with his wife's "asshole." There are lots of shots-up-close mouth-jabbing, cutting the tongue, and queen beauty queen, as well as a wonderful show disturbed by Corbin Bernsen. The scene in which she binds and sinks her wife before she forces her toothless is certainly hard to follow. A dentist is absolutely the wrong person to get out of the deepest end and this film explains this in detail. The "dentist" is incredibly fun, fast-paced and sometimes funny. Check it out!
