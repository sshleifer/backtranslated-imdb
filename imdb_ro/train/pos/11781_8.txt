The documentary presents an original theory of "Guns, Germs and Steel". The graphic series presents several episodes that strongly support the theory and defend the theory against common criticism. I was deeply surprised to find comments from users complaining about the lack of new information in these series. They say the documentary presents information that is taught at the middle school. Indeed, it is. In fact, I enjoyed the original look of the information I learned from the middle school and the unexpected analysis. So if you like to know why things work, if you took your phone out trying to determine how it worked, if you went to the farm to see how farms work and how the cows are eating, you will enjoy this series. A final recommendation.
