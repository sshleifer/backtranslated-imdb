The question of whether or not you like this version of "The Train Ghost" depends invariably on one thing and one thing: your reaction to Arthur Askey's performance. He tends to steal almost every scene is in, and not always in a good way. Sometimes you wanted to sit down or come back a little to allow many plot characters to appear and develop (what they do to some extent). But somehow everything goes on toward Askey's Tommy Gander character. Personally I liked the movie, and even as Askey to a degree. It always seems to me that I plunge it in the vcr in those weird hours of early morning when I can not sleep and I really can not find the energy to follow something else. There is something about watching old b / w movies in the quiet darkness of pre-dawn that seems appealing to me ....
