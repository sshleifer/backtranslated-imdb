This is a series of cartoons where most of the action takes place in the human body where the actors are vitamins, viruses, blood cells, etc. I will not try to explain this in more detail, you just have to see it for you I will not be disappointed. I remember seeing this as a child in the 80's (with a Swedish voice). I talked to some people who were also children in the 80's and they also liked it! I have to admit that the educational part of the episodes did not come to me at a conscious level, but the idea of ​​educating children while having fun is wonderful. I have recently seen a few episodes; there is a humor and a heart in it, which is hard to find in other children's programs today. <br /> <br /> 5/5
