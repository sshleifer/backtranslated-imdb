In the sea of ​​nonsense that Hollywood (and others) continue to extinguish, it is one of those rough diamonds. A small and simple film that is very fun and leaves you feeling that you have not lost just an hour and a half of your life. Ashley Judd is really amazing in this movie. I've never been a fan or I've noticed it before, but coming back and seeing her early performance, she convinced me she was extremely talented. Watching this movie was a college course for me, so I was skeptical, I really cared. I thought, "Oh, boy, a chic moving move or a male feminist who indie indie ..." I was pleasantly surprised. Without analyzing the many relevant topics, I will say, if you have not seen it, do yourself a favor and check it out. Sometimes "down-to-earth", "slice-of-life" movies are the best, and this is a great one.
