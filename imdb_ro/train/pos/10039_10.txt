Titanic is a classic. I was really surprised that this film did not have ten solids in the overall IMDb users ranking. Perhaps it's good not to grant Titanic credits nowadays, but when it was first made, it really was something. When the movie came out, people gathered at theaters. When the sister came out on the video and I'll forget it twice a day for a month. It was safe to say that I was obsessed for good reason. Some of disaster scenes were hard to forget, such as frozen or type child who committed suicide after killing someone in the crowd miserable. Many people have died on that ship, and it's a difficult challenge for James Cameron to convey to the film with the immediacy and emotion he needs. And let's not forget the amazing romance between Jack and Rose. Whether their relationship was a fiction of one's imagination, it was wonderful. They barely knew each other, but they would die for each other. They had mutual trust. They're sure they give Romeo and Juliet a way for their money. - I will never give up, Jack. Titanic is a great movie to its base. It's a storyline story told by brilliant action, great cinema, beautiful music, and a crew full of dedicated and dedicated workers. I really mind my mind when someone says I hate this movie.
