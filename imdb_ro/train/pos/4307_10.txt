Well, maybe not immediately before Rodney King's riots, but even a few months ago it was quite timely. My parents said they saw her the next thing you know, the police got paid and LA was burned down. It just goes to show the state of racial relations in America. The plot has white Mack (Kevin Kline) and African-American Simon (Danny Glover) becoming friends after Simon rescues Mack's life in the black ghetto. Meanwhile, the producer of Davis movies (Steve Martin in a serious role) thinks that free violence is very good ... until he gets shot. There is also a certain existentialism in the film: Mack and his family come to realize that they do not live the way they really want. It seems that "Crash" has a relatively renewed interest in racial relations, but it came out much earlier. Perhaps we will never be able to have stable racial relations in this country. But anyway, Grand Canyon is a great movie. Kevin Kline says as my favorite actor. They also starred Mary McDonnell, Mary-Louise Parker and Alfre Woodard.
