Like the Arab nights, this film plays stories convention to make us feel that there is a plot, a plot, and another plot: it opens with what appears to be the blind device of a blind man telling the story of his life, then it squeaks into a flashback that leads directly to the presence of the blind man, where we discover that about half of the story is still to blame. (We must admit that the second half does not fully respect the promise of the first.) Like the Arab Nights, they try to collect as many Middle Eastern folk motifs in one paper. A liberated baby, a beautiful princess, a flying rug, fantastic mechanical toys, sea voyages, a crowded market, a bad visitor, jewelery ... I do not know why everything works, but not. Everything is just as beautiful. The sets are beautiful. Jun Duprez is beautiful. Rozsa's score is particularly beautiful. As usual, it sounds like Hungarian; but he somehow manages to convince us that he is Hungarian in a Persian way.
