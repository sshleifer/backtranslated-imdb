The Scorpio tail is a very elegant giallo, directed by Sergio Martino, who seems to be a second giallo master only Dario Argento. Ernesto Gastaldi wrote this fabulous cine-dunnit, rather complex, but ultimately very satisfying and fun murder mystery. It also makes a big difference, because it is not always the case of these giallo, because they tend to stretch their credibility with their red lusts and final solutions. Here, the less you know about the intrigue, the better. The pure giallo marks here are beautiful cinema, catchy musical score, gorgeous feminine (Anita Strindberg is a goddess), brutal killings, black killing in bags and explicit sex scenes to name a few. In most parts is acting decent, Goerge Hilton's usually suave self and others do pretty well. Martino walks with a safe hand, keeps things tight and atmospheric with some terrifying pieces. If you're a giallo fan, you have to see that. If you like thrillers well written and suspense, in general, this is highly recommended.
