A sharp and well-documented documentary, focusing on the Mardi Gras beads. I have always liked this approach to filming - communicating ideas about a wider, more complex phenomenon and often inscrutable by breaking the issue into something familiar and close to home. I'm sure most people have heard stories about souls and understand the basic motives behind profit and capitalism and the effect of globalism on poorer nations (however, people feel connected with it). Rather than displaying these subjects and picking yourself up in a soap dish (not that there is nothing wrong with this, other than these documentaries commonly preached to the converts), this documentary simply shows the Mardi Gras Beads , how they are manufactured, under what conditions and then how they are used by consumers at the end of the process. She investigates openly and strongly the motivations of all those involved in the process, including workers, factory management, US importers, and finally the end-of-line consumer. I felt a little bit sick about this; also by the workers at Mardi Gras, but also by the way Chinese workers have accepted the situation as normal and par for the course (even if they have some objections to how they are managed). Finally, the images of street cleaning machines cleaning the beads on the streets made a special impression. But that was just my reaction; I can see how someone else could read this document a little differently. Unlike other documentation on this issue, I do not think you need to have any specific political opinion to be affected by this. This is ultimately a story about human beings and our relationship with the goods we produce and consume. If you ever bought a product made in the Far East, this should give you something to think. <br /> <br /> Remarkable and highly recommended. You have to see more documentaries like this. Kudos to all those involved in making this film.
