A lot of information to digest, and if you saw Zizek, you know his rhythm. Also, if you have not seen most movies or at least some other films of the same directors mentioned in this document, you will be somewhat lost. <br /> <br /> And the list of movies is long. The director includes Hitchcock (Psycho, Vertigo, Birds), Lynch (Lost Highway, Mullholland Falls, Wild in Heart, Blue Velvet), Tarkovsky (Stalker, Solaris) and Conversation (Coppola) Segway Movies, Star Wars: Espisode III, Matrix .. but they suspect they are baits. Of course, Zizek is never boring, but if you do not buy (or disturb you) psychology then you will be upset. <br /> <br /> But you should not be, like setting, clips, the way the movie interferes with these clips, Zizek's points are never boring.
