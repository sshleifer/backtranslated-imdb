This movie is a great fun to watch with your wife or girlfriend. There are laughing at the top and some wonderful stories of nudists going on here. The actress is very interesting and definitely worth looking into her natural beauty. Life on the beach of Maslin is full of various nudists and types of personalities. The Australian coastal landscape is simply splendid to see. What place to visit, at least, and someday can become my hiding place. I like this movie very much and every time I watch it, I like it more. I would love to see more of these characters and I always wonder what happened to them. Although the plot is somewhat soft, this film is, of course, a great excuse to sit on the couch and enjoy the wonderful and famous Maslin Beach with these wonderful nudists and their own personal stories.
