Any true fighter fan should consider this Wrestlemania to be one of, if not the best of all time. It was filled with emotions and surprises. One of the greatest matches of all time was between Shawn Michaels and Steve Austin, with a special guest Mike Tyson. The show that Michaels pushed him was incredible, especially given the shape he had in the back and that was his last match.
