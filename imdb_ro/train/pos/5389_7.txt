As a very primitive episode of the "General Hospital" established in a native section (and one for harsh cases), this fast-moving programmer has a satisfying emotional impact - mainly because Eric Linden, as a young man distracted in the plot the main thing is so thrilling, and for such good reason. His expecting wife, Loretta Young, is brought to the gym at the beginning of a 20-year prison sentence for a lechery offense that probably came to him; Mrs. Young, as always, does nothing to disadvantage the public's sympathy, and it's a little too good to be true, though nice and wonderful to look at, of course. Her difficult tasks and relationships with other girls in the section form the heart of the film, and the result - not a happy one - feels good. Aline MacMahon, "One of the Perfect Cinematic Actresses", in the acclaimed words of film historian David Thomson, emanates warmth and authority as a nurse, and Glenda Farrell, as a new mother of twins, crown "Frankie and Johnny" as a song drunk. Frank McHugh appears in another subplot and he shows more distance than he usually allowed Warners. She was scaled and modestly paced, and Panic Linden waited for my father to stay with you for days - this kind of part was often played for laugh but he is a young child terrified of problems and very convincing.
