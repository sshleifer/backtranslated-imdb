Nothing is more pleasant to me than a story that tells you or suspense that keeps you guessing everything about how it will end up. And that's exactly what's happening in DEATHTRAP, based on Ira Levin's cool play ("Baby Rosemary"). And in it, MICHAEL CAINE and CHRISTOPHER REEVE end up making the kind of stunt that Caine and Laurence Olivier drew in SLEUTH - with as much skill and more puzzles as any extraordinarily intelligent game. But because it is meant to scare you, it surprises you and keeps you guessing about the outcome, it is difficult to write a review about the plot. Let's just say that what we know at first is all you need to know about the movie right now. MICHAEL CAINE is a jealous insulting playwright, whose last piece has failed to be miserable. When a young aspiring writer CHRISTOPHER REEVE sends the manuscript of his play, Caine realizes that passing it like his would solve all his problems and bring his reputation. Since then, it is a matter of fun and gaming for the public, as Ira Levin's story unfolds, managing to attract Agatha Christie for the number of twists and turns. Caine and Reeve play each brilliant, each provoking a certain dynamic story tension, as well as some humorous touches that come from a script that links dramatic humor. Summary: Well worth seeing - but not everyone is happy with the end.
