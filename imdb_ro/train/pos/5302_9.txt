This movie always kept me entertained. Compared to the serious mother, Mr. Waters turned back to his gross part. This is not as polished. <br /> <br /> There is a dark side here. A message about how success and fame change a person - but more importantly how people around you change. There is no fake moment in this movie. <br /> <br /> The characters are somewhat cartoon ... but I want to think that is what Mr. Waters wants to accomplish. It's fascinating to look at how Mr. Waters evolved ... This is really the best work.
