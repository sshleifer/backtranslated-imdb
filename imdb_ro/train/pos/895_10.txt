I saw this movie. This movie is best suited to the need today. Dowry in marriage is the biggest problem nowadays. In affirming this problem this movie is the best. In this film, Indian values ​​are being declared very well. Young people today need to understand this problem. There is a smaller population of girls. And because of this dowry problem, the girls committed suicide. If this problem continues, then the day when there is no child girl is not far away. So, taking this into account, today's young people need to understand that we can not take the dowry in marriage. We must learn from this film that dowry should not be taken. And if we understand this, then we can see the new trend in society. This is the major change in society.
