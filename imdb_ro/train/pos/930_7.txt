I'm sure most people already know the story - Ebenezer Scrooge, who is miserable, receives a visit from three spirits ("The Ghosts of the Christmas Present, Present and Still Coming") that highlights parts of his life, hoping to save his soul and to change his ways. Dickens's classic story, in one form or another, has been the test of time to become a favorite favorite of the holiday. While I grew up, I saw the 1951 version with Alastair Sims and I think he's definitely Scrooge, I was impressed with this version, which was released when I was in high school. George C. Scott plays a compelling and understandable Ebenezer Scrooge, and actors playing ghosts are quite frightening and threatening. David Warner is a good Bob Cratchit, too. This version is nicely filmed and uses many modern movie styles (for the 1980s) that make it more enjoyable to children than the 1951 black and white version. This is a worthy adaptation and is one that I look at almost every year at a time in the Christmas season.
