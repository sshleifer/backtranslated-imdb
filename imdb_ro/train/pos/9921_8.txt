I've been an admirer of Edward Burtynsky's work for years and it's been a pleasure to see the man at work thanks to Jennifer Baichwal's documentary. Serious beauty of the Bangladesh craft court, the Vermont stone quarry, the enormous assembly facility in China, the old Shanghai districts waiting to be broken: these landscapes are captured so well by the photographer and the director. Sometimes I've been thinking about the old TV documentaries about abandoned coal mines and plastic molds; the kind of things I grew up. Burtynsky's business has the great merit of highlighting how industrial activity moved to Asia alone, it did not stop. The strangest scene for me was the computer yard somewhere in China - the waste had a threatening air, and the workers were very jovial.
