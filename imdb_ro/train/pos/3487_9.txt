Wrestlemania 14 is not often seen as one of the best Wrestlemania, but I would personally say in my top 5 if not the top 3. It has so many wonderful things and really meant the birth of the Age of Attitude, it was WWE's the best era, in my opinion. HBK has a lion's heart, and putting it on Austin, as he did, on his way out, was a pure class on his part. She has one of the hottest crowds you'll ever see and has J.R and The King at the best ad! <br /> <br /> Matches. <br /> <br /> 15 ?? royal fighting team LOUD pop for returning L.O.D. I'm not a fan of the royal fight, and that's still an average. Very predictable, even when you see it for the first time, it is obvious that L.O.D would win. Looking at the Sunny for another 8 minutes, however, it certainly helps. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> So get a surprising pop with his input. Fast, full of high and very interesting. If those two were to have more time, the roof would be broken with their stuff. Taka wins with Michinoku driver. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> The European WWF Championship. <br /> <br /> Triple H | C | Vs Owen Hart Stipulation here, Chyna is tamed at Slaughter. Beautiful pop for Owen, mixed travel response. A really, really undervalued game, which is one of my favorite Wrestlemania, in fact. The two mixed up very well, and Owen can go with anyone. Trips win, with Chyna interference. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> Goldust & Luna. Defining pop for Sable, unheard of at that time, for woman. Sable really looks hot, and the crowd is just eat it! The songs of Constant Sable, which erupts almost every time they enter the ring. It's not bad for a mixed label match, it's fun and it's fine. Sable's team wins when Sable hits TKO. <br /> <br /> Intercontinental WWF Championship 2 1/2/5 <br /> <br /> Ken Shamrock Against Rock | C |. Before examining the match, I would like to notarize that Rock has shown her tremendous potential with her interview with Jennifer Flowers before her match. Beautiful pop for Shamrock, great heat for Rock. Too a little disappointingly short, and I thought the conclusion was bad, though Shamrock's ancestor was great to see, and the crowd went unexpectedly. Rock keeps the title when The Ref reverses the decision. <br /> <br /> The Dumpster match for the WWF Tag Team Championship <br /> <br /> The Jacks & Terry Funk Vs The New Age. Prosecutors have not finished, as they will at this time. The crowd is actually somewhat dead for that, but I thought it had some Hardcore bits with some bumps. Cactus and Terry win the titles in the end. <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> Big time, for The Undertaker. Much better than Wrestlemania 20, and for a great match against a big man, this was really good. It was a great kiss, and The Undertaker took a bad beat through the table. WWE was smart, making Kane look strong, even through defeat. After two end-of-cuts, Taker finally leaves the third. 3/2/5 <br /> <br /> WWF Championship. <br /> <br /> Special Enforcer Guest <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> HBK | C | With Steve Austin. Great heat for Tyson. The crowd goes for Austin, certainly one of the biggest pops I've ever heard. Mixed reaction for HBK. This is really a special match, one of the biggest main events of wrestlemania in history, you can say when J.R is even breathless. HBK offers everything in what should have been his last match, and Austin was rarely better. The animosity and electricity from the crowd are stunning and are just as exciting as those you've achieved. Austin wins with stunning, and Tyson joins 3:16 by hitting Michaels. Austin's Victoria is a miracle you can look at, with one of the most common crowds you'll ever see, the king told me it's good that they were mad. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line. Wrestlemania 14 is one of the biggest for reality. He has everything you want in a Wrestlemania, and he really started the Attitude. This is very special to me, because it was the first Wrestlemania I've ever seen, back in 98. "It was Austin, it started!" 9 1/2 / 10
