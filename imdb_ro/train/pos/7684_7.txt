Reading all comments is very interesting. but can someone please tell me the name of the real artist who painted the pictures for the good time broadcast. I realize that everyone is referring to j.j. as a family artist, but there was a true family with the true artist, and he still has no credit in this regard. So, if you do not mind if someone can tell the name of the real artist, I would also like to tell him "a good job." I know that this view is for the "GOOD TIMES" casting, but you would not agree that it also touched everyone's hearts. I'd like to know if he's still painting or still living. I'd like to show some of my work in my house.
