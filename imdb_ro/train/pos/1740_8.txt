This film has not been promoted so much here in Greece, even if it had good actors, a great script and a pretty good shot was not a so-called "blockbuster" movie in my country. The film itself is very strong, it is the hard time a newcomer must pass when he returns to his home village after being released from a fifty-year prison (drugs) The end is pretty sad ... Mourikis tries to keep up with him and takes care of him quite well ... Lambropoulou is great and very sexy in a weird way and, of course, Hatzisavvas is once again near to excellence. 7 out of 10 because very few Greek films can make such an impression!
