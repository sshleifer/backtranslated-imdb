After seeing all the movies of Jesse James, Quantrill, Jayhawkers, etc. in the fifties, it's quite exciting to see this movie with a new perspective by director Ang Lee. The attack scene in Lawrence, Kansas is great. The romantic relationship between Jewel and Toby Mcguire turns out to be one of the best parts and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is remarkable as the bad guy. All the time this movie makes you feel the horror of the war and the desperate situation of the main characters who do not know whether they will survive the next few hours. It is definitely worth seeing.
