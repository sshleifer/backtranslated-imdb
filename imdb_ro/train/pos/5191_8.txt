Scott is right. The best 2-person sword on the film is in the middle of this movie. Fighting multiplayer swords are not the best, though good enough. However, the middle fight is the best compared to the Japanese samurai films. Chinese scene scenes in my opinion have never surpassed the Japanese in terms of entertainment value. Especially in scenes where a guy has to fight with a group of enemies, Japanese films excel, for example, the Lone Wolf and Cub series. Even if the Japanese movie duels take only a few seconds or a minute, the intensity of these moments makes them better. But, this is an example where the Chinese swordplay surpasses the Japanese. The scene in the middle of this movie was a five minute fight with the most amazing choreography ever. The other fights in this movie are good, but even if they sucked this movie would get a 7 for that one scene. If you have not seen it, you have to. John Woo is the man.
