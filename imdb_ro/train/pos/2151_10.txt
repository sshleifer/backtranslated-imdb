Funny. Sad. Charming. These are all the words that floated over my head while watching this beautiful, simple film. It's rare for a movie to really move me, but "Are we dancing?" he did with grace to spare him. Good humor mixed with occasional subtle agony has made it one of the best experiences of my shooting history. I let myself with a quiet feeling of joy, but with a little touch of mixed sadness. And dance, oh yes, dance. Even if you are not a lover of art or you can not put one foot in front of the other, the steps shown here will take your breath and make you sign up for hours as quickly as possible. It was absolutely delightful, even the pieces showing Sugiyama's (Koji Yakusho's) steps when they were learning to dance for the first time were wonderful in a humorous and childlike manner. Still, this film did not refer only to dance, but more to the subtleties of human behavior and feelings. We are witnesses of a shy person who learns to express her repressed feelings through dancing, a beautiful dance instructor who rediscovers her love for art and the personal growth of every member of the wonderful cast. Pain. Emotion. All the love and small agonies of life are here, expressed with the delicate feeling of a beautiful painting in Japanese watercolor combined with the emotional power and grace of culture. <br /> <br />
