First of all, I saw this movie without knowing anything about it. I only knew that Joel Schumacher did, and that was enough for me. A friend and I went to see him at a Danish film festival called night festival, which is a lot of different films, shown by hours, the festival specializes in the presentation of films that would otherwise not have been presented in the theaters Danish. /> <br /> Anyway, my boyfriend and I went to see him and we were amazed at how real he really was and really hit a cordon with our feelings, we really were caught in the plot without being able to to figure out what is a big plus in our book. The film is recorded in a style that reminds me of the Danish initiative "Dogma 95", which was initiated by 4 Danish directors, including Lars Von Trier (Dancer In Dark). In conclusion, the movie is really worth seeing as it provides a different perspective on how things were for American GI Joe coming out of school being expected to serve his country in a fight away from home. Also, Colin Farrell is exceptional in this movie I have not seen before, but I can not wait to see him anymore. <br /> <br /> Lars P. Helvard
