I came home late one night and turned on the TV to see Siskel and Ebert summarizing their options in the week. I did not hear anything about "Red Rock West" except for two fingers up and seeing her before she left. He would not spend too much time in theaters because of issues of distributor money and lack of promotion, but they said he deserved better. The next afternoon I followed their advice. They were right, they were some of the most fun I've ever had on movies. As some readers point out, there are some plot holes and the last 10 minutes do not seem to end. But it's worth it for the perfect craftwork that came in the first hour. It's the best role I've ever seen for Nicholas Cage, but almost everyone seems to be perfectly expressive. Dennis Hopper goes almost to the top, which gets stupid, but he strengthens how well everything works. Sets and music make a huge contribution to almost every scene. When I rented it for my family later, it did not work well. Long scenes that created tension in the theater were hard to appreciate, with home distractions. It deserves your full attention; turn off the phone, make sure you are not disturbed, do not forget and do not listen to each scene, especially at the beginning.
