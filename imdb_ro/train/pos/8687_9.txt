This was the second entry in the usual Columbo series, and it is good today. As I can now see on DVD and see how it is built, I am very impressed with the direction of Bernard L. Kowalski (who directed the fine MACHO CALLAHAN as well as countless TV episodes) - the killer's post-murder actions are shown on a a split-split effect on his two glasses, seeing how crime is shown in assembly mode, watch shooting from the perspective of the body. Also, the jazzman Gil Melle's avant-garde musical score was incredible and helped so much to create the atmosphere. And Brett Halsey's performance as a golf pro was great - a subtlety and complexity in a role that nine out of ten times would be a one-dimensional crop. The "Formula" had not yet been established when this film was filmed, so there are still some surprises in Columbo's methods. Of course, Falk, Robert Culp and Ray Milland are the best quality actors and it's a pleasure to see how they work - all people are familiar with many other roles, but they are lost in their characters here. Altogether, this entry into the Columbo series - and many others - are just as good as a great movie.
