The "Capital City" fans are enjoying! This first season of this series is now available from Network DVD and I recently received my copy! Although a major part of the major CAPITAL CITY trading characters presents us with different moments in both the first and second seasons when each team member plays a significant role in a particular central line or peripheral. The cultural mix (headed by Joanna Phillips-Lane) of the head trader Wendy Foley (English, Irish, American, German, Polish) is balanced with its own manners, interests and distinctive personalities that make it quite unfamiliar and, for most people, a seemingly sterile financial transaction subject, reasonably committed to the distribution performance. In fact, this seemingly dynamic team of employees is in direct contrast to senior management of Shane Longman, represented by Lee Wolf (Richard Le Parmentier) and James Farrell (Denys Hawthorne). I suspect that such an unconventional way of working as a team hired by Wendy's team would not have been a reality unless he was a young "free spirit", Peter Longman, inherited his thirty percent stock of his father's company his, relaxed modern way of becoming a reality. To some extent, Wendy's immediate supervisor, Leonard Ansen (John Bowe), is pursuing the traditional establishment of driving the company, yet his love for Wendy rather sees him as the "middle" on most occasions. The main interest of the series, I believe, comes from the romantic attraction of Declan's trigger by Douglas Hodge and German merchant Michelle Hauptmann with the blonde face of a blonde (played by Trevyn McDowell), where viewers always wondered if the situation between these two colleagues would develop beyond the close friendship / love they have no doubt. Looking forward to navigating through this title and hopefully the second season of thirteen will not be too far!
