Looking for Quo Vadis at my local video store, I found this version of 1985 that seemed interesting. Wow! Was awesome! Very much a kind of Ken Russell movie - weird, stylized, very artistic and of course "different". Nero was presented not as much as an incarnate evil, but as a crazy and unfulfilled emperor who would have preferred a circus career. He probably wondered why he was put in a position to "rule" an empire on the ground - it was not much fun and the fun was what he wanted. Klaus Maria Bandaur has had an extraordinary time with this role and played it for everything she deserves. Yes, Nero has persecuted Christians with vengeance; one of many who did this. At one point, one of his aggressors murmurs: "No one will ever understand that we just protected ourselves." He obtained this right.
