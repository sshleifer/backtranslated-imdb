Parker and Stone are transplanted with the overwhelming humor of their animated masterpiece until the live feature film with good results in general. Much of the movie is Trey and Matt running amok with their new toy box. The plot is simplicity in itself: two average guys invest a new sport, a mix of baseball campaign basketball that becomes a national madness. Along the way they encounter numerous sports clichÃ©s and send them along with any other popular culture that comes to their attention. It runs like an episode laid out in South Park, with the usual dialogue with the machine gun, the humor of the toilet, and the homies in the heart. If this film has a weakness, the association with the team gave us "Airplane" and the "Naked Gun" series. This influence is evident due to the heavy use of the blades and the presence of a glossy Yasmine Bleeth and rather two-dimensional in the role usually given to Priscilla Presley. Robert Vaughn does a little better to play the part of the corporation that has been his party since Bullitt and Ernest Borgnine have gone as far as possible, but we have to admit that it is perfect for the role of the madman. /> <br /> For those who have not yet noticed, Parker and Stone seem to be more comfortable than rockstar wannabes than comic books. This is manifested in the prominence given to the soundtrack in almost everything they create. As usual, they offer a good selection here, including the mandatory track, through their own ultra-non-PC DVDA. A special mention should be made to Dian Bachar, who deserves a kind of prize for durability a difficult task to play on Stan with Parker and the Cartmans who hit Stone. In conclusion, this is a fun comedy that is hampered by its full potential, due to its dependence on the Naked / Airplane formula. Parker and Stone could do something really brilliant (or absolutely terrible) if they had given full control of a future movie. America, either to lock these guys or to take care of them.
