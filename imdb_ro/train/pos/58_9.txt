He caught the end of this movie channel that sailed through cable channels and was so intrigued that I looked for the next presentation. I really did not know what to expect after reading the program summary, but I came from this film feeling disturbed and distracted. It also gave me as an adult who attended high school in the 1980s, a better understanding of what our children have to fight these days. The fact that you do not see the filming adds only chillness to the plot. To see both the child and the adult, struggling to understand and understand the meaningless shootings, was sometimes overwhelming. And I'll admit we've shed enough tears all along. Generally, not a movie I would look for, but I'm sure I'm glad I saw it.
