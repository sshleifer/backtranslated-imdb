Zu's legend is probably the most interesting movie I've seen in recent years. It exceeds all expectations and is truly a work of art. With unparalleled visuals and a divine story, Legend of Zu continues to cast on viewers with his grandeur. This movie is greatly accomplished by using high-tech cgi technology that allows fans of the fantasy genre to see their living visions alive. The act is perfect for this type of film; if you were an immortal with supernatural powers, I think you will keep more for yourself. Unlike many people's comments, the plot is actually quite easy to follow, maintaining a fast pace that adds a sense of urgency. Anyone who can not keep track of the different characters simply do not have to be careful because they are or are accustomed to such sophistication levels as the titanic. The land is hired and stratified with such epic themes that they will let you breathe for the air. Zu's legend is at a level of greatness so high that many people can be hit by his grandeur. Allow yourself to be completely surrounded in its fantastic vision and you will grow to love this movie.
