It's rare that someone meets a movie as perfect as this one. It's really one of the best, well-structured movies I've ever seen. Each dialogue line can be interpreted in several ways, which refers differently to each of the three main characters. The film has an intrinsic network of motivations and double crosses that curse and refuses to give up. Add to this that the slower romanticism between Kevin and Faye is as moving as anything else that has ever been engaged in celluloid and you have the ingredients for a perfect film. Explains the romance of movies such as "Titanic," such as the trite clich√©s. If you are looking for a movie to watch while you quit laundry, it's not like that. You have to get involved in this movie. You can not have a conversation while you're going in and out of the room. This movie requires your attention. Treat him with the respect you deserve and you will get a lot of it. If you do not think "Titanic" is the biggest movie ever.
