An intelligent, undoubtedly fun program with Peter Ustinov, as a career trust man, with his eyes on an American conglomerate in London. He is accompanied by fox (and deceptively sharp) Maggie Smith and threatened with exposure by jealous company Bob Newhart. This is a heist movie with lots of brains. Ustinov is exceptional, like Smith and Newhart is quite funny. The real surprise is Karl Malden, while the pill is "executive vice president". Malden was very rare. Cesar Romero and Robert Morley appear in some funny comedies. The excellent score of the music is by Laurie Johnson. Eric Till's direction is intense, and Ustinov's and Ira Wallach's scripts are of prime importance and very intelligent. A good period of beating!
