I find this a dark and fun comedy. Brosnan is a genius; as anyone will testify now, it should not be emphasized in the role of bonds. Kinnear was as charismatic and fun as anyone could have been in the role. I do not know if I laughed so hard during any movie! What unexpected pleasure! My favorite line would be "I feel like a bangkok prostitute one Sunday after the navy left the city." Brosnan has delivered this very unlawful line with such an unexpected comedy. I was also very impressed with the performance of Hope Davis. It seems that everyone in this movie is branching out of their previous work to such an extent that the comedy has actually improved. If you liked the dark and hilarious "The Weather Man," you will definitely want this. <br /> <br /> I voted 10.
