This is one of those unique horror films that require a much more mature understanding of the word "horror," for it to be appreciated. The main thing that people might not realize is that this story is told from a boy's point of view and, as with most younger children, is easily scared. Mainly because he just does not understand things, like why his father is not there for him. From viewing the movie you can see that the husband asks his wife, the balance between working time and family time and you can easily understand it, but the boy does not. It can also be imagined that the boy is afraid of the forest, as determined at the beginning of the film, that the family is out of town. Also, at first, as the family travels to the house, they hit a deer, then they got up, then quarreled with the locals, and the boy did not find that introduction into the forest at all. <br /> <br /> "Wendigo" is finally what his young, innocent mind works to explain all this. There is an American Indian legend, but when he looks at the stage where the boy hears about him, he is explained to him as an excuse and simplistic. Not because it is Wendigo, but because he understands it. When you look at the movie from this point of view, you can start to appreciate it. Obviously, it was inexpensive and cheaply shot, but jumping, light, and general impressions were more than compensated. And the final question the movie asks is: is it all in your head or is it really there? 8/10 <br /> Rated R: Forgiveness, violence and a sexual scene
