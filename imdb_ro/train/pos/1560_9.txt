This is a meeting, a team and a big episode of justice. From hesitation to resolution, Clark made an important leap from a troubled teenager who was afraid of a controlled destiny to a Superman who, like Green Arrow, leaves aside his emotions toward the few loved ones, ready to save the entire planet . This is not just a thrilling story about teamwork, loyalty and friendship; this is also about the decision of what is most important in life, a lesson for Clark. I do not want the series to end, but I hope the episodes that will follow strictly what Justice looks like, without repeating anything and ending here Smallville - and a wonderful start for Superman. <br /> In this episode, however, we should have seen more contrast between Lex and Team. Nine stars should give him enough credit.
