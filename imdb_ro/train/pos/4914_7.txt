A little pleasure in life is to walk on the old movie lane to the rental shop and pick stuff just because I did not see it. It's a great pleasure to take that movie home and find a little treasure like this on my screen. Long before Elia Kazan turned into a brand that cranking only notable (not good) movies, he made this drama better than the average. By watching it, you begin to notice how many decent, good or well-observed scenes have accumulated. Contrasts with his later films, in which the drama is written in great ... preferably great, neuralgic and scandalous. Kazan was more a promoter than a director. (no, thank you) Its future excesses are only suggested here in the plot. The plague comes! But here is an atypical Richard Widmark who played a family man in 1951 and avoided the most excesses of that trophy; here is a Barabra bel Geddes, which can be traced, with a boy turned down (good for her); they are a couple and share some beautiful scenes about big and small crises. Here's an expert comic interrogation with a crew of vessels; here is a wonderful moment when her chase begins in an angular deposit and a herd of birds pulls over her head pointing the moment. These are the small-scale successes that a movie can offer in which a viewer can actually recognize life; something, Hollywood, in his greed, now avoids studying. These are the moments that make me go to the movies and enjoy them. It's a personalized, human-sculpted movie, not the grotesque, oversized production that he and others (David Lean) will later popularize, whose legacy is still felt in shit like the Pirates of the Caribbean and Moulin Rouge. <br /> <br /> I looked twice and I would be cursed if I could tell you what Jack Palance was looking for in the final scenes but it does not seem as important to me as a spectator. This reminds me of both No Way Out a Poitier Noir, and Widmark, as well as the bad one, and you should really deal with.
