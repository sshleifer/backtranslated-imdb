It's been 19 years since Gordon Gekko used "Wall Street" to tell us that greed is good. Now, Michael Douglas takes the GG character and turns him into a Secret Service agent, Pete Garrison. Guess what? It works! This is a solid political thriller that kept me guessing. Detailed work on presenting security measures taken by SS on behalf of the President and the First Lady was also interesting. All the leaders were pretty good, but try how I could, I could not accept Eva Longoria as a secret service agent. While Jodie Foster has stopped you from believing and you really think he was FBI Starling's agent in "The Silence of the Lamb," you do not have the same feeling with Longoria. However, this is a fun movie, Escape with Beltway as background.
