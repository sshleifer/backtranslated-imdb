I've seen this movie only after I've heard raves about it for years. Needless to say, the real experience turned out to be a little anticlimactic. However, Alec Guiness leads vigorously a wonderful cast into a cheerful, if formal, story through post-war industrial England. This is the familiar story of the problems of inventing the perfect everyday product. Remember your car running on the water? Remember the promise of nuclear energy? In this case, it is a fabric that does not wear out, raises or even gets dirty! Of course, fabricators and their workers are horrified in the prospect of giving up business, and so the plot gets a little thicker. Guinness makes the whole business use and looks at the factory's research factory over and over again is quite an explosion! (The British ... always on the upper lip when it's in the fire). The film could bend just like the naked invention of the Guinness, but it's a good trip the same way.
