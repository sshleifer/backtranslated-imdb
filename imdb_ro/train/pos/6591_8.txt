The invisible man is a show that everyone has to love! It reminds me of the 80's (a-team, airwolf, knightrider). The special effects are small but very effective! but what is most important is the fun that this series has shot. It really looks! the entire cast matches perfectly in the roles there and it seems they can do what they want! especially Paul Ben Victor and Vincent Ventresca. Ventresca really shines in it! for me it is unbelievable that an actor with so much sarcasm is his actor style Not getting a shot in a big movie (Tarantino, this was the show you should have headed!) instead of that danger seriously boring (csi) shows if you can. well deserved !!!
