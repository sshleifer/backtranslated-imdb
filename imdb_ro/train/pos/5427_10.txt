Three British army sergeants stationed in India are sent to stop a rebellion of a tribe of criminals called the Thuggees. One of the sergeants, Cutter, heads away from the camp in search of a golden temple and is captured by Thuggees led by sinister Guru. Gunga Din, the regiment's water boy, returns to the camp for help, and the other two sergeants go after him, but they are also captured. Now, the Major sends a complete detail after the three, but they do not realize I'm going into a trap set by the Thugees. However, Gunga Din saves. Excellently made a friendly film, even if it is politically incorrect today. Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks perform very humorously and thrilling with Jaffe very well in the lead role and Cianelli very sinister as Guru. Rating-10 out of 10.
