There are so many "hollywood" movies made now that are not just torture to be watched but also have no connection with someone's life anyway. Granted, movies do not always have a profound meaning, but it is nice to know that there are also filmmakers who deal with telling "human" stories. I will not give up the premise of this brilliant film, however, the script is certainly one of the most complex and memorable ever seen in my life and I am also a 32-year-old boy! Bug ranks number 10 on the list of favorites, including: On Waterfront, Sunset Boulevard and Black Narcissus, to name but a few. This "on the move" movie should become one of your favorites, that is, if you have a heart!
