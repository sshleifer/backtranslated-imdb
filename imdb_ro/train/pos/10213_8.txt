This capricious movie had the misfortune of being released at the same time by the very popular Amelie, both with the wonderful Audrey Tautou playing the central role. Laurent Firode, the talented director, made one of the most appealing films that came out of France in the recent memory. The film deals with the chance, as its title in English also indicates. The French title refers to how butterflies' wings can create chaos across the Atlantic as they fly, as well as Pacific hurricanes, something that is not believed only by looking at these colorful insects. From the beginning, the director intersects all the characters you see in the movie and how each has a connection with the other, which is hard to imagine, but in the context of the movie seems to work well. <br /> <br /> A casual meeting at the subway sets the tone of the movie. Irene, who is about to work, is asked by the woman who stands before her to tell her what the zodiac is and continues to read from her paper. Irene, he seems to be going through the paths and finding his soul mate the same day. After Irene leaves the train, the quiet young man next to the woman tells her that she has the same birthday as Irene. Apparently they are meant to be from the beginning, but unfortunately they will not reconnect until the last frame of the movie. Audrey Tautou is wonderful as Irene. Faudel, who plays Younes, does not have much to do until the end, but shows that he has a presence and plays his role well. The talented young person has a valuable contribution to the success of the movie, which is as easy as the butterfly wings. We look forward to Laurent Firode's future films because he seems to be a heart-directed director in the right place and an ear for how people are connected.
