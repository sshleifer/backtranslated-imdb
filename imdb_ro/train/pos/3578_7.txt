For 12 years, Arnald Hillerman accidentally kills his older brother Eugene. His feelings are arrested by the fact that his family can not interact with him (or he feels it is not good to do so). His retreat is only his grandfather, who is the only one who seems to have compassion on him. Realism will capture movie lovers "true-2-life", but will not satisfy those who want action and emotions.
