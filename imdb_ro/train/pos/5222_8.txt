After Chicago, I began to lose all respect for Richard Gere and then came from The Flock. There is only a nice smile and some facial stock gestures that can bring you, but it proved to me that he eventually kept his maneuver and was able to act with the best of them. Clare Danes was also great as a "trainee / substitute". Some have suggested that there was too much useless violence, but I do not see it that way. Nothing I've seen get rid of the power of this movie. I was really shocked that I did not hear he was released in theaters and that he came over at Blockbuster. Indeed an exceptional film with a mix of action, suspense, emotion and social consciousness. As good as 7? May be. And you'll see a better action from Gere than anyone ever got out of Pitt.
