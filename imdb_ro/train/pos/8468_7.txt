A surprisingly interesting meditation about the nature of regret as to how it relates to paranoia. This happens a lot because they only have a running time of only 74 minutes, but it works. The sins are very subtle, not the cut shouts that seem to populate the latest Asian horror films. The way in which "scarecrows" are organized is similar to the disturbing moments of "The Uninvited" (aka 4 Inyong shiktak, directed by Su-Leon Lee), but this is not nearly the same caliber. The film does a nice job of balancing a classic ghostly story with something more unusual and psychological. She is not perfect, but she does what she has to do. I would recommend checking if you have a chance.
