In this sequel to the classic K-9 action comedy of 1989, detective Dooley [James Belushi] and his dog, Jerry Lee, return to fight the crime, but this time they are next to another detective [Christine Tucci] Doberman called Zues, who does not get along well with Jerry Lee. Dooley never understands his new partner. All of this changes as the movie goes on. The movie is intense because it's a guy who really wants to kill Dooley for the way he treated him in the past. There are some dramatic scenes that relate to Dooley's wife's death, which do not seem to be the movie's tone, because the rest of the movie is action sequences, a dog joke, fart jokes, and jokes about dogs bruised in a certain area. I know it sounds like a very low humor, but some of them are really funny. I did not see the movie for jokes, I saw it for two reasons. The first reason is that I am a great fan of James Belushi, and the second is for action sequences. James Belushi is more fun than he was in K-9, and action sequences are better. It would have been nice to see more characters from the K-9 to come back, but it's still a fun movie. If you're a James Belushi fan, you like this movie.
