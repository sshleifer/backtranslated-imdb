This is the best and most original show seen for years. The more I look, the more I fall in love. The cast is excellent, the writing is great. I personally like every character. However, there is a favorite character for everyone because there is a good mix of personalities and backgrounds, just like in real life. I think ABC has made a downside for the writers, actors and potential audiences of this show, has quit so quickly, did not advertise enough, and did not give a real chance to win a result. There are so few shows I watch, because most TVs are awful. This show, in my opinion, was right there, with my favorites Grays Anatomy and Brothers and Sisters. In fact, I think the same audience for brothers and sisters would love this show if they know about it. Why is it always showing the rate that wins so long, and the winning shows with great potential are always eliminated immediately. I'm so sorry for the reality shows that I do not see any of them. It was so refreshing to have a new idea for a show and then to hire excellent actors, this show had such a promise. The recent episode was the best, but everyone has really got into their parts and made the show so real. Watch this show on the ABC video and let ABC know you want to have this show back.
