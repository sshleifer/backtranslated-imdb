This is certainly a corresponding update for the original version, except that "the left party is now on the right". Just like the original, the film opposes a federal government that goes beyond its limits on personal freedom. It is a warning about how insurmountable our political freedoms are in an era of a federal government too zealous and too strong. Kowalski serves as a metaphor for Waco and Ruby Ridge, where the US government, in co-operation with mass media, threw words like the "white extremist" and extreme right extremists, its citizenship rights, with the wishes of the general population. This message is so non-PC, I'm amazed that this movie could be done - at least not without bringing the federal government through the IRS down on the producers as they did to Juanita Broderick, Katherine Prudhomme, Western Journalism Center and countless others who dared to speak. "Live Free or Die" is the motto of Jason Priestly's hat, while he brilliantly describes "the voice" (to some) the message of this film. <br /> <br />
