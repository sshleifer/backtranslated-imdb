Interesting characters, lots of tensions. How close to white and black without being black and white. I was stopped by how accustomed the sympathetic character of the mainstream, a quiet, almost secret deaf secretary, was able to return to murder to ruin his colleagues, harm people on her way, and finally, he participated in the heist and set up someone who was hit as a bait for her own exit. I am a little pushed by the tendency of quality films to otherwise describe criminals in a sympathetic way, without addressing the damage they have done to others than portraying their immediate opponents as offenders. In this movie, we never know who the money really is, or what happens to an innocent wife whom the secretary of sympathetic deafness uses to set up the bar owner who crazy him, to take the fall for the missing prey. Too bad the movie would have been great.
