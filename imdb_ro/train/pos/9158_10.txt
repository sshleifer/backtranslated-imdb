Last night we finished watching Jane Eyre (1983), the BBC mini-series adapted by Charlotte Bronte's Gothic novel, which deserves a classic of English literature with Timothy Dalton (favorite James Bond) like Edward Rochester and Zela Clarke in the role of Jane Eyre, a 18-year-old poor orphaned woman, governed by Mr Rochester's property, Thornfield. "Jane Eyre" was one of my most beloved books since I was an 11 year old girl and my friend gave it to me with the words "This book is amazing" and so it was and I read it tens and I'm not yet tired of it. Her beautiful, refined, scented and surprisingly fresh language, dialogues and, above all, two main characters and the story of their impossible love attracted many filmmakers. "Jane Eyre" has been adapted to television and large screen many times, 18 according to IMDb. Famous and wonderful actors such as Joan Fontaine and Orson Welles, William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg, George C. Scott and Susannah York, Ciarán Hinds and Samantha Morton played the couple who overcome hundreds of obstacles produced by society, laws, religion, age, environments, experiences, and fatal mistakes that would hunt for many years. Of all these films, I have seen only a 300-minute BBC version of 1983, which follows the novel closely, and where Timothy Dalton, who often plays dark characters, did not just play with Edward Rochester brilliant and classy, ​​he was Mr. Rochester - sardonic, vibrant, force of nature, strong, passionate, sexy, and tortured master of Thornfield. Zelah Clarke was also convincing as sweet, gentle, intelligent and powerful, Jane, who feels profound and passionate mixed with clear reasoning and quiet but firm will. Added on September 17, 2007: During the last two weeks, I saw five Jane Eyre movies and it was a great experience. There is something to be admired in every adaptation of "Jane Eyre," though not all of them are completely successful. This version is still my favorite movie "Jane Eyre".
