Until I saw this particular thing on HBO, I never heard of Eddie Izzard. Of course I'm glad I have now! He's one of the funniest comedians I've ever seen! Rarely, a comedian sank so much in his craft, then in Eddie. I could not help laughing at the whole show. If you like to laugh, you have to see this special!
