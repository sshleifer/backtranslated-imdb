The story of an imprisoned man who was haunted by the prison was electrocuted and killed random prisoners while waiting to take revenge on the man who struck him. Viggo Mortensen is great, and acting is pretty good. Lane Smith is deliciously evil as a guilty guard. Also, this film has a great gore, including mumbling death with barbed wire.
