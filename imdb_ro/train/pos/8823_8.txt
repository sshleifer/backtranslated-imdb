Good movie. Tells a story of a fancy boy who tells us how we are caught in social situations and what extreme measures we must take to behave differently. Or at least the feeling: you have to break every rule if you have to break one. If you wanted to express your love for someone you do not know, how would you do it without creating a pressing social situation? It is also about fascism to decide on the cultural life of others, what kind of culture is stuck in our throats. What Disney or FOX or suicide bomber gives right to decide which is our choice. They are not allowed to drink the morning coffee with one person. Do we have to listen to the NRJ cries, see the silly tabloid headlines and the street ads before our morning coffee?
