I never heard of this movie until I saw the rental DVD as a little skeptical, there were many movies in the past with good ensembles that can not do anything by filming a bad scenario and in some cases that simply saw that there was no reason not to give this movie a theater release, it's good. The story that most of this genre may seem a little forced sometimes, but there seems to be a good amount of realism that allows the impulse to wear. I was pleasantly surprised at how good a Justin Timberlake job is, with such an important role, of course it is not yet an Oscar material, but it will learn with every role and show a lot of promises for the future here. Dylan McDermott was also amazingly good in his unexpectedly ugly role and is certainly the cream of the culture in this film. Finally, let go of it. you will not be disappointed, you will not get bored, in fact, I think you will be more than satisfied with the final result.
