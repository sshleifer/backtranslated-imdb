My children have recently begun to look at the repertoires of this show - both the early episodes in the N and the more recent family in the ABC family - and they like it. (I did not realize that the event lasted even in the first or second season). I'm curious what caused all the changes expressed-I saw them described as "highly publicized," and yet for half an hour searching for web efforts revealed only endless comments about how the early episodes were much better than subsequent episodes. (Personally, I do not see a big difference - scenarios and themes remain largely the same throughout them - but they lose too many people along the way) My daughter put the DVDs on her wish list, so maybe the land of special traits and comments will shed light on all of these things. I would also like to make some self-referential humor about changes - such as "Boy Meets World," where they give up a little sister for a season or something, and when another actor appears later, plays it, asks where it was and says "upstairs", or when the "Spring Minkus" projector shows up for high school graduation, asks him where he was and says "there," indicating the part of the class that has never been presented by the room, before saying "Hey, Mr. Turner, wait!" and leaving the screen (Mr. Turner being another character who left) Oh well - maybe there will be a true story about Hollywood about this or something like that? I was very happy to see Aunt Hilda present at the end - she's always been one of my favorites - it's too bad that it could not have been a more comprehensive casting meeting. (The Zelda candle just did not cut me off)
