I chose to see this film the day it was opened at national level in France as a personal way to think about what happened a year ago; the collection works as intended: it causes a whirl of thoughts and emotions that work as an intellectual tribute, without ever resorting to cheap sentiment or knee reactionism. There have been many accusations that the film is anti-American: while I can not talk to everyone in this regard, I am an American who has found that such statements are completely untrue. people are making a lot of noise about the Egyptian segment by Chahine because they express the prospects of the Palestinian suicide bombers claiming that civilians in a democracy are "fair targets" because they choose the governments the bombers are trying to attack but this ignores something else : Several perspectives are discussed, no one is considered true, and critics - if they have seen the play - seem to forget the warm and warm dialogue that takes place between the director and the ghost of the American dialogue, and the dire sadness of the director in hearing the tragedy. Almost all of the films are beautiful, thoughtful and inspired, especially the brilliant work of Mahkmalbaf, Tanovic, Loach & Inarritu. Nair, as usual, really tells a true story about an injustice against a Muslim family following anti-Islamic hysteria that swept - and still swept - the states. I found Gitai's piece a bit vulgar and simple in his criticism of media hysteria in the face of terrorism, and Penn's play was too impressive and elliptical for my tastes, although I expected to like it. Borgnine is very good and courageous in him. SPOILER WARNING: A reviewer below has incorrectly read the fall of the towers as a happy moment for the character; he reads rather that the fall of the towers is what, because the light floods his room, calls him into the loss of life that he refused to recognize. Again, this is a kind of Impressionist piece, for we know that if the towers blocked the light on this man's apartment, it would have been nothing but smoke and ash, not light, which would have flooded through the window.
