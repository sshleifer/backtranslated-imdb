This movie was great! It was an excellent interpretation of an ancient myth. The animation was somewhat weird, but nothing new from Disney. It was definitely better than expected for a Disney movie without singing. The background animation was magical. It was a different level of work for Disney people. Some of the characters were a little weird, but more than just the beauty and brightness of the landscape. The music was mostly instrumental, but it was perfect for the movie. It was definitely not a film that needed characters to sing in bands. Perfect. 10 out of 10.
