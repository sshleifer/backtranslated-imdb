"The Last Big Thing" is a wonderful satirical film that sings the pop culture to the point of humorous self-destruction. Characters are so exciting and fun to laugh at / sympathize with. Which brings me to an introduction to the characters I liked best ... Simon Geist is a 30-year-old man / early 40s who creates an editorial magazine called "The Next Big Thing." The thing is that this magazine does not really exist, and it's just an excuse for Simon to approach the actors by interviewing them, just to hurt them silly, insulting his way of buying in pop culture. , writes a magazine (which is real), which is mainly related to her and to Simon, as well as her and her father. Darla is a really in love (or ungrateful) character, depending on how you see it Magda is a prostitute, the character I liked best. "Brent is a flat-faced personality, without too much for him, just like Tedra, the music-queen for a bunch of rock bands B. With all this she, these characters are weaving a very interesting web together. And this film casts doubt on all the motivations people have for what they do and why they do it. It's a great movie and I suggest you see it if you're in the indie / art house crowd. Mark my words! <br /> <br />
