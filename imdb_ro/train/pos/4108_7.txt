Kurosawa, fresh in color, loses sight of the usual themes of truth and perception of reality, and opts for depression in Tokyo neighborhoods. Kurosawa stretches for a style that was, in my opinion, his antithesis - that is, I feel like Kurosawa wanted to make an Ozu image. Poor, poorly conceived, this film is a rare spearhead in this excellent body of work. While Ikiru, while mundane and depressing, was still interesting and in full swing, and while Stray Dog described the neighborhoods and social poverty in Japan without being too hard to handle or boring, desu ka den has all the sumptuousness with which to expect content without any of the redeeming qualities of Kurosawa's previous images. <br /> <br /> Be warned, this is not a movie that Kurosawa should judge.
