I recently caught this little jewel of a cable film. It took me by surprise, even if I had to expect from the team involved in this film. <br /> <br /> Henry Bromwell directed this movie with a safe hand, and looks. She always asks the secret life of the killers who hit her. You do not have to go too far to realize that they are probably neighbors, social knowledge or even friends; they are no different from us, at least on the surface. In this story, grandfather is a clever person who does not hesitate to eliminate someone for the right price. He has no scruples to teach his son's ropes, and even to his nephew! Alex, he's a man in turbulence. He knows what he has done in the past and suddenly he gets to understand the consequences of his actions. He needs to see someone who can help him find peace with himself. If he goes to Dr. Parks, he tries to find a split, though he does not find it there. On the contrary, there is a dramatic turn when Alex finds that someone should still kill her. Alex, brilliantly portrayed by William H. Macy, fascinates us. Not only is he a fantastic actor but makes us believe that he is that man. One of the best things in the movie is John Ritter. He is as convincing as Dr. Parks, the man who reveals the mystery. Donald Sutherland, like grandpa is perfect. She is a natural actor in everything she does. Neve Campbell surprised her in her pivotal role of Sarah. It has an incredible capacity and range. Tracey Ullman is Martha, the wife of suffering, and does not get too much. Also, Barbara Bain, in a rare case, is grandmother from hell. David Dorfman, is a pleasure in the film. He shows a maturity beyond his years. <br /> <br />
