I can tell you how bad this movie is. I was in the movie and I have not seen him yet, but I'm wandering at the thought that someone pays to see me drunk. Especially considering what I did this year. The thing is, they probably edited him. Especially the scene in which my roommate suffered coke from the tits of a Mexican prostitute (probably should have followed him). I made some appearances, but besides, I do not remember anything. I was MC in a few scenes (from what I was told.) What I can tell you is that everyone has avoided the crew of the camera since whoever wants to be reminded of the cast or the girl who has shown herself in the world (or the girl who lost his virginity). Generally, the trip itself was crazy, but people act differently once the room is on them.
