Yes, it was a small budget, but this movie shows love! The only bad things about this were that you can say that the budget of this movie will not compare to "The Water World" and, although the plot was good, the movie never managed to take full advantage of it! Strong performances from everyone and suspense make it worthwhile to watch you on a rainy night.
