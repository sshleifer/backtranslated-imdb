My grandmother bought me this film when I was 5 years old (I always loved the scary movies) and even then I liked it. The atmosphere is wonderful and the story is original and fun. I especially like scenes where RV is attacked in the desert. Stones are, in fact, convincing for such a low-budget move. The actor is above average for these types of movies and the music is dizzying. This is definitely a jewel with a rating uder. I recommend it to everyone who likes these weird movies from the late seventies, early eighties such as "Alice, Sweet Alice," "Poor enough Eddie," "Nightmare," "Massacre Hospital," and " Return of the Aliens, Deadly Icre. " Definitely a classic!
