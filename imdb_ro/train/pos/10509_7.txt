I did not read the novel though I understand it is something different from it; the fact that I rather enjoyed this, along with the fact that this genre is not my kind, leads me to the decision not to continue reading the book. After I have not read one word from Austen's writing, I can not compare it to any work. What I can say is that almost every line of dialogue in this sense is intelligent, full of witchcraft and well distributed, as well as the greatest source of comedy in this sense. This made me laugh loudly with perfect British and verbal materials. Every acting show is on the scene, and Paltrow makes a match for the role of a match. Characters are well written, credible and consistent. However, I found some of them extremely irritating, and although I think at least some of these were supposed to be funny, they tended to repeat excessively and, honestly, it was not funny when they first appeared. Editing and cinema are great and everything looks great. Plot and rhythm are wonderful, you never get bored. It ends in a really obvious way, but maybe that's what their audience likes. I can not claim that I did not have fun, it did from the beginning to the end, and I will follow it again. There is a short language in this regard. I recommend this to any fan of love stories. 7/10
