Everyone should see this movie because each of us is broken in a way and can help us achieve 1) My life is not as bad as I thought it is and 2) How important is the adoption of a child in need. There are so many there. To believe that the film actually relies on a real person has made us think deeply about life and how the world has and will always be. Corrupted, but corruption does not have to go home. We all have a choice! She definitely recommends this ... and while you're at her, I'd like to throw in "The Purple Color" and "Woman, Thou Art Loosed" by TD Jakes. movies that rely on life and give us a piece of life.
