24 is the best television show !!!!! It is an incredible series of television with incredible suspense, with excellent parcels and unforgettable characters. And the first episode of all is my best proof. Because it's just the first episode, just the introduction and you're embarrassed by the plot and the twists and turns. Jack Bauer is a federal agent entrusted with the protection of Senator David Palmer. He can not trust anyone because people in the CTU can be involved. And when these events took place, her daughter: Kimberly escapes from the house to the party. But ... At the end of the episode, you want to look more and more and more. <br /> <br /> It's just the first of the lot, and it's great.
