This was the second of three films that Irving Berlin wrote for the Astaire-Rogers franchise and has by far the highest score and is somewhat unusual in that two of the numbers are made by Harriet Hilliard leaving the rest to be divided and / or split between executives. As usual, the story does not have to hold us, although for the record it was based on a play, Shore Leave, which also served as a base for Broadway music, Hit the Deck. Anyone who actually saw Shore Lost Theater in the theater may have been confused at the moment as the roles played by Fred and Ginger were created for the film, but what always matters is music, lyrics and hoofing, and everything is out of the right glass. It's a deviation from the other titles in the franchise where 1) we get to see Astaire playing the piano - in real life was a pianist made and composed several songs, one of which I built up to a Let-Down evil, had a verse of Johnny Mercer and spent a few weeks in graphics - and he's the only one in the series where he played a serviceman, though an ex-hoofer who enrolled in the navy after being thrown by his dance partner Ghimbir before to start the story. He earns a little known but excellent number in Berlin, I would rather lead a band, and a duet I put all my eggs in a single basket, but the final number is prophetic - in 1936, the rummy of the World War II have already been felt - Let's face the music and dance, one of the most powerful ballads ever made by the team. So if Randolph Scott is a bit of wood and fish off the water, with no horse or six arms at hand, and Harriet Hilliard does not exactly put the screen on fire; we came to see Fred and Ginger, and the only question is, they're delivering. Answer: In beatings.
