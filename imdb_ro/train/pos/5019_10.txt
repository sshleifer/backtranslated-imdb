Hi my name is Jessica, I am Italian! Some time ago I saw this movie: "For the first time" with Corin Corky Nemec. It was the story of Micheal and Mary Margaret. I have to know the song title of the most important scene of love in Micheal's bedroom. In Italy this movie has not been scheduled for many years and I do not know how to find the song. Lots of thanks for who can help me! I like this movie! It's very romantic! The soundtrack is beautiful! I love Cheryl Pollack! Jessica
