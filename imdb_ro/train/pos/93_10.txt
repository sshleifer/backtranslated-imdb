My first child was born in the year when this program came out and I played the record album for boys every Christmas afterwards. When the CD came out, I bought about ten copies and I still gave them to my friends and relatives when they started their families ... they invariably become their favorite Christmas album. Recently I found some DVDs (made on DVD-R on video tapes, probably) for sale on eBay. The one I bought was a great copy and it was so great to see the show again after more than 25 years. There are some songs on the show that were not on the album, and some of the songs in the album were studio versions of the same songs in the show. But both the CD and the DVD will remain in our library as the best Christmas entertainment ever.
