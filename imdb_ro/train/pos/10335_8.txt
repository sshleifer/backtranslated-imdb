The only reason I give this movie an 8 out of 10 is that, in my opinion, there are some films that are perfect. This small B picture is a long story, well said. I have always been intrigued by Alexander Knox, but I have seen very few movies. Here he plays Wilhelm Grimm, a sad man who turns into a monster. He betrays everything and everyone, without any remorse. Performance is one of the most frightening shows I've ever seen. Since the Second World War, actors who played Nazis or other types of evil in films have been occasionally nominated for Oscars. I imagine that, since this was done during the war, the Academy felt that honoring such shows was like the honor of evil. But Knox puts it in this way - a man so bitter and consumed by guilt that he does not think he is making others suffer. I still can not get over it. Marsha Hunt, who usually plays the role of filth or social butterfly, is thrown against the guy, probably the best show I've ever seen. Perhaps not Oscar worthy, but the best of her career. Nothing against her; I enjoyed her in those "light" roles she often played. But here she proves she is up to the burden of heavier drama. If you like stories about human dramas or stories about the fate of those who have suffered from the Nazis, film.
