He talks about a dream show - just two of the most wonderful actors who ever appeared anywhere - Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith - together - in "Hot Millions," a funny and strange comedy also with Karl Malden, Robert Morley and Bob Newhart. Ustinov is a former embezzler receiving the resume of a talented computer programmer (Morley) and occupying his position in a Malden-led firm - for misappropriation. It's not a good sailing; he drew Newhart's competitor's attention to the company, and his neighbor, Maggie Smith (who knows him at his place of residence with another name), becomes his secretary for a short period of time. She can not keep a job and she's seen across the film in a variety of jobs - all end up being fired. When Newhart advances, she invites Ustinov to spend his curry apartment as a cover, but the two will soon decide they are made for each other. Of course, she does not know that Ustinov is a crook. This is such a good movie - you can only love Ustinov and Smith and be fascinated by Ustinov's machinations, his genius, and ways in which he moves away from trouble. But there is an overturning end that will show you who really has the brain. Do not miss this movie, set in the 1960s in London. It is worth not to hear but to hear Maggie Smith: "I was dismissed."
