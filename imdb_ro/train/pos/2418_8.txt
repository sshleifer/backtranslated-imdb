One of the funniest of John, Eugene Levy is also great in it, I just want the studio to realize it has to be on DVD, I have it on the video but I feel that this movie deserves great DVD) Kung Fu Uuniversity (Kung Fu U) skit is so funny as the whole movie, too, the scenes she has with her girlfriend and family are wonderful, this movie does not seem to be on TV but loses the most (ebay it's a good place to find a copy.) I'll keep my VHS until someday we get to see it on DVD. there are so many great movies that are not yet released on DVD and this is one of them.
