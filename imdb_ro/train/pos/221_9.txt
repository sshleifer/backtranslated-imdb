I remember seeing this movie at Radio City Music Hall when it left. I did not really understand the humor at that moment, but this movie can make me laugh out loud. With all due respect for George Burns (RIP), Walter Matthau really deserves the Oscar for this film. His performance is amazing - considering he was 20 years younger than his character, Willie Clark. Its ways are of prime importance. ("Do you know what kind of songs he wrote? Sh * t!" And when he talks to the Spanish guy at the reception: "No, no, do not enchilada!") Absolutely hilarious! /> Kudos to Richard Benjamin, who played a straight man at Matthau. I just want this to be on DVD, because my VHS recording gets a bit old. <br /> <br /> No interest in seeing the remake with Woody Allen, because in no way can it fit the original.
