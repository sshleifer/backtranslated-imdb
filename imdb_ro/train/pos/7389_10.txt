No prize show can please all people. Clearly, if your favorite movies did not win, you will say that the show was not very good. This is understandable. However, the Academy's 74 annual awards will be remembered for a magical moment of Hollywood history: Woody Allen's first ever appearance at the Academy Awards. <br /> <br /> <Allen has often renounced the awards as self-aggressive and useless and never participated - although he has won several coveted awards. At 74 academy awards, the nation was still mourning the loss of life in the collapse of the World Trade Centers in New York. When the time came to pay tribute to New York, they decided to show a video of the great moments of the town's movie. Then the spokesman simply said, "Ladies and gentlemen, Oscar winning director Woody Allen." The place broke into an extremely long ovation. The entertainment industry has finally come to the applause of the man in New York who usually avoids the Hollywood scene. As applause died, Woody applied part of his legendary spirit. <br /> <br /> "I thought they wanted the Oscars back," he joked. "I panicked because the pawn shop was out of business by the age and I had no recovery of anything." But that was not. I could not work because my movie was not nominated for anything this year. Then they hit me - maybe they called me to apologize. "Allen also revealed why he overlooked Oscar's aversion during his lifetime for this special night." "For New York City, I would do anything. So I got tux and got down here, "said Allen." It's a wonderful and cynical city. It was a great, moving and exciting background for movies and remains a great great city. "<br /> <br />
