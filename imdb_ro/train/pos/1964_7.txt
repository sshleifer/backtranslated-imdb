I can not accept negative reviews from other reviewers. They are too critical, perhaps because they are locked in the past. I'd like to see a comment from someone who had never seen Basic Instinct 1, maybe someone very young? I let the cinema rejoice that I was not influenced by IMDb critics. 14 hours later I still try to find defects in the plot, but I can not think of anything serious. My advice to everyone is to see it and make your own minds. There follows a pattern similar to Basic Instinct 1, but the plot is less confusing. I still allowed myself to wonder in the end, but in a more satisfactory way. Sharon Stone is as sexy and bad as she is and she wears her for 48 years; this role remains defining. David Morrisey was satisfactory even though he is not Michael Douglas. Of the support distribution, I particularly liked David Thewlis as a police detective.
