Okay, so it can not be the "movie of the year" movie (apart from the brilliant soundtrack that I think has won several awards) but it's a great movie about "The Kid" (Prince / O The music is absolutely superb, in my opinion you have to have this soundtrack, it's really a classic, and it's all the sounds of the eighties and you've been great in fashion. And the movie itself plays a beautiful plot, it's worth seeing over and over again, espeally if you like Prince / O (what I do), of course.
