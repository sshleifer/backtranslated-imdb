I started looking at The Apprentice 4 years ago (maybe 5) and I really liked it. The first thing that draws your attention to this is the refreshing form that, although similar to many other reality shows in its center, is still very fun. Donald Trump is great as the host and the main referee of the show. The casting legacy with intelligent people who have a good choice as competitors is also appreciated. But the best part of the show is the city of New York. Mark Burnett may have made a lot of nonsense in his time, but his handling in cinema is excellent as NYC does as a character for himself. Jazz songs combined with tremendous work make New York look spectacular. The apprentice will easily make the best 3 real-time shows of all time (The Amazing Race is number one, though). But, like the amazing race, this show is always best viewed in moderation. If you look for a moment, the originality of the show will stop quickly (in the same case as in the case of TAR). Star World, the country's television stations, made a successful show in the show. The first three seasons were presented in turn, then after two years the following two seasons were presented, which kept the concept fresh. In conclusion, you enjoy this show, especially the first 2 seasons. However, if you keep watching the show continuously, then your charm will stop and will be fast.
