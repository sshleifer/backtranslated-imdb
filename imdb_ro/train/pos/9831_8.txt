We have great expectations with this. . . because Zombi 3 officially went to Zombi 2 and directed by Lucio Fulci. . . However . . . co-directed by Bruno Mattei (Night of the Zombies) and not written by Dardino Sachetti, but by Claudio Fagrasso (Night of the Zombies) and shot in filming like Night of the Zombies and resembles Night of the Zombies Dead Living. . as a result of him more as a companion to the hell of dead life than Zombi 2. Fabrazio DeAngelis who produced Zombi 2 and his editor Tomassi (?) and efx gianetto De Rossi gave Zombie 2 his magic. . . Zombi 3 is not magic. . . like peanut butter and jelly sandwich without peanut butter. But, over the years, I grew up to accept Zombies 3. I could swear I saw a version where a soldier was bitten on his arm and went to the hotel room. . . there was a meaningless cut and was cut on Mattei / Fulci on DVD.
