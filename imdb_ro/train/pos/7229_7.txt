The cat and the mouse are involved in the usual pursuits when Jerry sinks into an invisible ink bottle and discovers that it makes him disappear. Instead of taking the opportunity to spy on a mouse changing room or something, he uses his new invisibility to torment Tom. And it's pretty funny and quite inventive, despite the fact that it was a joke somewhat of a joke. And the action never leaves the inside of the house, which is usually the trait of some under-T & J trousers. Still worth a 7/10. However, I'm not sure how an invisible mouse can throw a shadow on the wall, defies the physics and the very nature of the invisible itself.
