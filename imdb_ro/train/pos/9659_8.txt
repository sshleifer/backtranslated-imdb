"Presque Rien" is a beautiful portrait of the experiences of a young French homosexual. Eschewing both stereotypes and preaching, it is an extraordinary naturalist film, superbly shot, shot with a feeling for the city where the action takes place, never melodramatic, but often painfully real. If something is almost too realistic, as it is a bit in the way of the conventional plot, only scenes in a lifetime. But the absence of conventional dramatic tensions matters for less than it could in a world so subtle. "Presque Rien" may not be the most exciting film ever made; but its simple humanism serves it well in comparison to the preconceptions of the celebrity or the bigot that often mark the treatments of this theme. It's worth a watch.
