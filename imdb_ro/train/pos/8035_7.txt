Sunday will not be Sunday without an action movie, and when you want intense fighting, you go back to Tom Berenger (Platoon). Here a jungle sniper is playing, going after rebels and gentlemen. Life is a bitch, so she has a green desk type (Billy Zane) to help the mission. The film is in the hands of Luis Llosa, who broke Anaconda. he does not do much better here, but Berenger makes the movie useful. Sure, it can be a bit longer - who wants to see a lot of walking through the jungle, but it's good, tense action when time is right.
