I took a chance on "Hardcastle and McCormick", acquiring Amazon's first value of the Canadian season. When I took it, I started with the pilot and I was immediately taken up by this. I rated it with 5 stars on Amazon, and I'm a 10-star rating here. It's so good. What I liked was the opening and closing themes and, of course, Stephen J. Cannell's logo at the end of each episode, but especially the relationship between the judge and Mark, who worked together to break each case. I was so excited about buying the second season as a company and I liked it equally. If you do not have this great series on disk, I think you should buy it and put it in your collection.
