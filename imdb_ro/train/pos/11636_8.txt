Beautiful, filmed, well-shot, filmed with suspense. I sat at the edge of the chair. I loved the lead actress very much and I thought the bastard was very well done. You do not have to chew here in the way of a theme, but if you get up in the chair, shut your brain, watch the fancy work of the room, and enjoy the plot, you will have a lot of time. The plot is well-worn, and ordinary filmmakers will probably know more or less what to expect about ten minutes in. But that did not bother me, because I liked to see it happening. In the old days, they may not have focused so closely on two characters, and there were some attractive moments when we hoped they would let other people have a few lines. But these people were right to keep the film so tightly focused. I just caught my neck early enough, and I never let go. It's not a good idea to think too much, either during or after the movie. because I'm not sure it makes sense. Stay calm and rejoice.
