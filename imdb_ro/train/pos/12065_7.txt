"Insignificance" is far from a great movie, from a stage piece directed by Nic Roeg. In Roeg's film, this is above the level of most of his "Do not Watch Now" post, which is characterized by the judicious use of Theresa Russell as a lead actress. It's really good here and far from the problem in other Roeg films like "Bad Timing" and "Heavenly Cold". As "actress," which is Marilyn Monroe, Russell is very effective, portraying her as a very depressing but pleasant mermaid. She plays well alongside Michael Emil as Einstein, which is excellent to say at least. He shows the admirable side, and while Theresa Russell does not look exactly like Monroe, she is certainly attractive enough to make the play a real one. Other players are appropriate unless they are as arrested as Emil and Russell. A smart, very lucrative script is directed by Roeg, but certainly not brilliant, like "Walkabout" or "Performance". As in other Roeg films later, he tends to rely too much on vague and non-substantial flashbacks that add little to the movie. In many ways, the movie would have worked better as a shorter piece (for example, 60 minutes), more modest. Still, a fairly acceptable and acceptable film. Sometimes pretty good, but quite out of the ordinary. Rating: - *** 1/2 / *****
