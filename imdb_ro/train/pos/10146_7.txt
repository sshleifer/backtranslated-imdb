As we all know, a romantic comedy is the genre with the end already known. The two leaders must always meet. In the third edition, I tried to figure out how this will end and how they will come together. A clue was given right from the start, but you will never achieve it by the end. It's a simple hook, but it works. You should have covered a lot of usual ground, but make a fresh spin whenever possible. I liked all the NY characters and I loved the places. It's a postcard from NY. It was also nice to watch a movie and find nothing wrong with it. So if you like a good old-fashioned romantic movie ... then it's for you.
