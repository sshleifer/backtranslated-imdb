Emma is a real story. If you like soptic stuff, full of intelligence and insanity, you will love this movie! His truth about the novel, which is very important, with some twists and turns added for pleasure. Gwen is not one of my favorite actresses, but she's right to a role that required everything she had to do in beatings. It shines in a role that I do not think another actress could have done to her right justice. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Northam, as a hero. how shocked are you? I never looked at him like a handsome but beautiful! What role can it do for you! It looks so good that the sensible, royal king, Mr. K, is literally looking at him in a new light. It also makes an excellent romantic advantage. The charm and character that he brings to his role is wonderful! Ewan McGregor, Greta Sacchi brings the rest. a good distribution. A good movie. If you are a fan of Jane Austen, watch this movie, along with Pride and Prejudice - and most importantly, buy the books. Improves the movie to extraordinary heights
