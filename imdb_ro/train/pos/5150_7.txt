Even though Ian Kershaw has distanced himself from this project because of the inaccuracies of Hitler's life and yes, it is dramatic but essential. Robert Carlyle interprets Hitler in his last years in this documentary that only refers to Hitler from childhood until he became Chancellor of Germany, including The Night of the Long Knives. This TV movie (and a mini-series in two parts) shows how a number of factors allowed Hitler to come to power, the financial disaster of the 1930s. The series follows Hitler and something else besides the life of Fritz Gerlich and Ernst Hanfstaengl. Totally, valuable and full of exciting actors, I still feel it should have been better targeted with stronger cinema; most of the actors are portrayed in half-body photographs that for me make a theatrical, not cinematic, position. The tempo is sometimes sleepy and the film suffers from it, about 2.5 hours long.
