I'm from "Christopher Reeve's generation" is right to say he was the best actor to play yet "Superman," but that does not stop me from enjoying other actors in the role, and George Reeves makes a pretty good try to beat Chris on the top, though it's barely crashing. That does not prevent me from enjoying this movie, it has much to do for it. She has everything she needs, a plot with the beginning, middle, and end, plus all these parts being intelligently written. The film is nervous both in acting and in the story, something like a movie-noir but with stockings. The story is both interesting and significant, it is a movie with a message that is not too preachers. I'm still amazed that he was shot in 12 days, oh Hollywood's glory days, when we did not have to wait five years just to see if the movie would fall into infernal ... The film is polished and specially created, directed by Lee "Roll'em" Sholem, best known for speed and efficiency. Never let technology constraints slow down, in fact there are a few creative things made to create the effect of flight, including putting a camera on a truck boom and high shot and traveling fast to make it look like we see from of Superman's view, also some George's cracks in the process of work and a long blow of a superman animated. <br /> <br /> It is now available on DVD as an additional feature in the first season of the George Reeves TV series. A DVD that deserves to own in its own right, including the film as a whole, is a cake icing. Give me the blood today to God to bless!
