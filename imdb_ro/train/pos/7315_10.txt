A classic, highly influential thriller that gave birth to a horror pictogram and launched the career of director Carpenter and star Curtis. A murderer apparently can not be stopped from the psychic institution and returns to his hometown where he starts off with a small Hallbyeen local babysitter. Halloween is a movie that fails to live up to its reputation as a horror masterpiece! Carpenter's frightening story and intelligent direction give this film a life so good that it can be seen to be truly felt! Direction is often made up of simple elements, shadows, dark streets, creeping doors that even make the day-to-day setting of a really creepy little town district. Carpenter is well awaiting his suspense and offensive shocks to make them the most effective surprise, that in itself is a little girl that some horror filmmakers ever succeed in! In addition, he is wise enough to give us some really nice characters and a very scary character to keep the tension stronger. The highest level also goes to Carpenter's musical score, simple but scary non-attentive. In a sense, Halloween is a good example of a perfect horror movie! The distribution is excellent. Young Jamie Lee Curtis makes a very beautiful tower like Laurie Strode's babysitter, so good that she will continue to be in a series of other horror films before breaking into bigger movies. The great Donald Pleasant has a perfect performance as a doctor of Myer, who is desperate to capture him again. Supporting the Loomis, Soles, Castle and other towers is also good. So, like his negative character, Halloween is an unstoppable force that never fails to tremble and cool. It's MUST for all fans of gender! <br /> <br /> **** from ****
