I was attracted to this movie when I saw a preview of it on the Oscar night. When I read about Kay Pollak, I was comprised. We, Americans, are suckers for a baby coming back. I understand this movie was a huge draw in Sweden. As a very provincial American I can only speculate the reason. Perhaps it is because of the provocative joke that Lena is making at the beginning of the film and other social commentaries, but perhaps because of the central message that I think has the same appeal everywhere in affluent societies. /> The message of this movie to me is the same as Titanic. Life is a short person, and to the extent that someone really knows it's all we have. Can be taken anytime. So it is not a pity that we spend so much time behind the walls that separate us from the others because we are afraid to be injured? Defeating the walls is painful, but feel alive on the other side of those injured walls. Feeling alive is worth the risk. Give it and you'll get it. So start living now. Many people criticize this film for lack of characterization and other defects. I say you are all pseudo-sophisticated. Get admiration, it's a parable, a fable for us, rich people, rich in matter, but whose souls are in abject poverty. So join a chorus or a band or help build housing or distribute food to the less fortunate than you. Spread joy and make the world a better place as long as you go out and communicate with your fellow men. Writing a check is not enough. We are a social species. Even the humble of the other human beings can affect you in ways you have never thought possible. <br /> <br /> Robust individualism takes place but is overestimated.
