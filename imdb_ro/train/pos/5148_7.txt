I do not know what it is with these movies. But movies about history or religion are always criticized for their accuracy. Of course, it's not exactly 100%. It's hard to make 100% accurate movies nowadays, when "experts" do not agree with each other. That's why I like to judge a movie with what she's trying to say, rather than taking all the inaccuracies. So I'm starting to say I liked this mini-series. But I agree with the criticism that childhood years have passed too quickly. The series should have been a story of three parts, childhood being the first. But if they do not have more money to shoot more stories, who am I to criticize? There is only one real problem I have with this movie and that is that it is said in a book history. Especially the second part, which is just a sum of events that have happened. I would have rather wanted to see Hitler more humane (more scenes he doubted, etc.). Noah Taylor did this more in the movie "Max," which seems to work better, I guess. However, I'm glad it was made and owned on DVD. Just remember what happened and see that Carlyle gives you the best. 7.5 / 10
