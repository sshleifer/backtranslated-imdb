SMALL SPOILS Alert! <br /> <br /> Good movie ... Very good movie. And I'm surprised to say that, because I'm not a big fan of vampires, and the sound of director Deran Seraphian is usually bad news. Most of his films are below the action action films, such as the Warrant of Death and Weapons. This was one of his first films and may have had to make horror movies instead of action. This movie really fascinated me. Good achievement, if not famous actors or big budget. It's really the story that keeps you focused. Especially fans of the original Dracula myth will be pleased. The Sarafian lights up another aspect of Bram Stoker's famous story and remains quite loyal and true to the truth. Explains the life of the Romanian Count Dracula and how he scared the Turkish army away, pulling corpses in front of the castle. Of course, reality stops there and "based on a true story". Blood drink and all were invented by Bram Stoker. In this movie, Count (Vlad Teppish) emigrates to the US and seduces tons of woman. And all the girls are beautiful, I will give it to you. On the whole, good action of unknown faces, enough blood and gore to satisfy horror morbid fans and an interesting story. This movie is really unknown and was hidden on the darkest shelf of my local video. But it's definitely worth cleaning the dust off the lid and putting it in the video camera. Heck, is much better than the famous Nicole Kidman movie with the same title. These two films have nothing in common, but I blame the movie for stealing attention from this wonderful image. Check it out ... my humble opinion on death = 8.5 / 10
