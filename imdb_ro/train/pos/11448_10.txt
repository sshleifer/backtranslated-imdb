I saw for the first time this absolutely riveting document in its initial release in 2001, and it even had a profound effect on me, so much that I urged many of my friends to see him with me at repeated screenings. Bottom Line: None of my friends left disappointed (ever!). This star film is about the Scottish conceptual artist, Andy Goldsworthy, who creates absolutely beautiful pieces of art using natural materials (wood, water, flowers, rocks, etc.) to create pieces that eventually return to their natural form the temporary state of everything?). We see that Goldsworthy creates more temporary works of art, as well as some long-term installations in major galleries around the world, as well as some pieces of the natural world. German film producer Thomas Riedelsheimer directs, shoots and edits this meditation on the creative process that is a true living for both the eye and the ear (with an ambient musical score, composed and interpreted by Fred Frith, music that is generally, experienced / loud textured guitar, as well as a capable ensemble of musicians). Although this movie has been available on DVD for a few years, if you can find a cinema that highlights a revival of this wonderful movie, by all means, look for it (it is easy a movie that was composed for the big screen with a sound system competent to really experience this movie correctly). No MPAA rating, but contains nothing to offend (unless the live birth of an sheep on the screen is intended to offend or disturb)
