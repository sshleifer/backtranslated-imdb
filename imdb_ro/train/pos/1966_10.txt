I'm not an ordinary commentator on this site, but seeing how underrated this movie is, I'm trying to write some comments and remarks about it. I enjoyed watching this movie, maybe because Cat is all I want to be, I will not post spoilers or I will not reveal the plots but there are things that I really found amazing, the way they manipulate people is so divine . this is a very undervalued movie, I miss the arguments here, I usually go to enjoy it and then talk a little about it, when you go to the movies is to have fun and I enjoyed 1h53 I stayed in the dark room. must be seen always and quickly until the delight fades. to try not to be so critical of that. thank you for reading.
