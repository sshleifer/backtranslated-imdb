In fact, this is not really a "movie" as much as an extended episode; that's what I mean by saying that if you did not follow the TV series (Homicide: Life On The Street), I guess you will have difficulty following this movie made for television. Saying this, "Homicide: The Movie" is still a great watch. I think a lot is said about a television production that every single casting member would return, many after years of absence, to portray his characters again and close an incredible program. The film highlights this sense of "family," not only between characters, but also among actors. It's very bitter-sweet knowing that this will be the last time we see all of them together under the title of HOMICIDE. My story, I realized that this movie is missing. Giardello's primary candidacy seems to be particularly controversial and I felt that his filming could have been treated within the limits of his usual position as Leutenant. Also, Det. Bayliss's overturning plot, which was left hanging at the end of the series, was finally resolved, but I, for one, never felt it must be; I liked to stick with a mystery (remind us that the first case of the first episode also remained unresolved for the whole series!). As a DEVOTED fan of TV series I like this movie and it was done even after H: LOTS was canceled, but I would not recommend it to anyone who did not have the slightest exposure to the series. Now if it's released on DVD ...
