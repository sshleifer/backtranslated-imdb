Action, Horror, Sci-Fi, Exploitation Fred Olen Ray shows he has a talent as a director. Actor William Smith is one of the best boys in the industry. He treats the viewer with the best interpretation of his career. As for Randy Travis, he offers the best impression of Lee Van Cleef. It's not bad in the movie. Smith and Travis do the movie. As for the rest of the songs, none of them stood out. Ray did a great job pointing to this movie, Smith and Travis were good, I would give this West on a scale from one to ten (ten being the best) a seven.
