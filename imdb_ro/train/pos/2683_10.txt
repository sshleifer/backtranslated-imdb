Franco proves once again that he is the surreal and erotic prince of the cinema. True, much of his work can be regarded as an unforgettable story, but with Succubus (Necronomicon) he shows he is able to leave his lost creativity and gives us both a hypnotic and enigmatic film, intrinsic erosion in his work . Jerry Van Rooyen's splendid score pulsates while the viewer is thrown from one bizarre scenario to another, following the attempts of a striptease artist (Reynaud) who may be schizophrenic or perhaps indeed (as a mysterious character) to be a devil, to conform to the world he lives in. A beautiful and enigmatic cinematic play highly recommended to anyone with an interest in moving into alternative cinema.
