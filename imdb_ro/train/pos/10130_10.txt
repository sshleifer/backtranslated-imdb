The pilot is extremely well done. It determines how characters are linked in future episodes. I do not think anyone could have created a better pilot for this show. Shows remarkable creativity on the part of the writers. Though not everything was straightened because it was the first episode, many events that took place in the upcoming seasons were demonstrated in the pilot. An example would be Ross and Rachels's future relationship. Even if the nervousness of a first episode arose, it was overwhelmed by an amazing plot and an extraordinary choice. <br /> <br /> Bravo. A great start for an unbeatable comedy!
