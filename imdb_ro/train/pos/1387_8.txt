A bit slow (like a Sofia Coppola movie), but still a very exciting film about the discovery of sexuality by three teenage girls. The magic of the film lies in its ability to bring back many memories to the way their age felt. Confusion and insecurity are presented in a very simple way, but so real in life. Music is perfect, and acting is amazing. The camera works well. I highly recommend those who are not afraid to look back at this particular period of life when we discover our sexual impulses and our desires. I would also say it is a wonderful movie for the young people going through that period. So many films have been made about adolescence, but this really captures the true essence of discovering the adult world of romance and its complexity.
