I first saw this movie on a local station in horror on Sunday afternoon horror around 1969 or 1970. Ugly. I was just a kid at the time, but I liked it and I was not afraid. I thought he had such a cool and very original story. Thinking back, I'm still surprised that it was demonstrated on TV during the day. I've been looking for this movie ever since, I've always seen it and always loved it. John Waters might have been idolized by this film. It must be not only a frightening film but one of the weakest movies ever made at that time. And, surprisingly, you do not hear about this as having the cult following a movie such as "Blood Feast" or "Hills Have Eyes" have acquired over the years. He has a next worship, but in my opinion he should have become a classic worship. As far as I know, it came out shortly before Blood Blood appeared, making it probably one of the first true "gore" movies. In fact, this film has elements of Hershell Gordon Lewis and a bit Russ Meyer tossed to a good extent. Anyway, I recommend this to anyone who likes horrible movies, underwear, black and white since the early 1960s (I think the date since the end of the year was read in 1960).
