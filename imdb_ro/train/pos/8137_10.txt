If you like CB4, you have no idea what you are missing if you have not seen this movie yet. This movie is hilarious mad and incorporates much more about the hip hop industry than any other parody movie ... It's regrettable that this movie was not released on DVD because it's a movie I've ever watched with everyone loved and wanted a copy. If you really want a good laugh and you like hip hop and you are little familiar with some old school artists, definitley rent this movie. There are not so many video rental sites that have their children, but if you meet meetings, you will not be disappointed.
