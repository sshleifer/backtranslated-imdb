A story about a Martian attempt to colonize the Earth. (Things must be pretty bad on Mars.) Two state bodies are investigating the scene of a reported UFO accident. Regardless of the landing, it is buried under ice in Tracy's pond, but there are footsteps in the snow that lead to a nearby dinner. Diner had no customers at eleven that morning. Now there is a handful of passengers on the bus that awaits permission to cross a weak structural bridge. The bus driver insists that six passengers were on board the bus, although he did not see who they were. The problem is that there are seven people waiting for this journey to be resumed. One of them is a stranger, but which one? Everyone is suspected. There is the crazy old man (Jack Elam), of course, who seems to exercise a subtle spirit. There is a gentle businessman who has to get to Boston (John Hoyt). A young couple in the honeymoon. (Executable performance of her husband, Ron Kipling.) Except for couples, nobody noticed anyone else. And even couples are suspicious of each other. The bride to the new-born husband: "I would have sworn you had a chin on your chin." The story continues in a weird, but scary way - the phone rings for no reason, the light turns on and goes out, the bait box lights up - and none of them should be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> It's a nice game overall, and climate revelation deserves a chicot. There is no "depth" to recognize. There is a moral message about the fact that people at the bridge masquerading as ordinary citizens. It is not a warning of any kind, just a fairy tale that entertains and amuses. I'm always glad when it's turned on. It is especially interesting to see John Hoyt as an irritable and impatient businessman, knowing that in 1954 he was the Roman senator who invented the assassination of Julius Caesar in Shakespeare's version of MGM. And here he is - with three arms.
