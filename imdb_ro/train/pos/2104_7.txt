Who does not know Largo Winch in the France-Belgium-Luxembourg trio (the three countries where "BD" or "Bandes Dessin√©es" are massively published)? 18 years after the publication of the first comic book, which is itself an adaptation of a series of novels, must be adapted on the screens. After a first attempt - and a failed attempt - with a TV show, the real thing starts. First, and that was what most fans did not get, the purpose of this film is not strictly to adapt the comic book series. Some essential parts, characters and actions of the original are missing. The film itself offers an alternative and more modern version of the series. As a fan of Class I in the comic book, I have to confess that I was very surprised. Actors are good, so is the script, though it may seem too fast. I recommend this film to all those interested in financial / political thrillers, but obviously there is no alternative to the James Bond or Jason Bourne series, as we could read on the internet.
