First of all, I have not seen The Blob since I was 7 or 8 years old and I saw her as an incredible experience as an adult. The pages could be written about his influence on horror films today. And more could be written on his social topics with "adolescent fear" in the 1950s. But this little little story about interplanetary horror is still a scary movie if you let it be. Sure, it seems to be cheesy, because everything comes out of our modern world. But "The Blob" is packed in truly frightening moments as a band of children watches the creature unstoppable when adults do not believe it. In fact, there are even some pretty gloomy moments in the colorful world of candy. And Steve McQueen gives much more than the story deserves on paper that our viewers are really caught up in this moment and we believe in him. To summarize, if you can remove your postmodern irony, there is much more to love than here.
