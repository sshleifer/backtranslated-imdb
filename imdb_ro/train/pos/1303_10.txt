Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker are gathered to play all their songs 35 years ago when they formed a trio called "Cream". These were the psychedelic days of England and America, and these guys watched them: all the weak, very long hair, wild clothes and loud music. They played a combination of rock and blues and was, for the most part, good things. Well, these guys are 60 years old and can still sing and play at a high level like this wonderful DVD concert DVD shows us. I've always been extremely familiar with Clapton, of course, who never came out of the spotlight, but I did not know what to expect from Bruce and Baker, none of them I have not seen for decades. I was surprised. When he was young, Baker was so proud that he looked like a strange speed near death. Now he looks healthy in shape and his drum has been solid. Bruce seemed a bit haggard, but his voice is wonderful, as good as ever and a pleasure to hear these old songs. This is just great material and performance from boys who know what they are doing. Some people have criticized this show for being key. I do not agree with this. I have no complaint. The concert sounded really good. The second song, "Spoonful", was remarkable, emphasizing the concert for me. Highly recommended.
