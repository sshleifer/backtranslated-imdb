Okay - you want to test someone about how comfortable they are with their adolescence and the embarrassing and manic changes of theory - then react immediately from tracking this cute dick about kids who make socially relevant horror movements in the suburban of years' 80. More than any film I have ever seen, the film deals with the burden of sexuality and self in a way that is completely human, never boring and shattered by the inherent kindness of youth, discolored by the adult world afraid of fear , quirk in youth is accredited to everything from madness to perversion. The mini-mogul Darren Stien seems to come to a deeper understanding of his triumphs and claims as the patriarch of the child's strict world. What he finds in himself and in others is not always beautiful - but shows how he can improve and reconcile with age. What does change without reflection mean? I love this movie.
