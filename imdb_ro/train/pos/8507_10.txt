Well, take O.J. Simpson, as an American soldier, has transformed all American bus drivers who decide to save their own passengers, which no one else wants and Arte Johnson in an absolutely royal role as a tourist guide who does not know what to do do not you do not want to admit that they have problems and combine it with Lorenzo Lamas as one of the three bad guys who are facing children who intend to kidnap an heir and leave a bus to die in the desert, to have action, and lots of dramas. Everyone was good, but he saw Lamas as the worst of the bad guys who hurt me. He was too credible as the evil one who not only wanted to kidnap the heir but to rape his women and humiliate the one who tried to stop him. This was long before he cultivated his good-looking image. And believe me a 20-year-old Lorenzo in tight jeans you do not want to miss!
