Although the movie is clearly dated, audiences can easily identify with Buster's unfortunate situation in this timeless and very funny story. Buster struggles against dishonest chances in three different times: the Stone Age, the Roman Age and the Modern Age, playing almost the same character with just a change of scenery to help us identify the different "ages". In this film we see one of the oldest comedy skills of the caveman stereotype, which does not win his love not by romance but by brutal force, as well as by a funny twist in the Roman gladiatorial battle, two comic sketches that teach such a long time spoofs Mel Brooks "History of the World: Part I". The fundamental theme of the film is simple but convincing: although times have changed, we still face the same struggles even in the modern times that we fought in prehistoric times to "win" the face is America's theme of 1923, moment in which chauvinism was still en vogue). It is interesting to look at this film eighty years later and to see how dramatically things have changed since the "modern era" of this film so far.
