Let's suggest to Anton Newcombe of the Brian Jonestown Massacre to use some therapies, which makes it easy. In Dig! who won the Sundance Grand Prix, we've been watching him and his self-sabotage band for seven years, while ex-friends and contemporaries Dandy Warhols stand up to comparative magnificence (a mobile phone announcement anyway ). /> What Raises Dig! above its contemporaries, is a huge, almost biblical comic tragedy: an honest depressing treatise on art, compared to trade and compromise. For all my "eyes, I'm a bloody genius," Newcombe is actually discovered to be a very talented musician if he is very upset, more talented than his rival, Courtney Taylor of Dandy who tells the story. If Newcombe is Dennis Hopper, Peter Fonda from Taylor. Even sadder, Taylor seems to realize this, highlighted by his tiring and self-repellent voice: does he know that his band won the battle - cost? In fact, they sold, made Indie-Lite records, kept their teeth beautiful and clean and probably washed their hair twice before bedtime - earning registration contracts and a big tourist bus. And breaking down all credibility in this process. Newcombe, on the other hand, lives in dirt, is constantly blocked, beats other band members on the stage, hits the hecklers in his head - and last passed the Dig! being ferred by the police after losing the right to see her child. Two of the best rock subculture films were directed by women: Penelope Spheeris's decline in Western civilization and that? a classic moment at the time he was released.
