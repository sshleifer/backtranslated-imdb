... I do not read the summaries of the plot, because in words the plot might seem trivial, dead brain and useless. The movie is excellent, acting both Denzel and Dakota (she will go to the big sky, believe me in that) are just fabulous, and the plot is breathing mind. In fact, "fabulous" is a small word that should be used for talented actors. The film is based only on real facts, and some characters are not fictitious, which adds to the shock I had during and after the movie. If I love both actors and disturbing films, you have not seen your favorite one yet ... Believe me, in the end you will have a strange and inexplicable feeling. The movie is wonderful, you see it, you rent it, buy it or anything ... it does not lose
