Comparable to the Battle Club, The Matrix, A.I., Sixth Sense, among others. This film is approaching psychically in a way that has never been done before. The first 30 minutes build an interesting love story between Diaz-Cruise-Cruz. The rest of the movie is, well, confused, you will choose more each time you watch it (I've visited the movies 3 times now)
