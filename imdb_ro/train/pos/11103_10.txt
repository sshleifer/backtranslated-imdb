The "godfather" of the television, but apart from the characters of applause and mobs, the two are not the same. Tony Soprano is forced to go to a psychiatrist after a series of panic attacks. His psychiatrist finds out that Tony is actually part of two families - in a single family he is a loving, but not so perfect father, and in the other family is a ruthless wise. After analysis, Dr. Melfi concludes that Tony's problems come from her mother, Livia, who suspects she has personality disorder at the limit. Gandolfini is rightly praised as the main character; however, Bracco and Marchand are not as well recognized for their equal and talented performances as psychiatrists and mothers, respectively. Falco, Imperioli and DeMatteo are appreciated for their support roles. Van Zandt (from E-Street Band) plays his first and only role as Tony's best friend and is quite convincing and latching. Chianese, the only recurring actor who actually appeared in a movie in The Godfather, plays Tony's uncle and the nemesis "on-and-off." Many fans also enjoyed the characters of Pastore, Ventimiglia, Curatola, Proval, Pantoliano, Lip, Sciorra and Buscemi. Tony's children are "okay," but they are not remarkable (except for the amazing performance of Iler in the third episode, "Second Coming"); Sirico and Schirripa are unconvincing and outdated, but the show is too strong for them to keep it back. Even if the show continues for more than six years, it stops being boring or predictable. <br /> <br /> **** (out of four)
