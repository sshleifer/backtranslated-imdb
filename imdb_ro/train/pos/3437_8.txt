Some genre films have to be dressed. That was an exception. Taken on his own merit, he is a dressed version of the horror genre. With minimal special effects, it manages to be a kind of psychological study with a simple yet existential theme - who is hit by the bus and why? It's not a great movie, however, because there are not so many controversies, the story works. Subtle, and all about character interactions. In fact, there is a creation in the opening scenes, but maybe it was placed there to simply set the tone for what is to come. I greatly appreciate the balance of male and female energy and I would not recommend this story to anyone interested in more than the reaction of people to a physical and psychological challenge. You will enjoy the film if you have a certain empathy, you will need a little adventure in your life and ask yourself, "What to do in this situation?"
