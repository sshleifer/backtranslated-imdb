I've seen this movie a dozen times and it's great. But the only thing that was involved was that at first it was too much about who was going with whom. I think it would be interesting to make a remake of it. But on the official site, they said they would not do the remake because so many people saved themselves when they watched it. What happened to Patty Dunning right now? She is a fairly good actress. He made several movies in the '70s and' 80s, but since then I've never heard of it. I know for sure about Thom Rachford, who plays Jerry and works for RD Films. But on the whole, I have to say that the series itself is like leaving the old school.
