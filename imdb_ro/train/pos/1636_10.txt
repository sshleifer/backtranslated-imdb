This is one of the biggest movies in the '80s! Get out like a "flock in a knife" !! I can not believe Mad Magazine denounced it or anything. Yet, they have proudly named their name in a show with "Stuart", "Chinese Lady I-speak-not-enlish" and "speed-up UPS." What's up with that? And, I like you Like Ron Leibman - it's a fox! I wonder why he took his name out of credits? It was the funniest role I know. Of course, it's not as vulgar as in Norma Rae. But, in my opinion, this movie is right there with the Lampoon National holiday. If you liked movies like Porky's, Fast Times, Last Virgin Virgin, or any of the 80's teenage movies, you'll love this! Rent it and you'll see what I mean!
