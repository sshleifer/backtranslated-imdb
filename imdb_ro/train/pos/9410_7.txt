I liked this movie. But I was surprised to see people who refer to her as a comedy. It was funny sometimes, but it was not funny. If I had expected to be a comedy, I would have been disappointed with the film, but, going without expectation, I realized it was pleasant and appealing. Maybe because, as an engineer, I identified myself with the protagonist. I was less concerned about the satire of capital or labor, and more so in the basic story of a man fighting for his invention. A man who is less interested in the monetary gain of his invention than to see that he has come to be produced and put into production. It's absolutely heroic when he refuses to take the big money and the hot woman in exchange for suppressing the invention. So I find it interesting that the people here compared it to Jurassic Park; I compare it to The Fountainhead.
