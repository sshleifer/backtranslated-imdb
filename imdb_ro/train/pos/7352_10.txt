This was my first introduction to the Bollywood world and I'm now engaged! Okay, so you need to adopt a different mentality to watch American movies, but once you enjoy the pleasure of enjoying what it is, you will not be disappointed. The songs are gorgeous, melodic and very appealing. The actors are visually constrained, especially Karisma Kapoor, who is certainly one of the most beautiful actresses anywhere in the movie world. The locations, the color are spellbinding. If you want something different and you are looking to be uplifted, glad and stimulating, I recommend you to catch this movie.
