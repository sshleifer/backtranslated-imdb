I have to admit that Purple Rain is one of my deepest guilty pleasures. Purple Rain not only broke the limits, set a decade, costumes, music, behavior and dance! To this day, my friends and I are still beating the Purple Rain soundtrack and pretending to be Prince and Revolution. Now the movie myself, I just wanted to say what I said in the title, because for the most part, this film itself is made of music. The actor? Please do not let me judge because this is one of my favorite pleasures because I know he was not an Oscar worthy of any kind. But I think the duo who made this movie was Morris and Jarome, their speech about passwords was just beyond hilarity. I just want to vote this movie on concert sequences because I felt that was what the movie did. Prince is a musical genius and has created beautiful music. While the movie and acting is bad enough, this movie is another fun thing to watch at night and even dance. This movie defined the '80s, so just have fun with it. The Prince would like that, just to spend it down! Oh, boy, he called blades. <br /> <br /> 9/10
