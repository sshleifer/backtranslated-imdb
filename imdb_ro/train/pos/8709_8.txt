Recently (May 2008) we found that this childhood preference was available as a DVD. Although we have seen much of the high-quality films since then (at the end of the 70's (I was 10 years old in 1978)), this with three low-budget episodes remains strong. I saw it now with my 10-year-old daughter, and she feels exactly the way I remembered since then: scary music (she had to hold my hands, even if she was raised with her eyes on LotR and Resident Evil), changing theories about who is the culprit, and also complaining about theatrical voices in an era before Norway has discovered the difference between the act of the scene and the acting movie. This is the only and only good science fiction or series film ever made in Norway. And it's worthwhile to look at.
