As a child I remember being nine or ten and I love this movie. It was Bollywood's action / comedy movie. It's an imitation of Bad Boys obviously! The whole changing identity, but the arrival of two twins throws everything out the window and then the arrival of colorful villains dancing and singing! The action scenes in the film are not revolutionary, but still amazing scenes. The movie is really very funny and it was a great comeback that Amitabh Bachan needed. Govinda is a jewel as always and this is probably the best work ever, it shines while the side kick offers the best comedy scenes available in Indian cinema. Songs ... The song is both funny and catchy .............. proving laughter when you're least expected ... Amitabh Bachan is surprisingly funny and makes you laugh like "Bade Miah "... his emphasis ... body language ..... Brilliant ... <br /> <br /> 'Assi chutki naab re daal' is the best song ......... ..... Lovers.
