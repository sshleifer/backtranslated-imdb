I caught this in 1996, at my weekend at a cinema. I was impressed with this and my feelings did not change too much. Documentary about the infamous Edward D. Wood Jr. covering his life and his films. There are interviews with people who worked with him or met him. These include: Vampira, Dolores Fuller, Bela Lugosi Jr., Loretta King, Gregory Walcott and Paul Marco. Interviews are mixed with movie clips or bizarre recreations. It's interesting (somewhat), but was that needed? I saw all of Wood's movies and it's just terrible. Wood has ambitions, but not a little talent to fulfill. I would not say he's the worst director ever, but he's down there. Do we really need a docu on a very mediocre film? I like the fact that they have not tried to make Wood a kind of saint. More than a few of the interviewees (especially Lugosi Jr.) hated the man quite a lot, and this is heavily and clearly heard. They also completely ignore their films in the adult film industry in the 1960s and 1970s. However, it is interesting if you are a wooden fan. The best interviews are with Vampira (who tears Wood apart) and Dolores Fuller (a long girlfriend).
