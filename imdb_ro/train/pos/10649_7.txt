What I can say about this is another Hollywood horror hit with a very large budget ($ 80 million). It's not scary, it gives us only a few emotions and a really creepy succession with skeleton in the fireplace. special effects and nothing more. Catherine Zeta-Jones is beautiful as always, Lili Taylor is also a good actress. The architecture of House Hill is amazing, all these monuments, statues, furniture ... Delicious! the end because it was so daring. Check it out and form your own opinion about it. I give this picture 7 out of 10.
