I have recently seen this movie in my international business class. I did not expect anything else but a boring documentary (not to say I do not love the documentary I'm bad luck with the movies in that class) Imagine surprise when this movie, actually a movie, appeared. <br /> <br /> This film is a story about all the cultural differences in the workplace and the way you have to cooperate to get anywhere. The confrontation of culture shows how different the world is and how different we perceive until someone comes and gives us a wake-up call. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone in business or just want a laugh, because that's funny. <br /> <br /> Well, that's about it! Luck
