I lived in those times and I think the program caught the heart of the era. I think he would have had to deal with several African-American issues, but I think he has to cover a lot in the program. It was scary to stay and watch riots on T V in the hope that they will not go as far as your family home and that they would not burn down. I figured Jerry O'Connell did a wonderful job portraying a veteran who returned from the war. I went to school with boys who came back. Some have changed more than others and some not much. It bothers me when someone comments that a problem was not covered enough or it was not fun enough. It lives through it and then makes comments. I thought the movie was great and everyone did a remarkable job. Thank you for a trip (sad and good) down the memory band.
