Carlos Mencia was excellent, this is a special hour. He had worked hard to show everyone that it was the real deal. I know people said he stole the material in this special, but that's not true. Carlos brings comedy to the front as he likes, not as someone else wants, that's why he's so good. People say it's not funny because they say too much Dee Dee Dee and they still have not realized it's part of his act and they do not want it, but he does it anyway, and manages to make people laugh. For all the killers there, here's a message, Carlos is here to stay, you have no point trying to get him down.
