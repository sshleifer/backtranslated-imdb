No wonder Busey later developed a tumor in the sinus cavity, this film is also a bad decision, but I really liked it. The first 5 minutes are the most inappropriate 5 minutes in any movie; boring, diabolically evil, and then, with a position of Spiderman, Busey screaming the best-bad line in any movie ever created ... "the worst nightmare of your nightmare!" I dragged some of my egg that laughed so hard. That line resonates so well that it even touches Clooney's "hi Freeze, I'm Batman" infamy. Other classic moments is that Busey gets upset constantly because people remember that he killed his former CIA partner ... he accidentally shot him in the chest (all made possible by a super slowdown flashback sequence that makes watching dry paint looks interesting). There is an ashtray for superiors, blows on the face and "it was not my fault and you know that!" Well, the movie shows him losing the bad guy and hitting his buddy, so ... Other critical moments must be his former girlfriend who threw a grenade to the ground to allow him to escape - a plan that defies all logic, physical and absurdity. And finally, when McBain jumps out of the Thunderblast during the intense guerrilla war and starts running and hindering a small object, I almost wet. Some of Busey's best works far, hired or bought today "butture!" My vote is a perfect 10 (per meter poo).
