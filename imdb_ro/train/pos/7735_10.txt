An excellent interpretation of Jim Thompson's novel, this neo-noir thriller has all the necessary elements - an exaggerated exaggeration, an alcoholic vampire with sinister desires, a former cop and a small kidnapper and a doomed kidnapping plan. However, the film never goes to the land of clich√©s, but it remains fresh and intriguing. The performances are superb, especially the role of Bruce Dern as the evil one, Uncle Bud. There is a tense uncertainty about motion of the film, which, intentionally or not, adds to painful procedures. Highly recommended.
