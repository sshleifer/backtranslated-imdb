The genre "gangster" is now a tired subject that is too often subject to parody. In retrospect, the series is a culmination of previous clich√©s that have been used in its genre, fortunately the writers have advanced to this defect by creating a realism that has been applied in this respect. The sopranos are a epic crime saga that illustrates its content with psychological depth characterized by subtle nuance, humor and unseen violence. The key protagonist, Tony Soprano, is perceived by his crew as a dangerous general lack of fear and moral values, yet Tony is two people who is bestial, while the other is in conflict with guilt and resentment. Without any inhibition or contradiction, I still strongly believe that the Sopranos have the best ensemble in their recent memory. All things considered could make a detailed statement about the series, but I will not. If ever there is a visual dictionary in global consumerism, searching for these definitions is vital, ambiguous, unsuccessful, epic, uncompromising, and the soprano shattered will instantly smile within you.
