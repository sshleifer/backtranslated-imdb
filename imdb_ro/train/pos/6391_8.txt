Caught this film at the Arizona International Film Festival. I did not expect much (though the festival director told me that it was one of the best movies). In five minutes I was sold. Filmed in black and white on a small budget, this movie is hilarious. The action is solid, the writing is solid and the appearance of the film is solid. The actress is probably the biggest revelation, since most low-budget movies have a tendency to act amateur or scenic. Not this one. She presents one of the most convincing, funny and fun portraits of a character with the Tourette syndrome I have ever seen. The land is surrounded without being confused and pungent without being free. If you get the chance, watch this movie. Those who like Majkowski (I hope I have this right) deserve the chance to gather things up in a broader audience.
