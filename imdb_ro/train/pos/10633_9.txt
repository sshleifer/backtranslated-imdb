This movie is as unique as it is overlooked ...... A different story is just that, it shows how from the need to survive or maintain, you can find the ability to love if you have an open heart, as well as an open mind. I first saw this on cable in the late 1970s and really described the limitations of the gay community at the time. I think this movie was ahead of its time, representing a small piece of obscure life. It is truly a classic in the sense that it was a precursor of what is now described as an extended family. This movie should be available on DVD / VHS so that only Meg Foster & Perry King's extraordinary performances can be recognized, but show how far we have reached and still have to go where we have relationships.
