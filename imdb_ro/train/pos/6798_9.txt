(No spoilers, only plot details) I do not understand such a hatred for this episode. Want to see a bad episode of Smallville? Look underground - it's a bag of nonsense. Tom Welling offers good performance (I do not say very often), and Michael Rosenbaum is great, but he is most of the time. The scenario of the alternative universe seems to be realistic. The Martian Manhunter, who previously appeared in "Static," returns and tells Clark that the doctor who is the head of the crazy asylum they are held in is actually a phantom ghost and if Clark wants to return to the universe, he must to kill him. A big episode with a good attitude and a decent rhythm.
