Before Tuscan Sky, I saw Diane Lane's dance performance in this other film of a movie. Campers are invited to their youth camp and experience it as adults. Everyone who returns seems to be looking for something lost, which makes him so realistic. Perhaps you had to be a camper to really get it, but in the words of a character noticing that all her clothes were wet "it's so camp!" From the practical jokes and the fight against friends, to the frightening lady of the morning and the early morning bell ... it is amps. Once interesting activities now seem worldly. A terrible casting makes the best one-two-dimensional roles and makes them credible. Bill Paxton, Diane, Elizabeth, Mrs. Brad Paisley (probably when it fell for the first time) Beautiful landscape, bright colors, comic music (including Hello Muddah variations) a movie that you can take out again and again like you would look at an old friend.
