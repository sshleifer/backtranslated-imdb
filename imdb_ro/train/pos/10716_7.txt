I look at this on the Star World network from abroad that buys American and Canadian series that have gone through one or two seasons, such as The Jane Show. I've been thinking about how many female comedies I'm showing I'm actually able to watch myself, I'm Lucy, Bewitched, Dream of Jeanie (the one with Barbara Feldman), and then my mind is going empty. I can not think of others, women are all supporting roles, not the leader. So for me, The Jane Show is in a fairly good company. One thing I just thought about. I watched a few things done in Canada and I never remember anything filmed in a regular TV series that shows SNOW! Everything is done at the height of the summer, LOL! Granted to be a great place to live in the summer, but you would think it would look a bit of Canada in the winter, because it is part of the lifestyle there. I mean SCTV, Just For Laughs come to mind like two comedy shows that have lasted a long time filmed in Canada and very few or none are shot in the snow, even though they both do a lot of outdoor photography. I turned around, but I have a little chick at Jane, and her paths, obviously liberal, being accused of racism for her neighbor, and I like the bald guy and his madness, I have found a tie with a series of UK called The IT Crowd (Think of me) office comedy with a lead woman. Not in any case the best comedy ever, but for a guy to say he can look at himself, that says something. If I were with my wife, she might enjoy it since she's dealing with sex in the office, and that could be a good comedy for couples to watch. 7 out of 10.
