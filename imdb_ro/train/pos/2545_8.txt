Ray invisible is an excellent display of both the acting talent of Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi. Karloff makes impeccable performance as an outrageous and conflicting scientist who seems to put his scientific achievements before his relationship with others, even his wife. His already lonely personality becomes unbearable as it becomes paranoid. Lugosi plays a perfect professional, passionate about his work, but he still has time to maintain good relationships with everyone, but he still does not seem real Friends close. He was one of his few roles as a good guy and plays it very well. It's hard, though, to hear his accent and think he's French. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the film was that all was based on "junk science," but in a way, even junk science makes it work well. Since ideas and theories are completely stupid, they are as "relevant" today as when the movies were made. And they are also like advancing - and they will always be. This is a great video to watch again and again. I've seen it five times this weekend and I could stay five times faster. The act is wonderful and science is fun. I strongly recommend it.
