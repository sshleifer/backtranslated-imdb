This is undoubtedly one of the funniest movies ever made. Amitabh, Arjun Singh, as a country fervor, is hilarious. The best thing is that laughter never stops. The plot is an old old story, where the baby is separated from the mother who sacrifices everything for her job - with a happy meeting at the end. There are offenders (Ranjit) and there are brothers (Sashi Kapoor) and there are vixens (Parveen Babhi) and there are lovers (Smita Patil) and there is a blind brother and a grandfather tossed to a good extent. But this movie is about Amitabh and that's all you remember at the end of it. Amitabh comes to the city to make a decent living, and his delivery of dialogue and manners are hilarious. Later, in the film, he turns into the Angry Young Man, who is famous, but humor remains. The memorable pieces include walking, talking and speaking in English, the song (gungaroo re bhand, meera nachi thi) and everything with my dadoo. Generally, I was laughing laughing along the movie. If you want 3 hours of entertainment with Amitabh at its absolute best - that's it. It will easily give it a 10/10.
