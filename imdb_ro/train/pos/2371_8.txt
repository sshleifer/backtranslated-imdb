I suggested that I rent this movie to my friend and was forced to see the movie and said it was okay. I thought the title was a bit camouflaged because the version in our store was called "The Fear: Halloween Night". I expected this movie to be somewhat Halloween with a kind of killer wood. But it opened with a good scene and the killer immediately killed two victims and broke twenty years later, where his son who saw him killed the two men (including his mother) and even witnessed the suicide of his father went in an isolated cabin the forest with his friends and his girlfriend, where he tries to face his fears, until a wooden statue comes back to life with his father's spirit. Pretty good for a sequel and I have never seen the first one.
