Generally, I like something easy and fun, so this movie should not have appealed to me. But it got me started. The story of the choices and challenges of a family seems obvious, but it raises the question: "If it were my family, my choice?" I cried and laughed when they did, because I really felt what the people involved felt. It was difficult to look into places, but it's harder to come back. The story is true and life is sometimes difficult to follow! Shows what filming can do without sex, violence or special effects: a good story is a good story by itself. The best and most unpredictable stories are all true. Like real life, you really do not know what will happen next, or why people do the things they do!
