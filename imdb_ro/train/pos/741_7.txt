I was just a little young for this, but I was supposed to see him. There is a great music that many people mentioned, but no one seems to notice a very rare occurrence of "Angel," a musical piece, mostly ignored but once popular. They were wearing white apparel marked by "Foxes Century 20," and they all seem to be trying to feed themselves in the camera's field of view. Keygeist Gregg Giuffria remains the most important group of bands, and never managed to get a lot of haircuts! Cherie Currie (ex-Runaways singer) begins a short but notable career that works here, and is quite memorable with Jodie Foster and the rest. (Her top 3-D scenes from "Parazit" and UFO observation in "The wavelength" kept us looking at all for a while). <br /> <br /> It's not a masterpiece, but it keeps a piece of time so everyone can look and ask.
