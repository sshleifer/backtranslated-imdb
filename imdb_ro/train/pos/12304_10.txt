this is a great movie. I like when Ning climbs to make ink, and skeletons follow him, but fortunately he avoided them, opened the window and never saw them. xiao qian is also very cute. and when he stuck his needle to Wu's ass, he's hysterical. and when he says love is the greatest thing on earth, while sitting between two swords is also great. then the part where they eat their buns while watching the man kill more people. then you see him singing poems when he runs to get rid of wolves. love scenes are romantic, xiao qian and ning look cute together. add comic timer, giant tongue, and u have horror, romance, comedy, all at once. not to mention gorgeous special effects for the 90s.
