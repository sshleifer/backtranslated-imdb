I do not know how and why this movie has a low rating on IMDb. This movie, accompanied by "I'm curious: blue" is a masterpiece. The only thing that will let you down in this movie is if you do not like the movie process, not like psychology or if you expect hardcore pornography. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie that you will want to watch for your relaxation; is a movie you want to see as any other masterpiece with time, attention and care. ****** SUMMARY MAY CONTAIN A SPOILER OR TWO ******* The main thing about this movie is that it combines the entire film into a movie so sometimes you forget that fiction is not real. <br /> <br /> The film is like many movies in one: <br /> <br /> 1. A political documentary about the Swedish social system at the time. Which, in many ways, are still relevant to this day. Interviews by a young woman named Lena. <br /> <br /> 2. A narrative about a director, Vilgot Sjoman, who makes a movie ... deals with a relationship with his star in the film and about how he should never have been involved with people with who was supposed to work. 3. The film Vilgot makes. This is a young woman named Lena (IE # 2), who is very young and very politically active, making a documentary (IE # 1). It is also a coming of age and in it sexuality, and freedom of that. The magical and pure brilliance of "I'm curious: yellow / blue" is how these three elements are cut together. At one point, watch an interview about politics and the next you see what the interviewer does behind the scenes, but he does so well that sometimes you forget that it's the narrative. Another thing is the dynamic between "yellow" and "blue", which, if you see one, you have to see the other. "Blue" is not a sequel. I will try to explain it as well, because, to my knowledge, no other film did it, although it is a wonderful technique. Think of "yellow" as a living thing, real events in 14 scenes. A complete story. Think of "Blue" as all things between the 14 "Yellow" scenes you have not seen, is a complete story about it. <br /> In principle, these are parallel films ... the same story, spoken in two different ways. It was not until I saw the first 30 minutes of "blue" that I fully understood "Yellow" <br /> <br /> I hope this was useful for people who are discouraged by various influences because this movie changed the way I looked at the movie. Thanks for your time.
