A SHIRLEY TEMPLE temple short. <br /> <br /> May be tough at Buttermilk Pete's Cafe, when the local contingency of diaper-clad BABIES wars come for their honey break. <br /> <br /> The small primitive movie - a paradise of military films - offers a few chuckles, but little else: small talking words can begin to move in a short time. Shirley's Temple, playing a double French hip-swing, does not have much to do in this pre-celebrity performance. Highlight: the real signs of the baby's temperament when some of the children get unexpectedly sick and really sick in milk. Often overlooked or neglected today, short subjects with one and two drums were useful to studios as important motives for training for new or thriving talents both in front of and behind the room. The dynamics of creating a short subject of success was completely different from that of a lengthy film, something like writing a short story rather than a novel. Economics to produce in both budget and program terms and capable of portraying a wide range of materials, short subjects were the perfect completion of studio movies.
