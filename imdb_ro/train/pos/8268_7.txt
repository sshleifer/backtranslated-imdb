This is apparently the second remake of this film, which was filmed before in 1911 and 1918. And, in many ways, I remembered the movie later, A YANK AT OXFORD. Both films refer to a dreadful battle that reaches one of the world's top schools and, ultimately, both, ultimately shows a slow blow to team learning and decency. In this film, William Haines is "Tom Brown" and his main rival, "Bob," is played by Frances X. Bushman. And, in a supporting role, is Jack Pickford - always remembered as Mary's brother. Of these, Pickford is the best, as a sympathetic loser who becomes Tom's girlfriends - he actually has decent scenes and a dramatic moment just before the Big Game! All the standard clich√©s are there and the movie because it has been done so many times before, and since then, it offers some surprises. However, it is a pleasant film and it is a pleasant viewing. In my opinion, for a quieter college film, try Harold Lloyd's The FRESHMAN - football scenes are frankly more interesting and Harold is much more enjoyable and sympathetic than Tom Brown, annoying. FRESHMAN is probably the best college image you can find from the time. Another reason why BROWN AT HARVARD is a smaller image is that William Haines played essentially the same uncomfortable and bombastic character with the same plot again and again (like WESTPOINT and SET SMART, among others) you saw one of these movies, you've seen them all. Well done but definitely NOT original! And, because it's just a remix of his other movies, anyone who gives the movie a score of 10 is STRICGLY advised to see these other movies. <br /> <br /> 4/25/08 == I just checked and saw this little movie was the best rated IMDb movie since 1920 !! Talk about overvaluation! There are dozens and dozens of better movies - how was this movie to be # 1 is guessing someone.
