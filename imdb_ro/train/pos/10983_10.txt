"Gray Gardens" (1975) is the bizarre documentary of the Maysles brothers about Aunt Jackie Bouvier Kennedy Onassis and the first cousin who live as pigs in a 28-room villa in East Hampton, Long Island. Bouvier Beale, 78, dizzy and dry, and her daughter, Little Edie Beale, aged 56 (emotionally about 13 years old), a still beautiful woman who once had a promising future, lives isolated from the rest of the world , except for many cats and bridge raccoons. They are amused by beating all day, listening to their radio or singing to each other (They no longer have television) Their fall from society is amazing to learn and the viewer is drawn to these two very special, though obvious, dysfunctional people. One of the best documentaries ever made and yet another classic cult today.
