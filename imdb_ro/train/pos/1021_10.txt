The first and second seasons began in shock, with good episodes between mediums and sometimes with recourse to clich√© stories. But once it has begun to install the universe in which it exists and has begun to develop its characters, it has become much more fun and fun. <br /> <br /> The main reason why this show is due to four men: Richard Dean Anderson, Peter Deluise, Joseph Malozzie and Paul Mullie. Richard's sense of humor makes him look a lot better, Peter's direction is excellent and makes any episode much more fun, and Joe & Paul never make a funny, exciting episode together. <br /> <br /> Once you understand what the show is and know the characters, I doubt you do not like the show. For those who enter the show I propose the episodes "The Other Side", a serious episode and "Window of Opportunity," a classic comic relief episode.
