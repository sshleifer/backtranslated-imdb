I am disappointed that Reiser (who wrote the film) felt the need to use such profanity for no reason. Maybe it's his idea of ​​"adult" movies, a lot of ugly words with bathing humor thrown in? I thought better about him and I thought less about him for this movie. Falk's actor and a few moments of humor, as well as some important themes are what made me give him such a great rating. > It could be a good movie for adult children to look and laugh at their own people and their foibles. But the lack of attention paid to audiences seriously affects what could have been a family movie, but it fails. Of course, it's not worth spending money, though it would be worth a free watch on TV.
