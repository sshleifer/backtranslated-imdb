Jack Cassidy's tower like Ken Frankin was the perfect glow. Cassidy personified his arrogance, trust, charm and spirit - all with a little bad hatcher on his face. In my opinion, Jack Cassidy is by far the best killer (who appeared three times) in the Columbo series. This particular performance (and first) is my favorite Colombbo episode ever - my hands down. A Steven Spielberg, face to face, did a great job of the camera (yes, there were sometimes some camera noises on the actors) capturing shades and banter at different and intriguing angles between Columbo and Franklin. Also, the panoramic and tall images of Big Bear Lake, CA (Franklin's cabin house) were very impressive. If you have not seen this episode yet, then you owe it to yourself - it's a true masterpiece. Jack Cassidy was a very talented actor and singer. His charismatic personality was extremely infectious. His death in 1976, at the age of 49, was very sad and really very tragic - he certainly had the best years before him. Rest in peace Jack, you will live forever through your great work.
