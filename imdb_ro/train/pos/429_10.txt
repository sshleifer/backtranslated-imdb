It has been about 50 years since a film about romance and mysticism was made. The only two films I can think of are "Enchanted April" (1992) and "The Enchanted Cottage" (1945). Both films have used wonderful actors, you do not see. In both films, all actors gave the best romantic performances. "Enchanted April" is about four English women after the First World War who are unhappy with their lives and find happiness in Italy on vacation. It's amazing "Enchanted April" was made in 1992. It's remarkable as a classic.
