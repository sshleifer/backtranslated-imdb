This was one of the DVDs I recently bought in a set of six called "French films" to wash the French before our planned holidays in beautiful Provence this year. Until now, as we have improved the French, we have greatly improved our appreciation of French cinema. What a fresh air taste in the fresh, predictable, unimaginable air. What a good example for scriptwriters, actors, directors and cinemas to follow. It was so stimulating to see two characters that can be identified in the main roles, without having to be glossy figures of magazines. <br /> <br /> The other thing I liked about this movie was the slow character and the construction of the plot that kept you guessing how it would end. Is there any good in this egoist, who is constantly living on his seemingly naive benefactor with the kind of contempt that would display an ex-con? Will our poor sexual, poor, poor, heroic heroine prove to be the answer to her dreams and the situation that fate gave him? The visitor is intrigued by these questions, and the actors reveal the slow and compelling responses, as they face events that cause and change their feelings towards each other. Once you see this movie, like me, you may want to see it again. I still have to solve the director's psychological reason for the subject in the role of the password-release officer and some subtle shades of camera activity deserve a second look. Crying requires a little imagination when our hero has the chance to help our heroine abused and overworked in the office. You also need to be conscious of believing in her bright lip reading and how some of the action goes into place. But if you go for a walk with this example of the French cinema at maximum, you will go out more than satisfied. Four out of five stars for me.
