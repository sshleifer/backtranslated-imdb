That's what I call a growth movie. Each character is different and better at the end - and it's also because a woman knows that the place they have chosen is a "bath of love". Josie Lawrence, the most famous comedian, really shines like the woman who brings all these changes. Even the men in this film go from being selfish to better people. The book has remained very authentic to the novel, which is a plus in my book because I am a librarian. The breathing landscape and the message of authentic love.
