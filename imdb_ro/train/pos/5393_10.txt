I was probably one of the few Australians who did not watch tennis when this series was broadcast. I have to say when William McInnes first appeared to be a bad actor! But after the series continued, he reduced his performance and loved him a lot. He was such a rotten guy, but he made me laugh. I watched the show to see Hugo Speers (Heart and Bones, The Full Monty) and Tom Long (SeaChange, Two Hands). It was interesting to see that Speers plays a beautiful and quiet man and even more interesting to look at Tom Longs muscles! Sigh ... Seriously, Long's performance was a total and brilliant shock. He stole the show. Martin Sacks was also good in a small role, and the lead actress set in an entertainment show. I would recommend this program if you enjoy stories with a twist and watch Tom Long walk without a shirt on ...
