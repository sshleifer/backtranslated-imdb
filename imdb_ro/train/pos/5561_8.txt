Of course, this film will only appeal to a certain audience; namely stoners and people who think the same. <br /> <br /> That being said, if you are one of these people, this movie is MUST. In fact, I think it should be mandatory for the main stores to sell a copy of it to anyone who buys their first bong. What Gray's Monty Python is for geeks and nerds, so is this movie for potheads. I saw this movie for the first time 10 years ago or so, and I still do it every time I watch it. The banknotes lived up perfectly with lifestyle, much better than last-day knockoffs, such as Half-Baked. There is no plot, so to speak; the film is rather a collection of different sketches; while movie protagonists wander in Los Angeles in legendary fog. In spite of this, the film has an excellent sense of rhythm and does not shoot at all. Many people read Up In Smoke as C & C's best work, but I should say the next movie is superior. So, if you are in mood for an hour and a half of belly laugh, light up, tone and let your mind float away =) <br /> <br /> Oh, and CHONG FREE!
