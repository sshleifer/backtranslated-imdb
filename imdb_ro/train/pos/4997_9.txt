This is a great movie for any fan of action movies in Hong Kong. In addition to his little plot, poor drama and comedy bits, the film is an action packed with weapons and martial arts action. They kept me entertained from start to finish. I thought Shannon Lee was great in the movie. Having a director of action like Corey Yuen is what makes Hong Kong's action strong. This modern action movie is highly recommended!
