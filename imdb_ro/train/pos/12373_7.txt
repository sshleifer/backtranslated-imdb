Time did not enjoy this movie. After a controversial adaptation of Jeffrey Konvitz's best-seller, this movie now looks like a simple mass version of your typical spookfest. The awesome touches (especially the crazy, in front of the top finale), this is basically a glaring film for those people who do not care too much about the genre. He has an extraordinary cast in small roles (Jose Ferrer, Ava Gardner, Eli Wallach, Burgess Meredith, Christopher Walken and many others), but something tells me that the producers wanted a so expensive distribution to convince the audience that it is not your movie poor (70th-century disaster film makers had a similar idea). I liked the way to see familiar faces, but the story is very bad and, regardless of the high class that the movie is supposed to be, it works at the level of exploitation film in the 1970s (it is not a bad thing). Still, it's a nice movie, especially for those viewers who enjoy superb views. As usual, Albert Whitlock's matte work is remarkable. Overall, quite fun.
