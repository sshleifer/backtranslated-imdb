It was such a treat when this show was on because it was such a fresh, innovative and original show. This makes every show I've ever seen seem boring. When the first episode was broadcast, I was entranced and became attached to all the characters so easily (which is not usually the case because I always hate some characters). It is a shame that this show will not have a third season, because it has to be one of the best shows I've ever seen and that does not exaggerate my feelings for the show. Nothing can ever replace Pushing beads, because what could ABC find to replace this show? This is easily the best TV show. <br /> <br /> I came for Kristin Chenoweth and I stayed because I fell in love with the whole show.
