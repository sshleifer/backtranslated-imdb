The events of 11 September 2001 do not require a human interest in addition to the training of the beginner firefighter or the progress of the two French brothers. In my opinion, it would have been better to give up this. I think the directors tried too hard, they probably felt that the events of the day needed a story like a background. The comment of one of the police - "this is a disneyworld" is apt. However, it is compelling viewing for events. Filming was in all the right places at the right times, no other film of that day matches what they shot.
