My college professor says Othello can be Shakespeare's most beautiful drama. I do not know if I still agree with him. I bought this video version of the movie. First I love Kenneth BRanagh as Iago, he was perfectly complicated and worked very well in this adaptation. Surprisingly, he did not direct it, but played a role. Lawrence Fishburne shows that American actors can play Shakespeare as well as British actors. not that there was a British problem with the American one. In fact, if we work together, then Shakespeare can reach the masses he deserves to do in a rich way. In addition to other Shakespeare tragedies, it deals with the issue of race. Something that has existed since the beginning of time. The relationship between Iago and Emilia could have been better and would have shown the complicity of their union. While Othello loves Desdemona wholeheartedly, he is weak for jealousy and fears that he will lose it with a non-Moorish man like Cassio. It's an extraordinary scene at the end of the movie, but I will not reveal the end of the movie. IT is worth watching. I think they have written many lines at 2 hours, but they always edit Shakespeare.
