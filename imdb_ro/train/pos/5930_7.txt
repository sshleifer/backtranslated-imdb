The monstrous spirit-mother-son (Alice Krige and Brian Krause) sucks the virgin's life force, and the newest target is Tanya quite alone (Madchen Amick). However, these monsters are allergic to cat scratches ... I have never been a fan of more skeptical bestsellers, better seen than the King, Koontz or Barker, but this B movie, written by Dung himself, is not nearly so bad be. Yes, sometimes something surprisingly surprising: a good old-fashioned cemetery, a bright sound scene and a Gothic scene, a mirror showing the monstrous form of the villains, etc. Of course, the movie is polluted by Mr. Dung's sweet-mithed dialogue and the obsession of all the toilet tactics places to kill the fat people, leading to a totally useless subplot of the violator teacher, but there are roses in the manure.
