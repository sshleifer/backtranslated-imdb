An old fan of Bette Midler, I have to say that recorded live concerts are my favorites. Bette fascinates us with her jokes and brings us to tears with her ballads. A literal rainbow of excitement and talent, Bette shows us the best of his solid repertoire as well as new songs from the album "Bette of Roses". Spanning generations of people it offers something for everyone. The only and divine Divine proves here that she is the most powerful talented performer around her.
