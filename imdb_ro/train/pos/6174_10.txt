It is very regrettable that most people outside Canada believe that the only things Canada produces are snow, ammunition and hockey players. This movie is the second superlative Canadian movie I've seen in recent weeks (the first was "The Red Violin"), much better than all the best Hollywood efforts. Gustad Noble is nothing but that; he is an employee of the middle-aged bank in Bombay in the 1970s. This film explores sensitively the different things that happen to him about his family, his friends and his work, and their effect on him. At the same time, it is a fascinating presentation, and I would assume an accurate picture of urban and middle class urban life at the time. However, I was somewhat prepared for this, by reading Rohinton Mistry's book a few years ago. The movie, as expected, can not surprise all the complexities of the book, but if you want to read a great book and see a very good movie, read and see "Such a long journey."
