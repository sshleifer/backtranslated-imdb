Writer-director Brian De Palma is best known for the series of movies that have been called, somehow unfair, "Hitchcock imitations". Unlike popular belief, De Palma does not destroy Hitchcock; he borrows elements of story or character that might have been seen in a Hitchcock movie and then spread over them in a more violent and modern way. Like Hitchcock, De Palma is known for mixing death dipped in blood with macabre humor. "Dressed to Kill," made again in 1980, is probably the most famous film of De Palma, Hitchcockian, and probably the best. The story involves a serial killer with a serial killer who follows both a burned housewife (played by Angie Dickinson) and a prostitute (played by Nancy Allen). Yes, it reminds you clearly of "Psycho," but De Palma's film is as technically and creatively ingenuous. The sequence of the museum is particularly well recorded and edited; the scene of the elevator is also one of the most murderous murders ever killed on the film. "Dressed to Kill" may not be a complete original, but I would say it definitely deserves your time. Rated R. 105 minutes. 9 of 10.
