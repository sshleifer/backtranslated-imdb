I think this is the most powerful film that HBO Pictures has done so far. This movie should have been released in theaters so the audience can see on the big screen. It's available on the video, so be sure to look for it and check it out. Chris Gerolmo did a great job with direction and script. The performances of Stephen Rea, Donald Sutherland and Jeffery DeMunn are impeccable. A masterpiece of the genre.
