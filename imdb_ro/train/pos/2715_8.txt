Quod erd demonstrandum was a series of brilliant TVs and was really one of the very few value appointments! I suspect that at this time of the TIVO and recording devices it would be much better than in 1982. I certainly expect the availability on DVD! with other television shows like The Wild, Wild West, The Bearcats and Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., all of which are a big fan of, QED has a much more intellectual quality. However, he did not suffer this - the dialogue was alive and the action was high. The show was released in the UK as Mastermind and had something from the BBC but with better production values ​​than the BBC usually at that time. I was a 19 year old boy when this series originally ran and had too much to do in my life to make time for television. I remember my mother's sake, however, calling me to remember that Q.E.D. she was on the phone and I watched it together. Wonderful memories. <br /> <br /> Truly, Q.E.D. is a sad loss and, if it could be done with the same quality and values ​​today, I would love to see it make a comeback.
