This is a tepid drama, which does not cover any new reason, does not restore all the clich√©s and is puzzled by the facts. For example, Munich is a very flat city. So why is it hilly in the movie? For example, the end of the Great War of 1918 was not a surrender, but an armistice. However, it is announced as a teaching. For example, European news vendors did not (and did not) shout titles while shaking their newspapers. However, this strictly American habit is used in the film. For example, the Nazis did not adopt the German eagle until they took power, but there is a desk, while Hitler delivers one of his forklifts. Indeed, most of this disappointing production is less than the Hitlerite oratorio. The film also perpetuates the myth that the beer rifle was launched in Munich Hoffbrauhaus. It was not. Robert Carlyle makes a beautiful portrait of his subject. But his supportive distribution is appropriate at best and often not even. These comments are based only on the first episode. One can hope the second will be better, but you do not bet on it.
