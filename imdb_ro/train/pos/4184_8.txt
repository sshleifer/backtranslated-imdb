Some war films succeed when others do not, and can be judged from a variety of angles. The humanist angle, one in which you feel the raw emotions (the terror of being attacked, the camaraderie among the soldiers, the heavy attempts that people encounter in battle, etc.) are always movies that I find convincing. Movies like Das Boot and A Midnight Clear are just two examples of movies that you feel connected to the characters in the movie. This film also succeeds at this level. He speaks of "the highest honor" and honor is doing the right thing. These 23 soldiers have done well, have honor, and are acknowledged in a way totally incompatible with Western thought, but in the end it is a true story of honor. Unforgettable movie. Based on the true story.
