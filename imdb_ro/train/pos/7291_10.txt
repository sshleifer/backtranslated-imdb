When you usually watch a short movie, you always fear that the person who is creating the movie is trying to throw too much in it. This is not the case. A wonderful story about a young woman who has had enough forces and other worldly forces who are trying to help accomplish things. Eric Etebari is doing a wonderful job of representing the spirit of twisted justice and helping to convey the complexity of a blurred line of good and wrong. Both the little girl and the father provide great performances in this wonderful short film, but Eric's performance is surely a storm of show in this story. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie for the sophistication, performance and great story.
