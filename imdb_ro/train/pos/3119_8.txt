"The Bourne Ultimatum" starts imprudently in the middle of the climb and impulsively explodes from there as Jason Bourne (Matt Damon, absolutely superb) follows the brain behind the CIA of the blacks who turned him into the perfect killer in a final attempt to find out his true identity. David Strathairn, a devastating ice, as "the man behind the curtain", adds to the routine distribution of kings, including Joan Allen (excellent) and Julia Stiles (nonexistent). , I wanted Paul Greengrass's camera to remain static for at least a few minutes of downtime. However, this is a perfect way to capture the tense, claustrophobic sensation of hand-to-hand scenes of hand-to-hand combat, and works just as well in tracking scenes that are mostly on foot and over massive roofs occasional -sus. Part of the fun of the Bourne series is to continue glob-hopping and manipulating technology and communications that seem to defy the laws of physics and current capabilities. Bourne's films seem to exist in a real kind of real-world hyper-magic, based on technology. It makes no sense that everyone seems to be right at the right time at the right time, but I will be cursed if it is not an explosion to follow them. emotionally and involving Franka Potente, the writers are trying to create an emotional bond between Damon and Stiles, but she is so impudent with an actress that she never takes anything. However, this can be forgiven, unlike "Identity" and "Supremacy," this "Ultimatum" reveals all and finally we learn the truth about Bourne's past. It's a fun and satisfying conclusion for the series, and if they have a good sense and Damon desires his wish, it will be the perfect end of it.
