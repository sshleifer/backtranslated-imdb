Like a dead baseball, this film goes against what I expect in a sporting movie: authentic sporting action, credible characters and an original story line. While "Angels in the Outfield" fails miserably in the first category, it succeeds successfully in the last two. "Angels" intertwine the story of Roger and J.P., two Anaheim kids who fall in love with baseball but look for a family with the Angels Woebegone franchise, fighting to attract fans and win games. Impelled by his father's promise that they will be a family only when Angels win the vampire, Roger asks heavenly help and receives it in the form of spirits spinning in diamonds, inclined to change the downward spiral of the franchise. And when short-term manager George Knox (portrayed by Danny Glover) starts to believe what Roger sees, the team suddenly hopes to change their season - and Roger and JP find something to believe in. Glover in particular performance, and Tony Danza, playing a pitcher, did well, despite having a ZERO idea clearly about how to get out of the win!
