"Jared Diamond made a point in the first episode that other peoples of the world did not have animals to domesticate, but Europeans did, and that explains why we succeeded in making steel and inventing complex cars." It is obvious that the person who wrote this comment did not understand the reasoning behind this documentary or the original book. Do not destroy this great piece through your simple mind. The reasons are much more complex than the one you mentioned. Please read the book as a great source of information. I liked very much. This book is even taught as a text book at some universities.
