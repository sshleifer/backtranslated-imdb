Very good drama, though it seemed to have some empty areas, letting spectators complement the action for themselves. I can imagine my life in this way for someone who can neither read nor write. This movie simply hit the real world: the wife who is suddenly the only supporter, the living relatives and their quarrels, the troubled child who is beaten and then usually escapes school, a wealthy husband who takes egg eggs and buy beer with him. 2 fingers up.
