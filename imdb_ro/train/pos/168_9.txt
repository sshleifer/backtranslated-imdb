This is one of Joan Crawford's best talks. It was Gable-Crawford's first pair and made it clear to MGM and the audience that they were a sizzling team, leading the studio to make seven films with them as co-stars. convincingly describes the descendant descendancy of a brother and a sister who, after their father has lost everything from the collapse of the stock market, have to deal with themselves and work for life.

If you like Crawford in this kind of do not miss "Paid", which he did a year earlier, which is also among Talkie's best early interpretations. <br /> <br />
