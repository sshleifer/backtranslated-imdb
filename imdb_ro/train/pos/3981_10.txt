This is my fourth short Joe McDoakes I've seen so far the most funny one. In this case, Joe takes voice lessons from a recording that shares Charles Boyer and Ronald Colman. When he goes to Warner Bros. Studio (the company behind this series, incidentally) asks Jack Carson for directions that are so confusing. He then meets actor George O'Hanlon (who is also McDoakes), who speaks in his more usual voice, which is not too far from Geroge Jetson later, and reaches the set where he directs the director directly. I'm going to stop there and tell you how funny I've found it all, and I was fascinated by the movie stars filming near the end. The final scene was especially boring, so on this note, go to YouTube if you want to look so you want to be in Picutres!
