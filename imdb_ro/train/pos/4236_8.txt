Take this movie for what it is, not for a remake, but for a completely different approach to the same concept. It's not an epic like the original, it's more like a popcorn thriller. From a visual point of view, it's incredible. Everything was OK. <br /> <br /> For what it is, I think the movie is great, but I like everything Burton did. People have to calm down and stop acting like the end of the b / c world of this film. It was not supposed to be a remake and it is not. <br /> <br /> The end was cold. . I took it as a parallel universe.
