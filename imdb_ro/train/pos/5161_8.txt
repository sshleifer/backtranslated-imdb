Kirk and the crew penetrate a lonely planet where the sun is about to explode. They intend to evacuate the inhabitants, but find the deserted place, except for Mr. Atoz operating a high-tech library. Despite attempting to get a direct response from him about their location, Atoz is indifferent to their questions and insists he has to "make a selection as soon as possible while there is still time." They have no idea what he is talking about, but they are wandering about looking at mirrors by viewing viewers and seeing images of the planet's past. Then, while a disc is in the viewer, Kirk passes through the door and is magically transported back in time to what he would show on Earth as the time of Louis XIV (1660s). When McCoy and Spock follow, another disc is in the viewer and they are sent to an age-old hell of ice. It's too late to realize that the library is a car and a time deposit. While Kirk's visit is rather brief and not so interesting, Spock and McCoy are more full of events, Spock lowers his head over the heels for Mariette Hartley - who was sent in this terrible place as a punishment. Scenes with Spock are especially interesting and very atypical of the normal logic type. Spock's departure from norm, inventive wild scenario, and very diverse locations make this an exceptional episode - a thing worth seeing. <br /> <br /> FYI - Ian Wolfe, the great character actor, played Mr. Atoz. I'm a great fan of older movies and I've seen him as a supporting and jewelery player in countless films in the 1930s and 1940s and he has shown almost exactly how he did in this 1969 episode. Interesting though, despite the search ancient, lived another 23 years - die for over 95 years!
