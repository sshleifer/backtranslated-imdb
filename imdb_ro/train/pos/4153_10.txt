this was a fantastic episode. I saw a clip on YouTube and I vowed that if I ever showed up on television, I would stick to the set to watch. I've finished watching with a friend of mine who happens to be gay, and we both cried out at the end. it was a really well written and unimaginable episode of the forbidden love between two police officers who, indeed, were (in Coop's words) "the lucky ones." these are episodes like this, which make the Cold Case one of the most captivating and much loved works of CBS television magic. I'm looking forward to more episodes and a resumption of the movie "Forever Blue", because I will always watch again and again.
