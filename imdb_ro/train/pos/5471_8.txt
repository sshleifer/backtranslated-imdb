In 1933, this film had numerous rebates, because she was very much in charge of the story and the fact that Lily Powers (Barbara Stanwyck) would do anything to get wealth and great power. Lily's father forced her daughter to become a prostitute at the age of 14 and grew up in a steel factory in a city with very poor people, and her father made a speakeasy that brought him all sorts of male characters who had eyes on Lily. As the story progresses, Lily meets with man after man and eventually finds a guy who has everything and is a chairman of the playboy bank. It's great to see a very young John Wayne (Jimmy McCoy Jr.) who was only 25 years old when this picture was produced and Jimmy did not even get to Lily, not even for lunch. A very young George Brent (Coutland Trenholm) plays alongside Barbara Stanwyck and both have played great performances. This is a wonderful 1933 film by Darryl F. Zanuck, which was closed for many years and only recently shown on the silver screen. This film is quite gentle compared to what we see on Hollywood screens today, but in 1933 it was very naughty to watch this type of movie. enjoy
