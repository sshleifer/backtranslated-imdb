1.) This movie was amazing! I watched her while I was in the city next to the one she grew up in! I went and saw the buildings that the story took place. Generally, I liked this movie, One of Jake Gyllenhaal's best! Also, my favorite parts were the science fair and all the time with his father. They were so sad, it seemed. Homer wanted to follow his dream, and his father did not seem to care in one way or the other. The labeling line is true. "Sometimes a dream is bright enough to ignite the sky." 2.) The way this movie was filmed was impeccable, it was so credible that it could have been recorded in the 1950s. The dress was accurate and had the slang down. Definitely recommend this movie!
