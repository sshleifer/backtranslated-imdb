I remember the first time I saw Sabrina when she came to UK TV on ITV1 when I was 13/14. I'm 24 years old and still love as much as I did when I first watched them. I have a stick from some of my friends because I'm still following a "kids show", but I do not care! lol Caroline Rhea as "Hilda" is my personal favorite character and later Morgan has also become another favorite character. I remember spending so much time watching some special events that honor Sabrina on Nickeleoden TV in the UK. I love Mellissa Joan-Hart, she was great in "Clarrissa Explains All", but much better in this. I was eviscerated when they decided to finish it! I hope it will be released soon on DVD here in the UK - I will be the first on the line! lol x
