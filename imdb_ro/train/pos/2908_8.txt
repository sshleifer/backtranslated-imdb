A journey of discovery, this film follows the lives of a family living in a sleepy, insular town in British Columbia. Typical and sensational, residents are pleased to be able to live their lives around until a young, fresh teacher with new ideas arrives and brings with it life on the continent. Slowly, their indolent state is awakened, the father (and the director of the local school) is looking for enthusiasm, the mother for stability, the oldest daughter for love and the youngest for power. While not an incredible or basic cinema, the film is pleasing and enjoyable for a tired night when the wind blows. Unfortunately, I doubt anyone outside of Canada will find it easy to access.
