The biggest surprise in this film was the performance of Daryl Hannah. Rather than play the blonde ditzy stereotypical roles she usually makes, she plays a clever, clever, tired character in the world. She does not have a huge role, but she does a wonderful job portraying Lois Harlan as a tired, though accustomed woman, covering her boss's indiscretions.
