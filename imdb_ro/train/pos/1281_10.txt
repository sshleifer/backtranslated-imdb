This movie is just as good as it is difficult to find. The film's hero (and writer and director) is Simon Geist - a man with an agenda. He creates a false magazine just to have the authority to interview the pigs in Los Angeles - actors, models, musicians - who think their defecation does not smell. With intelligent dialogue, Zucovic manages to do so. Of course, the budget for this movie was probably the one you paid for a used car, but this movie is so solid and so well written that it works very well. Any person who can resume Edward Munk's "The Scream" in reflecting a silver trashbin at a local caf√© should be nominated for a certain type of prize. Give this movie a chance and listen to what it says ... because they have made the same car since 1986 ... it's called the "car". Bravo, Zucovic, bravo!
