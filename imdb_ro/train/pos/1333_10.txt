I like this movie very much I have watched it over and over. I do not see why anyone might think this movie was not good. You may have seen better or anything else I would personally like. It's one of my favorite movies and I'm not Hindi at all, but I do not like it. It might be something like Pretty Woman, but I did not see that, and I do not think it's better than that. I do not know why you're shooting, but maybe you have a good reason, but I guess I told her enough, but I absolutely love this movie, and to those who say it's not good at all, then I wonder why it followed and what movies considered good. Like everyone else I've followed with them liked too, so I am surprised that many people do not like it. As for Rani Mukherjee (I think this is your name), it is very beautiful and my favorite actress ever!
