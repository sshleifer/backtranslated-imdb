Most people who have seen this movie think it's the best movie ever made. I do not agree, but this movie is very good. Tony is a bad guy and knows he's intimidating and uses it to move on. It's about him and how he goes from washing the dishes to a huge house and a cocaine office over the desk. If you want a family movie, then that's not the way to go, but if you want mobs and revenge and that, then you will love it.
