A spectacular horror movie that will give you chills once you have settled with it. The atmosphere is very creepy and elegant, the score is cold, but the best film is the performance. It's rare to be scared of performance and this solid action of this movie plays an important role in the scare factor. The story is very interesting and draws your attention from the first few minutes. Although the black woman does not have much time on the screen, she makes the appearances to rebuke audiences in some brilliant scenes. Dialogues are very descriptive and make your imagination work when it really becomes scary. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance, watch this at the theater is a totally different experience, but as scary as this movie. This is one of the best Ghost movies ever and is aimed at people who want to be scared.
