CHANCES ARE is a charming romantic fantasy about a woman (Cybill Shepherd) whose husband (Christopher McDonald) is killed shortly after she finds out she is pregnant. Then we see the husband in the sky, leaving his powers know he was taken too soon and that his wife needs him. He is said to be able to return to the earth, but not as himself. In 19, I saw daughter Shepherd (Mary Stuart Masterson) preparing to graduate from college and meet a young man (Robert Downey Jr.), who turns out to be the reincarnation of her father. The film is a bit predictable ... the story goes to all the places you expect, but it's so charming to play with an energetic cast (especially Shepherd and Downey) that you can not help but teach you the fun. The shepherd was rarely seen on the screen to make better use of her and she and Downey are supported by a talented group of actors supporting roles. An enchanting and charming fantasy that will thicken you and delight you.
