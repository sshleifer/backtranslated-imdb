I wanted to see this movie a long time, being a fan of Peter Cushing and David McCallum. I agree that the romantic sub-plot was a waste of time, but McCallum's talent shines through this minor role. Thanks to the heavens for Turner Classic that broadcast the show last week. I can imagine that there were a lot of problems with the children after the war, especially with the way things were in the 1950s. Some of the guys are a little scary. I certainly would not want to meet them on a well-lit street, much less a dark one. There have been some good insights into the feelings of a firefighter, or, as he calls it, a firefighter.
