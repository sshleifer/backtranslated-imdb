"Kaabee" describes the weights of a woman in pre- and during the Second World War, raising her children alone after her husband was jailed for "murder." This movie was directed by Yamada Youji and, as expected, the atmosphere of this movie is truly wonderful. Although the historical correctness of some scenes, especially the beach scene, is a suspect. The act in this movie is absolutely incredible. I am amused at how they have been able to collect this award for a 2008 film. Yoshinaga Sayuri, perhaps the most decorated actress still active in Japan, will undoubtedly win more individual awards for her performance in this film. Shoufukutei Tsurube in a supporting role was also beautiful as well. It was, however, Asano Tadanobu, who made the most impressive interpretation, portraying perfectly the ritual of his character and the difficult situation he was in. Pre-war pre-filming movies are not my stuff, but because of wonderful direction and action, I was totally absorbed by the story. It was also not an extreme left-wing stupor like "Yuunagi no Machi, Sakura no Kuni" and examines the controversial and delicate problem of government oppression and brainwashing that occurred at that time in Japan. Great film, highly recommended for all viewers.
