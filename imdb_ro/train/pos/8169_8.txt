This is a tough and quite convincing mess. Corbin Bernson is very much at the head of this film with his glamorous portrait of Ludovic. Linda Hoffman plays his deceptive wife and is very light in her eyes - unfortunately, for her, the little "event" with the type of pool brings a severe punishment in a way that the best doctor knows best - shame about that pretty smile ! The last half-hour of the film is dedicated to Bernson's character, losing it completely, and the spotlight falls on a young actress called Virginya Keehne. An extremely talented performer, she scribbles the spotlight from the moment her arms break. And beautiful legs!
