I can not believe that others have had such a serious view of all this. God, there was a lot of fun rooting for Hass-a-long Cassidy. It has been a great tribute to Western series for a few years. It was not supposed to be an excellent cinematic experience, unless it was. So, if there was not a great bonanza of special effects. It was a fun, a tongue in the cheek, look at the old West. Man, relax and rejoice.
