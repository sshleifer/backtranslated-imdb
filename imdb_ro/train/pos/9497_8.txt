Very fantastic ... it has everything: nudity, good scenes of fighting, gore, action, explosions, etc. She also sees the wonderful Belinda Mayne as Ingrid - not Olga, as the other reviewer pointed out - though Olga later turns into Ingrid in the movie (you'll have to watch him to see what I mean). I do not bother going into the story because it's too long and not very interesting. The relationship between Ingrid and her brother Bo (Robert Ginty) is interesting - watch the scene for towel theft to see what I mean. The battle scenes were once good enough, and then spoiled by ghosts that looked like they were made by the team that made City of the Walking Dead (strange colored hair from the wounds of the neck). I would advise fans of low-budget garbage to check if they can follow a copy - but quite rare and I have never seen anyone bothering to release it, so it will become increasingly rare in a few years. Anyway, we only recommend Belinda Mayne's wonderful scenes! This lady is a fox!
