Absolutely the first movie that scared me to death. I caught when I looked at my big brother (r.i.p.). It was on a black-and-white TV and not a good image, but I was interested. Shortly after, my colleagues bought a set of colors and, like luck, The Million Dollar shows it on a Sunday. I forgot most of the intrigue, but it did not take long for you ... and I was scared that I had difficulty sleeping that night! I mean, it was just a movie, but it involved a creature that not only came from space, but you did not hear it or you saw it ... and once it caught you, it was too late. Even now, after all this time, I have left my movements. A true classic, and even better a classic I've seen scared of pants from a new generation! Long live The Blob!
