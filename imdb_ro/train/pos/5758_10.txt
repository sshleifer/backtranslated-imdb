In my opinion, this is one of the best action films of the 1970s. It not only has a great distribution, it is also loaded with blows and wild explosions that are still impressive today. The story relates to a veteran of Vietnam (Kris Kristofferson) who is recruited by his brother (Jan-Michael Vincent) to help clean up the criminal element in a small town and what happens when Kris begins to take advantage of his position and gets so bad as the criminals he was hired to get rid of. It's great to see Kris playing against the guy. Bernadette Peeters and Victoria Principal offer both great support as the respective ladies of the two male stars. Jan-Michael features real movie characters in this movie. I do not think Vigilante Force is on the video, but sometimes it's on TV. It's a great movie for guys who like movies.
