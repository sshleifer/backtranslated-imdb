A highly animated Animated Sci-Fi movie, and sincerely, I like uniqueness no matter how it tends to be, better or worse. This French film is quite interesting to watch, the technical side is innovative, like "Waking Life" that I recently watched. It took me a long time to get used to the black and white style, but eventually I like it, the sketch images are really fantastic! The contracted future world is a symbol of the final destination of the human race, which I love very much. The whole plot is fine for a Sci-Fi, not so interesting, but it's OK, like some Hollywood products, a huge conspiracy about human eternity, a small clich√© and the twisted end is not so convincing, some developments are too simple and insipid, and the whole movie is too long. So, I fell in love with the style this movie is showing, others are not that good. About eternity of life, I think most people have come to unanimity that we do not want eternity because they demolish in the sense of life, we order our lives because they are limited and meaningful if everyone can live forever, so the world of the world will become a disaster a chaos. Leaving someone you love is hard and upsetting, but that's also a way of showing that our lives are authentic and that all your emotions are fulfilling your life and making the world colorful and lively.
