This is not an art film, it is fun on the table. <br /> <br /> Lot of beautiful people, t & a, and action. It seemed very fun to me. It's not supposed to be an intellectual stimulator, it's a fun movie to watch! Jesse and Chace are funny, which is just sauce. It definitely deserves a rental. So, in summary, I would recommend checking for a bit of entertainment Friday night with the boys or even your girl (if she likes to see other girls do it!) The villains are also good . Vinnie, Corey Large, the Hatian guy from Heroes. Outrageous people.
