Yes, a real classic! It's about British drama, realism and the minimal use of special effects (and swollen budgets). We have seen this drama last time when it was last shown on British Territorial Television in 1994. It should really be seen by anyone who likes a scary plot without big names but no action. In fact, copywriting is now owned by someone unknown, and as such this great drama is unlikely to be broadcast anytime soon. Recently, I recently won The Woman In Black on VHS, so now I'm going to be able to enjoy this really great British drama. You should try and enjoy it! Mark R. Horobin
