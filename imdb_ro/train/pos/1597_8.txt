This is a kind of movie for a snowy afternoon afternoon when the rest of the world can go with your own business as you get down in a big chair and relax for a few hours. The wonderful performances of Cher and Nicolas Cage (as usual) gently arrange the plot. There are no rapids to cross, without dangerous waters, only a warm and full of witchcraft in the life of New York at the highest level. A family film in every sense and one that deserves the praise it received.
