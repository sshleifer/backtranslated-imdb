I grew up with this as my favorite movie. The special effects are incredible for the era and have won prizes. I remember the dialogue as if I had heard it yesterday. It's just an extraordinary adventure. The music is by Miklos Rosza, the best cinema. Sabu is the thief. Conrad Veidt is the big villain. I have a handy copy for the next trip down the memory strip. Look over there! Rex Ingram wants the genius's glass!
