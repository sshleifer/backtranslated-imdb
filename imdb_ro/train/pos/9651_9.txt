What, at first, just another introverted French film, featuring no more than an aggressive feeling, became, in my second view, a truly visible and quite satisfactory presentation. <br /> <br /> Spoiler of sorts follows. /> Poor Cedric; apparently did not know what hit him. Poor audience I was initially trapped in what looked like a very beautiful and romantic story to be led back and forth into the dark reality of mismatch. These two guys did not belong together from the first ambiguous meeting. As much as Mathieu and Cedric were sexually attracted to each other, the absence of a deeper emotional bond made it impossible for Mathieu, an intellectual being, to find fulfillment by sharing his life with someone whose sensitivity was more suited to carnival celebrations and with the romps beach. On a purely technical note, I liked the action in this film. The subtitles were totally useless, even though my French are "prestigious." I could track it again without the English annoying translation and enjoy it even more. It was a filming, very polished. Although many scenarios seem superfluous, we have nine out of ten.
