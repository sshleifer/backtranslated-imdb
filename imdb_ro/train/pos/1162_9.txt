Like most people, I saw Jason Priestley on TV and I think it's great. But I did not know he had a sister! Justine Priestley is simply a vague "mah" as the despised woman. Good music, intrigue, and a death scene that involves Amanda's revenge on an abusive dr. Who will stay with you for weeks. I'm gonna let it go. Kudos.
