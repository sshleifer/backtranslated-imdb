The fear of a black hat is a hilarious paradise of hip-hop culture. It's as fun as this is spinal tap, if not more fun. The actors are incredible, and the documentary style is superb. Mark Christopher Lawrence is an extraordinary talent that should play in more movies. This movie is a classic classic cult!
