This is one of the great 80s of my collection that I think all the time. <br /> <br /> Running Man is one of Arnold's best and different films even to this day and when I first saw The Running Man I was so excited to see a movie like this. I just love all the fighting and this is really a special movie. He also has Jesse Ventura, legendary professor Toru Tanaka, Sven-Ole Thorsen, beautiful Conchita Alonso, Yaphet Kotto, Kurt Fuller, Richard Dawson and Thomas Rosales Jr. killed in films like Universal Solder, Lost World, Robo Cop 2, Predator 2 and among others. All fans of Arnold should love this movie from start to finish, because his action is full, full of stars, and Arnold's one of the best so far!
