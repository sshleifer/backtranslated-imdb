For the school humanitarian school project, I chose to traffic people. After some research on the Internet, I found this DVD and ordered it. I just finished looking at her and I still think about it. All I can say is "Wow". It's such a compelling story about a 12-year-old Vietnamese girl named Holly and an American named Patric who's trying to save her. The end leaves you breathless and, although not a happy ending, everything is very realistic. It's amazing and I recommend it to everyone! You really connect with Holly and Patric, and your heart breaks for her and what's going on with her. I liked it so much and now I want to know what's going on!
