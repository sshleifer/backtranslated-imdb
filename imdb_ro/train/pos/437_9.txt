Enchanted April is a tonal poetry, an impressionistic painting, a masterpiece of conveying a message with a few words. It's been one of the 10 favorite movies since it's out. We continue to wait, though less patiently, for the movie to appear in DVD format. Apparently, I'm not alone. If the records of Amazon's parent company are correct, there are many people who want this title in DVD format. Many people want to go to Italy with this distribution and this scenario. Many people want to keep a permanent copy of this movie in their libraries. The tower is spectacular, the cinema and the impeccable direction. The film is a clear goalkeeper. Many have already asked. Add our name to the list.
