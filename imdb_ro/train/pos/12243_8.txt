Kate Beckinsale is just as good if not better than Gwyneth Paltrow as Emma in this film, although I really liked Gwyneth Paltrow in the other version of Emma. Both are good in different ways. Kate Beckinsale like Emma seems more interesting, almost, though. And I liked the woman who played better in Harriet Smith's movie ... she was prettier and more sentimental. There are some things I like about Gwyneth Paltrow's version, though, as the humorous side looks more like.
