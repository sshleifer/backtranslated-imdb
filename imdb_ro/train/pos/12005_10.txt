This movie was the best movie I've ever seen. Being LDS, I recommend this movie because you are able to understand more about Joseph Smith's life. Although the film was not performed with highly acclaimed actors, it is a remarkable and ever-changing film that can be enjoyed and appreciated by everyone. I saw this movie with my family and I can confess that we all had a heart change. This film allows people to really understand how hard life was for the prophet and how much trouble he faces. After I saw the movie, there was no dry eye in the whole room. Everyone has been touched by what they have seen and I have not been the same since I saw it. I recommend this movie to everyone.
