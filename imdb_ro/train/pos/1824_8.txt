All dogs go to heaven is a movie that I always liked. When I was a child, I used to look at it every day. It is underestimated if you look at its IMDb rating and the comments of many people in general. This is not a bad movie as many say, it is a very good movie. This is good and your kids will probably like. Even if G is rated, some parents may think this is a bit violent. It's actually a rather dark story, where dogs are akin to mafios who are involved in gambling, extortion, and even cold blood. The film follows a dog called Charlie, who has escaped from the pound, is murdered by his old friend, goes to heaven, but ends up on the ground. Many younger children watching this movie can feel as if watching a great movie for kids. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that could scare small children, but I'm sure they will do well. Every time I watch this movie, it reminds me of when I was a kid. I'm sure everyone has a movie that reminds them when they were younger, this is the movie that makes me feel that way. The performances of Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise are wonderful and this is the last film that a little girl named Judith Barsi gave birth to. Unfortunately, she was killed at an early age, which is a shame because she has so much strength and she has not managed to - We're going what happened. Now that they know her story, they can not watch this movie the same way because her voice seems so sad. <br /> <br /> The animation in this movie is great, the voice work is wonderful, and the story is good, but a little different from many other movies for kids. This was popular at the time of his release, but was overshadowed by Disney's mega popular The Little Mermaid. This is a film that is not designed by adults, but if you are a child or raised with this movie as a child, then I'm sure you will enjoy watching it.
