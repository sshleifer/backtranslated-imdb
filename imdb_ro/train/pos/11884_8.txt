I found this film as a fascinating study of a family in crisis. When Leo, the eldest, announces that he is HIV +, the reactions of family members alone and with each other were touching and yet strange. I have never seen a family that is as physical as this; none as likely to shout to each other. I did not understand why the family felt that the youngest could not handle the news, but once, so hard, I found a moving movie.
