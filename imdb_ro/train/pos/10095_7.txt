My parents took me to this film when I was nine years old. I never forgot. I've never seen anything as beautiful as Elizabeth Taylor. (She was twenty-two when she made Walk Elephant) Remember, I'm new so feelings are not sexual, I could not see anything else on the screen. I just wanted to sit at her feet like a puppy and look at her. She began to prove her age, (She's almost seventy-four years old), but I still think she's one of the most beautiful and stunning women ever to have lived. I've seen the movie several times because, and it's a sappy melodrama. What it saves is, of course, Mr. Taylor's beauty, magnificent scenery, the very impressive impression of the elephant, and a good point for human arrogance in nature. Overall, one well - spent several hours watching the movie channel or a rental movie.
