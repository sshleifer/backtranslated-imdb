Despite reading the "initial comments" from someone who has been curious about the movie - (WHY IS THE VERY NEGATIVE COMMENT ON THE FIRST LIST?) It was very nice to note that virtually everyone loved it! Obviously, the Church wanted to emphasize certain points and present the Prophet Joseph Smith in a positive way - that's the whole idea. And, in fact, these points were extremely effective. We already know that Joseph Smith was a man ... but in spite of this, and all the terrifying negative trials the adversary has stirred up, he has shown how he has managed to accomplish a remarkable work of God. I would recommend it to anyone!
