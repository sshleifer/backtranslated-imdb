"Slaughter High" is an extremely ridiculous move about a high school high school, Marty, who always beats some pranksters. The prank goes wrong and ends up being burnt in the wild. Five years later, his attorneys attend a reunion - only the ten, of course, and low, and here Marty kills one after the other. British actress Caroline Munro ("Maniac") leads the cast as the heroine (who dies anyway!) The actor is completely horrible. suspense at all. A lot of grotesquely dead scenes to satisfy riddles: the stomach of a guy explodes, another victim woman gets an acid bath, a couple who has sex in bed, electrocution, a guy is crushed by a tractor, they drowned and a doctor receives a hyperdermal needle in the eye. The killer carries a decent and quite frightening mask, and the setting (a beautiful old English castle) is really enjoyable. However, the end of the dream is absolutely pathetic. that "Slaughter High" is a piece of garbage, but I enjoyed it. Just for fans of really bad slasher filming.
