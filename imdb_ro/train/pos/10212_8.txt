This whole movie deserves to be watched only for the last magnificent moment - the best end of the movie I've ever seen. Perfect, beautiful, fun, simply wonderful. I found this charming movie, even with what happens in French, taking into account - too serious. I liked it - it's a great love story. And I loved the way the Algerians were woven - and by the way, the music during the final credits is wonderful. I want the CD!
