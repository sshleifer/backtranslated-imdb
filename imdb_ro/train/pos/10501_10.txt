Super Mario 64 is undoubtedly the greatest game ever created. It's so exciting you could play it in hours without stopping for a break. I beat the game four times, but I did not get all 120 stars ... (I got 111) ... but I hope to get it in the end. Even if I did not officially play this game until I was seven, I liked to watch my sisters play it. I am now 13 years old and still play this game by wiping games and starting again. Graphics is incredible for an early N64 game. The mode of play is dependent. The controls are great. Levels are heavy, but not impossible. The Bowser fights are provocative. I want to tell you more, but why do not you give yourself up? Put them on X-BOX 360, PS3 and Wii and go and find yourself a Nintendo 64 and play this amazing, awesome game.
