Something surprised me about this movie - it was actually original. It was not about the same old recycled fools coming out of Hollywood every month. I saw this movie on the film, because I did not even know about it before I saw it in my local video shop. If you see this movie available - rent it - you will not regret it. Suspension is built all the way and the end of the twist is excellent. <br /> <br />
