Modern people know this small movie first as a model for the remake "The Money Pit". Today's elderly people are looking forward to her nostalgia: Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas were "super-star" in an easier, less complicated era. Or was it? Time, of course, has a way to change the outlook, and with so many movies today with truly ulcerative social and political comments, there is a natural curiosity to question controversy in older, less challenging movies. In "Mr. Blandings is building his dream house", it could be more than what audiences were looking for in 1948. There is a political commentary, however subtle. Finding a home in the late 1940s was a really exhilarating experience, easily relieved by the coming of Levittown and the like. Politics in the movie? Blanding children seem to always talk about the progressive ideas they have learned in school (which, in real life, will make teachers accused of communism). In real life, Myrna Loy was an activist in dwelling, Democrat and Feminist. Melvyn Douglas was no less a democratic brand: he was married to Congressman Helen Gahagan Douglas, whom young Richard Nixon accused him of being soft during communism (and who destroyed it). Jason Robards, Sr., has a small role in the film, but his political activism has not been less noticeable. More importantly, his son, Jason Robards, Jr., would be a very liberal liberal democrat for many years. Almost the oddest colleague was Cary Grant, whose strident conservatism reflected a major political sentiment at Hollywood, which is already slipping. But this was 1948: Communism was a perceived threat, and the black list was just around the corner. It would be another decade before political activism reappeared in mass movies and then not be so subtle.
