Bette Davis turns into a funny cold show like Mildred Rogers in this 1934 film. The film looks pretty dated in 2003. It is undoubtedly worth watching for film lovers and fans of Bette Davis, but it can not have so much appeal for the average viewing of today's movie. I was surprised to see how young Mrs. Davis was looking at this movement. The actors turn into performances that are basically healthy, and the story is significant and interesting. Leslie Howard is well represented by Philip Carey, the medical student at the club. This is a movie with a strong message about which we choose to love and why. However, "The Human Bond" did not seem to have a strong impact on my mind or emotion. I felt a little indifferent and I detached the movie after I saw it. I have an intuition that this might be the reaction the director did. You are the judge! <br /> <br />
