When I started watching the show, I said, "Oh no, it's as bad as Elfen Lied and not even that blood!" Indeed, the configuration is almost identical, the only boy living in a big house alone, then suddenly engaging in a fantastic adventure, while sexy girls live with him. is the place where the resemblance stops. The love story is almost as subtle and intense as the one in Inuiyasha, while childhood comments and behaviors are very few. The magical setting is a bit strange, because it's seven men, seven servants who fight for the Holy Grail, all the servants being a famous man, half of all masters being in the same school, hiring rules, etc. on the contrary, it fades away from the beauty of the drawing and the script. In fact, I watched all 24 episodes in one day, and without comparing them with animations that I liked more but were of other generations, I have to say that I was very pleased.
