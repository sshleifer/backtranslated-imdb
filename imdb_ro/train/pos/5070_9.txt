Recently I searched for the new WIDE Screen from FLY AWAY HOME and I came across an interesting title I never heard about: GRAY OWL. The fact that it was a film by Richard Attenborough caught my attention (he is responsible for such fine films as GANDHI, CHAPLIN and SHADOWLANDS). I noticed that the script was made by William Nicholson (author SHADOWLANDS). This "special edition" was full of interesting sounding material, and the price was just under $ 10.00 - so I took it and bought it. WOW! What a nice movie. Pierce Brosnan plays the role of Archie Gray Owl, a true life-lover in the 1930s, who came to love and respect the wildlife of Canada and worked to help them protect them. Brosnan (who starred in a James Bond movie) offers a shady, warm and powerful performance, like Annie Galipeau, as a young woman who loves and influences the feeling for the creatures of the country - especially the beaver. A good score by George Fenton (THE CRUCIBLE) and beautiful photo by Roger Pratt adds a lot to the effectiveness of the film. And the extracts on this DVD are different! Includes two shorts made in the 1930s with Gray Owl songs, as well as audio tracks commented by Attenborough and Producer Jake Eberts; 2 Facilities; and many other fine PLUS options for those who have access to a PC with DVD-ROM features. GRAY OWL was released directly on DVD in the United States - which Richard Attenborough attributes to Hollywood's interest in distributing something that is not loaded with much violence and sex. This is a movie that not only informs and entertains, it lets you think about something. I had a very warm feeling at the end of the movies - and a new love and understanding for beve! GRAY OWL is a very beautiful movie - worth checking out! This is one that I look forward to sharing with others.
