_Waterdance_ explores a wide range of aspects of the life of the Spanish artistic wounded. From the minor torment of faulty fluorescent lights that overflows to sexuality, masculinity and depression, the disability experience is open. The diversity of central characters highlights the complexity of the examined material - Joel, the writer, Raymond, the black man with a troubled past, and Bloss, the racist biker. At first, these men are united only by the nature of their injuries, but retain their competitive spirit. Over time, shared experience, both good and bad, brings them together as friends to lean on each other. The most obvious changes are those experienced by Joel, who initially distanced himself from colleagues with sunglasses, helmets and curtains. While he accepts the changes he has made in his life, Joel throws these props and begins to get involved in the battles of the people he shares with the salon. The dance to which the title refers is a reference to this daily struggle to keep the head above the water; to give up dance is to reject life. _Waterdance_ is a moving and powerful multi-level movie and I do not hesitate to recommend it.
