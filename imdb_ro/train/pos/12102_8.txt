This starts a bet between Edgar Allen Poe and a journalist ... Poe bet that man can not spend a whole night in a creepy castle. Of course he can, but will he go unharmed? It's hard to say with all those strange people who should not be there, including Barbara Steele, ice cream. This is a strange movie in which the presentation is both in French and English, and it changes a few times. Maybe this happens because dialog bits have been lost? It is also quite dark and claustrophobic because it does not look too far beyond a small circle of light that candles and generates it, plus there is a dread of dread and an impending doom pretty much anytime. This version (about Synapse) is also uncensored and I wonder what could be censored in a 1964 movie until I saw the topless scene, I think that could be. Generally, this is pretty good in both black and black. Barbara Steele is definitely making the movie too. 8 out of 10.
