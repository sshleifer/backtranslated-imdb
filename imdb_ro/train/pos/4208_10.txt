From time to time, it releases this movie that no one has ever heard of and was shot in a very short time with very little money and resources, but everyone goes crazy and turns out to be a surprisingly big one. This also happened in the 1950s, with some small films that many people have not heard about. There are really some wonderful surprising jewels from the 1950s that deserve to be dug. "Panic in Streets" is another film that springs in mind. Both are films that are not the kind of ordinary genres of their time and are also made with limited resources. I was really surprised at how much I got to like this movie. It was really a movie that improved even better as it progressed. Like all "old" movies tend to start a slow pace, but once you get into the story and are characters in which you are in a true life with this movie. The movie has a really great story involving spying, although the movie does not start like that. It begins like this typical murder-thriller with a touch of movie noir. But "South Street Pickup" is not even a movie of numbers, so it begins to take its own directions pretty soon. Ensures that the movie remains a surprising, but above all, also very refreshing one to watch. I also liked the characters in this movie. None of them are really good and with all their defects and defects. Very human. It also has a remarkable performance from Thelma Ritter, who even received a well-deserved Oscar nomination. She has indeed become one of the greatest female roles I have ever seen. Even in spite of its little obvious budget, it is simply a wonderful, original and special movie that deserves to be seen by several.
