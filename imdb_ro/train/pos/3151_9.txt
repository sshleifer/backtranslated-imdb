I saw this show 3-4 years ago. It was funny boat! When I first saw that she played on ETV (Estonian Television) and I started to like it. Too bad that the show is bad for me. Hyde is like a great guy who likes to play Frank Sinatra! And he comes up with stupid ideas. She received these glasses that are brown. I like . And it's FeZ. The Pervert Group. We all know what he does when his only one ... ... wants to be stupid. He even had it with his boss in an episode. And there's Michael, the stupid guy in the whole group, probably the worst in town and his cop! He's so stupid I remember the following: Hyde says: Did you call the police? - Michael does not go in and say. Does anyone know how to stop the siren? He is a playboy town. Then comes Jackie, Michael's former girlfriend and then Hyde's girlfriend. Then Eric is the son of the war veteran and Kitty's son, housewife. In a big pussy. But he loves Donna, his girlfriend with whom he plans to be married. Donna is a hot girl. What have I forgot? ah Hyde lives in a basement.
