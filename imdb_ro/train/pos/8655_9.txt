"California" is one of my favorite films over the years and can be easily labeled as one of the best psychological thrillers in the 1990s. The film has a very elegant surface, but behind it are many disturbing and honest names of the maniacs of homicide and the terrible violence it causes to others. One of the most powerful aspects of the movie is the show, Brad Pitt is surprisingly awesome as a trailer-trash psychologist called Early. Pitt remembers the scary character. Juliette Lewis is equally as good playing her naive girlfriend, her innocence is close to her heart. "California" has a very simple plot that goes steadily and slowly in front for about an hour, but suddenly collapses into a crime murder, while Pitt unleashes his psychotic personality. There are lots of shocking scenes, and all are heading for a climax of the powerhouse that will haunt you for days. "Kalifonia" is a film that must really be seen because it is an intense look at how great a human being can be, and not just her violence and her gore.
