I have seen that this film is dependent on Jane Austen and always doubts about the cinematic interpretation of the complexity of his novels: well, this transposition is simply precise, intelligent, delicate, attentive, tactual, respectful, intense, in a perfect word! <br /> "Emma" is one of Austen's most delightful and funny novels, due to general situations and characters that create irony. The film respected this subtle irony without ignoring the comic strip (Miss Bates above all). What engages me in the novel, and the film makes it clear, is the deep knowledge of the human life shown by the English novelist and the modern look of women, men and their relationship, and it is astonishing to think of an 18th century novelist woman the one who lived almost a retired life could understand such depth and truth about life as he did: most and still fascinating me. We can feel this modernity throughout the movie: replace the costumes and use a more current language, but situations, feelings, ideas would be extremely modern. I think of the morbid interest in other people's lives or the insinuated envy that now governs the relationships between women and the difficulty of disclosure, and the expression of feelings, especially of love: each situation becomes a universal and extrajudicial situation, value over time. <br /> <br /> The cast is very talented and offers very good and extremely brilliant performance: a young Gwyneth Paltrow is particularly suited for this role (today she would be too mature for her), Toni Colette is pure and simply great. And how I envied them for the wonderful dresses they could wear! And then, the stunning rural country of England, where each situation has such a magical and dreamy dimension ... a truly enjoyable and meritorious film.
