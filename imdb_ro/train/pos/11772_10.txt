In another of the Bugs Bunny trousers who dress the fins, the famous leporid works in a store case when the owner of Gildersleeve decides to conceal it. Of course, this is almost impossible, because Bugs knows the store better than Gildersleeve (and knows when to dress). As always, they keep everything at full speed, so you have to wonder how hilarious this cartoon was when it first started! Among other things, "Hare Conditioned" is a good example of how Looney Tunes looks in the 1940s before the Termite Terrace crowd has polished it. But do not misunderstand me, cartoons were still very good after refined shapes arrived. However, this is a great one. Leporids are rabbits and field rabbits.
