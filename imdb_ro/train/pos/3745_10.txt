Numerous mysterious stories follow the standard trail of man: the killing of the worst, collecting clues, chopping up potential witches, sprinkling red herrings and the unconscious fighter intelligent and a smarter solver. "Forgot" abandons the good and gives us complex characters who may or may not have done terrible acts. The fact that at the end of three episodes we have no easy answers and no tight tie can not frustrate some, but for me was the indication of an intelligent story that detects, disturbs and haunts the question: a bad person looks like? Excellent actors and production combine to make a mystery not easy ... forgotten.
