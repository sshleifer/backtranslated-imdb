I just read TomReynolds2004's comments and I felt like I had to come in here. I understand he does not like the movie, but his motives are not obvious. My feeling about this movie is that she is not afraid to travel on the darker paths of loneliness, failure, disappointment and pain. Each of these two people, as portrayed, has enough reason to be bitter and upset, yet they find sensitivity and comfort in each other. Only a very good action could do this work without becoming an emotional, sentimental mound and digging. I have become really interested in these people because of their overwhelming humanity that has been given to them by such powerful performances. I have every reason to dislike Jane Fonda for her actions in the Vietnamese era, but apart from personal feelings, she is fabulous in this role. Robert DeNiro is gorgeous as a man whose intelligence and kindness begins to fail him in a world indifferent to his abilities. This is the first one to see DeNiro using tenderness rather than hardness to sell a character and I really like it. This movie was a great surprise when I first saw him and I look forward to seeing him again.
