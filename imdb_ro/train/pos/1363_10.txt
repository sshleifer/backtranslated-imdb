A big blow for 90 years! Parker Posey is fabulous in this Manhattan nightlife story that requires so much money. Posey offers amazing performance as a librarian and a night crawler. This is a good movie, easy on Saturday night, before going out. The sounds of the soundtrack, the costumes are from this world, the script is fun, and the actors do a good job. Redemption Value: You can do it in this world if you try, just find a niche. I think Parker Posey is PERFECT actress for this kind of character: young, fabulous and broken. (You have to search for "Clockwatchers"). If you look at Party Girl, you're bound to have some fun. Enjoy!
