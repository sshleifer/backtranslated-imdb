I did not read all the comments but at least one poster mentioned that the 30-minute version could be abridged. I'm curious about this, because the later parts of the movie did not really make sense to me even when I rolled them back. 30 minutes seems very short for a movie in 1917 as well. "Poor Little Rich Girl," which was Tourneur's next film, is 65 minutes and "Pride of the Clan", which was his previous feature, was 84 minutes. So I'm relieved to see that I was not crazy, there must be some of this missing film and that's why the resolution did not make much sense. It's hard to review or comment on a movie that you can see only half of ... but I would recommend this movie anyway because of the really fascinating vision that we are offering insiders to a East Coast film studio ever since. It is the oldest film that I personally saw as relying on the film industry itself. The main character is a star of the film starring Robert Warwick, who was later a Hollywood character actor and appeared in almost all of Preston Sturges' films. He plays a Western actor, probably vaguely modeled on William S. Hart, who Warwick somewhat resembles. After the really fascinating sequences in the studio, we see them in a location where they find a girl in the country (Doris Kenyon) and convince her to come to New Jersey for a screen test that goes really bad. After this point, the movie seems to be missing from major pieces in the form we have now. Again, I would recommend anyone interested in the history of the film for documentary value, but in the form that I will not hold too much like a movie and is not a particularly good example of Maurice Tourneur's work.
