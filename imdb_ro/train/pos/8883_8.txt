The design of the film seems to be alpha and omega of major issues in this country (US). We see relationships with the university for the film. Obviously, the student's v.s. the teacher is present. But what adds the film to its value is the other relationships: v. Feminine, white v.s. black and the individual v.s. society. But the most important of all and in direct relationship with all other relationships is the individual v.s. is. <br /> <br /> I was amazed at how bilaterally a point of view the director gave to showing race relationships on campus. Most movies usually show the injustices of one party while showing the other's suffering. This film showed the injustices and sufferings of both sides. He did not try to show how he was right, though I would say that the head of the skin was shown to be more cruel and vengeful (quite obvious to the end). The film discusses sex and rape. It is ironic that injustice that, to some extent, brings the two races together for a while. Lawrence Fishburne performs superiorly as Professor Phipps. He breaks the idea of ​​racial favoritism and shows in parallel the parallelism of the lazy and stabbed with the hard and positive. Other stars who make this film are Omar Epps, Ice Cube and Jennifer Connelly. Michael Rapaport offers an excellent portrayal of a confused young man with a waste of rage seeking acceptance. Tyra Banks makes the debut of the movie and proves that supermodels can act. Higher learning makes its name in the college presentation more like going to class and getting a piece of paper. In fact, I would say that the film is almost a satire in showing students' interactions with each other, rather than a dry book, as a true education at a university. It is a learning process of life, not a textual one. I think you will find "higher education" is about the important issues in many universities and even in life in general. 8/10
