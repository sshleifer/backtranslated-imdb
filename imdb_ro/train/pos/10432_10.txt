I have to admit that at first I was reluctant about this film. I thought it was a bad, small and romantic film about a French woman who meets with an American on the train and decides to visit Vienna with him. I was not really excited about this kind of script, because it continued to make me think it was just a movie. Still, I saw it! And I was amazed ... "Before sunrise" is one of the few movies that dare to speak rather philosophically, wondering about the fact that at the time of our birth we are sentenced to death or that is what it is that a couple must rest together for eternity or that we humans sometimes allow us to live in fairy tales. <br /> <br /> The end was wonderful (we do not know if they will meet again in six months at six o'clock at the Vienna station) - in our optimism, we sincerely hope. The actors acted in a very good way, so, I began to think that I, I could live a love story just like this.
