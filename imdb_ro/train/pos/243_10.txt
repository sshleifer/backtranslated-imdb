Definitely one of my favorite movies. The story is good, the action is wonderful, all the techniques (especially cinema) are sharp and the script is smart. Heath Ledger is awesome as Edward 'Ned' 'Kelly. It collapses as the legendary illegal and is supported by Geoffrey Rush, Naomi Watts and Orlando Bloom. All the sequences of action are on the way <br /> <br /> The film is the ultimate thing to the end. One of my favorite films from the late legend Heath Ledger, which was the culmination of every film he played in. And make no mistake here. An excellent movie all year round.
