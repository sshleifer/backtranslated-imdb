Zombie Chronicles is not something to scream about, it's obviously not an award-winning movie, but it's a fun B movie directed by Brad Sykes who directed Camp Blood, which was another low-budget entertainment movie. The actor is bad as the cheapest movies, but that's what makes it more fun, the zombie makeup is cool and efficient, especially with the budget, the gore is also big and raw, the movie is kind zombie version of the Tales from the crypt ever since we received two stories about zombie encounters in the woods, the stories are fun and do not let you guess the first story. Zombie Chronicles is much better than some low budget zombie movies out there if you like low B budget or cheap zombie movies then make sure you check the zombie Chronicles.
