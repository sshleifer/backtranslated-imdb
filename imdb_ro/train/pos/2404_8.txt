I'm a huge fan M Lillard, so I came to watch this movie. Frankly, I doubt that if it was not in the movie, I would have liked it so much or even saw it, but once I saw it, I realized the story was pretty decent. A bad end I have to say, but I saw it coming. It's a low-budget movie, and some of the actors were not very good, but I totally rated this movie 7/10. The suspicion of asking what actually happened to Lillard was what kept me really interested in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's a good rental! <br /> <br /> 7/10
