Hello. I watched this movie earlier today for the 14th time in 3 days. I am a history teacher who has too much time in my hand. I need a life. I discovered the film that contained a striking resemblance to crack the mountain. I also found that I look very much like Jean Lafitte if she was white. also my favorite line in the whole movie was from Mr. Petey - "this kid can draw a chipmunk eye from 300 meters!" oh, and my favorite script in the movie was when the British came and the only drummer who was so devoted to his work and dabbled to death, as if the drum would end the war altogether ... but it would not be . well, that's all I want to say about this movie. Oh, one more thing .. Brown Brown is a BEEYOTCH swinging bipolar physical madness. that's all.
