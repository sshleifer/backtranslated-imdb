The best show in Seinfeld. It's very funny. Her total self-center, her stoned neighbors, her songs or cartoons, make her the most fresh show on television. One of the few shows I have overlooked. The scene with the old wise old lady in the pharmacy ("wait now that you're almost old," it turns with your finger and lol moves away), overlapping with cough syrup sleeping with God is so funny or so stupid , it's very funny. The weaknesses of the shows are her sister and the policeman just because they are too accustomed! I really can not wait until the next show, something I have not felt for any show for a long time.
