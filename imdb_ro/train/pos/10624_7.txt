I thought I should qualify for my position after reading other reviews. The movie is not great, but it has many extraordinary elements. Lighting and scenes with room work are great. The story is slow and weak but fun. The act is bad, but not worse than you will find on the SyFy channel. The music is pretty good and the gorillas are good. It has a big leather face and is produced by Bruce Campbell. I looked at the full movie and, while most predictable, it was still enjoyable. Women are quite attractive and the lead actor is doing a good job of being scary and creepy. The film was remarkably clean for a modern film and the right violence for children 13 and up. There were no sexual scenes. I gave it 7 out of 10 and I think it's right. I would look again if I had nothing better to do. The angel who calls gay is the most annoying aspect of the movie, the devil is pretty creepy.
