*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERI *** <br /> <br /> This movie, "The Divers", is very interesting. All I knew about it was that it involved Nazi history, underwater scenes, and everyone was Danish. But I decided to examine it for one reason, that the story is evolving around a submerged submarine submarine. I have a fetish for the German submarines, especially wrecks that can be submerged. So I was a little skeptical about the Danish side, but I reasoned that the subject could weigh that part. Knowing that the Nordic films are not always so good and not sure about the size of the budget, I was at least skeptical. At visualization I was ... surprised. <br /> <br /> I had some thoughts about the disagreeable actors, seeing how some are very young, especially the two main actors. This was not a problem, both very good performances. Like the other actors, who are the majority of the 50's and beyond. This makes some interesting interactions between the young and the elderly, which are not often seen on the screen. It's not unique in anyway, but somewhat rare. And everything is fine. As far as Danish is concerned, it is almost impossible to understand. But this was not a problem, it had subtitles. Another problem was the submarine itself, I suspected there were indoor shots, as well as submarine underwater firefights. Since their budget was thin, I thought that this could prove to be the best and the worst, even worse, at worst. Again we were surprised, the outer scenes of the wreck are beautiful, and the interior scenes are very realistic. Having a fetish for German supporters, I knew what the bottom should look like, especially in the interior, and she was not disappointed. The team did some serious research. Everything's good. I suspect that more people than me will watch this movie just to see some underground scenes, so I feel they have to issue a "warning". The submarine in the film is not a real pattern that existed during the war. It is a special sub-goal. But to give you a hint about what you're expecting is a crossover between a type VII, a type IX and a Japanese transport similar to the I-52. God is a good design and makes a nice wreck. The setting is on a Danish island or peninsula, I do not remember. It's summer and two brothers travel to their grandfather to celebrate the summer as they do each year. Their grandfather is a kind of sailor. The cinema is pretty pretty, lots of pretty summer scenes at the docks of the island, a new adolescent love, a beautiful diving weather, and a general feeling of "perfect". Again, everything is fine. The island has some suspicious type visitors, a gathering of men rents one of the boats, an old minesweeper and his crew. One of the visitors, a 50-year-old man, has the German eagle and his swastika tattooed on his back. Elderly citizens of the island remember when a German ship was sunk by the end of the Second World War and since then there have been rumors about the Nazis gold in the deep. The grandfather was one of the youngsters who searched for the sunken u-boat shortly after the German bodies began floating on the coast back in 1945. No submarine was ever found. What to expect <br /> <br /> Key elements are Nazi experiments, Nazi history, treasure hunt, secret, competition, adolescent love, conspiracy and ... a surprise. *** WARNING - SPOILER *** <br /> I did not expect to see some elements of the supernatural in this movie and they caught me on guard. He is not a big fan of supernatural events, but still fits well into the story and does not pose the problem. It's not like "From dawn to dawn" where everyone turns into vampires to the end. This is a little subtle. GENERAL: Very good movie, I gave her a 8. Some because it's not a Hollywood movie with unlimited resources. Later, I found out that she had a fair budget and that some actors were Danish veterans. But even if it was a Hollywood production, I would give it a 7 or 8. It certainly deserves your moment. Yes, the story of a child in a way, but then a mature story. It has a lot of suspense and a great aura of adventure, which I found very appealing. And again, the cinema is very beautiful. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
