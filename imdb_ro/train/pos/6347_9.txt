How Grinch Christmas Stole stole my heart instantly and became my favorite movie almost from my first view. Now, eight views later, still has the same impact on me as when I first saw it. Screenwriters Jeffery Price and Peter S. Seaman from who embody Roger Rabbit's fame do a fantastic job of adapting The Grinch story to the screen. Ron Howard's lead brought the story to life, and Jim Carrey's energetic performance, in which Grinch steals the show. Some film detractors have argued that the spirit or principles of the original story is not true. After reading the original story, I have to say I can not agree. The film does exactly the same thing about Christmas and its true meaning as the original story. Indeed, it increases the impact of the story by making it more personal, showing us how and why Grinch has become what it was. ... but if you have not seen it yet and you are one of those who want to know anything about a story until you have seen it, you should omit the next two paragraphs.) <br /> <br /> I think that everyone can refer to Grinch's terrible experiences in school. I think we all, at some point or another, were the unpopular in school that has always been gathered. I know I was ... and that's why I had so much sympathy for The Grinch and what went through him. Cindy Lou Who is naive idealism, believing that no one can be evil, was a heartbreaking heart. When everyone else turned their back on The Grinch out of fear and ignorance, Cindy Lou was determined to be his friend. If only everyone could have such an attitude. In fact, I think the only thing that would make the film a little better would be to further mitigate humor and adult content. It was already rather tight, but any of these adult humor (as when The Grinch hit first in the cleavage of Martha May Whovier) does not fit into such a story. a way to be a classic Christmas, taking a place with much merit alongside the book and Chuck Jones cartoon as a must-see of every Christmas season.
