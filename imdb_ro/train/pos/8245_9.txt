Even without speaking a word, Billy Connely is awesome as a zombie ... Carrie Ann Moss as "mother", even better. Zombie friends? <br /> <br /> "My father ate to eat me ... I never tried to eat Timmy." <br /> <br /> And I thought Dawn of the Dead was good. It's like Airplane Meets (Meat?) The Night of Living Dead Sponsored by Zomcom .. And Do not Forget My Basket <br /> <br /> And Fido in Aloha Shirt is just as Cool! And yes, the social comment is too much to even start commenting. <br /> <br /> Suffice yourself to say, it really works!
