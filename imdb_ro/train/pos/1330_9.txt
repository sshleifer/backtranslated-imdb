How Tidy My Little Frenchman is, he tells a story that is sad, frightening, and affirming life. It ends with a brutal end about which you knew it was supposed to happen, even if you hoped - maybe you could just drink - it would not be. Utlimately, this is the greatest power of the movie: with your emotions and expectations, then it throws you a bomb. I saw this in a USC theory classroom movie back in the mid-90s. It's not easy to find, but it certainly deserves to hunt.
