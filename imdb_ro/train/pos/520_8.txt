The smallest minor movement with the movie I grew up, knowing as STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN, is that the wonderful RAYMOND MASSEY is relegated in the last 20 minutes of the stage of the process. And the process itself, IMO, is the least interesting part of this fascinating fantasy. David NIVEN and KIM HUNTER are marvelously thrown away as young lovers, but it is ROGER LIVESEY, which offers the most vivid and credible performances. The French accent MARIUS GORING is a delight (he even receives a remark on Technicolor) as a heavenly messenger sent to recover Niven when his wartime death is not reported due to surveillance. Goring has some of the boldest lines and offers them with joy. Seeing tonight on TCM for the first time in the last twenty years, I think it is a supreme example of what a wonderful year was 1946 movies. The Technicolor photo, somewhat suppressed and not tried at all, is excellent and the way it changes into B & W for the celestial sequences is done with great imagination and efficiency. The opening scene is the one that really pulls a spectator into the fantastic aspects of the story - and Niven's tense discussion with the Hunter radio operator as his plane collapses to the ground, unexpectedly leads to a memorable romantic encounter. Indeed a wonderful movie from start to finish, another triumph for Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.
