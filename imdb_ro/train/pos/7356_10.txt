If you have not seen Eva Longoria at the show "Disperate House Wives," then you lose. Eva will be one of Latina's greatest stars and you will soon see her in theaters. This was Eva's first movie and he's doing a fantastic job. She was 24 years old when she shot her and then looked hot. As for this low-budget film, the director, who soon has another "Juarez, Mexico" that is currently playing at many film festivals in the United States, is quite good for the first time. In fact, it seems that it could have a limited theatrical release from some news. What would be nice to see is a "Snitch'2" with a larger budget.
