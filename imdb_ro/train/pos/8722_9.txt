To begin with, it's a very funny movie, with some crazy characters running around who must laugh (see the two Russian bugs). A Bug's Life has a classic Disney story, but that's one of the good things about the movie. Family values ​​are praised, and the main character of the film undergoes an evolution to finally resist wolves. And he also has a great voice pair by Dave Foley, Julia-Louise Dreyfus, Kevin Spacey (of course) ... But in fact, the most amazing thing about this movie is animation. It's great. All the details, wonderful colors, every ant show different beautiful foundations ... And the boys and girls from Pixar made it look so realistic. In general, a very beautiful work. This is the best animation from Aladdin's Disney.
