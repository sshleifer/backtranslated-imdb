As a child, I liked animation on my computer, although it was extremely limited, and the instruments were almost nonexistent. This movie, while stunning and watching stunning images and almost hypnotic music, created my desire to create things moving on my computer. This is an agreement between the package, between music and video, which really packs a one-two shot. If you know any child who wants to get involved in computer animation, you must have this. <br /> <br /> I still, almost 20 years later, rate this movie as one of my top top favorites. Originality, I believe, is still uncertain of most of today's McMovies, who escapes Hollywood. I now want to see if I can do it alone; if imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, then this film deserves a ton of imitation =)
