Michael Bowen plays an innocent young man who meets a thousand miles to visit his absent millionaire father (Ray Wise creepy) on a farm that winds in the wind and ends up in the woods of his mother's dangerous forest Clare Wren), causing problems to the already dysfunctional family. A frightening, elegant and exciting drama that did not receive any promotion and was sent directly to VHS and cable television - where I first saw it. It's beautiful, intelligent and tightly directed from a script that prevents you from biting your nails. I can not believe the reviewers who did not want to see him have ever seen it. It's a classic undiscovered.
