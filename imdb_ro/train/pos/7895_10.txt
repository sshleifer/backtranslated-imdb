In the opening scenes of this film a man shot the arrows through his hotel room in another man's bath and threw all the lights. This was very good for 1936, but rather a way out and has nothing to do with the movie, Robin Hood did not make an appearance as far as I could see. However, Bette Davis ("Daisey Appleby"), "The Whales of August", "87 was very young and attractive and played one of the best roles in a long Hollywood career." Daisey did not cease never tease or be very sexy with her night clothes and the so-called swim suit on her yacht with George Brent (Johnny Jones), "The Spiral Staircase," 46. Daisey even proposed marrying Johnny in a Ferris wheel with his head down and even got a black eye. Davis and Brent made a big couple, one supposed to be very rich and the other very poor reporter. Outside the scene, Davis and Brent had a real love affair, which is a good reason for sparks when these two appeared in the movie. If you liked Bette Davis and George Brent, this is the movie for you!
