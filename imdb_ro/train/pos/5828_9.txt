Microphones are short classics. Boys are ineffectually reproached at a radio station, and during a walk in a cab, Curly's imitation of a "Spring Vocals" recording is wrong for the real thing, leading to a radio contract and at a musical party. The teaching excellence of the quintet of the Lucia de L'Amamore trio is especially fun. Undoubtedly, this is an essential view for the Stooge fans. Although Curly's health evidence is visible in his voice and voice, his performance is amazing and probably the old mirror of the old Curly. Some fans think that "A Bird in the Hand" is the last big Curly short, but the thick voice and slow motion are too hard to track.
