I'm certainly glad that a film about Carl Brashear's amazing life story was made. Coming as during the civil rights era, Brashear has become a source of inspiration for people from all minority groups who do not want to settle for an expected status. Brashear, as played by Cuba Gooding, the behavior of the life she chose. Very similar to Jackie Robinson, who has integrated baseball and made her keep up with her character and behavior. As well as Brashear, Gooding knows he does not want the life his father Carl Lumbly has and makes him really clear to get more out of life than he has reached. But as Harry Truman integrated the Army Services after World War II, Marina still has its restrictions. A black man can only be a chef or a valet of an officer, the actual combat parts are denied. It is not good enough for Gooding, who is committed to becoming a deep sea diver. Once at the diving school in Bayonne, New Jersey, Gooding throws it all away, especially by the chief commander, Robert DeNiro. DeNiro may have some remaining prejudices, but he is still a hero and one who can inspire if the racial division can be overcome. The best thing about Men Of Honor is the chemistry between DeNiro and Gooding. They certainly come from different places, but as they know each other, they turn out to be Men Of Honor. Other good performances we have to note are Charlize Theron as wife of DeNiro and Hal Holbrook as the head of the diving school, a guy he just wanted to marry for reasons you'll see. Men Of Honor is an inspired story about people with courage and freedom of change.
