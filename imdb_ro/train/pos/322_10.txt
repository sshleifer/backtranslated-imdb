this movie is not porn, it was not meant to be porn, and if my uncle does not act as president of the world, he should never be considered pornographic. Now that the problem has been resolved, I can say I recommend this film because its problems are still widely available. it's funny, the act is great and raises serious (curious) questions. I do not fully understand why this movie was so maltreated, that's why we're going to never visit. Lena is the true pioneer of the modern movement of riot-grrrl, confusion, curiosity and intelligence are her main attributes, she is sometimes angry, but are not we all?
