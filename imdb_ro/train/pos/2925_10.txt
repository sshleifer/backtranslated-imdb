In Eddie Murphy's time an audience woman rises to Eddie and a guy in the audience answers. what is said is, the women - DO MR ROB (this is a character on Saturday night live), the man responds with SHUT UP BITCH. unlike the previous post, saying that women shouted to make the gum, this is incorrect, although the post-er said he is there must have an auditory problem! despite what post-er says about not being able to get it here on DVD they listen to it almost as you can actually hear on DVD - DO MR ROB !!!! Hope this helps anyone who is curious to break the gas's luck !!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!!!!!
