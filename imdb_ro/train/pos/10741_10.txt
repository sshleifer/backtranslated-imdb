The French Naudet brothers did something that no one else did, they had a video camera the day this tragedy happened. They were in building # 2, when you could see the drifting papers, people who hit the ground by jumping from such a height. I mean, it goes so far, when both buildings collapsed, the room was still moving, when the white dust covered them, they found a store door and came in, but all these images are real and I think they did a fantastic job of catching them for us. the stars are heading to the Naudet brothers who filmed the extraordinary movie they watch every September 11, so I will never forget what this country has gone through. I think if I remember well, it shows the first death of the firefighter's priest, while he was taken to the church and the honorable funeral.
