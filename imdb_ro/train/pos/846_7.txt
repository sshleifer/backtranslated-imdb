Two years ago I watched the movie "The Matador" in the cinema and I liked everything about this movie. Obviously, I was totally impressed with Pierce Brosan's magnificent role. Yesterday, I caught this movie again on TV, so I looked a little deeper. Now, I can say with certainty that this film is not so special, but you have to love it for one man. <br /> <br /> Brosnan raises his degree up, in my opinion, with stunning performances by Julian Noble, a tired hit-man who has no friends. Soon, Julian meets Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) in Mexico City, a man who is unlucky: his son died in an accident, his job is not going as well and he's not sure he can keep Bean's wife (Hope Davis) I always enjoyed movies like this; movie crimes with great humorous touch. Moreover, the humor comes from Brosnan while saying jokes about dwarfs with great d ... or one of my favorite lines in this film: "I look like a Bangkok prostitute on a Sunday morning after the navy left town" . Brosnan says with charm while drinking margarita as usual. I also like Greg "the typical American face" Kinnear in the role of the loser who is very lively because there are a lot of people like Danny Wright. So I recommend that you most likely look at Brosnan's best role. He will make you smile and admire him at the same time. Grand Brosnan in the film is not as big.
