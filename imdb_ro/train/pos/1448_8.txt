Throughout the country, and especially in the political landscape, people with any kind of political ambition should take time to see this movie. The film is called "City Hall" and with little imagination, its synoptic can take place anywhere in America. It's going to open in New York. Here is the story of a popular politician named Mayor John Pappas (Al Pacino), with enough skill to lead a major metropolitan city with very little effort. His right man is none other than Vice Mayor Kevin Calhoun (John Cusack) an equally bright individual who has ambitions about his mentor, and both seemed destined for a superior job. Everything points to this direction until a police shot triggers an investigation led by Marybeth Cogan (Bridget Fonda) who believes the blame goes to the mayoralty and the mayor. A six-year-old boy and the death of a police officer are accused of a career killer, a questionable freedom that leads to apparent coverage of political wages and corruption in the city, involving union leaders such as Danny Aiello played by Frank Anselmo, Walter Stern. (Martin Landau) and mafia bosses such as Paul Zapatti (Anthony Franciosa), who are deeply involved. Also, party officials such as Larry Schwartz (Richard Schiff) are working for the New York Probation Office. But the connection between the mayor and his deputy is taken by the task of accidental shooting. An excellent vehicle for Cusack and a sure-footed bet to become a classic. ****
