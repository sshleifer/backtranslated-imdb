I like cartoons. They can show things that movies with "real" actors and landscapes can not do - although the effects of the computer are changing more and more. They can push the borders of satire ("The Simpsons"), good taste ("South Park"), show ("Aladdin") or reality ("Toy Story"). There are some good examples of this in the "Ice Age", such as when we see a variegated flock of mammals that have now disappeared from the country, chatting like old friends. Such scenes are a pleasure to look at as we feel both familiar and weird at the same time, usually in a way that makes us laugh. While Ice Age is not as good as the top-of-the-line animated films, it's a very fun movie. Stay back, enjoy the deliberate anachronism, the wonderful background and the belly laugh. The story follows Manfred, fucking mammoth, Sid, a sloth idiot, and Diego, a wild tiger, human child back to his tribe - for very different reasons. On the way, of course, they have a lot of trouble. Also, during the voyage, is the scratch, the most unpleasant rodent of history, who desperately tries to bury an acorn for the winter: in the glaciers, on the top of the dead trees, in the ice caves. Its opening scene is classic. It's a simple story with a very predictable ending and a means that is just a series of funny incidents with a few moments of character building, but some of the scenes, like changing diapers or dodos, are hilarious, animals are enjoyable and looks good. There is also a touching moment when the mammoth paintings of caves come alive before Manfred's eyes. You do not have to see, but for a fun hour or so. <br /> <br /> <br /> 7/10
