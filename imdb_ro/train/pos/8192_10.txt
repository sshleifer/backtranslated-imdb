This two ground floor was excellent - the best since the series came back. Sure bit of the story has been pinned by previous films, but what TV shows do not do this nowadays. What I got here was a good story about SF. A great monster (very scary) imprisoned at the base of a deep pit, other glittering extraterrestrials in The Ood - the best "new" aliens revived by the series came with a nice and credible set of human characters (complete with a pair of people security that are not called "addicts" in the true Star Trek fashion), some philosophical themes on a large scale (love, loyalty, faith, etc.) and some special effects from the drawers. <br /> <br /> I love every minute of it.
