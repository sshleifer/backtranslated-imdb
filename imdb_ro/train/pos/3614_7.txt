The ice girl is like your grandmother's cooking: the same old recipe you tried a million times before, but somehow transformed into something fresh and new. Try and explain the story of people who have never seen it before: a young woman on the wrong side of the track tries to improve her situation by taking over the box while dealing with a bitter and obstructive father and her growing attraction to a male rival. Watch them look at the clich√© and they're right: it's * cliched. However, I was hypnotized by how well this film works, thanks to the current action and dialogue, and to the sensitive direction that makes it "us". I avoided this at the cinema, because it looked like nonsense, but I do not make the same mistake I did. Definitely worth a look.
