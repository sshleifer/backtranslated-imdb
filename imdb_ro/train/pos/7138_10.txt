If John Thaw never played "Morse," "Kavanagh," or played in "The Sweeney" and other productions, he will be reminded of this unforgettable performance in Goodnight Mr Tom. Supported with equally extraordinary performance by co-star (young Nick Robinson in his first role), and a discreet cast, this adaptation of Michelle Magorian's charming novel is a fitting memorial to his art. <br /> <br /> When I read the story of an old Norfolk widow, who was supposed to host a young boy in London before and during the Blitz, I found a rather obvious time error in it and creditors to go to the producers of this film to rectify this error. They must also be applauded not to over-sentiment the story and to prevent what could have become quite easy in a strange mess. If you keep a CD or video library, then this feels good for TV movie is an absolute necessity of inclusion.
