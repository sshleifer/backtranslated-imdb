Have you ever wondered where the ideas of romance novels and other documents come from? According to Jake Speed, they rely on real people, living in the adventures they write and publish. This film is quality family entertainment, moderate amounts of violence and expensive clothing at worst. Language is also not a problem, and jokes are fun at all levels. This is an "Austin Powers" look at "Indian Jones," without Michael Myers' antics. I recommend this movie for children in the 10-15 range.
