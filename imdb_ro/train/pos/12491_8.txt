This movie was really good. If you are one who likes to watch horror movies, I recommend it. The act was very good, though I thought the actress playing Julie might have had more emotion behind her. Allan was very good and I thought cinema was amazing. I was on the edge of my chair all the time, while my friends were rubbing and screaming. It was a complete success in my opinion and I should have done it on the big screen. I give her two fingers! I would certainly say that if you have not already seen it, then you can rent it. If you saw it and did not like to go and watch it again because there are parts that were completely unreal. I also liked how much the film was filmed on my school campus.
