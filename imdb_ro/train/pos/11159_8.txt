This is a wonderful movie ... The first impressions of cynicism and crassness are soon dissipated by a loving affectionate affirmation of how men and men change their minds (Vive at Difference!) You can love people in spite of and sometimes because of their weaknesses. Human beings are a little waste, but we have great hearts and try everything we can, despite temptation. It is not our fault when sometimes temptation can not be resisted, but just who we are. There is a consistent elegance from beginning to end; a clear photo and a sharp composition, a very enjoyable view when adding challenging content, well adapted music, and laughing with hard scripts. Take care of the very young "lonely wise voice" ... shining; the wisdom of innocence, balancing the comedy from the human state.
