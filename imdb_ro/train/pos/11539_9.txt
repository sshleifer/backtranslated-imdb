ODD CUP is the classical cinematic version of Neil Simon's most famous piece about a new television journalist, Felix Unger, who is a strangely obsessed, moving with the best divorced friend, Oscar Madison, a sportsman and a complete slob , Frances threw him out of the apartment. Already divorced, Oscar takes his best friend and regrets him from the moment he does. Neil Simon's classic comedy came for the first time on Broadway, with Art Carney playing Felix and Walter Matthau singing Oscar. Jack Lemmon takes Carney into the movie with a memorable performance like Felix Unger. Lemmon is not only incredibly funny in the role, but so real that it brings an element of melancholy to the fury that is Felix Unger. Matthau, fortunately, was allowed to recreate the role of Oscar, a unique comic performance jewel that provides consistent laughter throughout life. This collaboration of Lemmon and Matthau turned out to be a comic gold game that was re-visited in nine other films. With the two actors who are no longer with us, watching this classic becomes more moving, but no less hilarious. Simon's game was beautifully extended on the screen with a silent prologue chronicling a depressed suicide attempt of Felix, who is a winner. The film includes Herb Edelman, John Fiedler, Larry Haines, and David Sheiner in the role of Oscar-winning poker friends and Moncia Evans and Carole Shelley as Piedgon sisters blinded by Felix and Oscar. Of course, it became later an excellent television series with Tony Randall and Jack Klugman, but there is nothing like the original. Joy from beginning to end.
