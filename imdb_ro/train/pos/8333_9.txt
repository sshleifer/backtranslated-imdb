IQ is a wonderful original romantic comedy, which finds the scientific mind the deepest and deepest thought of the twentieth century as Cupid's aid. The juxtaposition of heart and mind is the central theme of this intimate and still thoughtful film. You do not know how to react because part of the time you see big scientists do silly things to nurture the love of becoming, but sometimes you hear them discuss some of the deepest puzzles of space / time in our time. The end result is a funny movie with surprises all along. Walter Matthau is a perfect Einstein, Meg Ryan creates a capricious mathematician, scatter-brainer, and Tim Robbins brings to life the contradictions of a poorly educated worker who is fascinated by science. All together, they create a phantom journey through love and science, mind and heart.
