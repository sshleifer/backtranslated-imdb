I've rated this a ten simply because I find it so impressive that one eighteen-year-old child with a video camera can do it. It's not an epic, but he's pretty busy and I never get bored. If tens of millions of dollars can go into countless bad movies that are spilled on the table, then give that director the same amount of money and see what's going on. I know I'll join the local cinema for her first major release. Hell, good work and worth the money. What a scenario! It might be a low budget, but it's not half of the big photos I've seen lately. Nanavati knows a story, both in writing and on screen. Kudos serious for her, I can not wait to see more.
