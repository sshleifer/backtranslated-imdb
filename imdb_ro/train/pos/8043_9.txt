I hear people say that this movie is boringly boring. I do not think they're watching the right movie. This is not the prototypical action movie, thank God. This is a psychological drama about the beginner and his mentor, which is just about killing people. This works extremely well, with amazing performances from Berenger and Zane (who does not have sleepwalking in the film as well as other roles - in fact, he seems to act). I was disappointed with the action at the end - many of them did not make much sense and were not satisfactory given the accumulation of the rest of the film. But watch Zane's face as he collides alone, while Berenger works dirty.
