Japan 1918. The story of a 16-year-old Ryu begins with the death of her father. As will be revealed later, both parents died of tuberculosis. In this desperate situation, Aunt Ryus arranged a marriage with a Japanese man in Hawaii, which I only know from his painting. By her arrival in Hawaii, Ryu discovers that her new husband is much older than in photography and lives in very humble conditions near a planet of sugar cane in which she works. Ryu is not used to hard work on the planet and desperately for the situation in her new home she is thinking of running away. He soon finds out that he has no place to go. Friendship with Kana, a female collaborator, offers her new hope and strength. This picture is based on real events between 1907 and 1920 when thousands of Asian women married men in America whom they only knew in their photo. This well-known picture is well written and actionable. The location is breathtaking. This film also features Mifune Toshiro in his latest screenplay as a Benshi (silent movie narrator). This film gives a picture of Japanese culture here and across the ocean. I need to see!
