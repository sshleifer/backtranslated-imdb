This movie is probably my favorite movie of all time. Miriam Flynn is as good as Bunny Packard. Zane Buzby as Delores is a comic genius. The rest of the cast is amazing, and the movie is very funny. A definite satire of horror films with an angry twist. If you enjoy a fun comedy night, then go and rent this classic. You will laugh all the way!
