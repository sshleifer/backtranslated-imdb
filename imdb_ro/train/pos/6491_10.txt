World At War is probably the largest documentary series ever. Historical research is virtually flawless. Just over a quarter of a century, it is the most accurate and definitive documentary about the Second World War. An invaluable historical work that includes interviews with some of the most important and fascinating figures in the war. I highly recommend it as a learning experience.
