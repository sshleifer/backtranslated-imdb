Okay, I'll admit - I'm a joke and sometimes I like a really bad comedy. While I saw several films from Kurosawa, Bergman and Truffaut than virtually anyone on the planet, I still have a weak spot for a comedy that does not try to be sophisticated but simply funny. Some such films that come to my mind are MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAY, UHF, START REVOLUTION WITHOUT ME, STRANGE BREW and the films Bill and Ted. They all have no attraction for snobs, but only a zombie or professional film critic can despise them. While BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY is not as wonderful as the original Bill and Ted, it's still very fun. Likewise, unlike the original, it seems to improve with repeated viewing. I remember not loving the movie the first time I saw it - probably because the other movie has set such a high standard for laughing. But every time I see it again, I am amazed at all the great moments - especially those involving Grim Reaper. And, by the way, this reaper is as different as Bergman's in SEVENTH SEAL, as you can get! In addition to a lot of laughs, this movie features excellent music - in a way that is actually better than the first movie. Kiss Kiss at the end is great, but the rest of the hard rock songs - provided you are not an old murder such as De Nomolos. Wonderful viewing for children and adults.
