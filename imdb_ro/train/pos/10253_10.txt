This movie has no story. It's just a bunch of guys who torture a young girl innocent to death. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is what they do: they beat her, she in a net and leaves her in like a bird, spinning it on a chair until it beats, exposing it to a loud noise, shedding it with hot oil, putting worms in wounds, crushing its hand with a sledge hammer, and finally penetrating a needle through the eyes his. This movie was so realistic that if I did not know it was fake, I would have thought it was a smoking movie. Although I was disgusted with this movie I really liked it. It scared me. I think it's fulfilling a certain purpose. I give it a 10/10.
