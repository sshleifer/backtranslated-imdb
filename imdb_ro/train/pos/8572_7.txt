The first movie was a nice one, but it's not as good as a wonderful animated classic, which we found stranger and weird. This continuation is inferior, but not bad at all. Of course, the slapstick is too much, the script has its weak points, and the intrigue is untouched. But the dogs are pretty cute here, and Eric Idle is hilarious like macaw. The movie is nice to watch the stylish cinemas and the popping suits (especially at Cruella's), and the music is enjoyable. The act is largely very good, Ioan Gruffudd is appealing, and Gerard Depardieu, while he gave better performances, is having fun as Cruella's accomplice. But the best advantage, as it was with the first movie, is the stunning Glenn Close in a delicious performance over the head, like Cruella, even worse than it was in the past. Overall, cute. 7/10 Bethany Cox
