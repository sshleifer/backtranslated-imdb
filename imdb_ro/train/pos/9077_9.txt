I really liked the pilot, it was just as amazing as I hoped it would be, if not better. Patrick Warburton was a revolt, though at first I thought I could not stand it. He and Megyn Price Even had a little chemistry, but hopefully, as the season unfolds, they will be more comfortable around them. It must have been strange for Megyn to go from being the star on her last show ("Grounded For Life") to being a co-star. <br /> <br /> Bianca Kajlich and Oliver Hudson seem very new to the entire Sitcom scene, but I think they will be better in time. The character of David Spade, to my surprise, was not the whole subject of this pilot. The way he offers his lines is so different from anyone else I've ever seen on TV, but I think it's just his style. He works for him. I think couples, or even the only ones, will be able to handle all the doubts and fights and not be sure of the decisions that this show has. All situations where characters are felt to be real life, not covered with sugar as most performances. Hope for all the actors for the sake that CBS gives them a chance. This show has the potential to be one of the best series if I only gave them the chance and time.
