With a special telescope, Dr. Janos Rukh (Boris Karloff) successfully proves that a few years ago a meteorite landed in Africa containing an unknown but extremely powerful element. Dr. Benet (Bela Lugosi) forms a Rukh-led expedition to locate the item. Unexpectedly, Rukh discovers "Radium X", even stronger than radio and very radioactive, and Karloff becomes contaminated and can kill anyone just by touching them. The sparks really fly between Lugosi and Karloff in this classic science fiction film in the post-World War II period. Hillyer has used some of the "FLASH GORDON" series of permanent sets that have been filmed at the same time, and has also introduced some recordings of Frankenstein's electric cars. Universal has kept the audience unaware of the special effects used in this great classic movie. Karloff and Lugosi were the best and both enjoyed working together and enjoying future generations.
