There is a spectacular picture, with a beautiful stopping heart here, from a variety of landscapes and animals, from Arctic to Tropical and everything in between. The techniques of the camera are varied and can be found on the spot from close works to aerial work. The editing is extraordinary, and the commentary is on the spot, with just the right tone and some dramatic facts about our world. If the movie falls down a bit it is trying to cover and integrate four themes - seasonal patterns, climate change, individual animal stories and hunter / hunt interactions in multiple environments. Eventually, everything becomes a little weird and split. In general, it's worth seeing, especially considering the issues you've been approached, but you're not expecting Oscar.
