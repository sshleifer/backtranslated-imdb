A surprising thriller with multiple twists and crosses double than a doodle pad. An extraordinary cast that blends her with an interesting plot supervised by Twin Peaks in director Dahl. Nicholas Cage is a highly underestimated actor and portrays a marvelous portrayal of a man in a relationship looking for a good thing. J.T. Walsh (RIP to a great actor) is always a wonderful villain, like Dennis Hopper. It's a shame she has never done to a higher profile. I'm sure he has his followers though. Overall, this is a great movie that shows you that you do not need big bangs or a commercial soundtrack to be a fun movie.
