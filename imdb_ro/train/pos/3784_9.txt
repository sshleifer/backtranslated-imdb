One of the most underestimated films I've seen for a long time, Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey is Bill's second prey of Ester Preston Esq. and Ted Theodore Logan, alias Wyld Stallyns. There are two ways to look at this movie: First, you see a stupid dialogue, a plot full of charm, a juvenile idea. OR .. You see some idiots of thumbnails that are once again in a too big situation for their brains. Throw Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzeneggar into this plot and it becomes a successful movie. Bill and Ted enter the story with the same level of sincerity, just Bill and Ted. This is a complicated fence to balance, but when you watch the movie not like a screwdriver comedy, but as an adventure with two guys who have no affair in an adventure, it gets a lot more.
