"Stairway to Heaven" is an extraordinary film invention, probably never doubled. I categorize the "Wizard of Oz" and "Queen of Africa," though he is a completely different type of film than the "African Queen". "Stairway to Heaven" is a psycho drama that uses performance concepts and technical effects that, to my knowledge, are totally unique. <br /> <br /> For example, there is a combination of black and white and color images - as in Oz, but the significance of contrast goes much further than the simple but beautiful effect of Oz. In "Stairway," the purpose and effect of contrast can only be described as powerful. Another shining aspect of "Ladder" is the concept of "time" and the way it is used here. How could someone have conceived a better way of making time to stay? literally? And then there is the Scale itself! If you have any imagination, you will agree with me. "Stairway to Heaven" is a real jewel.
