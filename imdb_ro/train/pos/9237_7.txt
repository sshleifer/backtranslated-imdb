This movie is pretty good. Half a year ago, I bought it on DVD. But first I thought it was the original movie. I saw the series and it's a good movie, but here they put together the "Legend of Life, Part 1 and 2" and "Fire in Space". Just like the first movie, but with other episodes. But still, it's a pretty good movie. Only the end is strange (you do not see what's going on with Pegasus). But I still think it's pretty good. The actors and special effects were good. If you have not seen him, go see. Cast: Richard Hatch, Dirk Benedict, Lorne Greene, Herb. Jefferson Jr., Tony Swartz, Terry Carter, Lloyd Bridges, Jack Stauffer.
