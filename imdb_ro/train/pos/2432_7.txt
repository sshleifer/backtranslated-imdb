I remember the Casper cartoon, but I do not remember any cartoon. Maybe they were not memorable; I do not know, but at my advanced age, here I am looking at this very animated Casper yesterday. After that, I was shocked to read the user's comments here. Do people miss the end? I have to learn again that Casper is not like the other ghosts who like to go every night and scare people from all over the world. "He sees no future in this," says the narrator here. Instead, one evening, he goes to the rural section of town, scares inadvertently animals and finds no friends. It brings him to tears, until a fox hears him coughing and kissing with him. The two become friends, but soon the fox goes to his life with a fox hunting in progress. Other comments have mentioned everything that's going on, so I'll touch that too. The fox is killed by hunting dogs (not shown), and Casper is in tears for losing "the only friend I've ever had". But no one mentions the happy ending of this story. "Ferdie" the fox gets a figure of mind like Casper, jumps in his lap, licks his face and the narrator comments, "they lived happily afterward." Both characters look very glad. What's so sad about that? This is a beautiful story with a beautiful, happy ending.
