The Cure is an amazing movie ... So suspenseful and so real! I was lucky enough to watch the movie "The Cure" at the NYC premiere and let me go completely! I also heard that she won a prize at that festival and she definitely deserves it. The first thing I hit was cinema. Eric Giovon did a great job. The shooting style of the half-movie love scene was amazing. A scene of love was needed in this movie, and Jafri had a point alongside, but he kept the taste of the scene. Giovon and Jafri are making an excellent creative team and should certainly collaborate on future projects. Judy Maier's story was so surreal, but at the same time scary of heart, made me feel what I felt the main character. I'm a very tough critic, but I have to say that The Cure is one of my favorite movies .. JUST LOVE IT IT! If you have not seen it yet, check it out!
