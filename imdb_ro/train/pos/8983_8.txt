Shot in the car on the windshield, someone is playing someone else's last song, someone else did not react, depending on the voice-over. I wonder what happened. There were too many scenes in this movie that I asked about how there was a room there. If the scenes shot by Warhols descended into a BJM post-party are true, then it was an unexplainable exploitation to the maximum, if not, then was it a total manufacture, whether it made me uncomfortable if that was the purpose? All the way through this movie I still wonder how the material appeared. Taken at face value, a beautiful portrait of the genre (tortured) that we all consider to be.
