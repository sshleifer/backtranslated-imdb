huge fan Ramones. I like the ram, and I suppose if you hate it, then, besides being an avid Bush supporter, you might not like this classic. It's much better than the teen teen sappy john hughes teen movies and it's like it's filled the 80's infinitely better than American Pie's who is torturing us now. There are other great high school films: Switchblade Sisters, Fast Times ..., Class '84, Three O'Clock High and still captivating cheese (does not seem possible) Edge of the river. But RnRHS will always be my favorite because it's fun and fun, plus you can get up and dance with him. I love you, Riff Randell. 10/10
