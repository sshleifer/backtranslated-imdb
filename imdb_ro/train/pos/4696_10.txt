even though this movie is pretty old, no matter how many times I look at it, it still makes me laugh. <br /> <br /> A special quote in the film is highlighted. <br /> <br /> When Danny (Joe Piscopo) approaches the office and the parks give it to a handicap, Danny's partner says he can not park here, he's for the handicapped. "<br /> < > Danny responds, "I'm disabled, I'm a psychopath." This is one of the many lines in the movie that, no matter how many times you look, will make you joked. As an extra bonus also includes the legendary actor Peter Boyle in cast. So watch this movie & like me and many others who followed him, you will be tilted.
