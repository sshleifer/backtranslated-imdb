I love the series! Many of the stereotypes which describe the soul as some hicks are very obvious, but such people are too frequently. Southern government representation rings too true, but sympathetic characters remember about one of the many good things about the South. Some things never change and see "good old boys" every day! There is a Lucas Buck in every city in the south, which just make a phone call to make things happen and the story "po 'white trash' is too familiar. In addition to supernatural elements, whatever might very well happen in modern South! I think Trinity, SC must have been in Barnwell County!
