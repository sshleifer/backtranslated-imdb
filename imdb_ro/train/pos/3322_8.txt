If you want to watch something that's for him and to say that then is the movie you choose. I am a sucker for rom coms, but my husband is not always so eager (what a guy!). Anyway, I managed to make him look at him because I told him it was about sports and you know what, he loved it! Drew Barrymore is very funny and her man does not remember his name) is just as good. When I looked at the film it was called "The Match Perfect," but I think the title has been changed for the UK because it is based on Fever Pitch and there is already a football movie with this title (the same movie UK Version - phew!) Anyway, any reviews here will tell you more details if you need them to buy girls, take it from me, get your hubby / boyfriend in front of the TV on a Saturday night and you'll laugh and you weep together. A real jewel.
