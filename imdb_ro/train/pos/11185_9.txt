Because this happens to be one of my favorite novels, I was very excited to see the movement. I was not disappointed! Yes, of course, there are a few things I could choose, but I think the movie was true for the book and it was a very good movie. It seems that Stephen King's films are mostly wrong, but this is one of the good ones. It's such a dark story, which I think is the reason I like it ... and what's better than life come to life ... and something about the animals that are coming back from the grave is even creepy. If you saw the movie, do a huge favor and read the book now! It's a well-written play, the actors could have done a better job (I'm just saying this for Rachel and Ellie ... she was so damned) I liked everyone else very much .. and most important to me. was true with the novel.
