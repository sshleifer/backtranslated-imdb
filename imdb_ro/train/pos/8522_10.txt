I found the show really late at night and I tried it. It's a refreshing change from other kinds of things shown late in the night if you catch my drift. Its simplicity of values ​​and the sweetness of hearts help me to remember the way friendships were like children. It's something I love whenever I find it (which is rare, maybe I should check the list! Haha) ... and the tension between Joe and Nick is so nice. Just like any kind of good girl, you get emotionally involved in the characters. Good ol 'Louisa May Alcott still inspires good stories :) So apparently I have to complete 10 lines of text so my opinion is valid, so I think I will tell you a little more. The children are played by talented actors and actresses, and the settings are wonderful and full of nature - another thing you do not see too much on television. I hope everybody shoots her. I recognize and I am fully aware that it is sappy, but it is a good heart. As I said before, it's refreshing.
