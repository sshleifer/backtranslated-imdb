After reading the comments on this movie and seeing mixed reviews, I decided to add the ten cents that I thought the film was excellent, not only in visual beauty, writing, music scores, but in the presentation of Joseph Smith's history and the way he traveled through his life of hardship and persecution to believe in God as he felt and knew it was his way. I am very pleased indeed that I had a small role in telling the story of this remarkable man. I recommend everybody to see this when the occasion is presented, regardless of the religious path he leads, only instills one with more determination to live the life we ​​should have with true values ​​of love and forgiveness, as the Savior has taught us to do.
