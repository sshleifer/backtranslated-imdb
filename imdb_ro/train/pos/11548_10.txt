Also, if we look at whether Oscar can stay in Felix's really strange and unique habits and cleanliness, and whether Felix can sit at Oscar, being such a slob and his attitude back to everything. Really a film about two complete oppositions that live together and the joys, heights, minuses and necessity of the gift that is friendship.
