After seeing Vertigo, watch Bell, Book and Candle, made in a few months one after the other. Kim Novak's second favorite film, Picnic, comes as the third. <br /> <br /> All three shows are great, Vertigo, being the best of all. They came to nowhere in Kansas Prairie, near Salina, Kansas in the 50's, to film, Picnic. <br /> <br /> The Bell, Book and Candle musical score, I think is one of Alex North's. Perfect for this little comedy. After Vertigo, Stewart and Novak, he made this comedy, how funny it is to notice the dramatic contrast. <br /> <br /> It's worth the time if you like Kim Novak. Greta Garbo of my youth.
