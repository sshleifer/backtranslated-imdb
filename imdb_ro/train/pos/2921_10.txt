The only and only film was a great movie. We just finished watching EncoreW on DirecTV. I'm an independent professional fighter and I thought this was a good portrait of professional life fighter. Now this movie was made 4 years before I was born, but I do not think the rigors of the professional travel fight have changed so much. Sad, funny, and around GREAT! **** 10+
