This is a strange movie the British do so well. The low budget role, well executed, cameo type. The story is a bit faint, a recent widow, Judi Dench, decides to round up the "blond bomb" a girl band that played it during the London War, the obliging son / daughter who thinks she has become eggs. as if the movie allows young people to see that they do not have a monopoly on feelings, love and even craving, that "old wrinkles" can also have a good laugh Judi Dench was gorgeous as usual, a shame they can not see anymore many of the other "blonde bombs, the end was a bit of my rush I thought. I thought when I saw that David Jason would have made Patrick better than Ian Holm, though it was quite appropriate for the drummer "transvestite." All in all a cheerful movie that deserves a night in girls :)
