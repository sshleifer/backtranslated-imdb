I found this very emotional, while Spike and Heaton stay together through this movie, not to say there are a few betrayal along the way. I thought the pursuit was left aside, the relationship between the two was the foreground, I think. We already thought there were such gay intentions on Heaton's side. My favorite scene had to be a bit in which Heaton and Spike were stuck in the swamp and Spike was fleeing. Generally, Spike did not come back. I have to say that if it was not for our film teacher who made us look at this, I probably would not have seen him. Overall, I thought this movie was good enough and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of British movies.
