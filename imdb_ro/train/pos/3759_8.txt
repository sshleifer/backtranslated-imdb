Two years later ... Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) are getting closer to rock stars in the future, but they still need more work in their instruments. In the future, Bill & Ted is in popular public history, but then an evil man (Joss Ackland) is ready to kill Bill & Ted, sending those who like to destroy them. Cyborgists are sent in the past and they kill the real Bill & Ted. Now both guys are spirits and have to travel through Heaven and Hell to save themselves for their future. Directed by Peter Hewitt (Tom and Huck, Borrowers) made a smart sequel with terrible visual effects. Much more fun and fun than the original. William Sadler (The Shawshank Redemption) steals the show as The Grim Reaper. The DVD has good anamorphic Widescreen transfer (1.85: 1) and Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. The DVD has a theater trailer and a fun scene behind the stage. This sequel was an Office Box like the original, but it's also (believe it or not), one of the best successes ever made (depending on your point of view). George Carlin resumes his role in the original at short notice. Pam Grier also appears in a small role. It's a pleasant fantasy comedy. (**** / *****).
