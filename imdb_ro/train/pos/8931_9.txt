Intruder (L'Intrus), a film directed by French director Clair Denis, is the release of the film. He follows his own spirit in time, space and character. There may be a plot, but I understand what I got from the description on the DVD Netflix lever. Honestly, it's probably best to know nothing about the movie before watching it, because then the viewer can withdraw any expectations. The film asks the thinker the look, but also the fact that he will not fully understand. The heart of man is the enigma of the film. Each image casts doubt on its role, nature and form. The heart is the intruder, that of the viewer and that of Louis. Louis's character is played by Michel Subor with the peace and mystery demanded by such a character. Honestly, anyone could have played Louis's character if he had a wandering, willing and comfortable heart. However, Subor is the one presented here; he becomes the film, his identity is inseparable from him. Many of the images of the film that is in my mind are rotating around her vocal, but mostly physical, expressions. The intruder is poetic in his ability to capture the tranquility and fullness of the movement, but more fluid than any literature in the form he refuses to take. "Surrealist" was a term used in describing this movie, but "quasirealist" is a more appropriate term. Nothing in the film exists beyond the possibilities of reality; the simple omnipresent score confirms that imagining in your music the connection between heart beats and weak light. Look at the trailer several times if you are attracted to visual images; see the movie to see the consequences of the combination of lyrics and the understanding of freedom.
