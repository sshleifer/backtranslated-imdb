Jim McKay has made one of the best movies you'll see all year. The quiet simplicity of this movie draws you from the opening shot and never leaves you to leave. There is no fake note in the whole movie. There is nothing. The hand room is never distracting and always where it should be. The three young girls whose lives we are always watching are real. There is no single battle in which the public is reminded to look at actresses who play a role. only real girls trying to find themselves. There is no political agenda, hidden or otherwise. It's cinematic to the most basic and though it's likely to be seen only by a handful of films, it deserves a much broader release. special hats for Hugh Hefner because he has given filmmakers the money they need to get this important movie. I can not wait to see what Mr. McKay is doing next.
