Xiao Chen Zhi Chun is a wonderful film, not only the year he was shot but now. It's a film of art that is not overtaken even in the 21st century. The director maintained good narrative skill and so made the story so smooth! The film reminds me of the new wave French film: Francois Truffaut "Femme d'a cote", which is similarly the subject.
