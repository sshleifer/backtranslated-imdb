I liked this movie as she reminded me of my marriage. It's very clean, you can see it with your family. Very well done. And the songs are OK. I think the writer's director is great. The film shows how marriages are progressing over time. They have couples at different stages of life and relationships in their lives, the film describes beautiful stages in parallel in the same story. Some dialogues are pretty good. The film describes complex human excitement, very beautiful, not dramatization. The perfect look is also not so perfect. It looks very nice the dynamics of the marriage arranged when it is new. The film is very well written and directed.
