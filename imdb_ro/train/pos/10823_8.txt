I always liked Johnny Concho and I want this movie to disappear on VHS and DVD. Frank Sinatra gives one of the most unusual shows in his career in this field. When we meet Frank for the first time in the lead role of the film, he is the brother of a notorious gunman who is out of town at the moment. Brother struck his terror in the heart of the city, and Frank takes full advantage of this to intimidate cities safely and safely in his shadow. Only Phyllis Kirk has a feeling for him. She is the daughter of Wallace Ford and Dorothy Adams. Two other gunmen arrive at William Conrad and Christopher Dark and it seems that Conrad killed Sinatra's brother and comes to his city to take over. They humiliate Sinatra and take him out of town. Kirk follows him. Sinatra overnight turns from punk to cowardly and becomes a man looking for a kind of spine. It is a well-played show, almost as good as his Oscar-nominated role in "The Man with a Golden Arm". Sin for some reason this has not been seen for years. Two other notorious performances are Keenan Wynn as a former gunfighter transformed preacher who helps Sinatra find what he needs to get up to Conrad and Dark. And then there is Conrad in what I think was his career role on the screen. He is a wicked evil evil evil, pure evil incarnated by walking and talking on the silver screen. All I love about Johnny Concho is the culmination of an unforgettable moment when Conrad and Dark are treated. Let's just say that I think Johnny Concho was MGM's answer to High Noon and a primer for what you do when evil causes a breakdown in all laws and order.
