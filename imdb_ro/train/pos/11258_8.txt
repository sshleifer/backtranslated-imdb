Spoilers! Classic 70 trash of sex! Galga Swedish (Helga) was what made this movie so great. She was beautiful, but what she really gave me was how sexual it was. She exudated massive amounts of sexuality throughout the movie. Her best scenes were when she was, we know herself. Whenever he was on the screen, I became transfixed. Also, Dr. Julia (the dimwitted masculine sister of the film) was very visually interesting. Although most 12-year-old girls have bigger breasts than Julia, she knew how to use her own scenes (especially the silk blouse and black skirt scenes) has caught my attention straight away. You also have to love the major scene where the bats strip nakkid; I do not know if I've ever seen something more absurd and sexy at the same time. Classic stuff!
