I recently had the opportunity to see "The Waterdance," and I really enjoyed it. I do not really understand why they say no dance, except for the dance from the comic strip at the end. We introduced the main characters in the movie, the disabled in a hospital. The story shows a love relationship between a helpless physical type and a healthy woman, which is a very sweet story. Unfortunately, you will not see movies like this today. I'm not "stuck in a warp time", im not saying that everything in the 1980s and early 90s was better than today, but I think the movie industry is getting worse and there are many things we can learn from movies old - nothing from 1920-1998.
