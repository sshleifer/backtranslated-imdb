Nothing revolutionary here; just an impeccably elegant, retained cinema. GARDE A VUE is almost exclusively limited to a police station and especially to a single interrogation room, but director Claude Miller (who has made the wonderful film THIS SWEET SICKNESS) others have interchangeable outdoor table glimpses as local minimalist scenography. Miller's collapse, especially early in the year, is breathtaking, and his refined maneuverability of the inner-pivot stage mission-scene makes viewing captivating. Lino Ventura is as gorgeous as he usually manages to legitimize a character that on paper is a cliche: the laconic, hard-born murder detective. Ventura lives the role, making it completely credible, even if the script allows us little access to his inner workings; the film ends at the very moment when it seems that it will be forced to face its failure for the first time. Michel Serrault is equal to the misconduct of the suspect murderer. The exchanges between the two are more often than the pregnant of the tension and the aura of a constant metamorphosis playing field for a battle of intelligence. Serrault's character is, in turn, deplorably full of cunning, cunning and pitiful; then later ... The "message" of GARDE A VUE, if someone were looking for one, is a condemnation of the police methodology and the types of pressures that make a policeman too jealous, if any, to close the cases to the detriment of justice. For most of its length, the film shines as one example of how it can turn a potentially soporific scenario set into a dramatic drama of the largest cinematic economy. <br /> <br />
