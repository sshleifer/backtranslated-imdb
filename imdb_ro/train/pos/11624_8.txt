Red Eye, a movie that the id wanted to see for a moment ... Cillian Murphy plays Jack Ripner, a leading Assassin's owner, and his literal killer plan to beat a deep man and his family. /> A daily woman "Lisa" (I think) is a normal woman, going to work, home ... worries ... hates to fly. Her grandmother's death is sending her on a flight that has delayed a flight a couple of times when he meets Jack ... a regular guy, until he reveals his enough profession and his plans, which coincide with her, is the key for the death of Keefe (sp?). She manages to save them ... but almost the cost of her life is taken away, Jack is beaten ... The balls are saved ... oh what the story * laughs * just joking, the movie is actually good, in fact, the best of the last year ... there are small things that you have to pay attention to earlier in the movie that plays great importance for the film later on. .. (Frankenstein Pen) I w touched it several times before I caught all the little jokes and quirks ... you have to see for thriller fans no sex, but there is a slight clue (the bathroom scene) "Thank you for quicky" and (accompanying woman) "Ohhh ... will be ONE of those flights" (the second accompanying woman) "Hey! This is not a motel" you have an idea ...
