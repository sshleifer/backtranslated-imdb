A true, healthy American story about adolescents who are interested in launching their own rocket in a Russian city in West Virginia after Sputnik's launch in 1957. Through trials, tribulations and perseverance beyond faith, they are finally to achieve its objectives. Jake Gyllenhaal, as leader of the group, is excellent in the lead role. As a math teacher, Laura Linney is pretty good, but her south emphasis is over the top. There is a standout that supports the performance of Chris Cooper, a head miner, who wants his son to follow him but gradually comes to the end of the film. What makes this movie so unusual for our times is that there are no scenes to keep its blindness and profanity. It is a symbol of an American story that is well done. Besides the scientific angle, we have the father-son disagreement, the football scholarship as a way to get rid of coal exploitation and the loving spirit of the family <br /> <br /> Why are not more photos recognized at this time?
