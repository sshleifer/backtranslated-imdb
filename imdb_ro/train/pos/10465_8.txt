Even at the beginning of his career, Capra was quite fulfilled by working with the room and his calendar. This is a thin story - and quite predictable at times - but it gets very good performances from its distribution and has some pretty complicated camera movements that involve the intimate viewer. The first part seems to be a Cinderella story, although anyone with the brain can see that the bottom will fall out of it - the rich "prince" will lose his fortune. However, due to its good distribution and rapid rhythm, it is easy to get caught in the clich√©s. Then the movie becomes more original, because the married couple has to find a way to live their lives. The end is very predictable but satisfactory. I also want to thank the title of writer: Very spiritual and fun.
