Although I was in this film starring Sheriff Hodges, she still managed to jump into more places and think I'm not that easy. We might say they are biased about the movie and of course they are, but I did not see the finished product until 12/27/2006 and I was extremely pleased. I'm not a horror movie fan alright, but I love the old "B" movies and the Sci Fi movie black and white movies. This movie will make you "believe" that you know when something will happen, then it does not happen. It will stop you completely. I would suggest watching the movie first, then the director's notes and special features. It's so well written, directed and filmed, and I can personally tell you it was a real joy to work with this cast and crew. I sincerely hope to be part of Brian and Laurence's future projects.
