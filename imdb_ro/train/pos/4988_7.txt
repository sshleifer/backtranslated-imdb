The man's castle is seated in one of those jerry-built settlements on vacant land and parks, which in those days were called "Hoovervilles", named after the 31st unfortunate president, who remained stuck with the Great Depression place in his administration. The proposal of this film is that a man's house is still his castle even when it's just a little house in a Hooverville. Spencer Tracy has such a beard and the truth to be told this guy even in good times you would not work so much. But in a very typical part for Tracy, before he was cast as a priest in San Francisco, the beginning of a series of classical roles, he plays a tough mug that takes Loretta Young. of things about the Castle of Man is that it shows the effects of depression on women as well as on men. Women had more strains, and if men had difficulty finding a job, women had twice as much. And they were sexually harassed, and some protested only for a square table. Spence takes Loretta Young, who is confronted with such problems, and makes no demands in her in his castle. Pretty soon, though they are in love, though Tracy is not likely to sit down. The scenes of love had a plus of zing for them, as Tracy and Young had a crazy adventure during Man Castle shooting. Both were Catholic and married, and in those days it was a barbaric barrier. Both Tracy and the young people have taken the Catholic faith quite seriously. Also in the cast are Walter Connolly as a kind of figure father for the whole camp, Marjorie Rambeau who has gone through all the Pit traps can meet and try to direct him and Arthur Hohl, a very bad creep that also has the eye on the Young . Hohl brought the plot of Man's Castle to his climax by his plans. <br /> <br /> The man's castle is a gloomy look at the Great Depression, and not the usual movie eviction movie for those who try to avoid that kind of reality in their entertainment.
