I remember seeing this at a Salem cinema (where I attended the Kiddie Matin√©e almost every Saturday) in Dayton, Ohio when I was a little boy and never forgot. I simply amazed myself and my friends. I wish there was a way to see it again! I tried to find a short pants compilation or something like that without any results. It was only now that I discovered that it was a Cousteau movie, and that made me even more crazy. How the hell he accomplished this is beyond my understanding. The fish IS IN THE LAST DAY OF THE CAT in a moment, if I remember correctly! If someone can help me find a way to see it again, I would be extremely grateful!
