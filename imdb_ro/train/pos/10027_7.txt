Sure, Titanic was a good movie, the first time you saw it, but you should see it the second time, and your opinion about the movie will change. The first time you see the movie, you see the love story and think: ooh, how romantic. The second time (and I'm not the only one to think about it) is just annoying and you just sit there looking at the movie thinking, When's this d ** n the ship is going to sink ??? And even this is not as impressive when you see it several times. Action in this movie is not bad, but it certainly is not great. I was glad that DiCaprio did not win an Oscar for that film, who does he think he is, Anthony Hopkins or Denzel Washington? He makes a half good movie and will not make a movie for less than $ 20 million. And then everyone is surprised that there is almost no movie with him in it. But enough, in my eyes, the worst character of the movie. Kate Winslet's performance, on the other hand, was great. I'm sorry that the director is very talented to put together a movie of this magnitude. There is a lesson to learn about this movie: there are too many love stories as it is, filmmakers should not try to add a love story to each movie! From a possible 100%, I give this film only 71%.
