This movie is wonderful on so many levels ... and none of them is the level that was meant to be great on. Just remember this: When you look at Shaun of the Dead and other recent zombie movies ... be it good or bad ... That's the formula I'm using. That's what makes zombie movies so great. And what makes it better than great is the story behind the movie. A simple web search will give you everything you need to know. <br /> <br /> In total, it does not stay. There is never a point to think of you, "to go further" ... the fast moving and the wonderful corners. This is the less sportive number of zombies in Italy. <br /> <br /> So terrible, it's great! If your language spends a long time in the cheek ... you rent it, you buy it, you love it. As an extraordinary note: if you see it on DVD, you will notice that there are sound effects in the menu screen under the musical score ... Well ... that's because the music was raised directly from the trailer ... what is probably the only workout of that music that still exists long enough to run.
