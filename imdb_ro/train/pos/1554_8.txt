I saw this at the theater in the early 1970s. The most memorable and frightening scene is when the German army attacks for the first time the gas of raw yellow mustard gas. The Germans and their horses are covered from head to toe (or hooves) with strange protective suits. Experienced British soldiers can not find gas masks (only) and wait again for gas clouds and German attackers. The gas clouds move closer, finally encircling British defenders. The Germans are slowly turning menacingly into their frightening clothes. Suddenly a scream from the defenders ... This gas is like no other they have experienced before .... Now you will know why I remembered this scene for the past 30+ years and still trembled, I think you too!
