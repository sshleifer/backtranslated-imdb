Rod Serling was, of course, a genius, and his wonderful, playful, creative mind left some of his time in which he also lived television examples in that state of development. There are no such performances now, but rather the "Housewife" battling with Eva Longoria or Terri Hatcher, or with the humorous miseries of humor and the witchcraft that lurk us on our high-tech screens. Jack Elam went into the episode with such precision, acting with his usual madness that I can not believe that Rod Serling adapted to the show before this week around Elam, even though he was an auxiliary of the flow story. This episode ends with a twist, as usual, but shock and humor are mixed with a special "Serlingesque" dexterity. Rex Lewis Field
