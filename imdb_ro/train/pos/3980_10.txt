I watched this every night on VH1 in the last week. This is a wonderful portrait of the drug epidemic and how the drugs have been exposed in the media in the late 1960s and to the 70s. Woodstock, Easy Rider, Beatles, Morrison's Death, Hendrix, Joplin are here. Vh1 has made a complete portrayal of life and times during the "drug years". From the Sanfrancisco Bay area to Studio 54, this documentary presents the evolution and progress of the drug business and death and new life it has breathed in American culture. From Marijuana to LSD to Cocaine, this documentary shows how the drugs went into the country, the hippie movement, the conservative resistance, and how the drugs performed the arts (music, movies, etc.) that contained many fascinating interviews and news videos. <br /> <br /> Drug Movies: Easy Travel on Smoke Travel Madness Blow Boogie Nights
