One of the best musicals made, one that is timeless and worth seeing from time to time. Delicious! The act, especially by Ron Moody as Fagin, is superb. The costumes are refined ... even the crushed. The two youngsters who play Oliver and The Artful Dodger are gorgeously talented. Oliver Reed does a great job of playing Bill Sykes where you can not hope for him, but he hopes he's getting a terrible end ... he's doing. <br /> <br /> Dance is intelligently choreographic and fascinating. Oliver can keep his own with My Fair Lady, Sound of Music, Oklahoma, etc. A movie for the whole family.
