envy is not as amusing as I thought it would have been originally, but after a few reviews I've read I found it more fun than people give them the props for, now true is not a gag a minute movie like zoolander or dodgeball, but ben styller and jack black work well between them and Christopher Walken is as big as ever, so the story is about the black jack character who invented a spray that makes the dog disappear, obviosly Ben does not want any part but when the product makes Jack do not like to see the envy, it's not great by all means and both ben stiller and black jack have fun and better movies under their belt, but if your fans I have recommend this as a funny movie and I laughed at my ass on quite a few times as a big fan of id id style I have to say that this is a smaller stylist but still very fun, give him a watch
