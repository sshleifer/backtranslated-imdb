Kiera Nightly moved directly from the P & P set to this action movie ... she could hardly choose to remake her picture more dramatically. A Big Success in Love In fact, and as Lizzie in Jane Austen's classic, she is, once again, "having a go". Just as her bikini-dressed warrior woman in King Arthur had more skin than muscle, it's hard to imagine that this delicate frame is a life of reward hunters ... but then it's exactly what Domino Harvey did (the real) I (one of the greatest night fans) think she also bears her. <br /> <br /> * 90210 (for the non-American world) is the Beverly Hills postal code in LA, where all film stars live. * Domino Harvey's biggest film was Candidate Manchurian (appearing in the film). * Domino Harvey died of an overdose of drugs in the bathroom before the film was released in June 2005 after being arrested for drug trafficking. She had just finished the negotiations so some of her music was included in the movie. * Kiera Knightly alludes to the sexuality of Domino Harvey in her interview with Lucy Liu. If you find this movie too late, check out Domino Harvey, because facts are more amazing than fiction.
