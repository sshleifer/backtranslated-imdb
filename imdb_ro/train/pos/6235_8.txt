This is one of the best movies Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers, or at least one of my favorites. Most of the A-R movies feature love story, but nice cuties. This still has the courtyard, but not as pronounced as the other films. This film has not only the dancing but pleasant characters, but also a bunch of good songs. Music is the central theme here, and what's nice is adding a solo tap by Rogers. She was not just a super dancer, but a very beautiful woman and one with an extraordinary figure. She also danced with Fred, of course, and they are always a fun pair to watch on the dance floor. Growing up in the 1950s watching "Ozzie & Harriet" on TV, it was a real hit the first time I saw this to see a young Harriet Hilliard. No surprise than Ozzie fell for this beauty. Although she had that short hairstyle in the 1930s, I immediately recognized her voice. Betty Grable and Lucille Ball also appear in this film, but I have to admit that I have not finished the ball yet. I can not find her, but I know she's here. Astaire, with the exception of those who chewed in the first third of the movie, was fun to watch and Randolph Scott - though better in the westerns - is also sympathetic. This is simply a beautiful movie, feel good and good if you want to enjoy the great talent of Astaire and Rogers.
