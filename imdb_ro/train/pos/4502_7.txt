I have seen almost all the movies of Cynthia Rothrock, and for me this is more fun. Reminds me of Jackie Chan's early movies. Of course, Ms. Rothrock can not be the greatest actress, but it's good to watch both as a martial artist and a very nice young woman. This movie, though probably not the best of all its films, was the most fun.
