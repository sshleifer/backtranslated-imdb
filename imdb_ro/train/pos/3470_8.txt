Even if I'm young enough, The Beatles are my band ABSOLUTELY FAVORITE! I have never had the chance to hear their music as releases, but I've loved them since I remember. It's kind of a movie that's worth trying at one time. I can see why it was not released in the cinema, but it's certainly a great movie that's on TV. I sank through my television guide and saw this movie, not much detail except something like "John Lennon and Paul McCartney meet after The Beatles parted, Jared Harris Stars." I have never heard of him (John played) or Aiden Quinn who played Paul. However, they are certainly underestimated the actors! The film had a slow start, but as it grew up, I could see how well played Quinn, but especially Harris their characters. Like a big fan, I know how real Lennon and McCartney are. The script was brilliant and Harris received the accent, personality and manners of Lennon! Quinn played McCartney well enough, but sometimes he got into his Irish accent. Makeup artists made them look great. This paragraph can be considered as a SPOILER *: As I mentioned earlier, it descended at a slow start but soon developed and became a rather emotional film. I found a little in the park a total loss of time and quite unreasonable for both musicians. As for Lennon's non-political line in the Italian restaurant, totally useless. The end was very miraculous and brings a tear to the eyes whenever I look at it. It's quite different from the other biographical films we've seen where it's about how the Beatles gathered and became famous, and those who never did the characters so well. E.g. "Backbeat". In conclusion, I would say, if you are a fan of Beatles or John Lennon or Paul McCartney, give him a chance to have a pleasant surprise. Just about 95 minutes, it's worth waiting for the movie to grow. If anyone knows if the 1976 meeting really happened, send it to the comment page for this movie. He would be very interested.
