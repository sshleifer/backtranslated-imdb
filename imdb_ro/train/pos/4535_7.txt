The first 50 minutes of this movie were pretty boring. She focused on Doyle's personal problems, including his sick wife, death threats by fans, a scattered publisher, and feelings of guilt towards his mentally ill father. Even though these subjects had an important impact on Doyle's life, I was more curious about the birth of Sherlock Holmes. The last 40 minutes were excellent. I found a look at Doyle's head, as Holmes created and why he had to kill Holmes. The actors are excellent. Including intriguing Selden, played by Tim McInnerny, Arthur Conan Doyle, a convincing role played by Douglas Henshall and Brian Cox as role model for Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Bell. Locations are good, especially for a TV movie and work on the camera is enjoyable. If the first 50 minutes were as good in the last 40 minutes, it would have been a small masterpiece.
