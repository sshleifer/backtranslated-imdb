I really liked this movie. He managed to do something that makes some movies now; has offered family values ​​while having fun. Nancy Drew is a heroine for all generations and a role model for young girls to look at. The girls I was enjoying with the film and kept talking about Nancy when I left the theater. The film has relatively few problems for families and I do not think parents will get bored of sitting in the theater. No, he will not win an Oscar and have no special effects or even not a terrible mystery to scare, but he has fun and kept the truth of the book spirit. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone with a young girl (she will love her!) Or any fan of the books. You will not be disappointed.
