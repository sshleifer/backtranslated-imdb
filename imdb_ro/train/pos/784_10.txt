I enjoyed this movie very much. It was fun and sad and yes, guy Andie MacDowell, who was beaten, was hot. Interesting, realistic characters and plots, as well as beautiful landscapes. I think my mom would love me. I still think he should have been allowed to call him the Sad F ** kers Club, though ...
