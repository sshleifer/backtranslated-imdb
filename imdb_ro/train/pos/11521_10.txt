Magicians are a wonderful walk from start to finish, largely due to the magic generated by the stars. Alan Arkin is fantastic in one of the best roles of the past decades. Like any very nice film, it's a journey in which the theme is the redemption and the results of the dream. I can not believe this movie is so hard to find - I would have bought it on DVD in a heartbeat, but I still have not found a plug.
