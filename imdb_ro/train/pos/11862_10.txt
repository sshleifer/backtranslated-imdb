for those playing video games here, somebody noticed that GTA: Vice City Mansion inside the game and other things, including the guns in the movie connected to this movie, and this movie inspired the game makers (Rockstar Games) to copy some things from this movie and how it is one of the best 80 movies out there I recommend this to anyone who has not yet seen 10/10 no question asked
