My mom took me to see this movie when it came out around Christmas in 1976. I liked it then and I like it now. I know everyone enjoys Barbra's hair in this, but I think it looks and sounds great! ... And I seem to have remembered a number of women who copied that permed look at that time! Also, the striped scene between Streisand and Kristoferson is just so sexy! And the music is great. This is the groovy 70's Babes at its best!
