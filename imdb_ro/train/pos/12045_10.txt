I watched this movie for the first time when I was a kid and it is the only time in my life that I remember putting our hands over our face and eyes with total horror at a certain scene. I remembered again with a disappointment with my united friends and I quickly purchased the video with a lot of hesitation that I could add (to my surprise I found it only on the web in the United States when it was made in England!) When I looked at him again, my reaction and my surprise were almost the same, horrified and afraid, and I never beat my heart so much. This is in my opinion SCARIEST movie ever made, Hollywood movies seem to be tame in comparison and a little Pony and Trap (carp), forgive the word. What is amazing, however, is the power of this film, and at Uni when I look at it with almost twenty my associates, I have never heard so many screams, too! Even the sight of the video brings to me the fear of God in that particular scene, and it has made me feel that I will never go alone in the dark!
