Of course this film is not fairly historic, but it's great fun. Most of DeMille's pictures, especially the later epochs, are slow and fertile, but the action moves in a clip. The story is basically a series of peaks with very quiet moments. The action takes us from an Indian raid into a cabin; one of the best parts of the film with Jean Arthur excellent as he tried to dry his natives painted by war. She is followed by her and Cooper being taken to the war camp and being tortured. Later there is a prolonged battle with Cheyenne. Everything is ridiculous, but very fun and fun from start to finish. Jean Arthur is one of the best actresses of this age and shines here.
