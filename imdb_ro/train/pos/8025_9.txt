I like this movie. songs and story lines are very fun. and the play "to say goodbye" always moves me. which is a brilliant thing to do to bring dolls to life in a way that cares about these things made of fabrics and fabrics and anything else. great voice and great talent. why were all the other muppet movies that came after this so much less exciting, moving and funny? is that Mr. henson is so loser?
