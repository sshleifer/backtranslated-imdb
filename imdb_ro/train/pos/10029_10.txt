Why people crazy about this movie and not about terrible movies such as the Godfather. Titanic is the biggest film of the 21st century. With great action, direction, effects, music and, in general, everything. This movie is always removed by everyone, because one day some said they did not like it anymore, so most of the world decided to agree. There is nothing wrong with this movie. All I can say is that this film, not only being the most powerful Oscar-winning film of all time, the most money ever made and unfortunately one of the most underestimated films I've ever seen. Besides, it's really the best movie of all time. The only movies that come close to being like all the Star Wars and Lord of the Rings trilogies or something from the Hitchcock or Spielberg masters or Tim Burton. These are good movies and directors, but none match James Cameron's TITANIC Masters.
