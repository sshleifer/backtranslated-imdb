I really enjoyed this movie. All three stars (Connery, Fishburne and Underwood) offer credible performances, and Harris enjoys the top. The lights and nails shot in some of Harris' scenes make him look really diabolical. The surprising turn of the plot at the end makes it interesting. It's not a great movie, it's a nice movie. I gave her 7 out of 10.
