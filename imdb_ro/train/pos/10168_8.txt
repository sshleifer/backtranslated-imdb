Look at Eva Longoria and Paul Rudd in a movie about a dead girlfriend who haunts her new girlfriend. She's Gabrielle from Disperate Housewives and the guy wearing "Panther Cologne" in Anchorman. If you expect a Golden Globe nominated movie, then you have to rethink how you look at the movies. However, if you are willing to suspend reality for 90 minutes and want to watch a funny movie, then you've come to the right place. Characters are funny. They work together very well. The real match is Paul Rudd and Lake Bell. It's as fun as friends and it was fun and good at the same time. I went with my wife, enjoyed her and so did.
