I just bought and watched the DVD of this movie. The transfer of DVD is last year, 2001. This 1988 film is really a great movie. Overlooked by most people. I saw her in theater in 1988 and I loved her ever since. I like the opening shot in Pittsburgh (not Baltimore, as another user commented). Face Pittsburgh looks like one of the most beautiful cities in the world! And I have to say Pitts' tour on the Nicky trash truck is very scenic, exciting! Tom Hulce, as the others have said, offers remarkable and wonderful performance. The DVD is a good transfer without extras but with a widescreen format. I recommend those who love the movie.
