I liked this movie. I knew it would be full of camp and holiness as the original series. I realized that warming his heart sees Adam West, Burt Ward, Frank Gorshin and Julie Newmar again together. Anyone who loved the Batman series in the 1960s would have had to enjoy Return to the Batcave. You could say that the actors had a lot of fun doing this movie, especially Adam West. And I bet he'd come back with joy in Batman's suit if the script had to do it. I told a number of friends about this movie that she chose not to see ... now they wanted to have. I have all 120 original episodes on VHS. Now, this movie will join my collection. Thank you for meeting Adam and Burt.
