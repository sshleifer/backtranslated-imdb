We hope the score has changed for the moment thanks to the brilliant and stunning review that convince everyone to go and watch the movie, creating an instant "8" chorus, the true score of this movie. <br /> <br /> mentioned before Chris Rock is the King! Before watching this movie, we were not too big about him, but now we're knocking on Chris Rock's door, asking him to take me as a protector. This movie is really funny, if you do not find this funny movie, you need therapy and humor, which targets all areas of society, including race (predictable), class division, love, wealth, employment, dreams, comedy . .. the list goes on. It was a slight disappointment for me. That was the fact that when I entered this movie I did not realize it was actually a remake of "Heaven Can Wait" another quite good film made in 1971 with Warren Beatty. As such, I was quite surprised when I looked at this movie and suddenly the plot began to do it to be similar to an older movie I had seen on television a few weeks ago Whether this movie is in my opinion a better version of two of them, simply because of the different areas it covers and the fact that Chris Rock is more fun than Warren Beatty at any time of any day of any week of every year of anything ... get the picture. <br /> <br /> Well, to the real plot of the movie. <br /> <br /> Do not browse the experience for you! Do not read the plot! Just go and watch a movie because there were two comments on IMDb so far that raved crazy about it, go see it because it's the funniest thing you've seen for a long time, go and see it because it's a cinematic experience that does not let you play cinema tickets. Go see this because it's a good movie!
