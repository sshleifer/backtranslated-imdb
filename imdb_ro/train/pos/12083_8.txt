The second feature relates to a young London woman desperate for a job, happy to accept the secretary position with an elderly woman and her son. Thrillers about people who are kept in a house against their will always make me a little uneasy - I feel like a prisoner - but this classic B movie is neither lurid nor claustrophobic. It's extraordinary and unlikely, but not uninteresting, and our heroine (Nina Foch) is fast on her feet. Rehashing this in 1986 (as "Dead of Winter") did not prove to be wise because plotting elements are not today. "Julia Ross" is extremely compact (too short at 65 minutes!) But it stays well up to a climax that feels a little careless. *** from ****
