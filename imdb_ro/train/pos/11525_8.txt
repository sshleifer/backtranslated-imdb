This movie is wonderful for three main reasons. It's beautiful aesthetics. I really enjoyed this. There is a bold color theme in the whole movie with extraordinary costumes and scenic sets. A photo that looks very expensive (and probably not) complements the look. I always enjoy those stories about helpless groups / singers who get together and become a family. Sometimes they fall into the clich√©, but this does not happen. This group of actors really describes really bad, but very pleasant characters. Alan Larkin is the best (between him, the van and the road movie theme, I could not remember my favorite Little Miss Sunshine last year?). I discovered Fabrizio Bentivoglio, a very interesting actor, and I have just annoyed a little bit of Til Schweiger's performance. The opening scene, all the scenes in which the tricks are puzzling are very funny. There is a mixture of humor and excitement in the movie. I really like the end. And, of course, it's the magician's theme. A good magician makes the audience look where he wants to create an illusion. What happens to be exactly what a movie director does and that's why they call it a magical movie.
