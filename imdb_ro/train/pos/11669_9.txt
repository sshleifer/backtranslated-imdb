Being the prototype of the classic adventure film Errol Flynn and having a good story, as well as two brilliant co-stars in Maureen O'Hara (which is an extraordinary beauty!) And Anthony Quinn, I can recommend this movie to everyone who has even the most little pleasure for love and adventure. <br /> <br /> Hollywood to the best!
