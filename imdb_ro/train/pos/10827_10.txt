Crazy Style was compared to Spinal Tap, as both are comedy about R & R washing groups. In fact, the likeness is over because Still Crazy is much better written and acted, while the Spinal Tap scenario deteriorates from the first 10 funny moments in a sense that makes Beavis and Butthead look sophisticated in comparison. Still Crazy is a form, but the simplicity of the characters and the unexpectedly high quality of some musical numbers for me have managed to offset the a priori predictability of the film. People expecting a Spinal Tap satire attempt would be disappointed with the film's incomprehensible nature, but it would make Still Crazy a successful self-ironic success over a pompous but unsuccessful shot of satire that is Spinal Tap.
