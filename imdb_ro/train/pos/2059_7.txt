What fun b-film! Shepis is absolutely beautiful and Scarecrow is distinct and original. He really brought me back to the 80s monsters. The budget is obviously low and not all are Pacino behind the goal, but it does not matter because it's never taken seriously. From the trailer trash to the Operitor's high flying martial arts moves, it's really a b-movie. Take some refreshments, snacks and a couple of friends, hit and relax. I liked this movie so much that I came out of all three scary movies. Sure, I'm not for everyone but for everyone. Sometimes you just need to set the cover down and smile.
