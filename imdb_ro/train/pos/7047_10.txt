this movie must be seen. the most true picture of what's happening in the world that I've seen from Darwin's nightmare. Go see! and if you're lucky enough to open it in your city, make sure you see it on the big screen instead of the DVD. The writing is sharp and the direction is good enough for ideas to pass, though hard to perfect. Joan Cusack is amazing, and the rest of the song is also good. It's inspiring that John Cusack made this film and I think he had to use some of his money to do it. It's a wild, absurd walk, obviously done without the resources it needs, but it does succeed. Jon Stewart, Steven Colbert, SNL, and even Bill Maher did not show the courage to say what this movie says.
