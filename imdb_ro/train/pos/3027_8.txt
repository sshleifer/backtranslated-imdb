I look at a lot of good, bad, indifferent movies; there is usually something of interest to fix, even if it's just about the established design or the reliable work of a good character actor or the fornicate laughter that comes out of watching the ineptitude captured forever. I was quite pleasantly surprised by this movie, one I have not seen before. Graham Greene has often been translated into the film, of course, in masterpieces such as "Thin Man" and in smaller vehicles. The "Confidential Agent" is one of those smaller vehicles but manages to bring me somewhere, despite an insufficient direction, of the inconsistency between Bacall and Boyer's representations as British and Spanish and almost total lack of any chemistry between the two leaders. In some ways, this last "problem" actually begins to work in favor of the film, how can it really love to flourish in the atmosphere of killing fascism and capitalism to meet the tragedy of a person? The most convincing aspect of the film comes directly from the psychological complexity of Greene, who faces the film. I know some see how the deliberate rhythm here is boring and I can understand that. However, we have found that the accentuated emphasis has not been removed from what is a claustrophobic world. (Boyer is wonderful as he usually conveys a rich mixture of fatigue, tragedy, hope and fervor with his magnificent voice and happy eyes) spiraling spirals of a man's poor hopes against a world of oppression and money. What is a thief? How good is love in the face of death? Where does it just start exploiting and ending profits? The film does not rise to the level of art, and therefore can not hope to answer such questions, but it is much more than mere entertainment, and its crimes and culprit are very attractive. The lack of glitz, the "bubble", the narrative "bounce" contributes to transforming this film into a very valuable film. And there is no happy ending, because history has written the end.
