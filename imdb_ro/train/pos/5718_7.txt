I wanted to see Sarah Buffy on the big screen, so I first bought tickets and then checked the IMDb comments. I was worried about seeing a bad movie. I enjoyed watching the movie. Some parts, obviously meant to be scary, were actually pretty humorous, almost like the Buffy Vampire Slayer. I do not consider this movie bad. There's no great movie. Just a horror movie pretty well done. It does not rely very much on special effects, but on camera angles, acting, music. In my opinion, the act was fine. Sarah did a very good job, quite convincing. And the other actors were not bad, I liked Yoko. The sets are beautiful (and I do not care that the sets are exactly the ones that were used in the original Japanese). Spooky moments were often predictable. But not always. I saw a horror, and I did not expect you to scare me now, but it happened at least twice. Niche. The film had some beautiful, almost original scenes, such as garbage tracks, simple ghosting effects for him, the boy's eyes, the cat that made noisy noises, the dead boy and his mother. You do not go if you want to see Sarah in another Buffy episode, because it's very different from Buffy's job, much worse. You do not go if you just want to watch movies that bring Oscar nominations. It's a good horror film, enough suspense. I gave her a 7.
