There are a lot of Romanesque and comic material from Modesty Blaise, which would be great in a movie. Unfortunately, several attempts have been made and they have failed to overcome the great potential of the character. So, no, this is not the Modesta you know from the comic strip (now reprinted in the beautiful editions of Titan's books). This is Modesty about 5 or 6 years before the first tape and what can be composed of her story is accurate. Miramax had film rights to the character, with Quentin Tarantino as a lawyer and technical adviser. The early projects of the Miramax project have attempted to adapt one of the best novels, but have always managed to leave an essential element. Tarantino was not satisfied with any of them and offered to remove his name from the project so he could continue. For the credit of the studio, they wanted to keep it in the process because they knew it "had" its character and its world. With the film's near-expiration, they decided to try a very different approach. The result was "My Name is Modesty," a small direct-video movie that introduces the character. The film does not introduce Willie Garvin or Sir Gerald. These characters are important to Blaise's adventures in most of the published stories. What this film is doing demonstrates the power of the character. He never loses his calm and never doubts that he is responsible even unarmed in a room full of gangsters of weapons. Most of the movie takes place in a casino, which has undoubtedly saved money on production. Does not matter. The film does not meet as cheaply. Instead, it provides a fairly comprehensive (and credible) story for the character and demonstrates how far he is thinking ahead. If Miramax adapts any of the stories or comic stories now, they have set the character's background nicely and will not have to spend much time on the "origin" of the character. I realize that the words "Direct-to-Video" do not inspire confidence, but this movie deserves a look.
