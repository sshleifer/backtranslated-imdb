I can honestly say that I did not expect this movie to be good. I do not like family movies. I'm far from Shahid Kapoor's fan. The last film of the director (MPKDH was totally stupid and the music was very boring and unpleasant, but Amrita Rao became my favorite after Main Hoon Na and Seema Biswas, Alok Nath and Anupam Kher, who are really watching the movie and I was very impressed ... He brings us the young lovers of MPK with a HAHK wedding knot and we have a winner. The story story is similar to that of HAHK, which at first began to turn into a serious way , and the director made a character you could relate to, which I did not like HAHK was that the characters were too eccentric. Shahid Kapoor surprised me with good performance, major improvement, and most importantly , it suits the role, best is Amrita Rao, in fact, this is her best interpretation, they are forced to love her performance. Sameer Soni, Amrutha Prakash, An up Kher, Alok Nath and Seema Biswas are terrible way You say an actor does not feel right now. <br /> <br /> The songs were quite disappointing, but they will sound better after watching them. Mujhe Haq Hai and Do Anjaane Ajnabi are beautiful ballads. Milan Abhi Aada Adhura Hai is also nice to watch. The songs are not colorful and dancing, and they are more like ballads. The exception is Hamari Shaadi Mein, who is obliged to remind you of HSSH and HAHK. So what was the defect of the movie? The film gets pretty slow, and the end is quite wide. But the movie continues to work at a good pace, making it a perfect family film.
