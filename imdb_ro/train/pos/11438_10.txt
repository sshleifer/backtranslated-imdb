Ralph and Mumford, strayed in their own land, were grasped to be the pawns of Synanomess Botch. Twice a time are their story, the characters they meet and their struggle to do things well. With a surprisingly impressive sound and a wonderful voice that acts by some of the best in business, this offbeat movie strikes the mark. The animation process, while similar to the South Park style cut, is much smoother and much more three-dimensional. If I did not know the animation was in this style, I would swear it was a traditional pen and ink. If you can watch this movie in Dolby Surround or THX, please! You will not lose anything if not, but if you do, you will get much more from the experience!
