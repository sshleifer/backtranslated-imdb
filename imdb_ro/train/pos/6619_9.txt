Blade Runner (Deckard is a Replicant!), City of Lost Children (augmented senses or anything else used and abused and, moreover, good, giving us just less than what we could dream of) and <br> /> Indeed, it should be added. <br /> <br /> For some time, I've been waiting for an animated movie that could affect me, just like Miyazaki's. This is the first. <br /> <br /> Hmm, scratch the "animated" part of this. I have an intense love-hate relationship with the noir movie and, hey, if you do not go, it's gotta be love, is not it? But there are so many sci-fi and noir themes totally immersed in this movie that it's just a wonder to look. These people did an incredible job!
