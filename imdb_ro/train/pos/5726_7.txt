"The Grudge" is a remake of Shimizu's own series of Japanese horror films. Shimizu knows he does not have anything new to do, so he does what any intelligent person would do in his place: he forgets the logic and focuses on giving viewers a fun walk. He uses the familiar clich√©s associated with phantom stories, but Shimizu plays with these elements in an imaginative manner. The nonlinear narrative is not just a trick, but an interesting way to present sequences from different perspectives. Finally, all I can say is that if the only purpose of a horror movie is to scare the audience (just as a comedy makes people laugh), this movie has succeeded with flying colors. I watched her in a theater with an audience and it was fun to see the wild spectators over it. It probably does not play well in the living room.
