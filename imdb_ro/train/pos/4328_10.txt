I bought the DVD of this version to compare the current version of BBC 2005 (which is brilliant). 1985 was adapted by Arthur Hopcraft, who adapted Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy for television and who died this year (2005). I remember a great deal, especially from Rigg and Elliott, and the music on the move. (Music in the 2005 version is much more underrated but very damaging.) Just to pick up other commentators on a few points: Richard Carstone is Ada Claire's lover, not Esther's. Esther had no uncle. Charlie Drake has never played Krook in any version, nor played Toby Esterhase in TTSS! Krook is played by comedian Johnny Vegas in the 2005 version. Toby was played by Bernard Hepton. Both versions are honorable and admirable adaptations of Dickens' great novel. Read the book now! It's not perfect, and sentimentalism can make you wander sometimes, but I defy you not to cry and laugh!
