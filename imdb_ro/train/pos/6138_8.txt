This is an old-fashioned, wonderful kid fun movie, definitely the most enchanting witch witch ever. Unlike many modern stories that seem to enjoy dark witchcraft, this is simply a magic story about hocus pocus, who is cute, open-hearted and charming. The story is resumed in 1940 in the English village of Peppering Eye where three children, Cockney, Charlie, Carrie, and Paul Rollins, are evacuated from the dangers of the city's air raids during the Second World War. They are wrongly sent to live together with Eglantine Price, who studies through correspondence courses to become an apprentice witch. Eglantine and the children's trio use a magic button to travel to London on their flight bed. Here they meet Emilius Browne, the fraudulent director of the Miss Price School of Writers' Correspondence School. Miss Price prepares to work on spells designed to bring life to life. Meanwhile, they also have to deal with a shadowy character named Bookman and his associate, Swinburne. Angela Lansbury is, of course, wonderful as an eccentric witch in training, Miss Price. David Tomlinson plays Mr. Browne, the director of the witchcraft school, who has now become a street magician. This actor was previously cast as a children's father in Mary Poppins. In fact, this movie is a story quite reminiscent of Mary Poppins earlier, both wonderful fantasy fantasies for children. Perhaps this movie does not have such memorable music as Chim-Chim-Cheree, but it boasts some appealing songs. Some were critical, but the movie has great special effects. Generally, the story is a pleasant family fun. It is a pity if modern children are too sophisticated for this wonderful and fascinating story, which should appeal to the child in us all.
