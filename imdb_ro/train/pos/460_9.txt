It's a series of wonderful murders, bringing together three young British television bosses (Denis Waterman, James Bolam and Alun Armstrong) as retired detectives brought back to help clarify old cases under Amanda Redman. The three irritable elderly police officers make a brilliant team, applying detection methods twenty years old in a police force that has since moved long - sometimes with effect, sometimes with the horror of their high-ranking officers. The three are portrayed sympathetically, wicked and all. There are splendid comic scenes and some very moving scenes, each of the three having to understand the old and the legacy of their past. At the end of the first six-part series (promised a subsequent series next year), each of the characters has grown. Widower James Bolam can not bear with his wife's premature death. Lothario Denis Waterman learns to accept her role as grandfather. And even obsessed Alun Armstrong is helped by his new friends to fight the demons of his past - and continue to take drugs! While Amanda Redman has to deal with the too familiar conflict between having a life and a career. The story lines were interesting, if they were quite dependent on the wonders of DNA testing. But it is about the interaction of four of Britain's best actors who made the series unforgivable.
