I just watched this movie on Showtime. Quite accidentally actually. If I had not only had 6 hours of sleep in the last two days, then I would not have come home earlier from work. If I had not come home earlier from work, I would not have seen this movie. I would not have known what I was missing, but I would have missed a lot. This is the movie. Almost plays the effect of Kevin Bacon. This and causality (hence the verbiage above). Whatever character intertwines in one way or another. Action, reaction, interaction, non-interaction. This movie is great. I'll have to find a copy to buy.
