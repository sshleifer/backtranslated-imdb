I just do not understand why this movie is beaten here. Jeez. It's mindless, it's not polished and it's (as I read) lost some. The distribution of this movie plays their characters in "T" (If you watched Permanent Midnight and you became a fan of Ben Stiller, then you will be disappointed). These are wrong misunderstood mistakes that try to save the city / the world only with stones and determination. The problem is that they do not realize their limits until the big showdown and that's the point! This is 3 times the movie that The Spy Who Shagged Me was still received by the same demographic group, probably the same people who feel the first AP film compared to the sequel. I just do not understand. Works work on more than one level; if you have not succeeded, I know at what level you are.
