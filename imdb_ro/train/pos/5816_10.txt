The first time I saw this "movie" I liked it. When I was 11, I'm more interested in music and dance. As I grew up, I became more interested in action. While the first half is just a retrospection of Michael's career (from Jackson 5 to "Bad"), it was still fun to look at. The success of Badder could have been left out, though the children were pretty good. "Speed ​​Demon" and "Leave Me Alone" were funny, especially when the police officer tells Michael that "I need your autograph right here," after I stopped him to dance in an area without danse. But it's "Smooth Criminal," which is the glaze on the cake. Joe Pesci did a great job as a toughie (and that the hair was wild). Dance is perfect, so do the special effects. The only thing I could have done without spiders. Any fan of Michael should see this if you have not. I give her a 10+!
