If you liked Deep Cover, you might want this movie too. Many of the poetic interludes that Fishburne reread in "Deep Cover" are from the lyrical script "Once In The Life," a screen adaptation of the play that Fishburne wrote. If you love Larry as much as I do, you'll love this movie that's all Larry, all hot, and they've all worked. Of course there is a gunpowder and an illicit use of substances, it's a gangster-like film, after all, but the script is beautiful and the story touches, even a little on the side of the flick. The amazing movie ... dark, scary, sexy, and exciting. If you've ever sneaked at night or you are in a clubhouse, you'll get the right impact of crowded sets (the weather echoes being trapped alive). Completely intelligent prefiguration and complex relationships, this film is tight ... all the feeling reflected in the sets of dressings and photos. GOOD JOB!
