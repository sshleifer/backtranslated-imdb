Riding Giants is an incredible documentary detailing the history and stories of three influential surfers, Gregg Noll, Jeff Clark and Laird Hamilton. Stacy Peralta has done an amazing job as a director and should be congratulated for having done such a brilliant work. The structure of the film is brilliantly edited and works perfectly with narrative, interview, animation, and navigation materials. The soundtrack just adds to the overall satisfaction of viewing this film, making Giant a brilliant view. Personal events include any of Greg Noll's comments, which, with his direct sincerity, Laird Hamilton's filming from Teahupoo and the end of the film's extracts. But really this whole movie is a great, recommended highlight that comes highly recommended if you have the opportunity to see. It is a shame that it is not better known, but it is a gem that deserves attention. 10/10
