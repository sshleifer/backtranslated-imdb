An excellent political thriller, played much more quietly and slower than other high-end films of this genre. When people talk about Pacino and Cusack, how can they overcome these amazing career shows? A story of friendship, father-son relationships, corruption and deception. The two actors blend amazingly well together, and the Aiello and Fonda stands as impressive, although Aiello is brilliant, especially when the newspapers go to the press. Instead of focusing on a complex corruption scandal, it creates wonderful characters that show the human side of failure, a political corruption. The final scenes with each of the main characters are beautifully written and animated.
