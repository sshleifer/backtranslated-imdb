Arthur Bach has to grow, but unfortunately it is not the only thing he has to do. According to his extremely rich father, Arthur has to marry a certain rich Susan Johnson or is cut off from family money ($ 750 million). The problem is that Arthur does not love Susan (though I hear he's doing some good chick) and that just fell over his head just for the waitress and the convenience store Linda Marolla. Arthur is an interesting man. He is indeed a great child, born in riches, with at least one person dealing with him every second of every day. The thing is just rubbing Arthur in the wrong way - he likes to have fun, to make a feminine and, of course, to drink. The drink gives Arthur a kind of jekyll-and-hyde complex; and while it does it in all sorts of trouble, it's absolutely hilarious to look at the screen. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore is great here in this movie as Arthur, winning an Oscar nomination and winning the Golden Globe for his performance. Moore is fantastic about the comic aspects of the movie, transforming the already funny lines into unforgettable comedy gold, but it is also great to bring Arthur to a relative level and make the character a pleasant one. Moore has a helper in the co-star department - Liza Minnelli is great as Lina, no one scared that Arthur can not do enough and John Gielgud is great as Harton's queen, Arthur. Gielgud won the best Oscar-winning actor for his performance in this film and there is no doubt why. Hobson has a dry solid rock spirit and a narrow attitude, but he always looks at Arthur - and Gielgud is perfect in the role. Steve Gordon's 1981 film, Arthur, is short and simple, but laughs a lot.
