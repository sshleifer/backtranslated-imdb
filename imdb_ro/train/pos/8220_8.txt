Fourth of the "Dirty Harry" series, this movie features one of the most despicable, ugliest, less profound and disgusting females ever seen on the film: "Ray Perkins," played by Audrey Neenan. She is the modern version of the low life of the Detour character of 1945, Ann Savage. Her gourmet attitude and robbery made me so divorced that I did not see this movie again until I acquired a profanity filter that closed it ... and a little bit of it! Then I could enjoy the rest of the movie. Everywhere "Harry Callahan" (Clint Eastwood) goes, the violence follows immediately ..... in a few minutes! It happens so often it's almost ridiculous, but it's done for a fast and fun film with a satisfactory end because all offenders are eliminated one by one. This is a very sophisticated film that appeals to our basic instinct ..... and connects, sad to say. Most of us like to see these dirtballs in the end and who does it better than Dirty Harry?
