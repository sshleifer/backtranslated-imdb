The last hunt is one of the few vestiges ever made to cope with buffalo hunting, both as a sport and as a business, and as a way of winning the Indian wars in the plain. Before the white man spat on the other side of the Mississippi, plains had American Bison herds as big as some of our biggest cities. By the time the last hunt is in place, buffaloes have only been wiped out. In the twentieth century, due to the efforts of the conservatives, there was a rebirth of the species population, but it was not so once. Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger collaborate in a second film together and this is far superior to all the brothers have come. Here Stewart Granger is the good man, a buffalo hunter, tired in the world, who has to go back to a job he hates for financial reasons. The partner he chose to throw is Robert Taylor. Looking at Taylor for the moment, I doubt if there ever was a worse, oddest soul than Charlie Gilsen, which Taylor interprets. In the Devil's Gate, he was an American Indian who fought against the prejudices caused by a racist played by Louis Calhern. In The Last Hunt, he's racist here. He kills both buffaloes and Indians for pure pleasure. He kills an Indian family when they steal their muscles and takes a captive widow. As a barbarous conqueror, he awaits the pleasure of Debra Paget's sexual favors. He is actually crazy when Paget does not see it that way. No matter how often I refer to Russ Tamblyn as half, I was never convinced that there was an Indian side. It's the only weakness I've found in The Last Hunt. However, Lloyd Nolan, the old buffalo youngster, gray-blue, Taylor and Granger, brings a wonderful one. Nolan steals every scene they are in the distribution. <br /> <br /> For those who like real-world admirers who want to see part of Robert Taylor who has not seen on screen and who does not like cheap heroes, The Last Hunt is the ideal hunt.
