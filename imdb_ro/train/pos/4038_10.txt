This may be the only film that really comes close to capturing the movie of the essentially unrecoverable world of the American college experience of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Go ahead and name another film that is even closer to that : "Do you get right"? "RPM"? These are caricatures. "The Return of Secaucus Seven" has its moments, but this is a retrospective film about individuals (self-obsessed) more than a movie about a time and a place described * at that time and in that place. "Drive, Sa Said" portrays - with subtlety and nuance where it should - and a quick blow in shorts, where the only appropriate way - the anti-project movement, the ambiguity of high school sport (especially when there is a war) the sexual revolution of the period and the general unreality of the day. Believe me, it was. The whole lady deserves a praise (as well as the director, of course), but special praise should be reserved for Bruce Dern as a basketball coach, and Karen Black, the hero is very unusual - except for that moment - I love the interest. William Tepper, as a leader, also evaluates a real round of applause for both the perfect capture of the student athlete of the period and the real college basketball in the movie (remember Anthony Perkins in "Tall Story"? Yikes!). In general, a classic of some kind - and the latest movie in someone in the 6th grade should write comments about ("boring", "repellent" - um, right, please come back to your Arnold movies). Why is not this imdb movie available?
