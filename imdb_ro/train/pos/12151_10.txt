This is simply the epitome of what made for the TV movie should be. It was a lazy Sunday afternoon when my wife and I were in this grade school that I was over. Act cheesy. Writing badly written. Good boys. The ridiculous confusion, but obviously clich√© and banal. Get down in trucks with your wife's companion. He has everything. <br /> <br /> You will meet familiar characters: golden hussy digger, rich stupid boy who wants to make it alone, friends-who-knows-better, dad who knows better, but lead the son away. And his wife's body. Propped up. In a pick-up. <br /> <br /> Wow: and the title. Several things in our life have been "The Tragedies of Texas," since we have seen this beauty. All those involved in their creation deserve a medal.
