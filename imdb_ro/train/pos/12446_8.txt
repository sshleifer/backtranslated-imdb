After hearing about Modesty Blaise before, but never reading a novel or a comic book, my wife and I really enjoyed the movie. It gave, in an exciting way, a good introduction of the character and its foundation. Although it has some elements of action, it is much more an intimate, excellent written piece. Unfortunately, this is also where a major disadvantage of the movie is revealed. An intimate game lives on the capabilities of its actors and, unfortunately, only half of the distribution distributed. While Alexandra Staden did a great job like Modesty Blaise, his counterpart Nikolai Coaster-Waldau - like the bastard Miklos - did not. Walking through the plot as if it were a toothpaste marketing, he fails to create an atmosphere of anxiety that would make the film a masterpiece. The support is somewhat similar, from stereotyped gangsters to decent performances by Fred Pearson as Lob and Eugenia Yuan as Irina.
