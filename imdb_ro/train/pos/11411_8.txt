S. Van Dine must have been a smart businessman in dealing with Hollywood. Most studio films were usually limited to one or two studios. But it seems Van Dine must have sold his rights to each book about Philo Vance one by one. Note that Paramount, MGM, Warner Brothers and more have released Philo Vance movies. Only Tarzan seemed to be getting closer to Hollywood. MGM produced the Garden Crimes Case and played Edmund Lowe as a fashion detective. Of course MGM had the Philo original screen under contract at that time, but Bill Powell was busy making The Thin Man at that time and I think Louis B. Mayer decided to focus it there. Edmund Lowe is a pretty acceptable Philo Vance. Lowe began quite large at the end of the silent era with "What Price Glory" and then with a series of movies with Victor McLaglen with their characters Flagg and Quirt. But after McLaglen took his Oscar for The Informer, Lowe seemed to fade in the B market. The Garden Murder case involves three separate victims, Douglas Walton, Gene Lockhart and Frieda Inescourt. The sinister atmosphere around the perpetrator takes it far, the mystery is really how all the crimes are connected and how they are made. I'll say that, though. Vance has a very good chance to expose the bastard and in the last 15 minutes are hitchcock worthy.
