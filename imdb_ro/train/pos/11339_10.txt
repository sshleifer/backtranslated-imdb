Anyone who has experienced the terror of divorce will feel empathy with the protagonist of this indie film, a scared little boy who thinks a zombie is hiding in his closet. Is Jake (a mesmerizing Anthony DeMarco) simply "transferring" the trauma of two stuttering parents to a meaningful image? Or could the creature be real? Writer / director Shelli Ryan accurately balances both possibilities and keeps the audience guessing. Her choice of using a set - a suburban house - adds to the feeling of despair and claustrophobia. Brooke Bloom and Peter Sean Bridgers are very convincing as angry but loving parents. However, they are the characters of the wonderful creeper, Mrs. Bender (Barbara Gruen), a disgruntled babysitter and Sam Stone (Ben Bode), a real estate agent in the mind. Jake's building is a portrait inspired by childhood, as a kind of special hell.
