This movie moves without being sentimental - without being pretentious. It's a simple story about a family in danger of breaking up because the technology invasion and an advanced society make the family-run business become more and more inactive. The actor is wonderful - although none of us probably heard of these actors, we should have taken them long ago - they play the characters with honesty and reverence - they are mistaken characters, each with major weaknesses but with a humanity and kindness so full that it is impossible not to get involved in the Story. <br /> <br /> We need more films like this - we need more Western filmmakers to create such films.
