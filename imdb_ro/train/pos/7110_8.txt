John Garfield plays a marine who is blinded by a grenade while fighting on Guadalcanal and who must learn to live with his disability. He has all the stereotypical notions of blindness and is sure it will be a burden for everyone. Hospital staff and wounded colleagues are unable to reach him. Even his girl can not return home, played by Eleanor Parker. He is stubborn and blinded by his own fears, self-pity and prejudice. It's a complex role that Garfield fulfills memorably in an extraordinary show that keeps someone looking despite the non-existent melodrama. The best scenes are on Guadalcanal, where they are in a machine gun that tries to prevent Japanese soldiers advancing in a night battle overnight, and later a dream sequence in the hospital where they can see walking - He is on a train platform with a white cane, dark glasses and holding a cup of blackboard while his girlfriend is heading back from the room.
