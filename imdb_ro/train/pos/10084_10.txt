This spectacular movie is one of the most amazing movies I've ever seen. It shows a China I had never seen and imagined, and I think it shows China in the 1930s in the most real light it ever sees in a movie. It's absolutely unimaginable in many situations, seeing how hard life was for the characters, and yet the story and the end are incredibly happy. You will see the depths and heights of human existence in this film. The actors are perfect, so you feel that you have entered a different world. <br /> <br /> I simply can not recommend this movie pretty much. It may change forever after you've seen it.
