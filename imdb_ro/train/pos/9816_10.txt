Outrage is a pretty good movie! Robert Culp was really good in the movie and was perfect for the party! It's hard to believe this is a true story, but what can you do? When I looked at that, I thought why I had to do all these things. It is not good, but they learned their lesson when they chose the evil man! Anyway, if you ever see this movie on the TV, watch it for it's a good one!
