This movie is among my favorite foreign movies, some of which are Amilee and My Life as a dog. The similarities with those films, as with many foreign films, is that it takes a lively piece of life and turns it into a profound lesson. <br /> <br /> In Japan, a man who is bored with his mundane life and routine of his married life sees a beautiful Japanese woman looking out the window of a dance studio. The moment his train passes, he is excited about it. But only through her beauty, through her distant vision, or through a connection that both will reveal to them that they share? <br /> <br /> Our dance has wonderful memories of characters that have to deal with the painful realities, transcending them through the dance world. Breaking traditional patterns and stereos of Japanese society all risk for happiness and find that joy is not too far away. It is one of those magical and meaningful films and transcends the world, showing the true magic and miracle that it can be life.
