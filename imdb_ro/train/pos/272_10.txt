He loved it, but he still has nightmares over the hotel manager. The film was presented well, with the choice of actors who play their roles in the reality of writing. Many scenes have captured the imagination and created a nail biter. The progress of the situations was written intelligently, making me think that the story was just going to find a new twist on what I thought it might be obvious. Too bad there have to be advertisements. I told many friends to watch other shows and I, of course, will see again. I enjoyed the landscape of the movie and I felt this added to the plots and intrigues. Wives and wife were very realistic (or should I say fights?). The initial situation is a common one, but the escalation in the story is not good. I want to thank all those involved in this great entertainment movie. Thank you! I look forward to the following movies --- when? Whidbey
