While Urban Cowboy did not mess with the same testosterone that you could find in a rodeo, it gave an exact vision of that day and age in Texas. I also think that to truly criticize this movie, you should have lived in time and in the relative place where it was made. It was good music, funny times and, yes, a few "tough and tumultuous" tunk honky caravans. The relationship between Bud and Sissy as "two ships that pass through the night" was well-designed. When Pam resumed the note that Sissy had written to Bud, it reported the tragedy of many living novels. The whole story was well thought out. I thought the cast and crew did a great job. I thought the track on the screen was well written and pointed. Scott Glenn should have received an Oscar for best supporting actor.
