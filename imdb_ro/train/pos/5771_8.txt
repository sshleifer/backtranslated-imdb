This is one of those movies you encounter when you browse the channel on a Saturday afternoon, and you get in it and end up looking at it all. I thought he was well acting and made me feel for the characters. Although moving slowly, focusing more on the relationship between Bonnie and Clyde and their family members, it was never boring. I do not see too many of the robberies for which they were so legendary, and instead most of the shooting takes place when they are attacked by the police. I thought Tracey Needham, who played Bonnie, did a good job with her character. Going from a beautiful country girl to a cold-blooded killer is a challenging thing to describe, and I enjoyed the subtlety she has brought to her. In general, an over-average effort, especially given that it was for the TV movie.
