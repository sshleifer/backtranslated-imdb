This is one of the few movies I can always watch. If you have never seen him, make a chance. Richard Dreyfus and Raoul Julia are wonderful together, and although the movie amuses me a lot, it reminds me of Julia's premature death. It is a good opportunity to stand and laugh at the international intrigue that is too much with us in this period of terror and fear.
