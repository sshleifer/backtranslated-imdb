This film is a quite fun horror anthology (along the crypt stories) written by Robert Bloch (author of Psycho). It's fun for fans of horror and has an excellent distribution. The film should also be needed for viewing for Doctor Who fans, because Jon Pertwee (the third Doctor) has a funny role as a terrible and inappropriate star!
