I really do not remember who recommended this, but they said it was one of their favorite movies. It is certainly a strange thing - such as the accident of a motorway accident. Someone said the truth is brighter than fiction, and the truth here is something to see. I really do not understand how this year's fictitious account of this documentary will be released. How can you improve this? Jackie Kennedy's aunt and cousin move away from the New York Society and hide in Hampton's. In this process they become recluses and what is best described as "crazy ladies". It would have been hidden if the city had not gone to condemn the dirt property and Jackie's subsequent rescue. This movie was made after this rescue. All the time, you could not think, "how bad was it before?" It's a look at the darker society and it's absolutely fascinating.
