this movie is absolutely hilarious. in principle, the plot revolves around a serial killer, somehow becoming a snowman through a chemical accident in film B. Then he leads to the city and begins to terrorize the locals. until the local police chief and other characters to try to stop him. It's done on a wee budget and certainly looks, but the big thing about this movie is that it knows garbage. improvisations made of polystyrene and polystyrene, which mimic the giant killer snowman, are classic, and that is clearly the intention - one of its few films that has as its point of sale its main budget. along with comic tactics, there are other moments of great comedy - listen to the very first voice for a father to scare his children to death and the funniest scene of rape ever committed to filming. fantastic sticky fun
