This is a long-lasting gem, starring Sydney Lassick ("Carrie" and others) and Barbara Bach. It's sometimes difficult to locate a copy of this movie, but it's worth it. This movie is both frightening and cheesy at the same time. It seems that three young men (Karen, Vicky and Jennifer) travel to Solvang, California, to cover a festival when a mix in their hotel room is underway and seek refuge at the home of Earnest Keller (Lassick) and his wife strange Virginia. Vickie lags behind, feels bad, while the other 2 are going to film their story. She is soon killed at home, in a very tender manner, by an unknown force hiding in the ventilation system (she is beheaded by the ventilation shutter as it collapses on it as she is pulled through and in the basement). Soon, Karen returns and is killed in a more brutal manner by putting her face through the ventilation cap. Jennifer struggles with her boyfriend (ex?) In a rather boring story and when she returns home, her hosts (which I have discovered so far are brother and sister and that everything in the basement is their son) a plot to try and kill her. Virgina is not totally in agreement with Earnest's plan to kill Jennifer, but she is mistaken to enter the basement where she meets the junior. Here the film becomes almost comic because Junior (portrayed hysterically by Stephen Furst) is a deformed, mentally deficient manhild whose actions and movements will cause some chuckles even if it should be scary. This is where the rhythm of the movie rises and the end is well done. Actors / actresses do a wonderful job with the material, especially Lassick, Furst and Bach, and though it is not the most horrible movie ever made, it's really fun!
