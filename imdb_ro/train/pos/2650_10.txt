Besides the fact that my list of favorite filmmakers is: 1) Stanley Kubrick 2) God Allmighty 3) The rest ... this movie is actually better than the book (and the TV miniseries, though this is an easy thing, considering the director). The flawless shooting style, also acting (Kubrick's music, number one) music - makes it a horror masterpiece. I watched the TV miniseries a few years ago and I liked the story and I had my hopes about it when I got it. I'm beating my game! It's much better than I ever imagined. Starts slowly (Kubrick brand) and has a lot of downtime that accumulates suspense. The intro scene is a classic by all means and I watched it about 20 times only for the sheer atmosphere it brings to the whole movie. Also, the film does not offer a lot of gore (it has a lot and is not at all tasteless), a trend that I hate in horror movies lately. Look at him!
