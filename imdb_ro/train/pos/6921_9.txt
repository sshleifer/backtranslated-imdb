Note that I am a fan of the genre, but I recently saw this movie for the first time. How I've overlooked all this time is a miracle for me. For me, this is a better movie, then much better praised "High Noon". It's a great western with excellent acting and a wonderful story. The DVD is black and white with a remarkable cinema. If you like westerns or James Stewart this movie does not have to be missed.
