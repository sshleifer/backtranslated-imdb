I liked this movie. They did not see Andy Griffith aged and felt it fit perfectly with this role. I associated him with the comedy, but I'm thrilled to see it versatile. I did not worry that Dotty's anxiety disorder might not have been written from a psychiatric manual. There are days of any kind of phobias and neuroses, and they can take a wide variety of quantitative and qualitative forms. She is clearly sensitive to extra-sensory powers, as understood by local Indians, but not by any Anglos. It is not surprising that this character is vulnerable and nominally eccentric. Although this film is considered a light family movie, it is actually more sophisticated than it seems. Also, Hiram's twist at the end came as a pleasant surprise to me and linked all previous actions together in a package. It is fun to think of the possibility of such spiritual guidance.
