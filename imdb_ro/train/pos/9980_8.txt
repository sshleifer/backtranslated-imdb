Any film that shows that federal PIGs (People in the Government) are the crazy threats they have in real life has a lot to recommend for me. Unfortunately, the supervision and editing of the script and sometimes the directions are flawed, so there will be people who will disappear the whole movie and ignore good moments. I saw the original way when it was new and a hate, she despised it. I thought it was a terrible and irrational piece of junk. Now, however, I do not remember why. I think the two should not be compared or even connected. <br /> <br /> Consider them as two different movies. Evaluate them as two different films. This "escape point" provides a rally spot, a banner for people who want to encourage individualism, who believe in human rights, who recognize the threat to the freedom of the government can be and is, especially the federal government. "Voice" carries a cover that bears the state motto of New Hampshire: "Live freely or die." At one point, it would have been the motto of most Americans. Despite its obvious flaws, "The Running Point" is a glamorous film.
