do not bother your soundtrack, which is unfolding until now. However, Debra Winger is always interesting, and while it was an early role for her, she is pretty good as Cissy, the mistaken girl (Travolta), just to be replaced for a while by Madolyn Smith as a rival. <br /> <br /> I agree with an earlier review on Scott Glenn, he is only used for the plot, mixed in to create suspense; the story is predictable and controversial. Also, even if I'm from the East, many of us did NOT like "Saturday Night Fever", while there were moments, perpetuated stereotypes are beyond criticism at this point. <br /> <br /> It is worth seeing for Debra Winger; she is still so enjoyable and has never had that Hollywood character, to which we are now subjected to too many actresses. 7/10
