Going to something far from the intentional things that he usually does, John Waters (happy birthday, John!) Made this parody of the world of celebrities / art. Edward Furlong plays the title character, a working-class teenager in Baltimore who loves the photos. When a New York agent (Lili Taylor) discovers his work, he offers him a great break, which he accepts. But once he has hit it, he has to reconsider everything. Practically, Pecker looks at how he loses his friends and normal life once he becomes a celebrity. What kind of thing we can expect, of course, but with Waters being directed, there are always a few things to be shocking (you'll know when you see them). I certainly recommend it. They also starred Christina Ricci, Mink Stole and Patty Hearst.
