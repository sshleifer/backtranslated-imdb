Simply, Oliver! is one of the greatest musicals of all time. It is full of memorable songs - "Food Glorious Food", "Oliver!", "Consider" and "Oom-Pah-Pah" to name just a few - and memorable characters. the film is a musical adaptation of Charles Dickens's classic novel, and just like the story of Oliver Twist himself, is a perfect family film. There are some frightening moments - the villainous character, Bill Sykes, played by Oliver Reed, is quite scary on his own - but overall the film will attract children of all ages and adults. almost everyone is surely known so far - revolves around a small orphan boy named Oliver and his life growing up in London. At first, he lives in the office of work with the other orphans, but after the boldness of questioning Mr. Bumble, the supervisor, he is sold to a family as a servant. After a series of shortcomings, he meets Artful Dodger - awesome playing by a young Jack Wild, who is doing everything in his role - and through him, the greedy Fagin (Ron Moody), which teaches young boys to pick pocket treasures on which keeps them for themselves. The film was shot only in studios and on the bells at Shepperton Film Studios, but this does not translate at all. The sets reproduced the Victorian of London perfectly, just like the costumes of the characters. An Oscar winner and massive success in his release, Oliver! is a worthy candidate for the best music all the time and will delight anyone who loves the movie.
