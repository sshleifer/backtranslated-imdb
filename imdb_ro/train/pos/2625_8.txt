Surprisingly, not terribly and well animated for one of Disney's direct film casts the sequels. Like the previous one (The Lion King 2), I was glad that Disney brought back the majority of the original voice actors, making a big difference and keeping a good level of traditional animation. Crying is wandering for a while, but we are distracted by a series of jokes, from hilarious to boring. To strip off the detached plot and the jokes, they gave us some stupid musical sequences that, like jokes, range from fun to a fast journey to the refrigerator. For the most part, MST3K-like moments are mild and full of untapped potential and indeed adds nothing but to act as a vehicle for an hour's flashback. The new characters are at least full of love, and old characters do their job, so I can not cure them there. Generally, this movie is not bad and makes for a nice frivolous filling between the most serious titles of Lion King.
