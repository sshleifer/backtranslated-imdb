The young, beautiful, muscular Joe Buck (Jon Voight) moves from Texas to New York, thinking he will make his life by being a stud. He gets there and finds out quickly that it will not be easy - he goes through degrading experience after another. At the end of his rope, he joins Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) strained and weakened. Together they try to survive and get out of town and move to Florida. But will they do it? Very dark, disturbing but fascinating. Director John Schelsinger painted a very dirty portrait of NYC and its inhabitants. This is dated - the city could have been so bad in 1969, but so far it has been cleaned up considerably. He also uses every room trick in the book - the color turns black and white; travelers in dream sequences; flash forward; (especially in the case of rape); shock shocks; strange sound effects ... that you call. It keeps you disoriented outside the center - but I could not help but forget. There is not much story - it is based mainly on friendship between Rizzo and Buck. There is an implication that they could have been lovers (showing the last type of shooting). It's just a portrait of two damaged characters trying to survive in a cold, cruel, urban jungle. It was originally rated X in 1969 - the only reason being that MPAA did not think parents would want their children to see that. However, there was a big blow with high schoolers (then X did not mean anyone under 17). It was also the only film with an X Award that has ever won an Oscar Award for Best Picture. Hoffman and Voight signed up for acting awards, as was (mysterious) Sylvia Miles who was in the picture for a total of (maybe) 5 minutes! It was finally cut to a R (no cuts) when it was re-edited in 1980. Also, the excellent song "Everybody's Talkin" was introduced in this movie - and it became a big hit. br /> <br /> A great movie --- but very dark. I give it a 10th. You do not see it on commercial TV - it's cut into ribbons and it's incomprehensible.
