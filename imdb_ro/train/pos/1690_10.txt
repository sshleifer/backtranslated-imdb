I found memorable quotes looking for videos; have forgotten one of my favorites ... Old Person 1: You know, I remember the first time they played that thing. <br /> <br /> Old Man 2: You remember pterodactyls. <br /> <br /> Old person 1: And I remember you fell for that, hook line and shield. <br /> <br /> The old person 2: Oh, I did not. <br /> <br /> Lady Old: You did it. You put a big bucket on your head and you took armed boys with them to fight the Martians. <br /> <br /> Old Man 2: Are not you still dead?
