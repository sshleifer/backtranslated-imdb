The third and final installment of "Hanzo Razor" is the most concrete of them. "Training" ends even in the first five minutes of the movie. Not for everyone, this film details Hanzo's investigation into the division of loans by an order of blind monks. He also makes a historical commentary on Japan's proud reluctance to incorporate Western technology. If the first Hanzo movie was just a fun and storied walk, with a little connection to his plot, "Hanzo 3: Who Has Gold" manages to connect everything and brings everything home at last. Definitely the perfect finale. Oh, yes, Hanzo still has many sexes and there is a lot of blood and useless violence (it is * Hanzo Razor, after all).
