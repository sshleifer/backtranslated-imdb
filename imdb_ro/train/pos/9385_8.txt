Red Rock West is a perfect example of how good a movie can be, practically without a budget. All you need is a smart script, good actors and a lot of atmosphere. RRW is delivering even more. Nothing Cage plays an ex-navy, wounded in Lebanon, who is up to the last 5 dollars after being refused a job on a petroleum field because of his bad knee. He roams in Red Rock and is mistaken for barman Wayne (JT Walsh, not even the most dangerous - yet bad) for a Texas man. He pays them to kill his wife and makes him look like a break. Only when he gets there, just to check it out. He offers him doubles to kill Wayne. Cage just wants to escape the city with his free money and let the sparring lovers be. But a number of shortcomings and drawbacks make Yo-yoing come in and out of Red Rock back and forth. Eventually, this leads to a meeting with Lyle in Dallas (a Dennis Hopper), the real hitman in Texas, who offers help without knowing that it complicates this plot. RRW has never had a great release, so most of his audience has discovered it on video or on cable television. If you look at it that way, it might sound like a TV movie, but it's bigger than that. The slick, slow-motion direction, moody score and desert wind noise would have made for an extraordinary movie in the theater, but the best thing you can do these days is to watch the DVD on a large HDTV. <br /> <br /> Only the weak point of the film I can think of is fatal female Lara Flynn Boyle with the ugly hairstyle. I certainly would not fall for her, but if you assume Nic Cage's character is in militant lesbians, then you will accept it.
