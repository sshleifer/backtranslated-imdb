After racism, rural exodus - also known as migration from the country - is another socio-political issue of the 1960s. WestSide Story has dealt with racism through a love feast in an artistic vision. Now, midnight Cowboy deals with rural exodus through a friendship tragedy in a psychological view. It has a deep ending, that we are witnesses to one of the two companions of the passing fate. Director John Schlesinger skillfully delivers the deepest thoughts, dreams, fantasies, fears and secret evaluations of the two New York City scums. While beautiful Joe Buck (Voight) dreams all the beautiful women of the world asking them to share a fantasy of wild love, poor Ratso Rizzo (Hoffman) dreams of a better and healthier life in clean and sunny Florida. Consequently, Joe becomes a hustler to turn his fantasies into reality; and Ratso becomes a snatcher to raise enough money to migrate to Florida. Aside from the fact that Ratso helps Joe find his way to do his best. They begin to share everything in life. They share food, share medication, share an uninhabited home, share earnings and thus share a destiny. Unfortunately, as the story progresses, Joe realizes that being beautiful is not the only thing that makes all beautiful women ask him to have fun; and more Ratso can not see Florida because his heart fails to defeat his illness while he was on the bus taking him there. Might is always fine, and Feeble does not have the right to daylight. Then, "Midnight" delivers factual vision. Despite the tragedy, there is no cowboy melody at midnight. Every aspect of each character is the reality of the poor who bear their inevitable fate. Because of this, Midnight Cowboy is a provocative vision of a socio-political issue, the rural exodus.
