This is a comedy based on national stereotypes, no doubt. If you let yourself pretend that you know or care about why it was communism and how real the Russians or the British are, if you accept and you are not injured by conventions, you can have fun with this movie. Nicole Kidman is the best, sexy, moving and funny. Ben Chaplin manages to avoid being completely shadowed by Nicole, and the rest of the cast is doing good work. The end moves, of course logical logic - the movie. It is worth watching if you accept the rules of the game.
