I like cinema, so I'm about to confess deeply. I gave my fingers down to "Che, Parts 1 and 2" without seeing the movie. Terribly I know. But I felt in a trap of ... who? I do not really know, but it was a negative word that spread like a wild fire, and no matter how clever I think I am, I fell into it. Fortunately, I entered an Argenian director, Martin Donovan, a man I love and admire. When I told him I would not see her because I knew the movie was a failure, he looked at me as if he was ready to hit me, and Donovan was a pacifist! He took me aside and told me how much he loved the movie and why. I went to see the two sides immediately and "Che, part 1 and 2" is the best movie I saw in 2008. It is so pure that it will remind you of the work of some of the great masters past. Respect for his audience is something we are no longer accustomed to. I do not know if I was ever. Riveting, in motion, without concessions and Benicio del Toro is just extraordinary. We can see his soul, we can actually perceive it. The man of man is overwhelming. So thank you once again to Martin Donovan for educating me so sincerely. Bravo Del Toro, Bravo Soderbergh and all those involved in this landmark. Do not commit the mistake I was going to make. Go see now on the big screen
