As you're left, you could see Star Wars: Get back from the Jedi, you can get to know a good movie, but like watching the movie, you might have a party at the end and probably (Live TV) When they're parties But before I say more when Ben obi-wan dies in the imperial ship or in death The stars saw him disappear and Yoda dies from old age or internal illness But because Luke killed Darth Vader (real name: Anakin Skywalker) When everyone happens at the end when Luke or someone stops the spirits, Ben and Yoda sit at him and smile while another the spirit appears is Darth Vader, Sith as the old habit comes off of him and began to smile with Ben and Yoda I think he made the film to end a little interesting But the producers or anyone should make a spirit on Padme and Mace Windu and other Jedi like were killed with Younglings Under There are weapons in the back
