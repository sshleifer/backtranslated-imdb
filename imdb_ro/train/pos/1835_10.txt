What remarkable movie is this I have no words to describe. I do not know how to make a movie rating is 7.3, it should be 9.3 but no one else can do this movie and akshay's action is just remarkable the second half of the movie does u cry and the movie has a real unexpected good end which makes the movie perfect. you should watch this movie once, I think twice good that it's up to u. Anyway I like this movie and it's not just sad and fun, but it also gives u a very good sense and what you should do u think it is one of the best movies in bollywood history. but I know people have a choice, so yes. the only thing I do not like about this movie is music and background music is good but the songs are not good enough I think music would be better if AR Rahman were the music director but we can not do anything about it anyway.
