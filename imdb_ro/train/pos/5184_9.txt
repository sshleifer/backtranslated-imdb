Deep, humorous and honest comedy about a group of adults (Bill Paxton, Julie Warner, Kevin Pollak, Elizabeth Perkins, Vincent Spano, Matt Craven and Diane Lane) who are invited to spend a week in Tomawka, they consume (Alan Arkin). Writer / director Mike Binder drew his experience in the same camp as the main source of creating a gentle and understanding thread that makes sense. Also, the movie has a lot of funny moments, some of which are completely bizarre as my favorite, the one that involves the use of a masking tape. Newton Thomas Sigel ("The Common Suspects," "Three Kings") offers the film some impressive shots of the Canadian vault. Among the cast, Sam Raimi, the director of the films "EVIL DEAD" and "The Gift", appears here as Arkin's left man. One more thing, this movie assured me that the camp should not be a bloody crime scene.
