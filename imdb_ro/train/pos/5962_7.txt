I've seen a lot of rockers' horrors over the years, from garbage like "Terror on Tour" to ridiculously funny stones such as "Slumber Party Massacre 2". Somehow, I've managed to keep doing that, which is weird because it's probably the most popular and best received. Well, eventually we did it and it is easily the best in this subgroup, most often terrible (but almost always in love!). The plot (which was quite high in the movie "Black Roses") refers to a mulleted misfit called Eddie, whose ridiculous of all in high school for his taste in music. He loves 80 years of metal, especially his idol Sammi Curr (played by Toni Fields.) After Sammy was killed, Eddie's favorite DJ gave Sammi final record. Once Eddie plays the record back, he discovers that it's a bit tougher, and bad things happen to those who tease him. Is Sammy's music possessed? "Trick or Treat" is well done and a total shot. The special effects are wonderful, although they have the typical features of 80-degree laser beams. I grew up in the 80s and, while I was not a fan of heavy metals, I remember the urban legend about the fact that I made a recording back listening to the sounds of Satan's worship. Haha! I also remember that my older brothers and neighbors said that both KISS and Ozzy worshiped Satan, so it's very fun to see both of them make a cameo as a harmless radio DJ and a anti-rock priest. If I only saw this movie as a child! While the film seems to have fun at the 1980s popular link between the alleged devil worship and heavy metal, the viewer never finds out why Sammi Curr returns from the dead, creating chaos and killing anyone in his way. This is the weakest point in the movie, but if you can overlook this, it's a lot of fun.
