The original with Barbara Stanwyk is saved only by Stanwyk's performance. The story and other shows are too sweet and the movie itself is too dated to be really enjoyable today. Bette Midler's version is much more interesting. She is Stella Claire, an independent, independent woman who gets pregnant and refuses to help her boyfriend (Stephen Collins) or her boyfriend (John Goodman in undervalued performance). She raises her daughter Jenny played so sweet by Trini Alvarado and then concludes that Jenny's father can do better and eventually makes a decision to change her life. Through the movie, there are many memorable laughs, tears and moments, especially between Midler and Alvarado. Marsha Mason collaborates as Jenny's stepmother, who, though rich, proves to be a very good influence on her. If you like Midler, Goodman or just good movies with lots of emotions, you'll enjoy the Bette Midler version of STELLA.
