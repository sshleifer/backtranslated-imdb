It was a good movie. It was not your typical war movie, it was something different. This film showed us recruits in preparation before the war and did not actually fight a war. This film is one of the most realistic views on war and army than most other movies like this. Colin Farrel did a great job portraying an army recruiter, and Clifton Collins Jr and Matthew Davis also contributed reasonably. Seeing Colin Farrel move from grade B to a class in a few years, you would never have thought it would happen. I will also add that tiger producers did a great job of filming a movie in 2000 and making it seem that 1970 was a good touch. His good talent has been used wisely and I hope to see the same talent again in the near future.
