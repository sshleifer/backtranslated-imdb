This movie was one of the best movies I've seen this year. I did not see any cams in the movie, but it's still pretty good. It's similar to Anchorman in the humorous department, but I think this is a better movie. It actually has a point. If you see a bunch of T & A, you'll be disappointed. Just a good put together movie !!!! If you have nothing to do for this day or you need a lot of humor, you will find that this is a very good movie. I certainly think the review of Ebert and Roeper's film about this movie is fine. I mean, I do not like Ebert on most of the movies, but that's the movie I'll agree on. The movie contains a good enough story that it is actually credible that these people are there. There is certainly something to be said about the way virginity is treated in this movie. Yeah, sure, you laughed at the moment, but it still suggests waiting. Steve has done a great job of describing the person she's made in this movie, and yet it's still funny.
