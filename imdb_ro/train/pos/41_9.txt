"Who did it?" contains many laughs and safety gags. It's not just one of the best Stooges movies with Shemp, it's one of Columbia's finest short comedies. Director Bernds originally wrote the script for Stooges in 1946, but when Curly Howard suffered a stroke, he was adapted for the Columbia comedy team by Schilling and Lane (their release was released under the name of "Pardon My Terror" was too good for Stooges to pass, and was finally filmed by Stooges at the end of 1947. Goodman calls these detectives Shemp, Larry and Moe for fear of being killed. When they get home, Goodrich disappears, and the niece and his comrades try to escape Stooges, find Goodrich and bring his granddaughter and enemies to justice? Shemp is especially funny in this film His reactions, after being given to Mickey by Christine McIntyre, they are gorgeous, he gives the sound of his brand (eeeb-eeeb-eeeb), and Miss McIntyre obviously does not laugh! Other fun scenes: Closing M oe looking at the lens of the room, and fighting in the dark with all the cast members. Nikko the goon (played by Duke York) is one of the most unusual characters ever looking for in the Stooges movie. With his stuck hair, he could have passed near a Stooge if he could not do all the others! "Who did it?" is a jewel amongst Stooges with Shemp. Even morally hard curly fans will enjoy this! A true classic Stooge. 9 of 10.
