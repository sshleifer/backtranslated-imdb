Tigerland follows the life of a group of newly-trained men in the army who are called to fight in Vietnam in 1971. At this time, America knows that it is fighting a lost fight and the director takes us through a 16mm the lives of some recruits at the "Tigerland" training camp in Louisiana. The film is rather a study of characters without any real plot, but focuses on a key character Roland Boz, a disordered but intelligent man who just wants to escape from the camp. We are taken by several characters in the unit, waiting for the story to unfold. I should have said this is a wonderful story about Vietnam and, more importantly, about the army in general. and very memorable. Also, directors use film and style to work so well, because it looks very much like the old movies you always see about Vietnam. It's great to see what the film looks like all the fighting and the issues were so important to the fight against this battle. The special scene in which Boz moves away from a training mission in which an instructor shows how to use a radio as a device of torture, just summarizes everything about war in brief ... and is useless. <br /> <br /> The film is fantastic. Not just about Nam, but about who has to decide what is morally correct by being "in the army." Rating 9 out of 10.
