Greetings again in the dark. 18 directors of 18 vendets apparently unrelated to love in the city of lights. A very unusual format that requires some segments to adapt to viewing. We are so accustomed to character development over a 2-hour film, it's a bit disarmed for this to appear in an 8-minute segment. The idea is 18 love / relationship stories in 18 different neighborhoods in this magnificent city. Of course, some rise better than others, and others go into comedy, while others focus on dramatic emotions. Some well-known directors are involved, including Coen, Wes Craven, Alfonso Cuaron, Alexander Payne, Gus Van Sant and Gurinda Chadha. Many familiar faces are also featured: Steve Buscemi, Barbet Schroeder, Catalina Sandino Moreno, Ben Gazzara, Gena Rowlands, Gerard Depardieu, Juliette Binoche, Willem Dafoe, Nick Nolte, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Bob Hoskins. One of the best segments involves a mime, and then another mime and a small, happy, but happy child of the two mime. Also, the main roles are a layer of red rose, cancer, divorce, sexual fantasy, the death of a child and many other topics. Do not miss Alexander Payne ("Sideways" director) like Oscar Wilde. Diversity of segments makes this interesting to watch, but as a movie, it can not be called great. However, a very pleasant change of pace for those who attend the film is also being watched.
