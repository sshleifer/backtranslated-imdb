Ayone, who complains about how this movie was bad or that she has no plot, has to look for "Jean de Florrette". HELLO! this movie was made a random act of comedy and in no way involves a plot in any form or shape. I would also like to remind these hates that if you remove the crap out of this movie, they seem to have missed the point. This film is clearly made for those who do not appreciate the so-called "American humor," which seems to me to be just a bunch of dirty cracks. The point is that everyone has an opinion and you should be a little more appreciated that some sense of humor can not be in harmony with your own before you blow your mouth. <br /> <br />
