Strangely but emotionally refreshing that he kidnapped middle-aged man (William H. Macy), who eventually decides to leave his father's family business (Donald Sutherland) and flirting with another patient (Neve Campbell). He talks about a major dilemma, but "Panic" is a first-rate thriller that looks like "Beauty American" meets "The Professional". Macy and Sutherland are here. Remarkable debut for first time writer / director Henry Bromell. I am surprised that this film did not have the chance to stay in the theater for more than two weeks.
