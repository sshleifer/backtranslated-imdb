I really enjoyed this movie, it was good and the actors were brilliant! Leon Robinson, who played Richard and many other classical singers, is very good at work when you see him in a musical movie, you know he'll be fine! I would suggest that people watch this heart-warming film, sad and special, if they want to know more about Richard! Impressive! Fresh!
