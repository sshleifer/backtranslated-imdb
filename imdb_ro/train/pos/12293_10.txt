This is an excellent movie and is a sort of treasure that you can only catch up with sporadic cinema shows because it is not available on video / DVD. The way the movie begins with the two lovers arriving and ending with their departure (although it happens quite a lot between them and does not stay in one place at this time) gives you a sense of closure and a feeling that everything is right with the world. If you have the chance to see this movie, then you do. I can not wait to see him again, and I wish he could be released.
