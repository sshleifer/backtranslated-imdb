"A Itch in Time" by Bob Clampett gives seven minutes of crazy action from a very small premise. Elmer Fudd tells his dog that if he scratches only once, he will get a terrible bathroom. Unfortunately for the dog, a flea that does not have the strength makes it impossible to stop scratching. The cartoon moves between the flea's progress inside the dog's fur and the dog's desperate attempts to cope. In an extraordinary succession that truly captures the frustration of a scratch-free itch, the dog changes color from brown to blue to red, to shaggy polka dots! It sounds ridiculously surreal, but it perfectly evokes the indescribable sensation of itching in a way that Clampett could have. There are several other elements that make Clampett pure "A Itch in Time". There is the grotesque concept itself, which leads to some graphic scenes of the flea that eats the dog's flesh. There is unrestrained violence that raises its head in any scene with the cat. Particularly, there are dirty jokes, including a huge blow to the dog back, causing the flea to whistle and a hysterical sequence in which the dog tries to scratch by pulling the back of the floor. At that moment, he stops to say to the audience, "Hey, I better cut that, maybe I like it." With a very limited concept, Clampett manages to make "An itch in Time" a unique, cartoon-based cartoon. As an early episode of "Seinfeld", "A Itch in Time" is practically nothing, but very funny with it.
