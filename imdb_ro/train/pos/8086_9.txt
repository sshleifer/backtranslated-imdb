I recently rented the animated version of Lord of the Rings on the video after seeing the fantastic 2001 live action movie version. Lord of the Rings action trilogy directed directly by Peter Jackson will be much better than undoubtably George Lucas Star Wars 'prequel' trilogy (Episodes 1-3) will ever be like the real fantasy series of 21st century movies! <Br /> <br /> I remember seeing the animated version as a child, and I did not quite understand the depth of the movie at that moment. Now, when I read the books, I understand what the whole story is about. To be sure, some of the characters are pretty bad, (Samwise Gangee is particularly annoying, almost as much as Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars Episode One, but I have to say I follow the book quite closely, and is part of the second book, The Two Towers. The good things are that the action is somewhat interesting, and some of the animation is quite remarkable because it's time. The bad things are that they end up halfway through The Two Towers, without any result of Frodo's quest to destroy the ring, and the animation looks pretty dated compared to current standards. <br /> <br /> In general, not as bad as many say it is. BUT, the live action 2001 is the new distinctive mark of Lord of the Rings! At least Ralph Bakshi took the script seriously! Peter Jackson said the animated version inspired him to read the books, which in turn led him to create one of the greatest series of fantasy he ever put on the film so that we could at least, Thanks to Ralph Bakshi for this! I'll get the animated version of Lord of the Rings over the live version of Harry Potter every day! A 7 out of a scale of 1-10, much less violent than the live action version of 2001, but NOW almost as good! For the courageous fans of the books and movie versions of Lord of the Rings.
