They never heard of Man on the Moon until I saw him last night on this HDTV channel. Look, my taste is like any other, eclectic. My favorites run from Blue Velvet to Dr. Strangelove at The Ghost and Mrs. Muir through the Wizard of Oz and The Loved One, Eraserhead, Repo Man and The Spy Within. The Man on the Moon is superb, a gentle, hearty, merry and tragic, beautiful film, in which actors really live at this time, not to act. This sweet story will be in the private library. This beautiful life story in a much finer age in rural Louisiana makes you literally a pastoral atmosphere. It's hard to stay stoic during the last moments of the movie, especially when the little girl, the sister's heart has suffered private pain and forgives all of them. Rather than ruining your joy or getting bored of my boring prose, it will end up with this suggestion from someone who enjoys movies that speak from heart to ours. > If you do not buy any other film, please buy the man on the Moon. This moving story is one that you will enjoy from time to time. It is a joy and a jewel, a film too rare in this world of hardened hearts. The simple virtues evoked in man on the Moon are a joy to look. <br /> <br /> Paul Vincent Zecchino <br /> <br /> Manasota Key, Florida <br /> <br /> April 05, 2009
