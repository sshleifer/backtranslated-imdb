A simple movie at first, a simple movie in the end. She has that endless and preposterous clich√©, but most television films have ways in any way. Christopher Reeve does a good job as an ex-con / drifter. Marriage between her and the woman she works for, I feel a little weird, but I think for the time it's in, that's credible, no less. , I saw the edited "tv", even if the movie was made and appeared on "tv", it seems a little strange to me. But, I feel that if I see the whole piece, I would give it more - probably the same note. J.T. Walsh does a nice job, not his best job, but still ... a good job. 7/10
