Sex Bender Limerick: A Man or a Woman? Who knows? It turns out to be "so". <br /> <br /> He slept in the clay <br /> <br /> Then they all went away <br /> In one of their UFOs. <br /> <br /> Sex Bender is another big season episode. I like this because the story is the kind that you are never sure what will follow. It is completely original. The teaser is very fun, with close eye and reflection of the disco lights. I really need to teach my grandfender's big finger movement. I really like the atmosphere of Kindred's little village, and Mulder and Scully sneak in the middle of the night. Is very interesting. This is one of the most favorite episodes of season 1 actually. I think things that I like so much are how they turn out to be strangers in the end and leave the circles. Many people see this as an episode of extraterrestrials unrelated to mythology, such as "The Unnatural" or "Space," but I think this could easily be seen as mythology. Perhaps the genbender was just like the alien hunter, and it might seem like he would look like anybody. It is not like that? Anyway, I give the episode 9 out of 10.
