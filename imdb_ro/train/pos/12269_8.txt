Four male macho men and three sexy men venture into a remote area of ​​forests to hunt a bear. The perverse cocktail group has fun with the crazy veteran of Vietnam, Jesse (a really creepy portrait of Alberto Mejia Baron), who undoubtedly does not make those who cross the field. The director / co-writer Pedro Galindo III relates the story of catching in a steady rhythm, creates a lot of nervous tensions and offers a fair amount of graphic gore with brutal crime pieces (a splitting of the neck and a hand blown with a shotgun rate, as it highlights the defined glitter). Capable performers perform solidly, with Pedro Fernandez's particularly praiseworthy humorous Nacho, Edith Gonzalez as Alejandra, Charly Valentino as Charly and Tono Mauri as antagonistic opponent Mauricio. All the better, both the delicious blonde, Marisol Santacruz, and the beautiful brunette Adriana Vega, provide some tasty candy and expensive costume suits. Antonio de Anda's agile cinema, astounding sylvan scenery, Pedro Plascencia's robust, brilliant and shrill score, well-developed characters, and a 76-minute winning hybrid horror action.
