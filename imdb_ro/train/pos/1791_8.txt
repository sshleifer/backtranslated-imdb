This is not a profound film; most aspects of the plot are quite predictable and "tried and true," but they were welcomed and made some interesting points about what we might regret (our "mistakes," as we call it the film) when we look back on our lives. I did not read the book, so I knew nothing more than the story of a woman who dies and has strong memories for a long time that she did not share with anyone. Fortunately, they received a top melody ... Meryl <br /> <br /> Streep's daughter, Mamie Gummer, plays young Lila, and then Meryl presents at the end of the movie as the old Lila ... in addition by an amazing resemblance (spirit!), the younger actress did a great job (maybe not even to her mother's caliber, but who is it?) Everyone else in this movie was fine, though I wish it was more much by Glen Close and thought Buddy's character was too dramatic. <br /> <br /> This is more of a girls' film than boys, but a good one to see with your mom or daughter and can start a dialogue. How hard it is to really know a parent as a "person"!
