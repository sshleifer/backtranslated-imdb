Sudden Impact tends to be treated as Eastwood's artistic failure at some point in his career when he has established a good reputation as a director. The reason is not actually the film itself but its attitude to the vigilance it seems to support. In some places, he owes more to Death than the original Dirty Harry. One might argue if it is so - at the end of the day is a movie about guilt, justice and revenge. For me, at the end of the day there is more empathy than sympathy. However, in view of all these arguments, it is easy to neglect that the sudden impact is a great film made. Forget about "Go punk, do my day scene" which is iconic but not original. But look at the San Fransisco view taken from the air, zooming in the city. The first 15 or 20 minutes are quite spectacular. Or take a look at the brilliant scene where Sondra Locke's character visits her sickly sister in the hospital. Eastwood uses face juxtaposition very much. So all in all Sudden Impact is a very visual film that really shows how mature Eastwood is like a director. And if I remember correctly, it was actually the first time that Eastwood put it on the screen, though in a questionable action film of action. I also think that this is Eastwood's first film. Although Eastwood has a huge talent as a director, dramaturgy has always been his weak point (see Play Misty for me, Breezy, etc.). The nature of narration leads to the film's integration into visual elements and does not distract from the story. The only thing that is really annoying is the dog farting.
