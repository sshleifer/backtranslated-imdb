Of course, one of the best movies I've seen for some time. Refined direction and impeccable action make it a very fun and often moving movie. Denzel Washington plays one of his most appealing and moving roles so far, and the rest of the cast behaves beautifully. Christopher Walken is, of course, superb in his role, though he did not appear as often as I would. A story about the later greed that the return is offset against the child's innocence and love. This is also a movie for movie action lovers because it has a fair share of bullets, missiles and revenge. Mexico's location adds an eruption and corruption sensation that itself is an eye-opener. On the whole, a truly captivating film from the beginning to the end. Highly recommended!
