I really liked the movie, though, I did not realize that Little Richard had so many things in life. First of all, I did not know Lucille. There are very few (very few) mentions about the fact that females are intimately involved with Little Richard. Even in his life today there is no mention of women's involvement in a romantic way. I wonder why this part of his life has not been mentioned. The movie was great. I also did not like Leon playing Little Richard's side, he's a good actor, but I feel the part had to go to another actor. From a visual point of view, he did not remind me of Little Richard. I was also fully aware of the promise Little Little had made. The film was imagined as a sexual addiction. Currently, he will refer to counseling for his sexual gathering. He was voyeur. I do not want to destroy the movie for someone who did not see the movie, but there were more things about the movie that I think should not have been part of the final cut.
