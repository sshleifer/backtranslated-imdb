I really enjoyed watching this movie. like most people who looked at it. I was not sure I was getting. Whoopi Goldberg is a very funny comedian and made a lot of funny movies; that is the act of the sister. However, this was not really a comedy. is a comedy drama. so if you're looking for a laughing laugh then keep looking. this movie is about a black family moving from a beautiful neighborhood in the city to a middle-class neighborhood. I'd say more, but I think it would hurt the movie. this film does not only deal with racial relations between black and white, but also about relations with the black community. I think it deserves a chance. if you're not really interested in another movie about racial relationships, then this movie is not for you.
