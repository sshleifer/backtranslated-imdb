I think this show is amusing! It is not for every taste, and I will not raise or denigrate people who do not receive it. I'm sure there are wonderful brilliant men operating at different wavelengths. But if you like it, you really like it. Sarah plays a self-infatuation loser, called "Sarah Silverman," who often finds her own person in Homeric Assets ("Homerian" as the "Homerian Simpson"). I remember Sarah Silverman Saturday Night Live in the early '90s. I liked it right away and I let myself go to check everything she did. This show is fun and funny. Therefore, I always go ahead before tracking it and wearing diapers for adults. Check it out!
