Father Pride was the best new show that hit television since Family Guy. It was still a masterpiece of the talented people at Dreamworks Animation. Like The Simpsons, the show focuses around a nuclear family (in this case, white lions). It also contains many memorable characters, including Roger deaf orangutan, Flamingo-Italian-American Vincent, Blake and Victoria excentric white tigers, Snout Brothers patriotic brother and Chutney elephant. The other stars of the show are Sigfreid and Roy. They are incredibly eccentric and do everything in a grandiose manner, making the brightest fun activities. The combination of the cute characters of the animals and the very adult dialogue and the controversial aspects (drugs, prejudices, etc.) is the source of the brilliance of the program. The guilty for the failure of this show lies in NBC. They have chosen to broadcast the episodes in a certain order (may be influenced by the stars they could promote) rather than the more logical production order. Several times, the show has been pretended for half an hour more than such an event as Loser's Greatest (as if 60 minutes of that was not enough)! It is indeed a sick sign for the future of television as art if an original and bold performance like this fails while Fear Factor and American Idol dominate. Fortunately, the full series was released on DVD and the show now has an opportunity to win more. 10/10
