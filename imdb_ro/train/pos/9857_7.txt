While I loved this movie, the trailers that circulated on the internet a year before hitting the theaters set my expectations a little higher. I own the DVD, so do not misunderstand me, do not say do not follow it or even buy it! It's just that I still think the first scene was the best and nothing of the whole movie ever succeeded.
