As an old white housewife, I can still appreciate that Laurence Fishburne is one of our best actors. anyone who appreciates their work, as in the Deep Cover movie, can enjoy watching the incredible range of action of this actor. Because I think this is his directorial debut, it could prove even more interesting. All the acting is pretty good. If you can not take the inferior worlds of Manhattan or the reality of the life of the crime (do not glorify the shooting actions) then it is not a movie that you will enjoy. It's an ordinary contribution of Mr. Fishburne to incredibly subtle relationships. I'd love to see Larry and Anthony Hopkins in a movie one day.
