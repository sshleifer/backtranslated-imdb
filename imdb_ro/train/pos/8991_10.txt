DIG! It is fun, fun, fun, interesting, elegant and very well done. Knowing that it was made on such budgets in seven years, it is amazing that such a story can be said, especially with such a style and substance. If you are a fan of music or a documentary fan this is a must see. Focusing on Brian Jonestown Masssacre and Dandy Warhols over the years is a brilliant way of showing the contrast between a decent band that meets with moderate success, perseverance and the ability to compromise, and a megalomaniacal genius singer supported by a variety of characters that sabotage their success through drugs, alcohol and madness. If I did not know it was pictures of real people, I would swear it was an incredibly well written and imaginative piece. The story is convincing, concise and simply amazing.
