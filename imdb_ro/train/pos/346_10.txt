What a great movie! They were very scary, they had an excellent, well-written, plot-like behavior, interesting characters, a very good direction and a surprise end that would leave you with a smile on your face. This is a horror movement of popcorn, which may not be appealing to non-horror fans, but it is still (still) one of the best thrillers out there today! I highly recommended fans to: 1) the type of horror <br /> <br /> or 2) an actor or actress presented in it <br /> <br /> ** * from stars ****! PS - I'm sick and tired of people who compare this, and other modern horror films with SCREAM. I know what they did not want to be like SCREAM. Everyone is like, "Oh, they copied SCREAM!" Well, if I'm not mistaken, SCREAM copied other movies! In fact, almost every horror movie copied a movie earlier. SCREAM, however, was a good movie. But, still ... stop the comparison and enjoy what it is! <br /> <br /> GO AND STILL THIS! <br /> <br />
