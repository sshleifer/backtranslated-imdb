Street Fight is a brilliant piece of brutal satire. This is not a movie you're just watching for fun. It's not a comfortable experience, although it has some laugh-out moments. This is a movie you watch when you need food for thought. To reject this movie as simply racist, you have to completely lose the point. This is not just a satire of Song of the South, but also a bitter commentary on the prejudices Americans still have in society. Each ethnic group portrayed in the film is portrayed as grotesque cartoons of their stereotypes, which in turn are grotesque caricatures of real people. Through this wild exaggeration, the director shows how absurd these strict beliefs are. If you are a kind of person who is willing to recognize the ugliness of the predominant prejudices that American culture still has, and if you are not afraid to show your own prejudices in the eye, this movie could be for you.
