I remember seeing a few years ago when he first came out and was surrounded by Parker Posey's performance. And the movie was also good. For anyone who has spent too much time in the night / night scene, this movie will have a great charm for you. Not too serious, mostly amusing, and Parker Posey is surely blessing her talent through this indie jewelry. I really liked the character Diaz (reminded me of every DJ who ever fought). And many other movies could take a hint of this film about how to preach the virtue of responsibility without being boring and gentle for it. Babaganoosh!
