I'm not sure this comment contains a real spoiler, but it's safe to play, so do not read this if you did not see the movie. I love this movie and so do everyone I work with - and that's the purpose. I have spent much of my life in cinema, without being an actor. These people are the heroes of this film: gafers, dragons, directors in the air, scarves and writers, costumes, etc. etc., and everything is said from their point of view, at least to a large extent. Most actors are nuts and they absorb themselves to the point of absurdity, which is what this film spoofs so well, but you must have worked with actors to recognize that this movie is a drama in real life! Possible spoiler warning: in an extraordinary scene, the two leaders, both actors, discuss how to reveal something personal, something entirely "out of the scenario" with another actor and start making some lines, repeating them to criticize the performance of others. Since the movie has appeared, what has been, '91, has become so fashionable, especially on television. But almost nobody did it so well.
