The "Leo King" series is easily crowned in Disney animation. The original Lion King is the largest masterpiece in the animal. Lion King II: Simba's pride is BY FAR the best direct-to-video sequel that Disney, or any other studio, did for an animated feature. It deserved a theatrical release. The same can be said for this movie. It has original songs, songs by Elton John, a hilarious story, interesting action and moments of appealing characters. Everything you expected from this series. There is not so much a new story, but a filling and background expanded on Timon and Pumbaa, and their place in this story. What impressed me most was the animation care. All to often Disney shorts pants on the animation quality of their video and television efforts. But here, they perfectly blend animation with images from the original movie. Scenes never seem out of place. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella are in full swing as Timon and Pumbaa. Matthew Broderick, Robert Guillame and Moira Kelly resume their roles as Simba, Rafiki, and Nala respectively. We even have a return visit by Whoopi Goldberg and Cheech Marin as hyenas.There are many laughs in this movie. So if you love Lion King, you need this movie. The story is not complete without it.
