Somerset Maugham's characters are brought to life in RKO's "Of Bondage Human"; but the film is a sketchy version of the novel, with Bette Davis's performance "star-making" with the breath of all the energy. Otherwise, it's the story of Leslie Howard (Philip Carey); he dreams of becoming a painter, but he is said to have no talent for art. As the film progresses, Mr. Howard tries instead to become a doctor. His efforts seem to indicate some bad tips about art; although with success in medicine, his painting seemed easier - he also notes the symbolism of his handicap, a "club foot" (explained in the film). On the way (immediately in this version), Howard becomes infatuated with Davis waiter (like Mildred Rogers). Davis's "Mildred" characterization is extraordinary, culminating in a spectacular speech when telling Howard, among other things, that he must "WIPE MOUTH ME!" after kissing him. Howard works well, but the story fails to explain the fascination and long love for Davis; so their performance is wasted. <br /> <br /> However, a movie that follows the actor, including some good support players. Bette Davis's characterization was renowned for inspiring a "write-in" campaign for the 1934 Best Actress Academy Award. She recorded the third one for her recording. The results were: <br /> <br /> 1. Claudette Colbert - "It Happened One Night" 2. Shearer Norm - "Barrettes on Wimpole Street" <br /> <br / > 3. Bette Davis - "The Human Bondage" 4. Grace Moore - "A Night of Love" <br /> <br /> ******* Human Shoes (6/28 / 34) John Cromwell ~ Leslie Howard, Bette Davis, Reginald Denny
