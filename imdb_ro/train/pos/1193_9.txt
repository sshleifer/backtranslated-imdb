"The Last Hunt" has been stuck with me since I saw her in 1956 when I was 13 years old. It is a film that was far farther than others at that time when referring to the treatment of the natives, and the contrast that is ever present between the short and long-term effects of greed. It is as relevant today as in 1956, a kinematic discussion of the highest depth and relevance. To be top-of-the-line setting is great and great cinema. The memory of this film will be with me until the end of my days.
