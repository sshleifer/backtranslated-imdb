My first Fassbinder was a wonderful experience. Alternative film and cinema (the small room with uncomfortable seats, the audience had to wait while the movie was changed) were perfectly matched. There were many cliques used in the movie, but Fassbinder introduced them so intelligently that we found them very funny. The sound was also shining (sometimes backwards being louder than the dialogue). Everything seemed to be in the right place. And I liked how the post-war era was presented. Real Fun! <br /> <br />
