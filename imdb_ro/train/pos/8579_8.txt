Complot: A murder leader binds 3 different mafios in an enterprise to buy an island that would serve as a money laundering facility for organized crime. To counter this, the FBI is trying to beat a mafia lord. The thing is going wrong, and by some unexpected upheavals and transformations, we are going to present ourselves together with other "non-love police friends", one being a female FBI agent and the other male ex-DEA agent. <br /> <br /> So far, so stupid. But the power of this film is not in its story - a bad joke at best. It's funny. (At least the German version is synchronized). The action is also good with a memorable scene involving a gun and a rocket launcher. But the emphasis is on humor. It's not satirical intelligence, not enough slapstick, but somewhere between them, you'll have a lot of fun jokes. <br /> <br /> However, this film is the opposite of political correctness. Legal drug abuse is presented prominently, without criticism and even displaying it as cool. This is the little movie that seriously annoyed me and made it inappropriate for children, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> In total, for a nice evening, come to action with some fun jokes, this movie is perfect. Remember: In this genre, it is customary to leave your brain at the door when you enter the cinema / television room. Then you will have a good time. 8/10
