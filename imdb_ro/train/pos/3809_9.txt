Have you heard the story of reluctant heroes who were hired by a king to kill a dragon? Oh, you? Was it set in a world composed entirely of small floating islands above the clouds, and the heroes had to make dangerous jumps from one island to another on their journey? Did the water rise up and the remnants of the big cities levitating on the horizon? I didn '; t think about that. I accidentally met this movie and I am very glad I did it! It's one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. Like Pixar, it's a computer-animated piece of art that might only be possible in today's world. Animators have invested their thoughts in almost everything that appears on the screen, and this attention to detail is amazing (the scene in which the mushrooms in the foreground smoke smoke, while the characters walk obliviously in the background are one of my favorites). The monsters are also fully accomplished and wonderful to watch in action. Although the plot can not be entirely unique, the film has enough charm to make sure you look. Our protagonists are enjoyable and interesting, making sure that the audience is behind their almost impossible search for the end of the world and destroying the dragon who otherwise could devour everything in his path. Of course, Hector is the character he will fall in love with. A small blue creature with a crazy smile and a tendency to talk a mixture of nonsense and English, Hector offers an improvement in comedy in a way that Jar Jar Binks could only dream. In short, I would recommend watching Dragon Hunters if you have the opportunity. Watch it for incredible animation, breathtaking fighting scenes, and a look in a world that does not look like anything you've seen on a cinema screen or television screen. At least, it's a fun way to spend an hour and a half - whether you are nine or twenty-nine (which, in fact, are)!
