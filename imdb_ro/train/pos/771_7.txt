I saw the film with a homophobe friend, my wife and her female friend. So, we had views from all directions. Mainly, the movie made me laugh, sex tension was not there and the only visible actors were Tudor Chirila and Maria Popistasu. Yeah, I think he played his role well, even if the script was not right. They were good Romanian actors, they did not have complex roles. I applaud that Puya enters the movie. I do not know why, but I think he's a good guy, I hope he's going to be a good actor. The wife loved the film, though, and I think there were arrangements being played and for which I had no ear. If the movie tried to show unusual sexual behaviors and their consequences in Romania today, then it did not do any harm. There were no consequences. Imagine that girls are actually a boy and a girl, and the same story becomes just a boring and uninteresting plot. I have no idea why he has received all the BAFTA awards. In my book, he should have won the "More luck next time" award. (bafta = lucky in Romanian).
