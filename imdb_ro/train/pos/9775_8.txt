Tears of Kali is an original but embarrassing horror film that falls into the deeds of an Indian worship group consisting of German psychologists who have learned how to control their will and bodies to the point where they can, make others "heal" radical techniques (which can trigger hallucinations of nightmare and physical pain and torture) to free the penetrating demons inside them. The film is presented as a series of wineries for the Taylor-Eriksson group - the cult group mentioned above. The first segment is somewhat slower than the rest, but it serves well to set the premise for the rest of the movie. The rest behaves like a mindf @ ck movie with some of the keyfobs thrown in blend (full-front nudity, some gore) to keep you happy. I say you check this out. It can not be spectacular, but the concept is rather neat and delivered in the right places. 8/10.
