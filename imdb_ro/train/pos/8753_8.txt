I saw this movie in the theater and I was impressed by it. Again, when Claire Danes was a good actress, not a bad, arrogant bitch in Hollywood, she is today. However, this movie really hit me as one of the most brutal, realistic, beautiful friendship movies. How much do you go for your best friend? I was moved to tears at the end, and still breaks when I watch now (I own it). I remember as soon as I left the theater, I called my best friend and I cried how much I loved them. This is a great movie that you look at your best friend. However, be prepared for the almost concrete conversation afterwards where she returns to you and asks if you do something like that for her ....
