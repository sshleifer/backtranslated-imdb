While a bit of preaching on the theme of progress as the rescue grace of mankind, it is still an amazing film that predicts science-fiction special effects of success that would take another 40 years to get on the silver screen. It predicts the global chaos of the Second World War, but it expands on premise by having the conflict of the last 30 years, and then tells the epic story of man's struggle underground and in the wilderness of space. The act seems to be woody and strangely sterile, but this is probably a result of its contrast with the images that were supposed to be amazed at the moment of the release of the film and still impress today. This is a movie that should not be missed by anyone interested in SF.
