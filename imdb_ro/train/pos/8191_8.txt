The Impossible Planet and the Satan Pit include together the two best episodes in the "new" Doctor Who is the second season. As has been said, it is clear that much of the story translates essentially the plot of Quatermass and Pit (1967) into a cosmic space with the history of the universe interconnected with that of the Beast 666. These episodes emotionally cemented the ties between Rose and Doctor , while highlighting Rose's growing self-confidence, establishing it as a partner that was not quite equal - but who had just been there with our beloved Time of Time. It's also an elegant scenario for Matt Jones, which occasionally drops too much reliance on the one for Doctor and the performances of the entire concert, especially the excellent Shaun Parkes in his capacity as Captain Zachary Cross Flane.
