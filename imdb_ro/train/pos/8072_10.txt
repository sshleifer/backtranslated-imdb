Magnificent and unforgettable, amazingly atmospheric and brilliant of all. I do not really understand what kind of people this masterpiece is doing, and the majority of votes are 8 (and nine!). This, along with Grapes of Wrath, is John Ford's greatest film. I would say that Long Voyage Home is the next in line though quite backward. <br /> <br /> Rating: 10. Worth a 12.
