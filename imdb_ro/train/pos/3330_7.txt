I was not just an extra in this movie, I have to see it in Boston in a sold-out cinema. Over a thousand Boston Red Sox / Farrelly fans stuck in a cinema theater near Boston Common to watch a comedy .... about them .... Red Sox fans! Drew Barrymore and star Jimmy Fallon is this cute comedy about love and lust. Love is between the two young lovers. The craving is for Red Sox to win the World Series. Although Fallon is not a great actor, he is the best actor for the role. It's pretty funny and gets the most laughs. Barrymore, on the other hand, is the same old Barrymore. Sometimes I realized that Ione Skye supporting actress would have been a better actor for the role. Generally, all Boston Red Sox fans will love this movie. For the rest of the world, this is just a funny movie.
