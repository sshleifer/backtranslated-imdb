He was not sure what to expect with that, except for the uniform positive reviews I've read. It seems I would never have imagined this movie, because it is very close to the "White-haired Bride" in being the opera and the fantastic. This goes through a perfect line between being a farce, a comedy, and a simple, old-fashioned ghost story. There is nothing scary about it, it's not the theme, it's really a love story about a boy who is confronted with a beautiful ghost who has many problems with other ghosts. So the main theme is the guy trying to save the beautiful ghost. This also takes place in ancient China, with Kung Fu wild exhibitions and a trip to hell (more or less). Some of the stop ghosts are pretty cool, and the visual effects are the best. We have been able to watch this kind of Chinese movies all day, because they are very entertaining, wonderful visuals and pretty much in language. And I look forward to watching the first sequel of this movie. Highly recommended.
