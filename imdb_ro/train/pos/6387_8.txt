I thought this movie was very well put together. Voice-overs were also great. I liked how they overcame their conflicts and achieved their goals. I would recommend this movie to anyone. She definitely deserves the time and money to watch her. Atlantis has some comic scenes that made me laugh. Other scenes made me sad. And others enjoyed me. It's a movie that any age can enjoy. From the moment Milo is the crazy "teacher" or until he gathers the crew for the fantastic journey under the sea. After watching the movie, I read the book. It was also good, but the movie gives you more wonderful pictures. It's like the book. But go ahead and watch this movie!
