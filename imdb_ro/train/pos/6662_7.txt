Gandhi My father is a well-done film. It portrays the life of the great Son of Gandhiji Harilal. His character, his differences with his father, the love for his family, the desire to stand on his own, his failure, his ego. Akshaye Khanna fully justifies Harilal's role. Not him, everyone did well in the roles he played. Darshan Jariwala is the best on Gandhiji on the screen I've ever seen. But I will eliminate three points, because there were few drawbacks. First, the movie was fifteen to twenty minutes longer than it should have been. Secondly, the film needed more research into the character of Harilal. Somewhere, the character seemed incomplete. Also, his relationship with his brothers has not been demonstrated. No other child of Gandhiji was mentioned in the whole movie. I think the character like Harilal should have at least some differences between his brothers, given Harilal's selfish nature. Anyway, despite some deficiencies, I liked the movie. Recommended...
