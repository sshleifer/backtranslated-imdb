ODD CUP (3+ from 5 stars) <br /> <br /> Like most people, I always feel that Jack Klugman and Tony Randall are definitely "Weird Couple". Their incredible work on the television series from the early 1970s to the mid-70s was a major brand for television at that time ... easily surpassing the scenes and screen versions of the story. However, how can you go wrong with a pair of Jack Lemmon / Walter Matthau? Matthau is in a particularly good shape like Oscar, slob. Lemmon is accustomed to getting used to Felix, especially if you've seen Tony Randall's remarkable performance before. The script is good ... certainly the best of Neil Simon. (I want to record that Neil Simon is probably one of the worst, most valued dramaturgists of the American theater.) The story is simple: Felix, a weird and odd new odd wife, is going with Oscar, a slob that needs help to save money for food pension payments. Their life arrangement is much like a marriage, culminating in some fun tiffs and witchcraft. A lot of fun and some unique edges.
