A comedy jewel. Many moments of laughter, the spectacular moments of the shop and the pubs made my belly - laughing uncontrollably. Characters are recognized and dialogue is well respected - people know like this! The humor is surprisingly gentle, and the movie (it may seem strange) puts me in mind in an Ealing comedy. It's a great movie, with lots of details. He certainly needs a series of views. I watched a few times (I showed all my friends!) And I noticed something new every time - a dialogue, something that I never saw before. I could really be pretentious and find some shortcomings in the film, but I'm not going, because in general this movie is a very fun, sensational film that really deserves a watch and whoever has a sense of humor to enjoy. It's a movie that will find friends and I hope there are many there. Oh ... and it has a great soundtrack.
