More than a children's film, "Holes" analyzes how past incidents affect us today, whether or not we know about them. When teenager Stanley Yelnats III (Shia LeBoeuf) is sent to a detention camp where he is forced to dive all day, he discovers a number of things about the camp and his personal connection with her. Through flashbacks, we find that more things are closer than we realize (you'll better understand this when you see the movie). LeBoeuf does a pretty good job, like the other casting members: Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight, Tim Blake Nelson, Henry Winkler, Patricia Arquette and Eartha Kitt. A very interesting movie.
