The second episode of Season 1 is a delightful holiday story of love, betrayal, and a madman of murder, escaped as Christmas. A woman (Mary Ellen-Trainor) just killed her on Christmas Eve for life insurance. What begins as a perfect crime begins a struggle to survive as a disturbed Santa Claus suit wearing psychopathic (Larry Drake, perfectly over the top) threatens her life ... as well as her precious girls. <br /> <br /> This episode is warmly remembered even by those familiar with the program. By the way, this reviewer follows him on every Christmas routine. The most remarkable thing is that they bury their suspense and narratives, and All Through The Houst is among the best stories in the crypt.
