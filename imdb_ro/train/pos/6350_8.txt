We waited and waited for the movie to come out, the trailers seem to be for years, worth it. I'm not a big fan of watching movies over and over again but I cant wait for this to come out for everyone to buy! He's not a big fan of Jim, but this fit perfectly, it was so much to see and the "feel good feel" is on the scale, perfect for Christmas. I think Ron made a job turning that movie into a movie. If you did not see him, then do it, if you have, see him again, I know you want!
