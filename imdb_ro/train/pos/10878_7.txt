I personally liked cut cut-thoulyly. It was the first time I saw a screenplay of the Australian film. A genre typically limited to Hollywood movies. With all the usual comedies and dramas that came out of Australia, I loved seeing a horror movie of origin that was not a blow to anything. I did not even think it would be a doll of other movies. It was a supernatural theme horror such as Nightmare on Elm Street, not Scream, or I know what you did last summer and there was more suspense of distrust. I think it's high time that Australian movies try to get more into the main genres. Cut has been original, quite scary and, ultimately, just a bit of fun. I would give him seven out of ten, and I would not treat it seriously. He did what I expected to do, have fun and scare me enough to be satisfactory. I liked.
