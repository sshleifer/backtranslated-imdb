Usually I'm not in a specific show (except The OC & Disperate Housewives ... hey, I'm 20!), But, I'm not kidding, after an episode of the Reunion I've been hooked. <br /> <br /> I can not even say how she blames that it was a period of time in conflict with Bush's speech last night because we are looking forward to the 1987 episode that will be broadcast next Thursday. Again, this conflict was disadvantageous because, being a new show, it must build a trace and have the second episode pushed back a week kill a moment. </ P> <p> This said that the TV does not always have to be Emmy worthy of being. I do not expect Reunion to take home any prize, but I expect it will be able to capture my attention throughout the season. Do you ever watch the first few episodes of a loved show years later? Sometimes you ask yourself how you've ever gotten. Building characters takes some time. The unique episode for every year is wonderful, in my opinion. The only other show I can recall doing something like this is 24, each episode being an hour ... and a year full of events is more realistic than a busy day! Please show an exposure. Relax by the form of art ... it's just a TV!
