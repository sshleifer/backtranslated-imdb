all the actions made in the first season were really amazing. the first aspect you have about Max and Zach is through Geneva Locke and Chris Lazar or how I like to call them ministers. minis makes the best job I've ever seen for kids. the main actors and actresses, that is Jessica Alba Michael Michael Weatherly, make you forget that you are watching a fictional t.v. show that they seem to make this show come alive. all in all this is the best show I've ever watched
