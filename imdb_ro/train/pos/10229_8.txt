YETI deserves the 8 star rating because it is one of the biggest bad movies ever made. I saw her at midnight screening in LA and people were roaring and applauding crazy - this movie is one of those movie trains if you think she can not get any stranger and then make it! The millionaire who finances the project to thaw Yeti shows that Chris Penn and John Goodman poured in an inappropriate suit - the guy who plays the scientist is one of the worst actors ever to appear on the screen - and yes, there is a mute boy who seems like a girl) and is uncomfortable since he survived an airplane crash that killed both parents (maybe - baby therapy). Then this Italian hottie girl is seen by Yeti (once she defroshes - who takes FOREVER) - and falls in love with her immediately - which is one of the most hysterical things about the movie is that this giant Yeti makes "the eyes of the bedroom" at she's like a great Barry White trying to seduce a group. Indeed, once the great Yeti raises hottie and has it on her chest - it accidentally touches Yeti's nipple and yes, the movie takes time to show her big gray neck GET HARD !!!! Tickets of all YIKES! In addition, there is a collie dog because the Italian producer must have heard that the American audience like dogs and he tried trying to get a Lassie - is this crazy scene where Yeti eats a huge fish - keeps big bones of fish and use the comb hair of the Italian girl "Gee, thanks Yeti - now my hair is smooth and smells like dead trout You are the best." This movie is more bizarre than Ed Wood could ever dream of. If you are a fan of classic cinemas - look for this baby out.
