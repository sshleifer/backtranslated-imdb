Let Braik do a good show. Eventually he and Zorak live their own lives outside the Ghost Coast To Coast Spaces. I have to say I like so many shows. These are all that has begun to swim for adults. Brak managed to make it at sea with an album that came out in 2000. Perhaps it was not platinum, but his performance was very popular for a lot of people who show love for adults. I have to say that out of all Adult Swim shows without any plot, it must be the one with the biggest plot ever made. That's why I like so much, it's just such a classic in the history of adult swimming. I think this is just a great show if you do not like it. Hey were tons of hate and tons they loved.
