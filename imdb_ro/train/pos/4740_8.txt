OK, it's not a perfect movie in any way, but I do not agree with the general IMDb opinion that it's really really bad. I watched a lot of Hong Kong flix in the 1990s and I loved the expensive era. I have never seen the "Black Mask" at that time and I saw it last week for the first time. Besides the embarrassing duplication of the copy that my DVD copy did not offer me the deactivation option, the movie contains the raw and bravado energy that came into the movies in Hong Kong at the time. I still have my gun in the opinion that, when it comes to action, these boys, regardless of their budget, add a magic element on the screen not Bourne Supremacy, Casino Royale or Mission Impossible (do not beat them - I think they lack spontaneity and feel too regulated) that they will ever achieve. What is it? It is a feeling that movie producers have experienced while they shot and edited, without fear of leaving in some spots to learn lessons for the next time. For me, this makes movie watching, the more fun and more dangerous.
