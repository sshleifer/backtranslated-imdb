This is a family movie, which for some people is an automatic shutdown. It seems that too many people do not want to see movies that are not loaded with broken arms and legs, free violence and plenty of exhilaration to fill the New York phone book. This movie is none of these. It's clich√©, it's formula, but it's fun too. Do not ask you to think, do not ask to accept the film as a reality. Simply do what a good movie should do, which means freeing the unbelief for two hours and enjoying the adventure. Distribution is good, but not excellent. As another commentator pointed out, John Williams' sound score was as usual excellent. And the fact that much of the movie was shot in Huntsville in the real space camp made it even more credible. <br /> <br /> It was ironic that the initial release of the movie was delayed for months due to the Challenger Shuttle disaster, which may play an important role in its original theatrical opening, but the movie eventually contributed to concentrate the dreams of many young people back to space and the possibilities that stand there. Stay fast with the kids and get ready to enjoy yourself.
