I recently bought the completely American Gothic series on DVD and lived my memories. I was very grateful to see for the first time episodes that have never been televised. I liked "Ring of Fire," especially in stories I did not see for the first time. Gary Cole is fantastic as "bad, sexy" Lucas Buck. Lucas Black as Caleb is also a superb player. I thought Brenda Bakke as Selena Coombs was also gorgeous in her portrayal. In fact, the entire cast has been fantastically talented and has had a great deal of chemistry between them. It is a shame that the series has been screwed up by the network (in collusion with a growing group of censors) because it was really designed for adult viewing. A mixture of comedy, tragedy, farce, satire, gothic romance, and horror genres has provided brilliant charismatics to act at the genius level. I had the greatest lust for the devil for once in my life. Long live Gary Cole (Sheriff Lucas Buck), the prettiest "fallen angel" ever.
