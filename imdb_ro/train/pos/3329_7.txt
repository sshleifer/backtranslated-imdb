The only reason I saw this movie was for Jimmy Fallon, of whom I had a 9th grade passion, which was his first year at SNL. I'm a Yankees dead fan and I have not found the painful movie until the last 15 minutes when they started playing ALCS games. I had to cover my ears and make small noises, so I did not have to hear what was not to be heard, but otherwise it was completely bearable. I thought Jimmy played the part very well, because the character was supposed to be nervous and weird, and he's a nervous and weird guy. I know it can not be a winning Oscar, but the movie is just a light, fun and romantic comedy, suitable for women and men. Jimmy and Drew worked well together, and they had much better room chemistry than other actors in the past. (Ed Burns and Angelina Jolie in that stupid movie? What?) I think Jimmy has a positive career ahead of him and thank goodwill because Taxi could have killed her. I think Fever Pitch will help him a lot. Everyone must not be so critical of his ability to act, because he only starts in movies. I imagine it must be difficult and if you look at any other great actor of our time (Tom Hanks, Russell Crowe, etc.), you will see that they started in some of the flops. Busom friends? Australian appetites? Here you want Jimmy a successful career on the screen. I never wanted to leave SNL, but what can you do?
