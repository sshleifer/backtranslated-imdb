Prix ​​de Beauté was made at the top of silence to sound, which came a little later in Europe than in Hollywood. Originally conceived as a silent, he was released with a soundtrack doubled in France with a French actress Louise Brooks speaking his lines, but was released as a silent in Italy and elsewhere in Europe. I was fortunate enough to see Cineteca di Bologna's new flawless restoration of a silent Italian print at the Tribeca Film Festival. I have not seen the version of talkies, but I think it is safe to assume that the version silent is more satisfactory, since all reports doubling is badly done (Louise Brooks speaks clear English, so there as to her lips right .) The film is also entirely silent, with few titles and the need for dialogue. Prix ​​de Beauté tells his visual story with an exciting, imaginative camera work. The opening is instantly kinetic, with shaky scenes from urban life and swimmers swimming on a public beach. Throughout the film focuses on visual details, clothing, machinery, decoration and symbolic images, such as a bird house, a bunch of broken images, a diamond bracelet. This is the silent film technique at its tip. Louise Brooks, of course, is responsible for saving the film from obscurity. Seeing this, it is harder to reflect that this was her last major role. Beautiful Lustrous, dominates the movie with her charisma and also offers a perfectly natural but very charged performance. Her role here, more than in Pabst's most famous films, is a woman we can fully understand and sympathize with. She plays Lucienne Garnier, a typist with a possessive engagement, who wants to get out of her life and secretly entertains in a beauty contest with immediate success. She is then torn between the enthusiasm of her glamorous life and her love for the man who insists on giving it all or losing it. All characters are drawn in hue. The fiancé inspires mercy and is not just a brute: he loves Lucienne, but he is a limited man who can not handle it with a life different from him or attracting the attention of other people. Even the "other man" in the story is not the simplest slimeball we take for the first time, though its intentions can be as possessive as the fiance. <br /> <br /> *********** *************** WARNING: MORE SPOILERS ************ ***** <br /> <br /> the film has many fine sets, including Lucienne's triumph in the contest "Miss Europe", shown by the reactions of the audience assorted comic, which ended with heroin with flowers ; her misery as a housewife, peeling potatoes, while the pendulum clock pendulum marks time behind her; (in the silent version, this happens at the end of the movie after the marriage), to which Lucienne, crushed among the low and depressed lives of her husband's makeup, decides she can not go with her current existence; and especially the final scene in the projection room, where he sees his screen on the screen. Louise Brooks could have never looked more beautiful than her, projector beam on her profile alabaster, dressed in white fur around her shoulders, her face glowing under black helmet of hair, as she looks one screen. Double shooting of her splendid body and its image alive on screen is very hard: the image of Louise Brooks, as well as that of Lucienne remains immortal despite his film career damaged frustrating.
