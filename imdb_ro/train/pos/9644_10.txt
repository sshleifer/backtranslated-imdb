I'll give it straight ... this movie is amazing. homosexual foreign movies are so fast that they outweigh American homosexual films as production and story. While so many indie American homosexual films are serious, bad sound, amateur actors, tribal lines and a surprising lack of nudity or erotic, high-quality foreign homosexual films have appeared like this in France. cinema is beautiful, thoughtful, significant. the story is adult and complex (but it is not difficult for anyone to follow it), the act is intense and professional. both leaderships are fantastic, as well as the entire cast. boys are more than good and there is plenty of full front nudity. watch the whole year of these boys, from their encounter to the end. all the minor nuances of a relationship, the details of falling and coming out of love are beautifully executed. let me want more. check it out!
