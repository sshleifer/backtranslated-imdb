I knew about that as a program similar to Jackass, and I saw one or two episodes on Freeview, and it's the same, more extreme. Virtually three Welsh guys and a British British guoke were gathered together for the love of skateboarding and a total disrespectful / masochistic pleasure of harming their health and safety. They shot a rifle, ate pizz covered with pubs, jumped into a nettle, splashed empty paint, joked the younger guy, while sleeping a lot / snoring, trampling at work, army, cowboy and many more crazy stunts that cause bruises, bloating, blood and vomiting, perhaps not just for themselves. With the role of Matthew Pritchard, who does almost everything, Lee Dainton also advocated for everything, Dan Joyce (the British) who does not do much physical things and has a laugh OTT, and Pancho (Mike Locke) who does much more popular because they are short, fat and lazy. It was something called in the 100 funny moments. Very good!
