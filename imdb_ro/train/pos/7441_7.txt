Personally, I despise the Jerry Springer Show, however, I found "Ringmaster" as the funniest movie I've seen this year. Jerry Springer's "unfinished" saffron that begins in the opening scene makes you laugh throughout the movie. Despite a brief scene in which Jerry Springer is making a bad attempt to justify his existence, I definitely recommend this film for an entertaining value.
