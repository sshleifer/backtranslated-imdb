Aardman does it again. Near Pixar, Aardman Animation proves again and again how to make the animation properly. I looked very much to watch the first episode of Creature Comforts. I thought he translated the American audience well. My only concern is that most of the audience will not get subtle humor in this show. Being a fan of the BBC and short film version, I knew what I was in when I sat down to see this. Animators have done an excellent job for the pre-recorded voices of a perfect match animal. Look at the first episode with the stones that ring, and the dogs on the street who ask themselves "dawg". Is this for everyone? Not a long shot. In fact, I'd be glad to see the show last for a whole season. But, as we said earlier, audiences will not receive it.
