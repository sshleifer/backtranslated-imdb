Rea, Sutherland, DeMunn and von Sydow (in a small role) are totally brilliant in their performances. Sutherland is particularly adept at this type of role, where he has to present a character whose morality is at first uncertain about the audience. As is often the case with Sutherland's characters, we have to ask "is a villain [in this case, a minor] or a hero?" This is a disturbing story, he said intelligently, about the incompetence and scary bureaucracy of the old Soviet Union that hindered the efforts of highly competent people. As noted by Sutherland's character: "The measure of bureaucracy is its ability not to make special exceptions." The "committee meeting" (between the characters of Rea and Sutherland) after perestroika is being implemented, with its revelations, has an enormous emotional impact. You can feel the suffering of the dedicated people who have worked in this system. The fist of dramatic scenes portraying members of the victim's family adds an emotional resonance to the story's impact. This is rarely a feature of a movie with this sick subject, but it actually reminds us that the victims had lives and were loved. This is a sad but very important film that deserves to be featured on Canada's history television.
