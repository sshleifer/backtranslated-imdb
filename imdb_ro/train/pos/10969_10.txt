I knew but I had never seen Gray Gardens before seeing the same type of Broadway music. My friends warned me that if I had not seen the movie, the music would not make sense. She did, but it made me rent the movie. At first, I thought it was a train wreck, filled with strange, horrid characters, and it was extremely hard to follow. But if I could stop it, digest it and get back to it, they made me realize why Gray Gardens is considered a memorable documentary. <br /> <br /> Both Big Edie and Little Edie are unforgettable, and the total lack of self-consciousness deserves to be testified. Both remain beautiful despite their old age. They have a relationship that will cool every woman (and, of course, some men) and will make you reexamine your own relationships with your mom. At a time when television and cinema are commonplace, it's fascinating to see the Mayleses work three decades ago, and to understand what impact the film should have had. I echo what other posters said: how were they allowed to get into such a mess by their family? But beyond that, how could two people who live in the 1970s be able to get rid of reality in such a complete way? Or were they simply considered too crazy to be helped? I would highly recommend watching this with the comment, which gave me a further insight into the movie.
