An American in Paris is a showcase of Gene Kelly. Watch Gene sing, act and dance the way through Paris in any situation. Some simply majestic, others pure corn. One can only imagine what Kelly did because he made this film just one year before "Singin 'In The Rain". He is definitely one of the best players of all time. It is interesting to look at the parallel between the two films, especially in Kelly's characters, the only major difference being that one is based in Paris, the other in Los Angeles. Some said Leslie Caron's act was less than pure. Maybe Cyd Charisse, who was originally intended for the role, could have done better, though Caron is quite credible in the role and has chemistry with Kelly. Oscar Levant's brief role in this film gave him exactly what he needed, someone who did not look like Gene Kelly. Completing the role of man is not an easy task, yet Levant has made it as class as any other lead. Songs and dances are perfection. Even the long-lasting ballet at the end of the film makes a better film with it than without it. Seeing that there really was not much time to make such a credible loving relationship, Minnelli used this sequence to make you seem to have spent four hours with them. Ingenious! I should have recorded this movie with Singin because it is very similar in story and song. Singin 'barely got a sign because Debbie Reynolds upped the performance. <br /> <br /> Complete recommendation.
