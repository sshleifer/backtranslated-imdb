I first saw the film here in the UK in December 1989 when it was broadcast by Central TV. I still have the video tape, though worn out (over the years, many friends and family members have borrowed it and were also cooled by it!). Anyway, I remember coming home that night, grabbing a Christmas cloth, stop the lights and watch what was announced as a "Christmas Ghost Story." Even now I remember some scenes that still send hair on my neck to the end ... I've seen some movie reviews that say it's not that and not that ... they think those people get scared until Friday, 13 and others, strain and slash, which are ridiculous. This is a "traditional" ghost story; there is no big budget action or special effects ... no oath, no blood, no free sex scene, no chain saw or guns etc ... So how refreshing !!!! It's atmospheric. If you like to freeze your horror, well written, well acting and with a really scary atmosphere, this is the movie for you. I like the original horrors; just last night I saw Haunting original and this is a superb movie. Very atmospheric again - and so is the woman in black. The end of the film differs from the book, but still very good. I recommend it. Try it ... you like to like it if you like the traditional fantastic stories ... so ... turn off the lights, light the fire, close the doors, take a drink ... and enjoy yourself ...:)
