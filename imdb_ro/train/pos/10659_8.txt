"I like the fragrance better, it does not last so long ..." - Ralph Meeker's condemned character (Lawson) tells this to the character of Barbara Stanwyck's Helen, after having received a scent of perfume she chose with her husband they in Tijuana ...! This line has broken me, and it also seemed like a metaphor for this movie - cheap is better than expensive, because a cheap perfume man who has a 2 x 4 way is a better man to have around in the long run! I agree with some of the other comments posted on Helen's attraction to Lawson. Even if her narration says she wants Lawson to be removed, she seems to be attracted to her nature of fire, and that passion she has awakened in her would not have been tidying up!
