William Hurt is no longer an American mattress, but he still has a pretty good taste in film projects B. Here he plays a specialist in hazardous waste cleaning, with a tragic past, watching a perennial loser on the way - played by the former cute Weller boy - who was contaminated with a deadly poison. The current boy Hardy Kruger Jr - perhaps more beautiful than his father - is portrayed as Weller's arrogant boss in a terrible succession to a chemical production plant that makes the story move. Natasha McElhone is a giant government agent who examines the incident that offers the inescapable and high love interest to the Hurt Hero. Michael Brandon appears to play a brilliant guy without prisoners, whose coming can not wait. The Coca-Cola Company wins the 2000 product placement prize, as the soft drink is featured throughout the production, snap shot in a snowy image of Hungary.
