"Kolchak" was a television series that really did not fit into any category. A part of horror, a partial comedy, a social consciousness thrown in and what we have is something that people think they were not prepared for. It's really a shame because I started watching these shows on the Chiller network (I never saw the originals), I realized how different and interesting it really was. In the role of Darren McGavin as Kolchak, a reporter of the international news service and Simon Oakland, his always angry boss Tony Vincenzo, the show followed the exploits of a Chicago news reporter, who most of the time a part of the story himself, while he searched the windmill for the modern day, which is breaking down at night. Macgavin's basic charm really makes the show out. A strange guy who always wears the same suit, you can only help him love him. His banknotes are great, and back and forth between him and the skeptical publisher, Oakland, I'm even hilarious. The stories are for the most part good, and the acting is very good. The 70's were not a big * period * for special effects, and the show suffers for that, but if you suspend mistrust, what you have is a fun series that was ahead of time.
