With all sincerity, this series is just as classic (as television), as the original version of the poem is the world's literature. Far from being exploited, it is a beautiful and respectful interpretation of the defining texts of Western culture. I was moved by the situation of Odysseus and his descendants; touched by the drama of the fall of Troy (which was felt but not seen); intrigued by the way the gods played with the fate of mortals. (It should be noted that the gods who appear here are not ridiculous CGI creatures that roll on their ankle wings or bikini fashion models. As in Homer's work, they act by mortal agents or rarely are statuary classic). It is a pity that it is not available on DVD, especially considering the extremely low-level adaptations and Odyssey cheeses that we find in video stores.
