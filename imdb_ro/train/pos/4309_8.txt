Many of the comments that people have made me escape (lack of patience). Kasdan wants to present life, just ordinary life. The conventionally structured story, in which characters have life-changing knowledge, then fades, music up and the film ends, is absorbed in this much larger cloth. Some characters in this movie have only such a lighting and then move. Sometimes they can keep on, sometimes they can not, and so is life. In other words, Kasdan jettisons the conventional dramatic structure in favor of exploring the continuity of life? there is no happy ending, but only a possible conclusion; and still before that is still in the process, still always up for grapes ?? and, if you insist on a theme, an exploration of the miraculous role in our lives. What is a miracle? Well, life itself, for starters. Then add all random incidents and cross-connections that make life or interconnected lives and have miracles with logs. Kasdan underscores this theme, rather than insisting on it, and pushes it in different ways, most memorable by the device, right in the center of the film, to have Mac and his wife lying in bed, each dreaming of their dreams, but also shows, later in the film, how these dreams have the power, within the film, to shape reality. This is not a movie with a simple or obvious message. You just have to let her play in front of you and then let her stay in mind for a few days, a month, a few years, and see what she did there. This is undoubtedly the best film of Kasdan, the most mature, the most humane. A major meditation on life from one of the most talented writers and directors. The tragedy is, of course, not allowed to work for a few years, especially due to studio constraints around the "Dreamcatcher". Hopefully I did not hear the last one from Larry Kasdan. A great movie from a great artist. Keep in mind that art does not need to be fully rationalized to succeed.
