I know it sounds weird from someone born almost 15 years after the show stopped broadcasting, but I like this show. I do not know why, but I like to look at her. I love Adam the best. The only disappointing thing is that the only place I found to buy the seasons on DVD was in Germany, and that was just the first two seasons. That's disappointing, but it's okay. I will continue to watch online. If anyone has tips on how to buy the second 14th anniversary, please send me an email at darkangel_1627@yahoo.com. I already have the first one. The only part of the film is that the DVDs are from Germany, they play only on my portable DVD and on my computer. Good. I still hold!
