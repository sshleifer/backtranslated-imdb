The unlikely Duke of Zero Mostel and Harry Belafonte gave us some interesting shows and themes in The Angel Levine. It's an interesting question about the themes in "A Wonderful Life". Zero is married to Ida Kaminsky, and the two belong to a special class of Jewish poor in New York. Mostel was a tailor and proud of his trade, but his back and arthritis prevented him from working. Kaminsky is mostly on the bed. It has diminished at the request of well-being. In despair as Jimmy Stewart, he shouts to God for help. Now maybe if someone like Henry Travers had gotten things done differently, but even Stewart had trouble accepting Travers. But Travers had one thing for him, he was over 100 years old on this deadly bobbin, and all the ties to the earthly things disappeared. God sent Mostel something different, the recent deceased Harry Belafonte, who should have at least received some basic training for angels before he was given a task. Belafonte did not accept that he was moved alive, they still have many problems. He also has a wife, Gloria Foster, who does not know he's been hit by a car right at the beginning of the movie. You put his problem and Mostel's problems and you have a good conflict, starting from the fact that Mostel can not believe in a black Jew called Levine. This was the farewell performance for Poles / Jewish actress Ida Kaminsky who received a nomination for Best Actress in The Shop on Main Street a few years ago. The other prominent role is that of Irish actor Milo O'Shea playing a beautiful Jewish doctor. Remember O'Shea's Verdict brochure, I was really surprised to see him and hear him detained by the doctor. Angel Levine raises some interesting and disturbing questions about faith and race in this society. It is brought to you by a stellar cast and of course created by the acclaimed writer Bernard Malamud. Make sure you catch it when you're playing.
