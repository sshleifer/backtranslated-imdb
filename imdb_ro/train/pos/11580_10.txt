As another reviewer states that Hanna's war is a remarkable film about a remarkable person, Hanna "Anniko" Senesh, who will become the Jewish Joan Of Arc. Unfortunately, I diverge in my opinion by not agreeing that Miss Detmers as lead is too beautiful to be taken seriously as a resistance fighter. For me, her performance is not hampered by her beauty, but it makes her so firm in the terror of sadistic brutality as the resistance she faces. Maruschka Detmers's performance is courageous, full of heart, wise, comprehensible and totally credible. In other words, for me "In the area". of the opening credits. If you want to learn about someone else's suffering for something they think and have fun, do a Hanna's war with Maruschka Detmers. My hat is on top of Ellen Burstyn as Hanna's mother, a well-known and famous actress who could have made the effort to go with the movie. Because it's a team effort, maybe two actresses, but not an All About Eve situation.
