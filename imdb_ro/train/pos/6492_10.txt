I'm not a very good writer, so I'll keep it short. World at War is the best documentary of the Second World War I've seen. I have seen various documentaries of the Second World War (not only English / North America) and this documentary seems the most complete documentary of the Second World War I have seen. I think he could talk more about the Great Depression and why / how Hitler came to power, but it does a good job of covering the war. It seems to be complete and objective / fair for everyone. It does not exaggerate or diminish the roles of different nations. It has a lot of original records, including color images and many eyewitnesses (it was made in the 70's, when several were alive). He has great music and narrator. All-in-All I gave this on 10/10 because it's so good. (I did not see specialties in the DVD version, so I can not comment on them)
