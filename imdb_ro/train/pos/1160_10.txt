It's funny. It's not Arthur Miller or T.S. Elliot, but man is funny. Kline and Fields are great. (Her sliding line "Lord, you're so disguising" when he goes up in his window - great! Kline runs into the door after Teri Hatcher highlights - and great!) Robert Downey Jr. and Kathy Moriarty work together - until he discovers who really is ... a soap opera, if they were each one! The scene near the end of the Chinese dining area had my kids and I rolled on the floor - that scene the only thing worth the rental price. It does not solve any problem globally or it does not show the underground look of the TV in the daytime (hopefully). Just a lot of fun.
