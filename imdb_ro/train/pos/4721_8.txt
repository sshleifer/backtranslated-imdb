Sad story about a descendant B-17 pilot. Brady is shot in the busy territory. Local farmers have extended their kindness and protection to the price of their own lives. I've never heard of this movie and it took me two hours. After the movie is over, I'm glad I made some time. It's a whole story told to explain Brady's appearance at the beginning of the movie.
