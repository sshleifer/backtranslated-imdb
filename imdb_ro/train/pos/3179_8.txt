Who did this movie? Do I like this movie? Someone has a strange sense of humor ... This Zany style, Surreal shooting is appealing, but it's hard to create - or easy to forget - that substance and characters that actually have souls are what give such depth film. Without that, a comedy is just a bunch of ideas. Who cares. Maybe he laughs but passes through you like a good half-good hamburger ... the next ... Crosseyed can not intend to change anyone's life, but I appreciate the depth and substance. Sneak on you. I started this movie to think "Oh, I understand - indie comedy - on the wall - gonzo ... yup". And that is - but if you pay attention, there are moments of sub-text and characters that complement it. In this sense, the film breathes. She makes breakthrough sentences - if you're available to see them - and then, of course, it goes in its cheerful mood. You will lose the point if you do not sign the contract of suspension of faith in moments in the movie. The transition between reality and surreality is one of the points of this film. Crosseyed is not perfect, but intelligent people have succeeded. I want more. Scenes in the dining room are an absolute HOOT. Install the seat belt.
