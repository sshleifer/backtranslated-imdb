In the colonies we are not so familiar with Arthur Askey, so I almost went over this movie (which had the preview of TCM recently) because of the negative comments here about his appearance in the "Ghost Train" completely annoying. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised to find myself laughing audibly. The physical aspects of Askey's comedy and when a line was launched suggest what you would get if Charlie Chaplin and Woody Allen had a baby. We do not compare it with Bud Abbott or any of the most common ordinary comic relief suppliers in such films. It can also feel the thread that links Askey to the British comedy after 30 years; at least it is clear from the American point of view that he has more in common with Monty Python than with any of his colleagues here. As for the rest of the movie - the more movies you've seen, the more likely you'll be guessing at the end, but it's still quite fun and atmospheric, and it's worthwhile waiting for its later appearance.
