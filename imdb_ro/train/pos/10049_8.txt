I'm not a parent, I'm not a man either. But I managed to identify myself with the pains and pains of each character. This is a movie that adolescents should follow. Perhaps they will start again to appreciate the value of the family. I'm sorry for those who do not understand the value of love, family and friendship. It was very interesting to watch Patrick Duffy in a role other than that of Bobby Ewing. And it's great to see a 19-year-old Ben Affleck who can give her the best in a moving and honest performance. He showed from an early age that he is capable of an unimaginable drama. He should be given more serious roles. Record Hollywoodland ... his first serious role for years and he went out and won the best actor at the Venice Festival in 2006. This film can be appreciated by people of all ages. Perhaps it should not be watched by children under 10, because they might be scared that the same thing could happen to their families, but I recommend it to the whole family. I bought this movie on DVD and I watched with my friends many times. Because it describes the important values ​​in life.
