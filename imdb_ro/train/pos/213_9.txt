Walter Matthau and George Burns were a famous vaudeville comedy, Lewis and Clark, who have not spoken for over 10 years. Burns retired and Matthau took it personally, and since then he has kept a prey. This is the premise of this hilarious Neil Simon game performed in a movie. Of course, what makes it so good is Matthau and Burns in the foreground, and the material is funnier than anything you can find today. Richard Benjamin shines as a grandson and agent of Matthau. There are even old golden age-old star clips to bring you into the groove of the movie, and character actor Fritz Feld starts with a "pop". Rosetta LaNoire, who began in the 1930s with Orson Welles and later was a grandmother on "Family Issues," has a very small role. The only problem I had with her (and maybe I'm too pretentious and / or serious is how Matthau treats Burns when they meet for the first time.) Since, in all these years, he had a lot of resentment but some of the things that he does are considered rude or simply stupid badly taken from the context, and I'm also used to see Matthau acting in other films, but not George Burns, and Matthau's fury tends to get older. <br /> <br /> In total, if you need a funny movie constantly to help you and forget your problems, put yourself in "The Sunshine Boys." They will raise the spirits and they will make you think of a simpler way of life. "Benjamin:" You have to slip it. "Matthau:" Wait, wait, I think you have to slip it. "
