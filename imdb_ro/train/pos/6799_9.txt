This episode is a little confusing. Some people say you have to start right from the start, but I have to say that I was a little confused from the beginning! Clark gets a shot at his head and wakes up on Fairview Mental Institution floor and it's fun to think he's a superhero. Clark says the life he knew was still in his head. Delirious. He also finds some unusual things: Martha is married to Lionel; Lex is linked to a wheelchair with limbs interrupted after the accident on the bridge; and Lana is dedicated to Clark. But he finds a familiarity; someone who's dedicated to Clark: Chloe. He also notes that a mental patient is also from Smallville's well-known world. And the doctor is an escape from the Phantom Zone. This episode reminds me of a Buffy episode called "Normal Again," where Buffy begins to have vivid dreams about a mental asylum. The doctor tried to convince her that everything she knew was a fantasy of her imagination and that she was, in fact, crazy. Her parents were still married, still living in LA, her friends did not exist, Angel was never her boyfriend, and she did not have a sister called Dawn. Demons and vampires also did not exist. Both episodes are a bit sad because doctors do not just tell the characters that everything is a fiction of her imagination but tells us what it really is: fiction and brings us back to reality. It is nice, however, to have a sense of reality from time to time, but we look at these shows to get rid of reality. It's nice again, because the characters have to overcome new challenges.
