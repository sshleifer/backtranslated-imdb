It does not easily distribute ten star ratings. A movie must really impress me, and The Bourne Ultimatum has gone a long way. In addition, this trilogy has gathered so nicely that I think it is one of the greatest cinematic trilogies of our time. Although all three films could no longer be distinguished from Ludlum's novels, they remain a powerful landmark in cinematography. Bourne Ultimatum made me want to cry that the series was complete, yet we could not even try to stop smile for hours. From the moment the opening title appeared, we knew we were on a walk. Paul Greengrass does it again. Everything we love about Bourne's previous films is here again: the action, the dialogue and, of course, the blurry room. However, for me, the last one has never been a problem. I think it adds to suspense. I'll come back to see this movie several times before it's released on DVD simply because it's a genius. It is a perfectly satisfactory conclusion and should support the test of time as a fantastic film and, totally, an unforgettable trilogy.
