Sports movies have never been my stuff, but a small hand of them works for me. The best are those that focus less on sports and more on the character, such as Raging Bull, Wrestler and Girlfight. This is a great directorial debut for Karyn Kusama and a remarkable first performance for Michelle Rodriguez. Girlfight feels both realistic and implied, which is enough to make a memorable movie. The land is pretty tight. Diana Guzman, is in the fourth year of high school, but because of her struggles to pick in the lobby, she is near expulsion. As a possible means of unleashing her anger she enrolls in boxing lessons in the club where her brother trains (to the wishes of her father). Within ninety minutes, we see the spectators something extraordinary. Diana almost literally turns from a girl to a woman. We see him both in her body and in her behavior, especially when one of the boys at the club is closely linked to her, and she enters her. There is not a bad scene or a strange / filmed movie. The only error I would say can be corrected is that one subplot ends on what feels like an unfinished note. Besides, Girlfight is a great movie.
