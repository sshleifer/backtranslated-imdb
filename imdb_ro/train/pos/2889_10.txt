*** It can not be considered a spoiler, but I would rather be cautious than negligent *** I have never seen the movie when I was little. I fell in love the first time I saw her with my three-year-old daughter. I can look at it again and again. For the actress Ilene Woods did in her life, she was a wonderful voice for Cinderella; very appealing; very credible. Music fits perfectly with the perfect movie. The act was great; loved mice! You really hated Lady Tremain and the sisters; were just terrible. Cartoonists have described the spoiled behavior very well. This is a great movie, especially if you are in love. My daughter saw the movie about 25 times and is still excited at the end.
