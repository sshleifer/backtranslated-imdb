My favorite police series all the time turns into a TV movie. Works? Yes. Gee runs for the mayor and is shot. Homicide "fiction hall" is back. Pembleton and almost all the policemen who have ever played in this series. A lot of flashbacks help those who have not seen the TV series, but they also amuse fans. The last five minutes resolve another murder, and finally, even two of the dead policemen are coming back. And a brief appearance from my favorite doctor, Juliana Cox. This is a good movie.
