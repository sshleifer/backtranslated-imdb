I was pleasantly surprised that I loved this movie very much. The written soul (some jokes I received inside, others I did not - maybe because of the actors talking to each other), a great action (especially John Cassini), a great cameo, a direction interesting and unique. I hired her to see Jeffrey Meek (he was very disappointed that he was in him so short, I was blinking and he would miss him!) But he found the remarkably fun movie. Actually, I'll watch her before I send back to Netflix. I think actors and actors who want to be actors will enjoy this film. The end is somewhat awaited, but want to do something different (and more positive). Too bad that the film was better received than on the "festival" market. I suggest it to anyone who loves biz act.
