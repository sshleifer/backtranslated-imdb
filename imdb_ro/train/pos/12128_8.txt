I just saw "Human Bondage" for the first time a few days ago and WOW! What a mysterious and almost scary movie. I liked how music went with the rhythm of every step of Philip's feet. She gave me chills for some reason ... One of the biggest aspects of this movie is that you see Bette Davis come in right in front of your eyes. It's wonderful, not necessarily because it's her best work, but because she was so accustomed to being so vicious, cute and unshakable as an actress in 1934 ... Bette was a risky person, always wanted to either different and this is true when she began to realize that she could be just as ugly and daring as she wanted, and people would love her for it. If you're a true movie lover, it's amazing to see ... It just had one way to provide a line that made the role and the movie for it belongs to it. Such as "A mass of music and fire ... I am ... an old kazoo and some sparks" or "But you are Blanche, you are in that chair!" or "With all my heart, I loved the man I killed!" ... These are some of her movies, but you took my drift. She was so courageous, sassy and exotic looking up with those great eyes. After seeing this, I can not believe he has been remodeled twice ... Leslie Howard was wonderful ... so calm and persistent, forced to be loved. I thought he was adorable, and he could not understand how everyone did not fall for him, but again, everyone was ... except Mildred. He did a wonderful job ... The only thing I did not like was something that was common with the writing of the first films. He would have made such an ugly person that it is almost unbelievable that someone would actually fall for them in the first place. The performances were wonderful, but in real life, Philip would never have been interested in Mildred. This is just the simple truth ... See it!
