"end-of-day" is an incredible picture. in some respects, it is better than "meetings close to the third guy". (I prefer independent film on cheeses to spectacular big budgets). The special effects are safe, but this is a great deal of fun. jim davis offers excellent performance in this movie. is probably one of the best roles he has ever had in a feature. the musical score is very good. the story does NOT make sense. BUT YOU CAN MORE INTRIGIBLE. like many of the best works of art, "the day of the end of the day" is not afraid to be subtle and ambiguous. "end-of-day" can be a low-budget, low-budget film, but not much to compare with the "existential" European films of the fifties and sixties. (many of which were independent low-budget producers.)
