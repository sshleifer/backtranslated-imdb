The cute film about three living sisters in Switzerland (often seen while matching the right clothes) who want to put their parents back together (apparently the mother still bears the torch for her father) - so she goes to New York for to stop his father from marriage a blonde gold monk whom he calls "precious". The father did not see his daughters in ten years, they do not seem to be mind, and I think it's wonderful, and while Precious seems to lead a life led mainly by her bold mother (Alice Brady), a woman who wants to she saw her daughter marry a rich man. The sisters get the idea of ​​pushing Precious in the way of a drunk Hungarian, deceiving the two women dug in gold, considering that he is one of the richest people in Europe. But a bad identity case makes the girls believe Ray Milland's beautiful countenance is going along with the scheme because she has a passion for Sister Kay. This movie is nice, easy. Barbara Caye as Kay comes just as sweet and cute, Ray Milland looks so young and beautiful here (though, unfortunately, little is done), Alice Brady is pretty good as a mother who pays her - but it's Deanna Durbin, charmer and cute as a button playing the youngest sister Penny, who steals pretty much the show. With absolutely beautiful voices, she plays more songs in the film, although I would actually like to see them have even more in it. The film in this movie is a bit stupid, but nevertheless, I found the movie fun and fun.
