Young Victoria is a beautiful film and presented Regina Victoria in a different light from what everyone thinks of her. The films destroy the impression "I'm not amused" by Queen Victoria and she shows she was a cheerful young woman. As I like history, especially Victorian history, I imagine my reaction when I first saw this film being advertised, I was so excited, and I counted the days before it came to the cinemas. I was a little worried that it would not be historically correct, but it was and I loved it. I learned new information about Queen Victoria, who did not know so far and I'm very interested. Queen Victoria, in many lights, was one of our greatest monarchs over the years, and this film presents her picture of her real personality and her life. She was treated so badly by her mother's counselor, Sir John Conroy, because she wanted the UK to have a regent. That inspired Victoria to be a fantastic queen who was! The romance between her and Albert was so profound and this was greatly done by Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend, who were so brilliant! Young Victoria is a sensual love story in the heart but at the same time a wonderful sight in much of British history ... I LOVE IT !!!!!!!!! 10/10 ... no doubt!
