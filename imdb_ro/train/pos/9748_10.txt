I saw this movie when it came out when I was 17 years old and in classical rock (I still have) ... I never liked the work before, because I hate the soprano's voices, but he changed all that. She was adorable in the movie and had such an amazing voice. <br /> <br /> I heard from CNN that he died tonight at the home of pancreatic cancer, he will be missed and he left his mark on this world. I hope to buy this movie if I can find it, look and enjoy. * smile * Maybe I should go to Amazon.com and have a look before it's sold.
