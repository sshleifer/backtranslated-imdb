"Cinderella" is a movie about a young girl whose mother died and her father remarried. Once her father died, the Cinderella's stepmother became very bad for her and made her do all sorts of things around the house, such as cleaning up the two fates. One day the King sent a message to all single women to attend Royal Ball in honor of his son to find his wife. Of course, Cinderella failed to go, but they did. The Cinderella was very upset and thought that there was no way she could attend the Royal Ball until her native appeared. So she made some magic and made Cinderella a beautiful woman, but she had to go back to midnight, because then the magic came back. While at Royal Ball, Cinderella loses time, and the clock strikes midnight, so it drips out of the palace and loses its glass slippers. Then the king orders the duke to find women wearing slippers. The Duke searched every house, but eventually found the women he belonged to, Cinderella. Clyde Geronimi, Wilfred Jackson and Hamilton Luske directed one of Disney's best animated films in 1950. This movie is about a magical tale. At the beginning of the film, Cinderella was a servant of her own family and had no one to love her, but with little magic all her life changed and finally found love. My favorite thing about "Cinderella" is music. When the nasty Cinderella appeared to make her magic, she sang the play Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo. When I was a kid, it was one of my favorite songs to sing around my house, so I will never forget it. I also liked the role when Cinderella and the Prince sang the song So This is Love as they danced because they realized they were in love. Generally, this movie was my favorite movie when I was young, because every little girl wants to live a fairytale life.
