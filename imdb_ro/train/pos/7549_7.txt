A young cat tries to steal the soul of his brothers from death, but only half of him and then he has to do adventure to get the other half ... or maybe not. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I'm not sure what happens in this movie that is full of very strange, very surreal images, some of which parents might be worrying (that is, cats that cut a part of a pig who is traveling with them and fried like a bacon everyone eats). This is a very strange movie that some have Hello Kitty-like acid, I think more like Hello Kitty as Dali did. (Of course, this is more vivid than Destino, which was directly based on his work). If your up for a very drunk movie that will cause your perceptions of things, then see this movie. Just be ready for some strange pictures that will be burned in your memory forever
