First, let me say that before the sun rises, like all the movies, it's NOT a movie for all tastes. It seems that some people are less intelligent to recognize this fact, but it is remarkable to contemplate the genre of tremendous anxiety about this harmless little film produced by some people. For me, like most people here, before the sunrise struck me with a deep chord, I was really amazed, moved, inspired by it. This is a movie that ultimately benefits from multiple views. Create some of the most wonderful feelings and unforgettable emotions you can imagine. It's impossible to imagine this world without ever thinking of the feelings of inspiration I have received from her. The film functions as a communion of two fragile souls who begin to know each other. He is very intelligent and inspiring, not so much in the way a conversation is necessarily linked to the importance of Jesse and Celine's discussion topics, but rather to the tiny nuances, to the perfectly articulated responses they challenge to each other. It captures an honest, romantic and yet trembling emotion that begins to flourish in the sublime Viennese environment; convinces us that their evanescent relationship could be the greatest compliment in the world. And what happens after that night is open to debate, but I never doubt it will not reawaken each other. The easy comments made by RockytheBear and the user below are hopeless examples of a doctrinal dissident who does not want to accept and respect those who love this film. See it and change your way of life.
