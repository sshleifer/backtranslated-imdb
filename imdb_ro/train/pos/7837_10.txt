After listening repeatedly to the soundtrack of the CD, I knew I wanted this movie, I got it for Christmas and I was amazed. Marc Bolan had such a charisma, I can not describe it. I have heard about it this way, but I did not understand what people were talking about until I was in the company of this record. It was incredible. The Wembley concert clips are scattered with surreal sketches, such as the nuns who go to a garden party as Marc Bolan plays some acoustic versions of Get It On, etc. (I'm still learning the song titles). George Claydon, the diminutive photographer at the Magical Mystery Tour, plays a driver jumping out of a car and eating a side mirror. Nothing I can say to describe this would spoil this, even if I put the warning alert on this review, so you just have to see that for yourself. Avoid description. <br /> <br /> Yes, I like the Beatles and I was curious that Ringo directed a rock documentary - 35 years ago - now, I finally found that she was on DVD for 2 years but it's finally in my house. It's an amazing viewing experience - even enthusiastic. <br /> <br /> Now the DVD comes with a hidden extract and the following text is a copy and paste from another user: <br /> <br /> There are two hidden extracts on the Born To Boogie Double DVD release . <br /> <br /> 1.From the menu on disk 1, select the bonus material and get the extra scenes 2.
