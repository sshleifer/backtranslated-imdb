I should say that this is the first quality romantic comedy I've ever seen. it was deep, and although you knew from the beginning who was going to get together, there was still desire and anticipation. the thought that maybe they will not meet ... is, however, an indie film. this movie was well written, guided and acted. the dance on the edge of the road scene was magnificent.
