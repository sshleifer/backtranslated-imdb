"Hamlet" by Kenneth Branagh strikes all the signs. The actress is magnificent, the 70 mm cinema is gorgeous, the Oscar-nominated costumes and sets are breathtaking, and Patrick Doyle's (Oscar nominated) score is sensitive and moving. Yes, the script, by a guy named Will S., is not too bad. Film critics praised Branagh for receiving his fourth Oscar for "adapting" the script, but his decision to use the full text was a tasty one. I can not think of more ways to make four hours flying through. Almost every Branagh decision makes brilliant works: using the Blenheim palace in England for the outside, the Edwardian dress, and organizing "Be or Not Being" in a mirror room to name a few. Casting Hollywood lighting fixtures such as Robin Williams, Billy Crystal and Jack Lemmon in minor parts may distract attention. The main cast excels: Derek Jacobi captures the conflict nature of Claudius; Kate Winslet describes the descent of Ofelia in crazy; Julie Christie brings the passion for portraying Gertrude; Richard Briers is a perfect pitch like Polonius conniving; and Nicholas Farrell raises Horatio's potentially insignificant role in the apotheosis of true friendship. Every speech, every line, every word is offered with passion and conviction; there is no lost moment in the whole movie. The final scenes increase the extent of Shakespeare's tragedy in a way that is not possible with theatrical adaptations. "Hamlet" by Branagh is a daring, ambitious and ultimately successful attempt to fit the grandeur and poetry of Shakespeare's language with equally eloquent images. Is it perhaps the greatest shakespearian adaptation ever shot? strong but well-deserved praise.
