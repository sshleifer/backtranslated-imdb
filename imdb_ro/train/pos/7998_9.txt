I liked this movie. I am a Mexican and was at least offended by her. In fact, I think this film should be presented at the Mexican police headquarters. It is a sad truth that our police system is as rotten as a three-month corpse. I'm bothering to read in the news how killers, kidnappers, and other spirits are freed with a ridiculous fine or live as kings inside prison cells. We should have someone like Creasy, the character of Denzel Washington. A guard has become a vengeful aide. Kidnapping is the thriving industry here (at least in big cities). I really want the life-suitors to live the same fate as Creasy who did the job well. That would be so wonderful (sorry, I am resentment!). MAN ON FIRE is a movie that you can not miss. It might be hard for some of you if you are not accustomed to reading subtitles (Mexicans do all the while while watching American movies), but the effort will be well worth it. Some of the edits are pretty fuzzy ... like TRAFFIC, remember? (another glimpse of how corrupt Mexico is). The movie starts slowly but the rhythm rises frenetic in the second half. I swear you'll be applauding when you look at Denzel Washington sending the wrong senders. Its performance is nothing less than Excellent. The end (no spoilers, OK!) It's a bit sad, but I'm sure you'll love it anyway. MAN ON FIRE is one of the best movies of the year. A "must hold" for a DVD collection! 9 * of 10
