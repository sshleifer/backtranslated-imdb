This is truly the greatest Swedish film of all time. Not only is he revolutionary in his narrative, but also among the first films that feature the next generation of Swedish humor and Swedish comedians. Felix Herngren and Fredrik Lindström are two of the smartest and smartest filmmakers in Sweden today, and this film really puts it out. <br /> <br /> "Vuxna människor" (Adult People) is a warm and hilarious story about adulthood and the question of whether we would be better off without it.
