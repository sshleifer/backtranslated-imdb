In Anne of Green Gables (1934), Marilla Cuthbert (Helen Westley) and Matthew Cuthbert (OP Heggie), middle-aged brothers living together at Green Gables, an Avonlea farm on Prince Edward Island, a boy from a orphanage removed to help their farm. But the orphan sent to them is an early 14-year-old girl named Anne Shirley (Dawn Evelyn Paris - veteran of Disney's "Alice" series, who later adopts the name of her character). <br /> <br /> Anne was only 11 in Lucy Maude Montgomery's source novel, but the same actress could not walk credibly from the age of 11 at college age during the story. The film somehow suffers from this concession because many of Anna's reactions and many of her sayings are more fun, coming from an eleven-year-old child from a teenager. As in the book, Anne is bright and fast, eager to thank her, but unhappy with her name, her construction, her freckles and her long and red hair. Being a child of imagination, however, Anne enjoys a lot of joy in life and adapts quickly to the new family and the environment of Prince Edward Island. In fact, Anne is the original "Teenage Drama Queen," and the screenwriter has chosen to focus on this aspect of her character. Which transformed the genre from a slightly funny family drama into comedy. A change that delights audiences and continues to frustrate the purist readers. <br /> <br /> Since the comedy is largely in the spirit of Montgomery's story, I do not see any reason to put the issue of change, but that would serve as a proper warning for anyone who expects a totally faithful adaptation. The comedy element is the force of the film, being one of the first self-reflective parodies of the Hollywood conventions. Actress Anne Shirley was one of the Hollywood beauties and the film is black and white. So much fun is to see the endless complaints of the title character about the appearance and color of the hair, contradicting what appears on the screen. Anne regularly recruits her rural guides with melodramatic lines such as, "If you refuse, it will be a lifetime pain for me." Perhaps the most funny moment is when he corrects his orthographic name on the classical board. <br /> <br /> Tom Brown does a nice job as the interest of Anne Gilbert Blythe and Sara Haden's love steals all of the scenes where he appears as Cuthbert's pompous neighbor. <br /> <br /> Again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
