Well, well ... Roeg touched a little nerves out there, did not he? He was a genius while listing the descent of his various characters in psychosis for decades, but as soon as he has the bad taste that suggests that redemption (or even good advice) could be found in the old Catholic church, the crowd of the alternative film of hip-hop becomes more vicious. Worse, the character of Theresa Russell - confronted with experiences that no explanation for its rationalism has explained to them, is forced not to confront these experiences on another level - that of the spirit. You know, the realm of the ignorant and superstitious, the genre the art cinemas should support. Oh, horror ... So she finds her marriage - the idea that it could be a uniquely important commitment - affirmed by what seems uncomfortable as a divine intervention. People who find this prima facie offensive idea might wonder why they install in a way of attack, being challenged to take seriously the idea of ​​a spiritual dimension in their lives. But they probably will not. Sure, this film has some problems, especially the Talia Shire's delirium basses, such as the overwhelmed monk, the 1950s style, and so on. And the dialogue between Marie Davenport and the young priest on their last scene is directly from Glib's Spellbound School of Interpretation (although Hitchcock's film has escaped similar accusations because of the source of wisdom with impeccable secular credentials as a Freudian psychoanalyst). But, unfortunately, Nicolas Roeg seems to have made a critical crisis just as much to ask the question as to the possible answers given by this film.
