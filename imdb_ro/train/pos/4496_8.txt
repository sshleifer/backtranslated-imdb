To simply say, I liked this movie. The reason for my interest and pleasure was nothing but the subject in itself. I heard stories from my mother and grandmother about how the life and attitudes of the working class in northern England were (as they experienced) and this is an interesting picture that seems to faithfully represent what they have been told. In particular, the paternalist but arrogant father who "knows" what is best for his family, along with his obstinacy when this paradigm is challenged. (There has not been much change in there!) People who have seen the play will probably be disappointed by the film because the story can not easily be transferred to different environments. In a sense, however, the film is a historical document and I personally enjoyed it only because of the way it transmitted a social phenomenon.
