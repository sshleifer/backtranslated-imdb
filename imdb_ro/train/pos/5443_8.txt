For what it is, it's a pretty good movie. I like both Johns-Stamos ("Full House") and Stockwell ("Christine", "Top Gun"). Both offer powerful performance. The interest of love is OK, but this is more a movie than a good movie. I love Harleys and I hate to see them paint over "14 layers of scrubbed hand" with an old good army of olives. There is a little history lesson here, in which Harley-Davidson motorcycles played a key role in the Second World War. I do not know if the training was quite similar to these clusters! The film kept my interest all the way, without being stopped anywhere, with good sequences of action. I like to look at the demographics of voting history - an 18-year-old man gave the film a 10 movie (I really love bicycles, I think). I would not give it a 10, but I gave it a 8. I do not weigh each film on the same scale. There are big budget movies with great actors that you expect to be good, so when they fail, they do not get big. (Star Wars - Episode I is my best example) I liked the first three SW movies, but I thought the Episode was poor in comparison. So I'm given a lower rating than this movie. I expect more of George Lucas.
