Let's establish a right thing: this movie does not try to redefine the genre, not Dr. Strangelove o Young Frankenstein. It's a stupid movie with three great stars (I do not remember any other comedy with similar features), Rachel Dracht and Amy Poehler from SNL and Queen India Parker Posey, charming as ever. The story is basic: the three girls have been "defeated" in college, and I'm still after. Poehler is a dog trainer (who can never get a blind date), Posey is an assistant to a senator ("who has not been touched by a man since Clinton was in office" ... I caught that a few minutes later ... I'm a bit slow, OK!) and Dracht has a gay fianc√© (Seth Meyers from SNL, funny). They must prevent the senator's "distressed" daughter (the always-sweet Amber Tamblyn from the TV series "Joan of Arcadia") to stir her up during the spring break. So, of course, she has to go watch her, and some hilarity. Generally, a simple, simple, rather short and pleasant comedy
