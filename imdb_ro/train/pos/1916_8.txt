"8 SIMPLE RULES ... FOR DATING MY TEENAGE DAUGHTER", is my opinion, is an absolute classic ABC! I'm not sure I have not seen each episode, but I still enjoyed it. It's hard to tell which episode was my favorite. However, I think it was always funny when an accident happened. I always laughed at this. Despite the fact that James Garner and David Spade were good, I liked the show more when John Ritter was the leader. If you ask me, his sudden passage was very tragic. Everybody always did a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, I hope a network will bring it back to fans for the show to see.
