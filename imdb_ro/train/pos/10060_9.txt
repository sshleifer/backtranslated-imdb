Wang Bianlian is an old street artist who is known as a "masked king" for mastering the change of Sichuan art. Liang is a renowned opera artist in Sichuan and respects Wang as an artist and as a person. Liang is concerned that a precious art should not die with Wang, so he sowed the seed of a heir to Wang's mind. The film is about prejudice, masculine domination, art, values, and above all, warmth. I can not recommend this movie enough. The whole movie is in loops. Everything has a meaning. It's a long story that has been edited so well that the length of the movie is only 91 minutes. Total satisfaction. For five minutes is an artistic movie, the next five minutes is a sad movie, the next five minutes is a thriller. It simply changes its mood as its protagonist changes his face. The last scene on the rope is phenomenal. The story and script are impeccable. The actors are brilliant. Both protagonists are artists that you can tell how they did. Very impressive. Nor was he nominated for Oscar. The English student of that year received the best Oscar and won the foreign film category "Kolya". "Kolya" was fine, and the "English patient," the smallest said the better. Look at 9/10.
