This is a short and animated series by David Lynch (as they say at first), followed by the misfortunes of a puppeteer, a big man, a wife who has a stress disorder and an annoying son. Both elements are harassed repeatedly in short episodes and there is no real plot to be seen. It's easier if you think of this as a Looney Tunes except strange, slightly macabre - much more violence, profanity, bloody violence, and occasional hilarious moments. I bought the DVD with Eraserhead, having previously seen Eraserhead. Do not look at this series if you want an artistic masterpiece - it's nothing but. In fact, it seems to be almost a statement against such things, because its harsh style spits up against any animation convention you can see. As Lynch says: "If this is funny, it's just funny because we see the absurdity of everything."
