North Africa in the 1930s. In a small Arab city on the outskirts of the Sahara comes a beautiful woman who seeks her life and a trapist monk escaping from the crisis of faith. They will meet and move their passions, but even the Divine of Sand does not know whether they will find happiness or sorrow here in the garden of Allah. The land is pure hokum, but the movie is still a lot of fun and nice to look at. Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer are a superb screen couple. She is simply gorgeous, and Boyer offers a more efficient, undervalued performance, allowing her sensitive face to do a great deal of his actions for him. <br /> <br /> The supporting tower is excellent: Vasile Rathbone, in a sympathetic role as a count that loves the desert; Joseph Schildkraut as a friendly guide, speaking (all "the Arab" he and others are talking about in the film is simply gabber); Lucile Watson as a grandmother; Alan Marshal as Honorable French Officer; Tilly Losch as a Dangerous Dancer; Henry Brandon as comic goalkeeper; John Carradine as a mysterious sand giver; and the magnificent Sir C. Aubrey Smith as a wise priest. <br /> <br /> Mavens will recognize Helen Jerome Eddy as a nun; Marcia Mae Jones and Bonita Granville (looking at the monk's shoulder) as girls of the monastery; eating Nigel De Brulier as lecturer of the monastery; and Ferdinand Gottschalk as the Registrar of the hotel, all unbelievable. The 1930s color films are so rare and wonderful to watch, and this film is no exception - the cinema is as colorful as the desert itself. ALLAH's garden was the first Technicolor film to be shot on the spot. Yuma, Arizona has shot all the sand dunks he might want, but contaminated drinking water and 135-degree warmth soon had the company in revolt. When the daily fly showed that Boyer's face was burning red, the producer David O. Selznick eventually succumbed. The rest of the movie was shot on a Hollywood sound stage.
