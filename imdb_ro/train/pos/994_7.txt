I saw this movie once and I was able to watch it again, but although Jamie Foxx is good in the movie, I think he could have used a "less funny" character like Alvin Sanders. Foxx's scenes, for example, in prison, when faced with Edgar Clenteen (David Morse), are too funny. David Morse is once again a wonderful portrait of a policeman. Its harsh and yet quiet features are perfect for its role. Once again, Morse meets Doug Hutchinson (Bristol) in the theater. Morse ends down to Hutchinson. Both are perfect for this scenario in each movie. I personally like this quality in a movie where actors come in the same situation as a previous movie, as they did in The Green Mile. Overall, it was a pretty good movie.
