********* Ten of ten stars ********* <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe this was done for a television movie. Only the expression "made from television" makes me tremble. Production values ​​for movies made for television are almost always remarkably lower than the production values ​​for professional film studios. That being said, this version of "Christmas Carol" would have been released in cinemas because it is so good. It's my personal favorite all the Christmas Carol movies because every aspect of this production is of the highest quality. Yes, there are some minor scrolls on the screen with two ghosts visiting Scrooge, but it is not a lifetime movie that does not have at least one pair of mistakes. <br /> <br /> Scott turns into a stellar performance like Scrooge, it's a pleasure to look. In fact, I can not think of a performance in this movie that should not be applauded. The location of the costume, location and winter background are fascinating. The musical score is proud and warmth of the heart. In addition, solid direction, impeccable cinema and faithful writing; we have here what one day will be considered a classic holiday. In fact, it was not long enough to be a classic, but brand my words one day soon will be. This movie has turned into an annual Christmas tradition in my home because it embodies the true meaning behind Christmas: love, disinterest, dedication. In the selfish, greedy world, my family and I can lose in "Christmas Carol," with George C. Scott.
