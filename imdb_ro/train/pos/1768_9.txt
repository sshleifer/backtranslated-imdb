I have not laughed hard on a movie for a long time. I have to go to a screening in advance and I was delighted because I was dying to see him. I had tears in my eyes laughing through many movies. The audience shared my laugh and beat and screamed throughout the movie. Kudos to Steve Carrell (whom I had already been a fan of). He shows in this film his tremendous talent for comedy. It has a style I have not seen before. And Catherine Keener is as good as ever. Thank God there was no comeo of Will Ferrell (love him, but you've seen him too much this summer). In this movie there were parts of comic genius. I thank him partly to Carrell and, partly because of the writing (also Carrell). The wax scene and the "obvious problem" velocity were absolutely hysterical. I'm definitely going to see "40 Year Old Virgin" when it's released. My advice: go see him for huge laughs and an incredibly pleasant movie on the top of it.
