I find it very interesting that Lee Radziwill, Jackie Kennedy's sister and cousin of these women, will encourage Maysles to make "Big Edie" and "Little Edie" the subject of a movie. Certainly, they could be considered "skeletons" in the family closet. Additional features on the DVD include several contemporary fashion designers who have given some ideas to these weird women. I would say that anyone interested in fashion will find fascinating the discussion of these designers. (ie, "Are there any nuts or I miss something?"). This movie is hard to find. Netflix does not have it. The girl does, though.
