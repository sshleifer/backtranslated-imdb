"The Incredible Melting Man" is a fantastic brutal, trashy and energetic, Z-type production that every self-respecting character has to see himself! The ideal way to describe this low-budget 70 jewel is a shameless copy of Hammer's "The Quatermass Xperiment" ... just a thousand times more dirty! Astronaut Steve West is the only survivor of a disastrous space mission, but it is proving to be a horrible disease that makes him radioactive and ... makes him melt! In shock after seeing his face in the mirror (can you blame him?), Steve breaks out of the hospital, leaving a trail of sticky pus and falling from behind. Doctor Ted Nelson has to find him urgently because the disease left Steve with a foolish appetite for human flesh. The premise may seem extremely bad, but this movement is extremely fun and contains great makeup effects from Rick Baker. The print melting face looks like a rotten pizza, and his heavy breath makes him sound like Darth Vader! Another important advantage is that William Sachs's script does not waste any time on scientific explanations or emotional speeches. Repulsivity begins immediately and lasts until the last moment of the movie. Just enjoy this foolish jewel of jealousy and try to stop brain activity as long as you can because if you begin to contemplate many stupidity in the script, you will lose all the fun of the camp!
