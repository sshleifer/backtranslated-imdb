This is an OK adaptation, but not as good as the TV version. The actors are generally fine, but I found Jeremy Northam as damp as Mr. Knightley, especially Mark Strong in the TV version. Gwyneth Paltrow is fine and her English accent is pretty good, but again, I preferred Emma to Kate Beckinsale. There are excellent support performances from Toni Collette, Juliet Stephenson and Sophy Thompson. Script is often played too much for laughing, the book is a comedy, but there are too many set-piece gangs here, and also sub-floor Frank Churchill is almost completely absent. My biggest critique is the landscape. It's too lush. England has never been so. It looks like a chocolate box. Only the Americans would do that. Despite these criticisms, I liked this movie, but I would recommend more TV adaptation.
