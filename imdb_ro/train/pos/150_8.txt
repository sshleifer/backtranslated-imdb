The latest film by Spanish director Agusti Villaronga is a study on how children who face violence and isolation in their distant community develop into young, troubled young people who need some psychic tools to cope with the hidden mental phrase. If these tools are religion followed at a fanatical level, caring for others or simply putting on a macho image while engaging as a male prostitute, Villaronga creates a successful examination of how these vices affect three teenagers living in Spain under Franco. The three witness the disturbing double death or their friends before they are adolescents and then bury the emotions they feel with their fragile bodies until they meet again at a hospital for those suffering from tuberculosis. the cinematic style of the text is typically visually visually as you would expect from the Spanish author and is extremely reminiscent of the work of Spanish colleagues Pedro Almodovar with themes dealing with sexual desire, both heterosexual and homosexual. An element that is different between the two directors is that Villaronga favors a supernatural subtlety combined with a claustrophobic realism, stony, opposed to the use of Almodovar's surrealism, although both styles are similar. The play gives insight into the psychic youth disturbance and contains disruptive violence and scenes of sexual nature. We recommend watching this movie because it contains elements that will remain with the audience for a considerable period after watching.
