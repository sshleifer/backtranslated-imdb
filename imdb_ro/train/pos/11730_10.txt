What can be said about Elvira, which has not already been said in the world press? The classic comedy that Elvira offers her in her first long-standing masterpiece. From the first movie, Elvira packs a handful of action that clearly tells the Big Film ... eat your heart out, Bette Davis! See a bad Elvira, see an exciting Elvira, see a jealous Elvira, see a killer Elvira. You can do nothing but marvel at her power of action! <br /> <br /> In the heart of this masterpiece of comedy is Elvira's desire for the Las Vegas show. Despite putting the "boob back in boobtube" as a horror host (with mostest), Elvira finds a small screen constrictive emotional .... and Physical! Nuff said she packs her bag and goes east ... a hotdog in a hand and a letter from the aunt's lawyer who portrays her inheritance in the other. I have seen this movie so many times, I can almost recite it verbally .... (the word would only be)! Take a copy, laugh stupidly, find out the lines .... <br /> <br /> Why not win the best actress Oscar for this role is beyond me.
