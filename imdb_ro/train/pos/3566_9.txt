In 1954, Marlon Brando was the Hot Actor after his performances in Streetcar Named Desire and On The Waterfront. Frank Sinatra did not have to invent yet on the silver screen. But Sinatra's portrait, like Nathan Detroit, helped reinstate Sinatra with his fans. It's an extraordinary screen version of a great game, and the choices of players and support players are great. Imagine a movie in which Brando plays? This was his only role playing as he interpreted Sky Masterson. In addition, the female lead, Jean Simmons and Vivian Blaine (resuming her stage role as Nathan Adelade's long-time lover), put in superlative efforts. Special mention refers to the great Stubby Kaye (just as beautiful) and with all respect for Eric Clapton, Rockin 'nobody's version of The Boat does not even approach Stubby's. Sheldon Leonard, who will become famous as a producer of shows like "The Danny Thomas Show" and "The Dick Van Dyke Show" are afraid of "Harry The Horse," BSPulley is excellent, being Big Julie and even Regis Toomey offers his excellence as "Brother Arvide". He is one of the fun musicians to see, a good comedy, and Sinatra and Brando. Soooooo "Luck Be A Lady Tonight" and brother ... "is your dice"
