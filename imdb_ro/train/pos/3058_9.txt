I bought this one year ago or something more for 2 $ (yep, $ 2), I left it on the shelf all the time, now looking at DVDs while hiding with a cold. Spectacular performances by all those involved, especially the 6yo boy (about the only smiles you get in this movie). The plot probably reminds me of my favorite movie ever, Grosse Pointe Blank, but obviously it's a hard heart. As a psychologist, clinical and forensic psychologist, my spine increased when the identity of the new contract was revealed. Frightful things! Brilliant thing all over the world. <br /> <br /> Pete
