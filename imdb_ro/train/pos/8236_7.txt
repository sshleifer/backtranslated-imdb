Due to the invention of a "home-grown collar", meat-eating zombies are brought under control and become productive members of society; however, they perform mining tasks. The dead servants are addressing those who live in the buried United States of America in the 1950s while unarmed zombies walk in the Wild Zone. In Willard, pre-adolescent K'Sun Ray (like Timmy Robinson) lives with his parents, Carrie-Anne Moss and Dylan Baker (Helen and Bill Robinson). Unfortunately, Robinsons are the only family on the street who do not have a zombie; their new neighbors, Bottoms, have six. So to keep up, Robinsons gets the zombie Billy Connolly (like Fido). Unfortunately, Mr Connolly's "Domestic Collar" is destroyed by an old man, and he eats it; then new and hungry zombies infest the city. Meanwhile, young Ray has been associated with Connolly (his boy and zombies are like Timmy and Lassie TV) and the Robinson family finds it difficult to cooperate with the Zomcom control authorities. <br /> <br /> "Fido" does not go far enough in its own "wild area"; but it is a colorful, elegant and funny satirical addition to zombie film lore. Ray and the distribution behaves well, individually; with sonny Bennett (like Tammy) and owner Tim Blake Nelson (like Theopolis), the most memorable pair. Director Andrew Currie and the crew, including Rob Gray (design), Jan Kiesser (photo), Don MacDonald (music) and James Willcock (design) have earned merit. * Fido (2006) Andrew Currie ~ K'Sun Ray, Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker
