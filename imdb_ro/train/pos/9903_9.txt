Wow, IMDb praise and Google, because I've been trying to remember the name of this wonderful f'ing movie for over 15 years now. Sacrifice, man! Hell, yes! I will not bore you with a summary of the plot, actors and yadda yadda yadda, because you all know what's going on. That's why you're here anyway. What I will do is, however, explain the amorous memory I have of this D-Movie's joint articulation since 1980. In 1987, when I was seven, my father used to rent all these horror films. Would they care that his children were following him? Not. So at that age I saw Slaughter High. What I saw in that movie was great with me. I have not seen it since then, but I still remember most of the ridiculous murders in the movie. For example, the post-sex scene (why is there a metal bed in a school?) It's electrocuted. Or the guy who drowned in a pool. Come on! My personal favorite, though ... the stomach exploded from beaten beer. Amazing! How can you honestly hate a movie in which one of the characters finds a beer in an abandoned school such as 10 or 15 years later, and thinks it would be a good idea to drink it? Then his stomach explodes? What the!? And this wonderful line: Let's get our car ... always start. Classic carp all the way. <br /> <br /> I mean, I look back now, almost 20 years later, and laugh at her. But when I was 7, I was scared. What a shawl hat (or a mask?), That the killer on the rock scared my fear! Everything, yes, a bad movie. But for nostalgia and humor, this film gets 9 out of 10 from me. Either sit up every night really late and hope to catch this at the same latest late show, or hunt a VHS copy and dust on the VCR.
