The secret of rage, in many ways a romantic suspense drama (directed by Mel Ferrer), boasts the top executives of Colbert and Ryan; it remains confused if it does not crash to the end, when implausibility conquers the suspension of mistrust - as is often the case in this genre. But for some viewers, the film will be highlighted by Leah's portrait of Vivian Vance - immortal Ethel Mertz on "I Love Lucy." Oddly, Vance had very few film roles; her true home was Broadway, where (among other concerts) she studied for Ethel Merman. Here, she contributes with a winning reward, as a chambermaid, empowered to play a minor role in a bad scheme; watch her half-hearted trying to evacuate the smoke when she blows an angry cigarette into the linen storage room - a mistake for which she ultimately pays the ultimate punishment.
