I like newer episodes with CJ and Grandad - I also liked the story with Kate falling for the principal. I want to find out what's going on with Rory and Kerry and Bridget and the next family. I think CJ is very funny and I like scenes with Grandad. I have always loved James Garner in everything he does, and it's a credit of his act that I never think of him as James Garner or Rockford in this series and I believe in him as Kate's father. This family is so real and funny. It was terribly sad when John Ritter / Paul Hennessey died, but as it happens in real life, as it was written in the series, he was funny and sad and always extremely sensitive and loving to treat. But, in general, a very funny show, with lots of fun and fun.
