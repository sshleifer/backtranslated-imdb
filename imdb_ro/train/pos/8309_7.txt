It's always a pleasant surprise when a movie made for television turns out to be fun, like Little Richard. This is a highly watched film about Rock and Roller's story, Little Richard, played by an actor named Leon, whom I have not seen before but does a really good job. Like most TV films, this is a bit tamer than if they did for Cinema, which is a shame because I'm sure there are many I could have seen about Little Richard, which was controversial. Instead, we see a lot of religious garbage, which is the only thing that destroys the movie and eventually spoiled a very promising career. Everything in this movie is good, and acting is above the average of a TV movie. 7 out of 10.
