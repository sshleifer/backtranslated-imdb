My older sister was born in March 1985 and has cerebral palsy. in her 22 years of life she has seen only the walls of her home and her school, which is also occupied by other children with disabilities. I was the head of everyone's jokes because my sister is disabled and I still think that until today, nobody is or will never give anything about her and her condition. Then I saw this movie. I knew what Christy's family was going through. but they were lucky. Christy could talk, communicate, and have artistic skills. my sister can go, but she can not say a word and can not use her hands to do anything but to get something. but this movie made me realize that there were other people in the world as my sister, and the end (to tell the truth) made me cry. And I saw SHAWSHANK !!! This movie is seriously undervalued, and should not. This movie tells people something. that people should be proud of their own lives. Do you think you can not write well? the guy wrote with his leg. thinking that you are not attractive? this guy was denied by many girls because of his condition. not the fastest runner? Christy could not even get up. My point: Parents of small children, I suggest your children to watch this movie with you so they know the next time they see someone on the street in the wheelchair, they do not look at them as if they were aliens. My sister received millions of eyes and broke my heart to believe that this is still happening to many people. This film will teach people that people who do not seem "normal" are people. 10/10
