and what combo. Two of the great singers of the century play together in this undervalued music. He writes music, writes lyrics, and both work for Vasile Rathbone, who can not even write because his wife died (in fact she became fat!). The best scene is the number of the pawn shop, where Bing plays an improvised number, while the swing band takes their instruments out of the string. Just awesome. And this is a rare role for the legend on Broadway, Mary Martin, and it's pretty good. Charlie Grapewin, John Scott Trotter, William Frawley, Oscar Levant (Maniac Pianist), Charles Lane and co-star Helen Bertram. And who knew that Rathbone might be funny?
