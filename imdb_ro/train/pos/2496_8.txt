There is no garbage - not if not even close to garbage. Is not it an original? this is the last thing that can be said about "2.4 children". Predictable? of course not! Although it was an unusual series for the BBC, it was hilarious, fun and spiritual. I really liked Belinda Lang and John Pickard - whom I think we have greatly prepared. Gary olsen was also very good and there were other members of the casting. I do not really know why he was met until he read today about Gary Olsen's death at a relatively young age. I want them to do more of this kind of comedy, much more (and to show them here in Israel).
