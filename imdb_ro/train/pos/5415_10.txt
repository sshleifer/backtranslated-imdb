Early Hollywood at the best! A classic Kipling poem is transformed into an epic adventure that shows memorable performance by a star cast. I think the measure of a good movie is how many times you can watch it and you can still really enjoy it. I've seen it a dozen times and still cry at the end and, I admit, you do too!
