This film shows peoples in the midst of the hottest days in Austria. They show people who humiliate other peoples and are cruel to other peoples. This indicates the inability of people to communicate or to talk to others. In my view, people left in the middle because they could no longer watch the movie. And rightly so. Because the movie is not easy to watch. It has a very depressing message and there is no moment of pity in the movie. It's a very cruel film, not for everyone's taste. You can not talk about the terms of joy in this movie. Agglomerates in your throat and never lets you go away and finally you feel just breathless because of its intensity. I can not "recommend" or "do not recommend" this movie. You should create your own mind based on what we said earlier. You just need to know that this movie is not an ordinary movie and it is not for anyone who tastes.
