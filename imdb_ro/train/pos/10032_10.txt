I liked this movie since I was 7 years old and I saw it on the opening day. She was so moving and beautiful. I strongly recommend to see for all. It's a movie to watch with your family away. My MPAA Rating: PG-13 for theme themes, prolonged scenes of disaster, nudity / sexuality and some languages.
