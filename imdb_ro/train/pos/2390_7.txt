My 2-year-old mother likes to show the Doodlebops show, seems to keep her attention for a while. Characters are interesting, vibrant with primary colors and all. There is not too much educational content that the target audience could benefit from, but they seem to have a theme in each show and they try to teach the children about sharing and respect and other basic elements, so I like that. It is well produced with high production values. But it's just an average show like most of today's television shows. We do not buy in the corner of the merchandise and we have our son wearing everything Dooblebop does. I do not think we'll spend money to go live, if they ever came to town. Going to the Zoo or the Science Center is a much better experience for all involved and, in my opinion, the money is better spent.
