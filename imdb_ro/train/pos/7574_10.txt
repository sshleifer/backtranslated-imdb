This is one of the best in the series, ranking there with Resident Evil 3: Nemesis (or Biohazard: Last Escape) The game has a great story where you play as Claire Redfield in search of her brother, Chris Redfield. Resident Evil original) It's as scary as the other Resident Evil, and contains many more cutscenes. <br /> <br /> My rating: **** of ***** Stars (Comparison based on comparison with other video games)
