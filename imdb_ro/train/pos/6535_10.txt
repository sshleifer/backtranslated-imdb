This was a great movie! Even if I only had 15 people, including myself, it was great! My friend and I laughed a lot. My mother really enjoyed it. There were two middle-aged and 20-year-old women who seemed to enjoy it. I like the part where Corky and Ned are as if they would like Nancy and have fun with his nice coat. And when he makes his roadster, Ned is there. Yes, it was a great movie, even people underestimated it lol. Go see I bet you will enjoy it! I also enjoyed my friend. <br /> <br /> People were so tough on this film and they did not even see it. I bet next time will give a chance to the movie and the actresses. Everyone did a good job in my opinion. But if you have small children, it is still appropriate. I'll probably take my seven-year-old granddaughter to look at her too.
