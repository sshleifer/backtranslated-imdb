PG-13 rate for violence, short sexual humor and drug content. Quebec Rating: 13+ (should be G) Canadian Home Video Rating: 14A <br /> <br /> I've seen Story Police a few times now. In my opinion, Story Story is Chan's best movie in the 80's. he did it because he did not like the other movie of a policeman he was supposed to play as The Protector. I did not see the protector, so I can not compare. The actor is not too bad, and the plot is pretty good. I do not remember the plot well because I saw this movie once more in the back, but what I remember is that this movie has a lot of great action, stunts and comedy just needs a good Chan movie. If you can find the police story and you are Fan Chan buy this movie! <br /> <br /> Runtime: 106min <br /> <br /> 9/10
