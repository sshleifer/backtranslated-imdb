This movie was absolutely brilliant. It actually made me think. Throughout the movie I was confused as a hell. I liked everything ... it was so confused and so twisted and strange that it was hard not to like it. All the actors were phenomenal, and no one could do a better job ... This is one of my favorites of the year ... it deserves a reproach.
