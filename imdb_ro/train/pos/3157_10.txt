"The '70s" is definitely the funniest show on TV. I started watching her two and a half years ago, and as soon as I saw it, I could say it was a great show. I like all the characters, but my personal favorites are Fez and Kelso. Leo was also a wonderful character while he was there, I hope he'll be back because he's hilarious. It's classic when Fez goes "you, fuckin '!" And when Kelso yells "burn!" That makes me laugh. They are such great characters and always have something fun to say. Jackie hot is just another reason to watch the show; she started to be very good looking, but damn, somewhere around the 5-6 season she was just really hot. I've seen most of the episodes several times, some like 10 times and even more funny. This is one of the few shows I can always watch and laugh as much as I did the first time I saw it. The tower is classic; almost everyone is funny, where in many shows there are just some funny characters. I will be sad to see this show later next year, but it will be out of the air as one of the best shows ever.
