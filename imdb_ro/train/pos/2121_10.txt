This is a beautiful movie, which is played by wonderful players. It will make you laugh and make you cry. At the end of the film he gives me every time. If you want to see a great movie, that's all. Jimmy Stewert provides a wonderful interpretation of the wonderful and Frank Morgan as Mr. Matuschek is spellbinding. Morgan's diversity is not surprising at all. William Tracy as Pepi is a terrific comic story and offers some of the most important lines and shows of movies. Felix Bressart offers a tremendous performance like Perovitch, a hard-working worker, who is the ambition of life to please those with whom he works. It is a simple story about how close the collaborators can become and how two people who have a great animosity about each other fall in love with unusual circumstances.
