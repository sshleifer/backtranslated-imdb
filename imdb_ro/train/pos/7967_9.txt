This is definitely one of the biggest Disney movies ever made. It's a real pleasure for anyone. It will make you laugh, make you cry, and it will put you in suspense. Essentially, what Home Battle Means is three domestic animals that are sent to live on a farm while their owners go on holiday. They do not know what is going on and desperately want to go home, they escape from the farm and try to find their way home through the wilderness. This is one of the last films that Don Ameche has played. He offered the voice of Shadow, the old, wise and friendly golden retriever. He also starred in Sally Field, featuring Sassy's voice, the Himalayan cat. But seriously, what is this movie about is Chance! The voice of Michael J. Fox (my favorite actor over time), Chance is basically everything you would expect from a dog, full of love, playful, energetic and capricious, and every time I do it to watch this movie; it's like comedy never ends! <br /> <br /> This movie is also very sad at times. It sometimes reminds people of times when they were alone or when they lost their pets. A scene that always puts me in suspense is the scene where the trio tries to escape the pound; I feel particularly shocked at the side where Chance takes his collar in the fence and almost fails. The film had other moments of suspense, but none seems to me more suspense than one. Generally, it's a wonderful family movie. If you like this movie, you'll probably enjoy the sequel. Give this movie a solid 9 out of 10!
