It's not well shot, well written or well done, but it has to be the most exciting show I've seen from the Twin Peaks. Each disclosure is scheduled so well that you have to see the next episode to get any kind of closure. They even slowed down the rhythm of the show, revealing just a small amount of information on the episode, but I feel they have told you everything you want to know. However, some of the acting is terrible, and some of the duologists are brutal. Some characters are two-dimensional. More experienced actors like Locke and Ecko really stand out in front of actors playing Jack, Kate, Sayid, and so on. Developing the show can also be very frustrating as the next episode could not indicate what led to the previous episode. Annoying parcels have become part of the story that sometimes tells you nothing. However, the second season has grown to a point where the stories behind reveal more about the island than they had previously. All in all of her a great show, but not perfect.
