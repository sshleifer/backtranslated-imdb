"Hollywood North" is a cinematic euphemism as they went to Canada to make movies because of tax breaks and cheaper costs in a civilized city such as Toronto, later in Vancouver. Peter O'Brian, the director, has probably seen many invaders in California that this film seems to be the right way to treat the arriving personalities, trying to tap the economy that Canada has shown. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, "Moon Lantern," the successful novel written by a Canadian author is transformed into "The Flight to Bogota", which has nothing to do with the original movie. A big selfish person was Michael Baytes, who is obsessed with what is happening in Iran, and they are offered the lead, which turns into a disaster. The film seems to say that too many chefs broke the broth, which seems to be the case with the final product, which is saved by its producer, Bobby Myers. With the help of Sandy Ryan, who was around to make a documentary of the film being shot in Toronto, parts of the film are turned into a cohesive film in the end. The filming process is hilarious, and action is generally good.
