I saw The Bad Bad Swim at the Temecula Film Festival in 2006 and I was totally caught guarding how much I was drawn into it. The film focuses around the life of a group of people who have taken an adult swimming for various reasons. A humorous idea in itself, the class serves as a catalyst for greater changes in student life. What surprised me about the movie was how real it felt. Rarely, in the ensemble's parts, the characters are treated so well. I liked the classics very much, and the drama that took place outside was very disturbing. Nothing seemed out of place or out of character and eventually left a very strong feeling, just like at school or at the summer camp - where you find quick friends, strong ties and discoveries about yourself, however to go too fast. My only complaint was that Paula's character had a very strong and unusual introduction, which made you want to know more about her than she was eventually revealed. I guess you do not meet everybody in the class, though ... Besides, I found the film very well rounded and pretty. See if you have the opportunity.
