In 1958, Clarksberg was a city famous for speed traps. Much of the revenue was generated by the Sheriff department capturing speed. Those who tried to overcome the sheriff? Well, that gave the sheriff the chance to push them off the Clarksberg curve with the Plymouth cruise. For example, at the beginning of the movie, a couple of soldiers on vacation who try to return to the base in time are pushed to death if I remember correctly. Then one day, a stranger led the city. Probably the hottest roer in the world. Michael McCord. Even his name is a car name, just like in the McCord gaskets. In the event of a hot rod. A black coupe 34 Ford. The colors of death, evil and fire. It is taken by the sheriff with intent. He checks the location of the land. He is the brother of one of the Sheriff's victims. He knows how his brother died. The Clarksberg government is in favor of the sheriff. There is only one way to obtain justice for killing his brother and repair things so "this will never happen to anyone": recreates the pursuit and arranges the style of the hot-rodder contest to death. It goes to curve and practice. The sheriff knows that McCord knows. Race begins ... This is a movie to be remembered by anyone who has ever tried to master maneuvers on a particular stretch of road.
