The intelligent, stylish and impressive thriller of the great Brian De Palma is a modern classic that ranks among his best movies! When the troubled housewife is brutally murdered by a strange stranger, the victim's son joins a prostitute to discover the killer. Dressed in Kill left a strong impression on the public of the day and for good reason. De Palma creates a wonderful dramatic story that begins with a set of intrigue and builds into a bizarre mystery full of intense suspense. The end and the conclusion are especially the "nightmare". It's a real edge of your shock. Even more impressive is the elegant direction of De Palma, which offers this film not only a tight suspense but also a unique and dark atmosphere. Dressed at Kill is also a very erotic film, but mainly in a weirdly beautiful way. Pino Donaggio also offers a great musical score for the film. Distribution is another strong feature of this film. Michael Cain does a terrible job as a psychiatrist. Angie Dickenson is great as a bad housewife. Nancy Allen's performance as a street is solid. A young Keith Gordon also proves that he is a worthy supporter as the investigating son. Many criticize De Palma's films for Hitchcockian elements and this film was no exception. But any resemblance between Hitchcock's and De Palmas's plays can be seen as a good quality, though calling this movie a "rip-off," would be degrading to a better thriller. Dressed in Kill is a must-see for all fans of cinema. <br /> <br /> **** from ****
