"If I sit down, I will never rise again," says his mother's mother when she tells her to rest (she is just a widow). It means that rest is what a woman of his age and in her situation needs to do: to rest in peace, to be neglected. But he does not have the "rest", not yet. She also has a daughter who reproves her for every disaster in her life ... Suddenly the revelation appears: sex and passion in the form of a 30 year younger carpenter (Daniel Craig, the new James Bond) when " she thought nobody would ever touch her again. " It's a story that makes you reflect on many things, especially about what a woman a woman has to do with her life when her husband dies. It does not seem that we have advanced this in these aspects. No one is surprised when Sean Connery has a love affair in a movie with Catherine Zeta Jones ... but what did you think it would be different? An old man, a young guy ... oh, you're not ready for that, are you? The film has intimate tones along its entire length, with the exception of two or three sequences in which the sounds burst and go out of explicit and dirty dialogues. These vulgar touches and the way your son and daughter find their mother's business (quite absurd - you'll know what I mean when you look at her) are the only discordant elements in Mother. <br /> <br /> * My Ratio: 7/10
