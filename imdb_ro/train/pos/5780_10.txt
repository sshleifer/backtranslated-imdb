Maxx is a profoundly psychological introspective slightly camouflaged as a strange superhero story. Julie Winters is an "independent social assistant" in an anonymous dirty city roamed with murder, and she and everyone knows she has a lot of trouble working. Maxx is her boyfriend and client, a street boy who thinks she is a costumed superhero - or is it the other way around? Maxx is not to be missed for the work of art, the story itself or the excellent work of voice - especially Barry Stigler's delay in expressing the city's deliciously delicate urban mischief, Mr. Gone. If you have the chance to see this, do not lose yourself.
