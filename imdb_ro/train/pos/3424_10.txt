The information contained in this film is somewhat known to many who have been watching the news lately. Walter Reed scandals show a small part of the fact that we do not do a good job of taking care of our wounded heroes when they return. What this film looks like is a common truth for all wars. The psychological trauma that soldiers suffer during the war and the difficulty they have when returning to civilian life. They are not just changed or affected, they are different people, and most people do not know how to handle it because they are not known. Finally, this film shows what the army does for our young people in women in their preparation for war, and the policies and practices they have to follow in pursuit of the war that leads to all psychological trauma. We have over 3,000 dead soldiers in the four years of this invasion; but we have many tens of thousands who will suffer physical and psychological traumas throughout life because of this war. No matter what direction you are, please know the cost of the war to decide if we should be in that business. This film perfectly illustrates the costs for men and women.
