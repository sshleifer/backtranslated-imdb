Notice that if he wants to ascend, he has to give people what they want. they ... well, you know. Alfred E. Green's Baby Face (1933) is a movie of great sex content. For a film of that era, anyway. This was one of the last pre-code movies that have been made. Barbara Stanwyck offers a very sexy show like Lily. Other actors include George Brent (Courtland Trenholm), Donald Cook (Ned Stevens), Alphonse Ethier (Adolf Cragg), Henry Kolker (JPCarter), Margaret Lindsay (Ann Carter) Theresa Harris (Chico). Young John Wayne is seen as Jimmy McCoy Jr. This movie deals with a brave subject and it does it well.Baby Face is a significant historical film and therefore good to watch.
