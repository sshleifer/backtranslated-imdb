While the story of a troubled child returning to boxing for self-esteem and anger management is hardly a new thing, the story has a fresh twist here when the protagonist is a girl instead of a boy. <br /> <br /> Diana has problems at school. It simply can not stand by the battle. At home, her father constantly puts her down. Her brother treats the box in a gym, and one day she decides she wants to train. It would be easy to call this movie a "Rocky with girls," I think. But that's not what it's all about. The story takes a lot of the main character being a girl, rather than a boy. This way, you can solve several problems at once. First, the problem of her lack of acceptance because she is not a little girl, and when she comes to the boxing room because she is a girl. It's also a story about how a goal can change one's life. What positive things can make you grow. I do not want this to sound pretentious, because the movie does not feel pretentious, but what I say is true. Michelle Rodriguez is also very good at lead. It is a shame indeed that she has become stuck in the "hard girl" now, because that's not really her side in "Girlfight". Sure she is a boxer woman, but rather the more sensitive moments that really make her shine. So maybe this is basically the underdog's usual story with a turn but is raised above the crowd by Rodriguez's performance. Measures this 7/10.
