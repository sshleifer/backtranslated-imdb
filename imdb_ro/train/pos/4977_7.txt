So many educational films are nothing but witchcraft, saved only by the fact that "MST3K" sneaks ("Why could they study industrial arts?"). "Hemo the Magnificent" is actually quite well done. It's about blood, heart, and circulatory system. I admit I do not remember everything from her, but she does a good job explaining everything, keeping it serious but fun. I think you can always count in June Foray (the most famous voice of Rocky The Storker, she plays a deer here). Since the "Hemo Magnificent" itself can be hard to find, perhaps the best place to see is in "Gremlins": a class follows her while a gravel is formed.
