This film is exactly what his title describes - an attempt to make you buy what writers have to offer. First of all, it's quite fun to see Toronto in the style of 1996, I just remember silly haircuts, sunglasses, clothes and attitude. It really has not changed anything; just a small, urban, beautiful, safe, cheap, provincial leisure area that makes an excellent venue for international film types! It's also fun to see Kenny and Spenny in Los Angeles and find out he's from Toronto again, just with a strange assortment of beach sticks, musicians, riddles and yet more cinematographic types. I do not see Pitch as a nice film; it's no fun unless the spectator enjoys watching one's aspirations to be taunted. I take Pitch as a warning that power and money are really owned by studios and production houses. The writers, musicians and actors who will be (and "succeed") are still transient, even when they come in great time. So, Kenny and Spenny are trying to sell you a warning. Buy it or not, but the message is still there.
