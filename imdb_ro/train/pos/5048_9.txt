This is a very dark and intriguing horror thriller based on the idea of ​​religious crimes. The story is based on a disturbed man living in Texas, USA, who suddenly goes into a murmur of his two sons after being instructed by God to redeem the world of evil men. Bill Paxton, who directs this film, interprets the disturbed Father, who is known as the God-Hitler, while Matthew McConaughey plays the best performances so far as the eldest son, Fenton Meiks. The film revolves around Fenton, who decides he can no longer bear the burden of his criminal childhood, and uses flashbacks to tell the story of FBI agent Wesley Doyle (played by Powers Boothe). of many movies that literally keep the viewer chained from beginning to end and this is certainly one of them. Even if you do not want to watch, you will not be able to do it because of the exact power of this movie. The filmmakers have filmed this movie very well and helped to establish the plot through the good landscape. Action in this movie is great, but if there are disadvantages, some parts are very strong and can bother some people. While the concept of this film is very dark, little children help portray the idea through brilliant action. This is really a backbone movie and it is guaranteed to have you at the edge of the chair all the way. I would recommend this movie to everyone who enjoys horrible, bothersome and powerful movies or anyone who just wants to see something different. <br /> <br /> 8/10
