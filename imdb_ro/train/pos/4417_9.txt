This film is a lyrical and romantic memorial that has been telling through the eyes an eleven-year-old boy living in a rural Cuban town in the year of Castro's revolution. It is an obvious work of love. <br /> <br /> The names CUBA LIBRE and CUBAN BLOOD are just attempts to mislead this movie as an action movie. JULIA'S DREAM has much more meaning. It has more in common with European cinema than with RAMBO, and the revolution is just an inconvenience to people's everyday life and intentions. Only this fact makes the film more honest than most of the works that deal with this period of time in Cuban history. Excessive use of the voice narrator does not undermine the story, but the film compensates unqualified clips from Hollywood movies that say so much more visually than the narrator could. Comparisons with CINEMA PARADISO and are the correct game that film wax melancholy about movies, but there is a pain that underlies the loss of a lifestyle that outstrips the lost love. <br /> <br /> The revolution, like JULIE, never seems to end.
