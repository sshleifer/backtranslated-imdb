A common line in the films consists of the main characters who leave the agitation of the city and find themselves in the silence of nature. In the power of Kangwon province, we are shown two stories about individuals doing this, trying to go through a trip to the popular Korean parks in the mountains of Kangwon Province. However, rather than epifanal moments, we have two characters whose journey in nature was just another form of escape. The rhythm of this film is slow, contemplative. Finally, we learn what everyone brought to Kangwon Province and learn how they are connected. For those who want Hollywood Glam and for a movie to give them a definitive answer, this movie will not please. But for those who want a movie that lets them think, asking themselves, which affects them years after, this movie will much more than satisfy their desire.
