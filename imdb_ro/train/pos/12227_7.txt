I've researched this film after seeing Alicia Silverstone's most famous effort since the beginning of his "Clueless" (1995), difficult and linguistic career. "True Crime" has Kevin Dillon, who should be helpful in improving most film projects. In fact, everyone in the distribution is doing a good job. The only disappointment I think the film has for me is a strange "feeling" of scenes, coming from the need to have a rather uncompromising, raised theme as part of the tune that begins as a school adventure. /> <br /> Alicia Silverstone is pretty good in this regard. It performs well the naive enthusiasm and the increased anxiety that affects Mary Giordano as she manipulates the truth behind serial killers. I think MG's characterization also has a mileage. The conclusion of the story line is that she continues her career in law enforcement. It would be very interesting for an older Silverstone to return to Giordano in a period of crisis later in the officer's life. Just a thought! "True Crime" shows the director in a good light. Pat Verducci also has the written credit. I do not know of any other PV film work. I can only wonder what happened after such a promising start. Like most productions, it has a largely unknown distribution, though Bill Nunn (Detective Jerry Guinn) is not that way. In the last decade, he seems to have managed to get an impressive number of appearances on the screen. I remember seeing him recently in "Carriers" (1998), a military television show. Bill Nunn played "Captain Arends". The fans of the American television show "Who is the boss" could also have an interest in "Carriers," as the main player is Judith Light, reminded by much affection for many of his long involvement in the show. /> "The real offense" might not have worked well, but it's okay. I think it's an interesting story that's worth seeing.
