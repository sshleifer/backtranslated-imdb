I agree with another user here and I have to say that this is one of the best Kung Fu movies ever! I have seen this as a child and loved him absolutely! The scaffolding scenes are brilliant and you can really feel impressed by this type because it is treated as a defeated. Beautiful humor and fantastic kung fu this rock movie! If you like Kung Fu you like this !!!
