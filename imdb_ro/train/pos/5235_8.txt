The story does not begin to describe the movie: a man writes a movie, or rather, * this movie *. It's absolutely self-referential to the point where you think it will be bent in itself like a black hole. The writer writes something and happens or something happens and writes about it. It is very philosophical, like "Waking Life", but more oriented towards Zen and, moreover, much better, in my opinion. At one point there are personal interviews on the street, and then you see photos of those people who are filmed and then discover that their answers are written when someone continues to change their lines. There are beautiful landscapes and optical illusions. I hope it will appear on DVD, so I can watch it again more carefully. Viewed at Cinequest (San Jose Film Festival, CA) on 2/25/2002.
