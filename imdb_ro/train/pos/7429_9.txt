She is an extraordinary singer who takes care of anything else !!!! This final scene is one of the best moments in all biz - bar shows none !! I'm glad he held the camera for ten minutes - it's worth the iconic status - that's the power of the voice. <br /> <br /> I first saw this movie when I was five years old and had a huge impact on me. I see today, and yes, I can see some of the flaws (like Esther wanting to leave the Grammy right as her prize is announced). But some of the other users' comments are just plain false - that is, where free nudity - may have seen different movies ??? <br /> <br /> Streisand's singing capacity is monumental, and if he has a great ego - well! <br /> <br /> She won it.
