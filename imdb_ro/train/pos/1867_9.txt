this is a movie about life, the triumph over the adversity and the miracles of the human spirit. I advise anyone not to throw a tear until the end of the movie. This is more than a tear-jerker, an interesting drama with a challenging thought, with excellent performances from all the pieces distributed, but especially derek Luke and Denzel Washington. 7 years ago, I'm amazed that Luke is still a virtual unknown, and Washington has just directed another movie. However, in addition to a delay, the story of the child's trials and troubles and the way it still affects adulthood is a kind of movie that remains with you long after you've seen it. Like many fox images, this was more of a sleeping blow and did not receive the critical mass appraisals they deserve. The scene Antwone eventually meets his mother summed up the film for me, there were so many ways that could have been done and could have been all schmaltzy or could have been unrealistic, but Washington hit exactly the right tone , a word, and could only shed a tear, while Antowne simply asked why. Her overwhelming blame prevented her from saying anything, what could she say to defend herself? One of the most exciting cinematic scenes I've ever seen.
