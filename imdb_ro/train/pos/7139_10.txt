John Thaw, from Inspector Morse's fame, plays old Tom Oakley in this movie. Tom lives in a small English village in 1939 and the beginning of the Second World War. A little relic, Tom has not recovered since the death of his wife and son during his service during the First World War. If you can imagine that Inspector Morse is old and retired, twice as crocheted as when he was a cop, then you have Tom Oakley's character. However, this stone heart is about to melt. Children in London are evacuated before the flash. Young William (Willie) Beag is busy with Tom protests. Willie is played in a good effect by Nick Robinson. This boy needs care with a C capital. Behind the school, still moistening his bed, and unable to read, is the slightest of his problems. He comes from a terrible backdrop in London, with a mother unable to cope, to say gently. Slowly, but constantly, the man and the boy warm each other. Tom discovers once again his ability to love and care. And the boy learns to accept this love and care. See that Tom and Willie build a bomb shelter at the end of their garden. See Willie's joy at what is probably Tom's first birthday party today. Not to end, but Willie is adopted by Tom after a long battle and the pair begins a much richer life for their mutual love. In this film, Thaw and Robinson watch in a long line of movies where the man meets with the boy and develops a mutual love. See the fair Dirk Bogarde and Jon Whiteley in the Spanish Guardian. Or Clark Gable and Carlo Angeletti in "Started in Naples". Or Robert Ulrich and Kenny Vadas in the "Courageous Captains". Or Mel Gibson and Nick Stahl in The Man Without a Face. Two points of interest. This is the only appearance of thawing that I know where she sings. Just one verse of a hymn, the New Jerusalem, but he sings. Second, young Robinson also starred in a second Tom film in the title "Tom's Midnight Garden" on a classic novel for children.
