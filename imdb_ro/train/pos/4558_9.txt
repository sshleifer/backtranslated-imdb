HELPING ME LEFT, in my opinion, is a great biopic about one of the most talented authors and painters in the world. The performances were crushed, the soundtrack was great, and casting was perfect. I thought Christy (Daniel Day-Lewis) was a very talented man, though I did not understand what he was saying the most. Besides, when he threw a punch, I was scared a little. It is also sad that he suffered from cerebral palsy. In conclusion, if you are a fan of Daniel Day-Lewis or biopic, I recommend this great biopic about one of the most talented authors and painters in the world. You are really for a good treatment and a good period, so do not miss this.
