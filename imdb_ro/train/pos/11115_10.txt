I think Soprano is an extraordinary show because of all the characters who support him. I bought each video so far and I'm waiting for the rest to be released. In all 42 episodes so far, the best is certainly # 3, Denial, Anger, Acceptance. This episode treats the most favorite character of all time in Sopranos. His name was Brendan Filone. He was killed because he hijacked the wrong truck and accidentally killed a truck driver. Brendan was great because he was actually one of the few characters to actually stand against Tony and his gang. Eventually, he shot his eyes as he bathed, and this is the most favorite scene in the history of the Sopranos. Brendan Filone is # 1 for me. And my most favorite character was ever Matthew Bevilaqua, who was killed after trying to kill Christopher Moltisanti. Tony and Pussy shoot him in the Hucklebarney Park after he catches him and tortures him. My most favorite character is Sean Gismonte, who was killed just after Christopher's filming. And finally, my most favorite character is Chucky Signore, one of the uncle Junior's patrons. He was killed on a boat by Tony. All the wonderful characters are dead. This is the only bad thing about Sopranos. All the bad guys are always killed. Do you know what would be great to change about Sopranos? They should have a whole episode showing all the supporting characters in hell and they all try to torture Chris, Tony, Uncle Junior, Silvio and Paulie, because he has to take revenge. Brendan Filone will hit back !!!!!!!!! 1
