If you want to see a movie of different kinds, if you feel love in your heart, even if you miss the Lord, this movie makes you think. Although Georges is mentally handicapped, you can see the ultimate intelligence at the end, when love gives you no direction but the brain. I'm not emotional, but this movie makes you feel the human being. The film is as good as Forrest Gump in my belief. Foreign movies are sometimes more interesting, but there are not enough advertisements to make them popular. Majid Majid's "Rang-e khoda" is another example of foreign movies, almost with a similar taste.
