Some movies seem to be made before they're ready for them. When I watched this movie, made in 1988, in 1999, I thought I was looking at O.J. Simpsons debacle (although I have very different opinions about the innocence of people in each situation). The Australian media, if this movie is to be believed, devoured the case of a possible infanticide, and the truth remained as a later idea. It was scary to see invasive and humorous media hordes of horror, ridiculous accounts of halves of truths and lies and debates on the supposed merits of the case by people at all levels of society. media representation as indifferent and misunderstanding of technical information in this case. I want more to address the issue of religious prejudices in this case (seven-day Adventists are accused). These circuses have become commonplace today, but this makes the lesson more important. /> <br /> Streep is great as usual, and this is the best movie I've ever seen Sam Neill. Aussie accents sometimes become a little thick, but not incomprehensible.
