Wow, this movie has had a huge impact on me, moved me,. It's an amazing story about a girl from Cambodia who is sold in sex. I can not help thinking about the fate of the little girl named Holly. The film's adjustment is realistic, the film was an eye-opener, I can not imagine anyone who moves away from him without wanting to help change with this frightening problem. the movie was very moving. It was one of the best movies I've seen this year. Girl playing Holly does a fantastic job with her character. Ron Livinston offers tremendous performance. The film has moved me to tears, says an important message that needs to be heard around the world. Everyone should see this movie. I think this movie will make a difference, I liked it!
