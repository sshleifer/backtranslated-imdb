It was an extremely low budget (some scenes show that they were recorded with a home video recorder). However, it has a good line of plot, and easy to follow. 8 years after being shot, her father, Amanda, is released from the psychiatric hospital with the help of her doctor, with whom she secretly has an affair. The doctor ends up renting a house and buying a car. But in the first 20 minutes of the movie, Amanda kills him and buries him in the back yard. Then she sees her neighbor Richard looking at his eyes and stopping at nothing until he has him. She acts innocent, but after another neighbor, Buzz, finds out that Amanda has killed the doctor and tried to kill Richards wife Laurie (that's after Amanda and him put him in the hot tub). Then she stops acting so Innocent and kills Buzz, and later attempts to kill Richard whom she supposedly loves and cares. And you'll have to rent the movie to see if Amanda dies or not. The good movie, reminds me of much of my life, you know that everything was falling for your neighbor and did not stop until you left.
