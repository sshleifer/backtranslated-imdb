The story is pretty original, but the movie is pretty slow, building up to the point where the cars are stealing. It's nice to watch and prepare the theft, but the real theft would have been more in the picture ... However, the stunt work on this movie was excellent and it's certainly a movie that you have to do, see it (7/10)
