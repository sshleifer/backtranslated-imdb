Maybe the biggest ever jazz movie. It's Jazz. The opening shot continues to haunt me. Lester, of course, is also wonderful from this world. <br /> <br /> Jo Jones is always a delight (see The Sound of Jazz, too). If you can find music; is available on CD. All jazz and noir lovers should study this huge jewel. What shadows and light - what music - what a hat!
