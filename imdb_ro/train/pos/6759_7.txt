WHEN STUDY SIDEWALK deserves a better known film, directed by Otto Preminger, the man who gave the world LAURA. And this time he has the same co-stars: DANA ANDREWS and GENE TIERNEY. It must be said that Tierney is underused in what is more of a supportive role while the spotlight is heading towards Andrews. He plays a tough and tough cop who deals with a lot of thieves in a way too vigorous until one night accidentally kills a man in the process of arresting him. When suspicion falls on a taxi driver (TOM TULLY), he goes along with the murder investigation, but he starts to feel guilty because he's in love with the daughter of the cabin (GENE TIERNEY). Tierney, by the way, looks a bit too elegant for the little girl she's playing here and does not seem to fit into the background to the story. The story has a bleak twist during the investigation goes deeper and it was discovered that the man killed had a silver plate in his head in his service as a hero of war. In the end, it turns into a morality story, with Andrews developing a conscience about his crime. It's fascinating that the noir movie performs with a strong distribution. A good entry into the noir field, forced by Preminger and played nicely by Andrews and Tierney, despite the ease of shrinking character.
