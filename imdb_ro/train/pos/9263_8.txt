This is a totally delightful and unexpected movie. Start by following a young man who hopes to enter the qualifying football match between Bahrain and Iran. If Iran wins, they will enter the 2006 World Cup in Germany. The problem is that the young man is a girl, and girls (or women who matter) are not allowed in football matches to "stand with men". What follows is a wonderful comedy, played with an accomplished skill by a small, full cast. The film explores the absurdity of restrictions on women's freedom (and, for example, young soldiers who have to corrupt them). There are some great sets, not least when one of the girls has to go to the toilet and, of course, the stadium does not have women's toilets. The works on the camera are the simplest and in some respects this story could have been said to be a stage play. However, the small scale gives the film a bite. Great cinema? No, probably not; great fun - sure.
