This film captures the absurd essence of an arrogant American patriot actor - who thinks his work (and politics) is just as crucial to the American people as the president's own opinion. Alan Bates perfectly captures this mentality like Michael Baytes, and I will remind him immortally of Bates as a character. This is a film for both Canadians and Americans. It is a valuable cinematographic piece that can take its audience through the magic of filming and reveal how easy it is for the producer and director to lose the total control of the will of the actors and the innumerable external forces. Wonderful, Hollywood North does not suffer from the subject he is playing: Peter O'Brian is moving with precision control and commanding both the serious part of the movie "behind the scenes" and the movie "Flight to Bogota" with clarity and understanding. If you are all interested in the spirit and power of Canadian cinema, "Hollywood North" is a great place to start.
