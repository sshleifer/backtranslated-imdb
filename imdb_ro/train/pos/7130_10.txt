Well, when before watching this movie I was not sure if it was a cup of tea ... how wrong I was! I thought this was one of the best movies I've watched for a long time, a true classical family. The story of a young evacuee and his new foster father, this movie beats all the boxes. I did not read the book (maybe it's a good thing and I liked the movie more), but about the story, I really can not think of any bad points, that's why we mark 10 of 10 (and I Hardly ever believes that any guaranteed top marks!). Until William proclaimed, "I can drive my bike!" I cried my heart (anyone who saw that she would understand, I'm sure). Really encouraging, and certainly recommended.
