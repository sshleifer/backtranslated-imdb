I love these "Baby Diaper" movies! You could not make a movie like this today and it's rich in cinematic history. It's terrible and the movie was made to make you laugh, what it does. As they have ever done these children to "act," I will never know. I think they are precious and the kids make me laugh, but the others who made this film as the naivety that existed in the early 1930s. You have to remember that when the film industry was very young, the stock market collapsed, global depression began and these films were made to give a person a break from the real world. The fact that you could see movies for five cents is beyond my understanding, but then the dinner for 25 cents is too. It was a different moment, with a completely different set of minds.
