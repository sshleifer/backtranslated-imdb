The film reaches the courage of tension between a son and a father. The brilliant dialogue, wonderful scenery and an excellent adventure serve as an excellent way to put onion that keeps peeling back. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The essential issues of parents, communication and men are indirectly explored. <br /> <br /> Fun, the curtain is retracted, the masks slid slightly and the truths are exposed. > <br /> All this happens in the middle of a road format. The background is the New York countryside in the early autumn, just as the trees change their colors. WOW!
