Throughout the Pirates of the Caribbean Trilogy Craze Paramount Pictures really dropped the ball in the restoration of this Anthony Quinn directed Cecil B. DeMille supervised film and taking on DVD and Blu Ray with all included extras. It is obvious to me that Paramount Pictures Execs are blind as bats and ignoring the fact that they have a really good movie in their cellar about a true pirate who actually lived in New Orleans, Louisiana, which would have helped The Crescent City once again renowned for Pirate Connections. When Execs at Paramount finally end up with the program and release this movie in digital format, then I'll be a happy camper. Paramount Images is up to you to get off your duff and get this restored movie now!
