All I can say about the Necromaniac / Schizophreniac 2 series is ... if you're even a "PC" remotely or you do not have a feeling of serious tangle humor, then you probably will not get it. Being sick and disgusting as this movie is really a comedy and not a horror movie. If you can appreciate someone pushing the boundaries of good taste and political correctness to the most extreme boundaries imaginable, to the point where it gets so far out of the manuscript that it is comic, then you have to see this to believe it. This movie is so uncontrollable that a major film studio could not achieve this with a 10-foot pillar (with a condom at the end). In my opinion, however, the best, most extreme pieces of art come from underground. If you do not stick to the same old formula that people are accustomed to seeing, then they reject it. I've seen stacks of terrible, boring, z-type movies that were just waste of a perfect VHS tape or DVD-R. I've also seen stacks of odorous bombs coming from the big studios, which were a complete waste of millions of dollars. When a NO BUDGET movie like Ron Atkins / John Giancaspro comes out and blows all the other "shock" films out of the water, you have to look a second time at the entire Indy scene. Once you've seen this, you can really see how much freedom an Indy movie producer can have when working alone. The funny thing is that even the other people who saw this movie and "hated it" admit they have laughed all the way through it. I do not think it's possible for anyone to get bored looking at either of these two. So if you do not take too seriously everything you saw in the media and you could laugh at a psychopath who struggles with a puppeteer who eventually abducted, you must see this. Perhaps you will only be able to see it for classical, classic worship. Both Schizophreniac / Schizophreniac 2 are among the favorites in my collection of over 1,000 DVDs.
