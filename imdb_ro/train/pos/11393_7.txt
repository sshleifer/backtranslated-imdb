Uggh! I was not really impressed with this film, though I must admit it is well done technically. It gets a 7 for very high production values, but in terms of entertainment values, it is quite weak. In fact, I consider this film one of the most overrated in the 1950s. She won the Oscar for Best Picture, but the film is just boring sometimes with so much dancing, dancing and dancing. That's because, unlike some musicals that have a reasonable number of songs, along with a strong story and acting (such as MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS), this movie is almost all singing and dancing. In fact, this movie has the longest number of songs and dances in history, and if you're not in this movie, the movie will wear you fast. Give me more story! As a result, with excessive production numbers and a poor story, this film is like a constant diet of meringue - it does not meet in the long run. <br /> <br /> To think ... this is the movie that struck "A tram called desire" and "A place in the sun" for the best picture! And to make things worse, the "Queen of Africa" ​​and "Ace in the Holes" have not even been nominated in this category! And even more amazing for me is that Ace in the Hole lost for the best script, script for this movie - even though "An American in Paris" had no story to talk about and was largely led by dance and song.
