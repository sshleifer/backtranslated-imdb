Renny Harlin's first American film was one of the best of a series of horror films (like "Death House" or "The Chair") in the late 80's. Twenty years ago, Guardian Lane Smith erroneously executed a condemned man. Now he is the director of the newly opened prison, and the man's ghost returns for bloody revenge. This atmospheric and very bad film hosts a lot of terrible gore and violence. Viggo Mortensen, Tiny Lister, Tom Everett and Kane Hodder are for the fun massacre.
