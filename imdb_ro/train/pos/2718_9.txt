Last year, we were treated to two films about Truman Capote writing the book from which this film was made - Capote and Infamous. I can not imagine a movie like this one made in 1967. A powerful, powerful movie and drama dramatically dramatized; raised to the status of a classic film, through the direction of Richard Brooks' master (Elmer Gantry, Cat on a warm board, Blackboard jungle, Blackboard). Interestingly, Robert Blake, who starred in this movie, has had so many problems lately, which might be related to portraying him as a killer in this film. This is a movie that stays with you after watching.
