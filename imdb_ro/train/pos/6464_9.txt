I loved this movie! It's a normal life in a small village. About hypocrisy and honesty, love and teaching. That's great! It's the things that everyone meets in life. You have to do things with passion. But some people will not appreciate your passion and will try to stop you. There are people who find the opinions of others and what "neighbors will think" more important than to follow their hearts. Do not allow anyone to stop you from fulfilling your dreams and passion. I liked the fact that the actors were really normal people, it could have been my family. There are not great beauties, but all the people you fall in love with during the movie.
