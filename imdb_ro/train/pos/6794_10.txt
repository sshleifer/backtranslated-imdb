I read through most of the comments posted here and all I can say is that most of these posters have major issues in life. This show, unlike most of the game shows, was fun. Mister. Shatner, whose temptation in everything he does, was the hit of the show again. He is truly lively personality shining like a headlamp from where ever he goes. It's fun and makes you smile and that's exactly what the show looks like. The dancers and questions, the rounded fashion they are presented with, are added only to the show appeal. And even if there is a lot of money in the game, it's fun. The pressure (stress) that exists in most gaming shows is NOT here. Several people who posted messages complained how long it is mysterious with dancers and the choice of questions, and that the Millionaire has no similar time losses. All I can say is that most of you have lost the whole concept. The idea here is to do your FUN & ENJOY. It's something for everyone. Sewing to test the knowledge, eye candy (dancers), suspense, Shatner's wonderful personality ... but if that does not make boys then I feel sorry for you; and if this is not enough, you can get rich! I really miss the show. Of all the games I've ever had, and to be very honest, shows the I HATE games, this is the one I really liked to miss you. The only game I liked was the game.
