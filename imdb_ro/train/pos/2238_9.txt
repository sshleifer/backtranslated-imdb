Because this film is completely in the Swiss dialect, it is probably hard for most German speakers to really follow this movie. I'm not from Switzerland, but I worked there for a few years, so I had the chance to understand this great spoof of Lord of the Rings. I've seen a lot of such movies (for example, Scary Movie, many Scifi spoofs, etc.), but this is the best one I've seen so far. Give a 9 out of 10. The only reason I can not give a 10 is because there are some details that could have been made better and because they did not provide subtitles in any language on DVD, so there is almost no chance non-Swiss to understand.
