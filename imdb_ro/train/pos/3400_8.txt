Domini Enfilren (Marlene Dietrich) spent most of her life taking care of her father. Now that she's dead, she's free, but she does not know what she wants. Boris Androvsky (Charles Boyer) is a monk who has fled from a monastery to taste more of his life. They meet accidentally in Algiers, fall in love and marry. But he can not let go of the past and can not live without him ... WAY overcomes the story full of dialogue and bad hysterical situations. Dietrich and Boyer are doing their best to provide good performance, but NOBODY could escape with some of their lines! However, in a way, it is a classic. He is shot in the gorgeous Technicolor (try to see it on DVD) where every frame is beautiful. Dietrich is always dressed in the 9th (even in the middle of the desert) and hits the hysterical possessions to show her clothes and body. Boyer just travels around amazed (there is no shock there). I have never been bored. It was great to watch and the stupid dialogue kept me in seamlessly. The end I almost fell from my chair because I laugh so much! Now I love my love and give me plenty of space, but indeed - this is unbelievable! It also runs a very short time of 80 minutes. As a classic camp, I give this to a movie 8. As a serious film - 1.
