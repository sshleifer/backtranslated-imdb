I thought this movement was really good. There were a few things that were less perfect, but in general, I was quite surprised. The courtroom scene eventually seemed a little unrealistic, but it was real enough to be fun. We have found that the film has communicated the hardships of going through military training and the sacrifices that go with it. Being a military pilot, I could refer to many of these parties.
