Eytan Fox did it again: move the viewer's heart into a modest story that takes place in an overwhelming mess. The film also manages to describe so perfectly and subtly the amazing city atmosphere that Tel Aviv is. I was there a month ago, and it's still there: lifestyle, relationships, heartbeat the city, misery, utopian mind misfortune in the lightest, lighter, and more common megalopolis ever. <br /> <br /> We recommend: it is a journey to the heart and mind, with an interesting perspective on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. <br /> <br /> Note Bene: There is a homosexual central plot in the film. If you do not think you are too homosexual, be prepared to be provoked and eventually see it as "just love". (and do not worry: the chicken is too hot!)
