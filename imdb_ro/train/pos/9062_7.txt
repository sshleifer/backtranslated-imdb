it's a weekend I've been watching this funny movie. and I like it very much. all children are nice, I remember my childhood with that stupid thought. is a true entertainment film for a family of families on weekend nights, which could make a lot of memories and laughter. Baby's humor always goes. nice acts also. simple story, but cool shooting. a good job for directer to find the way of the child. when it comes to the child's movie, I think of "12 and holding". but this year differs in appearance from the world of the child, which is real and cruel. a wonderful job. H2EFW focuses on the happy childhood that every child and family have. P.S. Twitch, I think, is Nemo's voice from "Finding Nemo."
