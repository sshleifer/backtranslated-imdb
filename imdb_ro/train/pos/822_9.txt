Lucas's latest film is a spectacular and spectacular production. It is often considered the ugly duck of the original trilogy, but I think it is a note above Episode IV (and just a notch under Episodes III and V). In fact, I think it's the third best six-part saga. As far as I'm concerned, it's still a great entertainment movie. It is not a film with a beginning, a climax and a final point; the mechanism of the film operates with a single purpose in his mind: to close the universe of Lucas. There is a finite air attached to the whole thing, which makes the movie a bit too sentimental but emotionally rewarding. It is also very fun. New characters are introduced, and old ones face new unexpected challenges. C3PO and R2D2 offer (as usual) a great comic relief. Leia and Solo are a wonderful romantic duo, and Luke is still an extraordinarily identifiable character. Again, there is the inner conflict of Luke (and of Vader), which gives the spine the spine. Lucas's aggressive imagination is still very apparent, and the themes of the loyalty, hope and redemption movie resonate. I'm glad Lucas gave up on the idea of ​​making Seventh, Ninth and Ninth Episodes, because this film is a great documentary about a long, fascinating and captivating saga. It's not a perfect but fun movie in the best matinée style.
