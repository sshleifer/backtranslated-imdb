Thelma Ritter stole the photo. I just finished seeing him again. I could not get emotionally into her final stage. He did not receive the Oscar. That's why you do not have to put too much trust in the Oscars. Richard Widmark never had a better part and was perfectly casting like a faulty 3-D human being. Jean Peters was great as a strong, tough girl in her best role ever. And Richard Kiley must have been very good; why else would I hate it like that. Yes, it was hardly taught patriotism; but without her you do not have a movie. Look at their faces! The first three stars did not need much script. I would like to have seen them by making this film without dialogue. If you saw Ray Milland and Rita Gam in "The Thief," maybe you know what I mean. When I was a kid in 1956, on my first trip to NYC, I made my uncle from the Bronx drive us down the street in South Street, looking for number 66. Then I knew Hollywood could not trust her. But I found the evil. I do not ruin the story too much because I hate it when I know what's going on before I see it for me. If you have seen it, there is no need to elucidate. Just that someone reading these comments did not see "Pickup On South Street". You will like it; just do not look for 66 South Street streets in New York City.
