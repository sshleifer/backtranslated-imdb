There is a need for a Serbian familiarity or at least a Balkan to understand and enjoy many of the situations, characters and jokes of Zavet, as well as many other Kusturica films. See, for example, the opening scenes with the remote village in the Serbian mountains with low-tech devices that defend the integrity and lifestyle of the inhabitants, the nostalgia for the good days of communist governance and the younger brother's awakening looking at his teacher nude to the sounds of the Soviet hymn. Kusturica not only tries to get away from the tragic history of Serbia described in his earlier films but creates a whole world of himself in this process. This is not a political movie or an explicit political movie in any case. It's a fun movie first of all. Kusturica creates a set of characters we care about. Music plays an active role in this film just like in all of its other films. His style is direct and grotesque, now what he feels about his characters and we know he wants to feel the same. The space that he develops now mixes history and magic, and the colors seem to be a Douanier Rousseau of modern cinema. There is no perfect movie. The main failure is the length, some changes and shortening would be useful, because at some point the director seems to have exhausted the ideas and the repetitions appear. It's still one of the most exciting, fun, movie moves we've seen lately.
