He is not sure he can call this anti-war film, it shows war on an elite level. These are elite troops who know what they are doing and boast a lot. Even when they are pacifists, they still enjoy the skill level and the defeat of their enemies, even if they oppose peace. The films are slow and fairly rigid, and in many respects they are tainted like war films - more than today's standards, nor body parts that fly like in modern films. It's brutal in other ways, though I see killing on a personal level. This is more of a thoughtful film. Once you start watching, you do not want to lose anything. The thoughts of the men in the movie and their interactions are what the movie means - not a fight in itself or an interesting story. This can be called a triller of war. If you are in war skills, if you are reading or see programs about SAS and so on, Want to look at this movie !!!!! Similar films are The Hill (1965) with Sean Connery, 49 parallel (1941), with an all-star cast, Cliff Robertson, The Naked and the Dead (1958). All are unusual in their own way and show personal warfare. Enjoy!
