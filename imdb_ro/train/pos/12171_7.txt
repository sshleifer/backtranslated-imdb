I was literally preparing to hate this movie, so trust me when I say this movie is worth seeing. Overall, the story and gags are made, but the film has the charm and finesse to eliminate them. The gang where Jason Lee thinks he has crabs and tries not to let his boss / future father-in-law and his colleagues see him scratching is not terribly intelligent, but he sent me into a laughing frenzy. Very few of the film's gangs are headed, but they made me laugh. As I said, the movie has charm and charm can go a long way. <br /> <br /> Characters are also nice. I have to say I want to see the character of James Brolin more, because he was a hoot in the very few scenes he was in. Additionally, I admire any romantic comedy that has the courage not to make the character of the wife (which serves as a hindrance to the plot) a total witch. The character of Selma Blair is hard to deny and there is never a scene to think, "Why did she want to marry her first?" The end is Hollywood-ish, but it could have been more schmaltzy. <br /> <br /> The cast is talented. I did not have a favorable opinion about most of Jason Lee's work. I loved him so much in Kevin Smith's films that I could not feel disappointed that I saw him in these roles. And she never feels comfortable in these roles. Even in this film, he does not look perfectly comfortable, but he contributes with his own two cents and manages effectively each scene. But I still lack my work in independent films. Julia Stiles proves again why she is so enjoyable. Of course, she is a very beautiful girl with a radiant smile that makes me want to faint but also possesses a unique charm and seems to have a good personality. In other words, she shows her beauty inside and out. I do not know the name of the actress, but the woman who plays the drunk grandpa is hilarious. Julie Hagerty also has a small part and is always pleased to look at her, which makes me want her to have got better roles. I loved it so much in Airplane and Lost in America that it is a shame that she does not get the same chances to make her skills. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the horrible trailers and the more terrible recordings of the box office. This is a funny, charming movie. Romantic comedies become so predictable nowadays that it feels like the genre itself is ready to be washed in the toilet, so always see a good one among all these bad apples. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
