Look at the depth of the meaning, leave your logic at the door and spend a lot of time with this "cartoon", totally absurd, fun, manic, funny. MYSTERY MEN is a reference to all the superhero movements you've ever seen, but tiny super-wannabe are so interesting, varied and well-expressed that they are memorable characters themselves. Dark humor, deception, bona fide action, and even a moment or two, combine to make this comic fantasy of scary misses a true winner. The comical talents of the actors who play Mystery Men - including a single mysterious woman - are a perfect foil for Wes Studios as what can only be described as a Yoda bargaining basement, and Geoffrey Rush as one of the smartest walls and charming strangers) villains who have ever walked on the pages of a Dark Horse comic book and on the big screen. Prepare to laugh, cheer and say "huh?" more than once .... Enjoy!
