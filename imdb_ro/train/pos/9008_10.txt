I saw this movie without knowing what it was ... I'm fan of Branagh, even more Shakespeare movies, and at first I just saw it for that ... and I ended up with tears in my eyes, because great, great serenity, values, affection and courageous philosophy about the life of Helena's face. Recommended for people bored with TV programs (at least in Spain).
