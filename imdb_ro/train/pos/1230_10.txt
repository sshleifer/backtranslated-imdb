after seeing this movie for the third time now I think it's Adam's worst movie PUNCH DRUNK LOVE IS LOST Compared to this I have to say that at the end of Dickie when throwing the boat is so funny (the hair is different of his and I like when he flips everyone off.This film should be brought only if a true fan Adam Sandler. The characters are weak compared to his funny movies like Waterboy, which has the same people from him (Peter Dante), who is one of the assassins trying to kill the Australian bird. This film has no depth and a decent story line and deserves to be at the bottom 100
