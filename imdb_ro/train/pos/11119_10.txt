There are so many reasons why we have evaluated our sopranos so much, one of their greatest triumphs being the distribution and character of the building. Each character unfolds more and more every series. Also, each series has a number of different "small time characters" as well as the main ones. A good example of a character (which was only in three episodes) for which you feel is that David's compulsive player played brilliantly by Robert Patrick. Every little detail builds the perfect TV series. The show revolves to the head of the crowd, Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini), who is trying to balance his life of murder with his role as the father of two. The show is not afraid to be bold and powerful with its dialogue and pictures, and that makes it so credible. While Tony leads with Capos Paulie (Tony Sirico) and Silvio (Steve Van Zant), his nephew, Christopher (Michael imperioli), is looking for a promotion. Each episode also presents Tony's family in a way that includes children and his wife soprano carmela (Edie Falco). Besides these problems, his junior soprano (Dominic Chianese) tries to get what he can from Tony's business despite being arrested in home arrest. All the action is complex and powerful, but the two most distinct are: James Gandolfini who is "Tony Soprano". Also, Michael Imperioli, who plays Christopher, represents the younger generation (20-30) in the crime. If David Chase had not created this masterpiece, there might have been no modern television drama, like The Wire and Dexter. So the Sopranos are definitely the films of Godfather, Goodfellas and Pulp of Television
