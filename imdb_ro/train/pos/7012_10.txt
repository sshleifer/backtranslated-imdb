Although a jerk of tears is certainly a "feel good" movie. All the actors were excellent and Will Smith as always does the job and does it well. I could go on, but I chose 10 of the "10" ratings and I told them and probably better than I could. <br /> <br /> But because it must include at least 10 lines to post a comment, I will say that Rosario Dawson was largely unknown to me as a spectator. Her performance was the most enjoyable and I look forward to seeing her in many movies. And this film demonstrates that Will Smith has nothing to prove in terms of his actor's ability.
