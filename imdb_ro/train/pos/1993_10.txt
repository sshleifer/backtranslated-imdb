This is a musical adaptation to Dicken's "Oliver Twist". For the most part, the original story has been maintained, although for the film flow certain subplots (such as the summer it spent recovering from the half brother) are omitted. The biggest difference in film and story is that by the end of the book, Fagin is hanging - a very different end to this musical. This is a kind of music - one whose style and scope have not been matched before or since. Not only are songs often very sound and memorable, but the choreography of the film is a look that must be seen. While in most musicals some people or even a small group are choreographic dances, here numbers often run in hundreds or more. It's really a vision I see and I was lucky enough to see him in the theater when he started and it's one of the oldest childhood memories. I just saw it again a few moments ago, I had to say that the movie has improved over time. Wonderful sets, great actors and chants - is a great treat that is hard not to like. By the way, when I saw the movie again tonight, I was surprised at how tall and feminine Mark Lester's song was for the film. Well, in IMDb's opinion, his singing was called by a girl, and that will surely explain his voice.
