When you read the summary of this film, you may end up thinking it is a strange movie and, in some respects, is Gerard Reve (Jeroen Krabbé) haunted by visions and hallucinations for the primary character of this film. The visions that Gerard see are all (more or less) subtle suggestions about what will happen to him while the story continues and it is very fun for the spectator to try to figure out the symbol used in the film. Despite the use of symbolism and a few suggestions at the end of the film, the film maintains a very high level of emotion and does not get bored for a minute. This is largely due to the great performances of Jeroen Krabbé and Renée Soutendijk (Christine) and the wonderful direction of the whole by Paul Verhoeven. His directing style is clearly visible and it can be said, looking at it from different angles, that "De Vierde Man" is a typical Verhoeven movie. Not only will it be typical of people familiar with its American films due to nudity and graphic violence scenes, but it will also seem typical for people familiar with its Dutch films because of the same things and its talent to tell a great story . When people watch the American movies from Verhoevens, people with a short look might say they have no talent to tell a good story and focus only on blood and sex. That's what some people think, while I think it's a very talented director who tries to send a deeper message to each with each movie. Although not a good film, Hollow Man (his latest American film) is an example that Verhoeven can do more than science fiction films, and companies should have more confidence in it and give him more leading movies. He needs that. Just watch the Dutch movies. Not only does he prove he needs a certain amount of freedom but also has remarkable talent. "De Vierde Man" brought him one step closer to Hollywood and is certainly one of the best. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
