Some people loved "Aristocrats," and others hated him, often walking in the middle. Reactions to Eddie Izzard are not so extreme - if you can deal with a transvestite comedian (who says he likes girls) and has a vocabulary that does, let's say, the sufficient use of the word "f" be a long beep if it is shown on the network television. Many of Izzard's fans are so devoted that they do not see any defects in their performances. On the other hand, I thought this show was sometimes more enjoyable than Izzard's chest, but also often not funny and, in places, absolutely hilarious. He has a way to connect the routine references at the beginning of the broadcast to their subsequent routines. He's not a storyteller. He's not a joke producer. He's not a frenetic fancy like Robin Williams. They play with ideas, some of which work, and some of them - a cable car routine in San Francisco and Alcatraz, for example - are completely inoperative. It has, however, a way to move gracefully through floppy routines and expand those that connect. I gave this performance a 7 and could be convinced to raise it to a 8. But a 10? No way.
