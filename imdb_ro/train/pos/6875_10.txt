When I was chairman of our college caf√©, one of our activities was to review groups and films for student activities. One of the best things to come in 1972 was Groove Tube. The original premise was that Broadway off-off was presented in theaters where television monitors were placed across the audience, so everyone had a great place. The premise was that drafts would change regularly - Saturday Night Live, keeping things fresh. They decided to turn it into a general distribution film. I think the developers said it was the first time Chevy Chase was on the film. Watching him run naked, though the forest was a roar. Like many of the reviews in front of me, it was Saturday the next night before such a thing existed. I strongly recommend this vacuum. I told my son, 13 years old, about Koko, the clown - can not wait to receive a copy!
