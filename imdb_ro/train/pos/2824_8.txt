The debut of Greta Garbo's American film is an analogy of how our lives can be removed from our fate and actions, like in a torrent, which makes us lose some of ourselves. Leonora, a lovable peasant girl, in love with the character of Ricardo Cortez, Don Rafael, landowner. Ricardo is in love with her, but she is too easily influenced by her domineering mother. Leonora ends homeless and travels to Paris where she becomes a famous opera singer and develops her reputation as a free woman. In fact, part of her attitude is bitter about the abandonment of Rafael. She returns home to visit her family and eventually faces Rafael. Surprisingly, no one knows that she is famous at Brunna, and Garbo plays the role of diva with whom she really was and was recognized with an appealing attitude in her subsequent portraits. Ricardo Cortez reminds him of Valentino very much about this part, and he was taken care of as a Valentino clone by MGM, although he never thought he might be in reality and was right. He is credible in a part of sympathy like a mother's poor boy and wants to age realistically but comically at the end of the film. He fails to win Leonora when he returns home and later on when he follows, his courage is undermined. This movie is beautifully shot, with brilliant storm sequences, and the sets describing Spain at that time are authentic looking. There are also some fine side performances by old timers Lucien Littlefield, Tully Marshall and Mack Swain. Although this is a story of lost love and missed chances, I do not think that Leonora and Rafael would have been happy together because she needed a more traditional wife and she was very much a career woman and I do not think she would have been happy in a small village. The end is true for life and does not attract any blow. See this as the American film debut from Garbo and precursor of things to come
