I'm waiting for each new episode, every one re-run with anticipation! The new aspect of the sci-fi created by the Stargate SG-1 is a wonder that I hope will never end it. Combining the past with the future is a new turn that is fascinating to me. Season 9 should be an emotion in itself. I want Richard Dean Anderson to appear more often in the new season because I like his dry spirit as much as his temper in the character of Jack O'Neill. The other characters add their own uniqueness to the show that makes it the winner, the season after the season. Cancel the program in the next three years and make a serious mistake. You also need a bigger role for Asgard - I'm too cool.
