ITALIAN is an amazing film for his time. Stunning shot, with lighting effects that are truly sublime, this is an early gem that clearly reveals REGINALD BARKER to be a pioneering director of D.W. GRIFFITH and MAURICE TOURNEUR. How much control Thomas Ince exercised on production is hard to know, but this film still has extraordinary power. The simple story of an Italian immigrant struggling to keep his life in New York is very moving. The themes of social injustice, vengeance and forgiveness are pertinent today. Using background photos is remarkable, and GEORGE BEBAN's performance is electrifying. What we need now is a very good print transfer to DVD, so we can truly appreciate this early masterpiece of cinema.
