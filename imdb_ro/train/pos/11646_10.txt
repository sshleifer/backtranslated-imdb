This film, though one of the most favored topics of Mexican producers: the extreme life in our cities, has a fun way to put it on display. <br /> <br /> Four of the most prominent Mexican directors in recent times have approached our city's stories, framed in various literary ways, such as farce or satire, which gives us a movie with exaggerated exposure in our country , but narrated in a very different way, which gives it the tone of freshness. <br /> <br /> With little known actors, but who interpret their writing style excellently, each of the directors reflects in stories the ability to identify wherever we are in the world, the ability to laugh at pain and make the feast of sadness. Perhaps for many people in our country the film was not pleased, but I think people in other countries might find it attractive and share the surrealism of the Mexican.
