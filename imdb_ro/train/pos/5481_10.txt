For me, this was more of a wake-up call, and the realization that most of what we see, hear, read, and think more about anything depends on what the media feed on us. This is a classic example of high-level spin physicians who are trying to control the masses through controlled information. It is also an excellent example of how people with a constitution they have freely bought will not be influenced by this media control or any attempt to misinform. Once again, this shows that, at the end of the day, the needs of many will, in fact, exceed the needs of the few. It is also enlightened to see that in a country where no religious civil war is taking place, democracy is not a real hard thing to implement.
