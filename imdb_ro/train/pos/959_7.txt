There are many police dramas that make a round. I'm not sure why. It's probably about the old good and bad base theme. This film has a documentary style as we follow the difficult initiation of Anne, a crude recruiter, into a police squad stationed in the Baltic. No attempt is made to attract the cops. They are indeed on the earth, sometimes painful and unforgiving, Anne, on the other hand, has a soft heart, perhaps a lower understanding of the human condition. Against all rules, sometimes it retains the incriminating information found in strip searches and other investigations. It's not a nice movie. Not one to relax. There is not much feeling of optimism in it. Police seem to be involved in a losing battle. Tomorrow there will be more bashings, more murders, more family breakups, and more distressed children. Let's face it. This is the world we live in. As Anne's days become more intimately involved in the police and the families she is investigating. The only real warmth of the film is that of 12-year-old Benny, a broken family. Anne has her own way to patch. He looks at Benny's theft and tries to help him as he can. I was surprised that he went so far as to seduce Benny's father. I wondered if it was her father or her needs. After all, the film clarifies the fact that it has a desperate need for a partner and for lovers of children. Very well, but not my idea of ​​evening entertainment,
