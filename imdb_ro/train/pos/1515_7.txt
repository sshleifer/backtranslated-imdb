Amicus has approached about half of these horror anthologies in the 1970s, and this, from horror writer Robert Bloch, is one of the best efforts. There are four stories, all worth it, but two - Sweets for Sweet and Crime Method - are distinguished as extremely effective trips in fear. In "Sweets," Christopher Lee plays an impatient widow whose lovely daughter (Chloe Franks) becomes unhappy with her gross negligence and intolerance, so she carves a voodoo doll expressing her dissatisfaction with his methods. Franks is a beautiful figure of malicious evil and offers one of the greatest child shows in a horror film by Martin Stephens in "Innocents". This tranche is highly subtle, and the final revolt, which happens outside of the screen, is a purer horror. The crime method is about a Horror novelist (Denholm Elliott), who is threatened by one of his creations, creepy Dominic. This episode is striking for its simplicity and terror. Dominic may or may not be real, so director Peter Duffell is endeavoring to play with our expectations. Dominic's short shots reflected in a pond or seen as a passing phantasm in a meadow are truly haunting. The original art of the posters, with a skeletal figure that squeezes a tray holding Peter Cushing's head, was a bold boldness for fear-set bettors.
