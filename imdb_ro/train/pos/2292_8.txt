I just saw this Bugs Bunny (the first time he was named here) and cartoons from the ThadBlog site as linked from YouTube. This was Chuck Jones's first time leading "becally wabbit" and as a result, Bugs has a different voice from Mel Blanc than Brooklyn / Bronx we are more familiar with. Actually, in the opinion of Thad, he channeled Jimmy Stewart (his "shy boy" personality since then). Anyway, after Elmer buys his pets, Bugs makes everyone inappropriate, turning the radio out loud, pretending to die after the commander has repeatedly cast him out of the shower and saying, "Turn off the light!" whenever Elmer catches him in his bed. Even with a different voice, the Bug is certainly his own naughty and I laughed blue all the time! According to Thad, there was an extra scene at the end of Elmer, giving him the house of Bugs after passing through him, but he was probably too sad because he suffered a mental defect at that time, so he is just as good that cut scene is lost. Anyway, I strongly recommend Elmer's Rabbit.
