Really touch the story of a recruiting camp in America, where young people are ready for the Vietnam War. The human study has always appealed to me when it comes to war films because it translates personal, subjective opinions on war, against action films against war, where action and technical data are analyzed at the expense of the human factor. <br /> <br /> The film succeeds in making a new spin on an already ancient subject and manages to distance itself from ordinary war films, especially focusing on an anti-hero in terms of the traditional standard. The film focuses on the tragic character of Bozz, who smartly avoids being drawn to the dehumanized war machine and refuses to give up control of his destiny and to fight for something he does not believe in, spending his energy in search of ways to avoid sent abroad for both himself and his comrades and ironically finds his own justified reason for going to war. Perfect irony. The actor is truly exceptional, and documentary photography makes you feel transposed into the film. Also, the film will provide food for thought to loved ones in ordinary war movies or war gaming enthusiasts, hoping to awaken some minds of a generation that fortunately escaped the terror of being elaborated.
