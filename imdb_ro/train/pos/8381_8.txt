I loved this movie since I was little! It's great. However, it may be a bit too much for the average observer if you can not interpret certain subtleties in the movie (for example, the name of our hero is Achilles, and in the last battle between him and Alexander he is shot in a heel with a rocket at just as he was shot in Achilles' mythology in his mythology). This is a small thing that is kind of fun! Anyway, a great movie, a good story, would be worried to see it with the special effects of today! Strangely, Gary Graham had an average success playing in the T.V. Alien Nation. This movie is a fun watch and should be much appreciated!
