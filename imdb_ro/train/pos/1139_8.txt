There are some comedies like this, where almost every line and every character is approaching the limit. This is soooo funny! And he has enough satire there. Sally Field is heading to the field of truly remarkable actors and has a good, if not perfect job with her diva TV during the day. Sometimes her action is just a little wide and over the top, but 90% of her time is a riot! In the same league are Kevin Kline, Robert Downey Jr and Whoopy Goldberg (who, unfortunately, has little to do here). Downey jr can not fully convince himself as a comic and does not have the right to synchronize all the time, but he is fighting his part that is, to be honest, the most ungrateful. But the shining star here is Cathy Moriarty as Celeste, a real whore if there has ever been one with more disgusting secrets (you will see in the absolutely amazing final!). Unfortunately, Elisabeth Shue does not seem to be comfortable enough on her part. Normally, I like Mrs. Shue, but here she acts like a fish in the water and sometimes seems to be in a different movie. But it is not harmful, and for the most part, it is at least appropriate. Otherwise, full of memorable lines and situations, this is a comedy to watch whenever it's on TV or anywhere.
