The extremely grim murder race of Pou-Soi Cheang, director of Home Sweet Home. Besides, he reminded me of Billy Tang's "Run and Kill", though he is not so polished. However, it is a sin of sin, about a Cambodian cameraman, Pang (Edison Chen), who arrives in Hong Kong to kill a lawyer. As he escapes from the scene, he kills police officer Sam Wai, who, to add insult to the wound, is in the middle of a relationship with his dead father, so Sam starts a crazy, obsessive pursuit for Pang, which results nearly a dozen dead bodies and incessant violence. There has to be something in the air lately, because I have not seen so many people who have pulled the pulp apart from each other, as we have done lately. There are painful, ugly things, which is why I'm so partial to it, and applaud her diminishing vibration. It is the visual arrest, and the sound design is very unique. Dramatically, everything rotates down until each character finds him in a world of screaming pain. A subplot involving Pang's attachment to a sexually abused girl adds depth to the story and provokes a fourth surprising act that boasts a delicate act of grotesque surgery.
