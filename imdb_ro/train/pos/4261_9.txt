I adored this movie. Not only because I am a great fan of Moritz Bleibtreu, although he practices all the German films that matter. But also because he is NOT the main actor. Leadership is taken over by Barnaby Metschurat, the only reason she has been watching Julietta since 2001 and who really beats this film on her shoulders. A family moves from Italy to Germany, trying "the German dream" (this is my own invention and ironic ...) of cheap labor in the steel and coal industry. However, they end with the opening of a restaurant, and the journey the movie has to this point is so poetic and at the same time amusing and charming. From this point of view, the story is mainly about the two brothers of this family, Giancarlo (Bleibtreu) and Gigi (Metschurat). Gigi's dream of becoming director is threatened by rivalry with his brother and his mother's determination to return to Italy. What follows is a wonderful and completely neutral look that looks at the life you can form through your choices. Finally, this film does not tell which life (Gigi or Giancarlo) was more successful or more full or more interesting. It only gives us a rewarding look at what must be looking for an identity when two countries and mentalities are involved. and this aspect is not driven by bitterness or contempt for any of the countries, making this film so great for any country dealing with immigration tensions. The fact that director Fatih Akin moved to Germany from Turkey in the 1970s also offers this film a great deal of credibility and emotional precision. The cherry on the cake are fantastic performances of the entire concert, especially Metschurat and - I really have to point out - the little boy playing the young Gigi. Child performance would be hard to follow by almost anyone! Great movie, go see.
