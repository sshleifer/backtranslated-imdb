Kurt Russell is strong and (mostly) silent in this action thriller by Paul Anderson (Event Horizon, Resident Evil.) Placed on a garbage-dump planet, Soldier plays as a cross between Rambo and Shane, with Russell barely speaking the title of character, a "outdone" genetic soldier left to death. The best interpretation of the settlers, including Connie Nielsen, Sean Pertwee and Michael Chiklis, surprisingly harassing, is capable. They spend most of the film being scared by Russell, and the rest of him is running for their lives. Russell's performance is one of the best he ever gave. With almost no say, he conveys emotion, feeling, and grasping his gaze. It's almost a mime performance. When the action sequences give rise to speed, he makes a blow - and he does it in a strong, silent matter - in fact. There are flaws. Jason Scott Lee is brutal as a "superior" genetic soldier. Jason Isaacs makes a good impression of Frank Burns from M * A * S * H ​​as a commanding officer and Gary Busey busts a gut (and almost busts his girdle) as Todd's mentor. This is an underestimated and excellent science fiction film and recommended to all those who want a second visit to the Blade Runner universe - David Webb Peoples, to write both scenarios.
