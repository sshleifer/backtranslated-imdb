Even if you know absolutely nothing about Ireland, you have to love "My Left Foot" (and especially Daniel Day-Lewis performance in it). He plays Christy Brown, affected by cerebral palsy. For this reason, he spent most of his ostracized life. Even when they try to warn people about something, they laugh at it. The light in the dark for him is that he has control over a part of the body: the left foot. He uses this appendage to paint and write poetry, bringing it to prominence. Daniel Day-Lewis and director Jim Sheridan did very well this collaboration and also in a later collaboration: "On behalf of the Father" (but the "Boxer" was useless). "My left foot" can make you feel many ways: sad, hopeful or something else. But in any case, Daniel Day-Lewis gave the performance of a life here. A wonderful movie in every sense.
