this movie is ok if you want a mindless action, a cornice action and a very small plot! The special effects are decent, given that this movie is from the "Event Horizon" folder. The costumes are like a movie in a crazy movie. None of the soldiers speak, so the others tell them what to do. Eventually, it ends like a movie of explosions all over the place. I personally liked Russell in "tango and money" "escape from / New York" and "executive decision." You have to see this movie leaving your mind at the door for an action movie that has no action in brainer!
