Wow. He saw that last night, and I'm still wandering about how good he was. Every character felt so real (though most of them are small and selfish) and the bizarre story - the middle-aged widow begins to crush her daughter's lover - she felt completely convincing. Top performances all year round, but hats at Anne Reid and our Friends in Daniel Craig (the latter happens as the next David Thewlis). And director Roger Michell? This is just as far from Notting Hill as it may be. Thank God. Look at this movie!
