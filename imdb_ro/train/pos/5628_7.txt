After reviewing some of the other comments here, I have a main complaint with this presentation. <br /> <br /> The two primary characters are attractive in their own way - the beautiful "victim", and the beautiful protagonist, obviously "extremely off-center" (if not just "completely upset") - turns into hell-beating, like the other, like a Caucasian Kabuki script. This is fine, and this is, of course, mainly a turn-of-the-story story. I think the director was caught in the desire to display Farrah's well-known and obvious physical attributes. Being dressed in legacy in a slim dress and a series of scenes that present more than necessary for any dramatic effect - While very pleasing to the eyes, they distract attention from the level of the drama's pointy. <br /> <br /> Her roommates are sure to give written and directed performances - yet their skepticism and histrionic buzzing and crying does not sound ade on the basis of Farrah's past experience of this type, the obvious evidence that he came to a space with only the most intentional intent and that he had absolutely no reason to overstate what had happened. But this is a film and a story so convincing so much, despite the director's work.
