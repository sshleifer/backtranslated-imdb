As if the film had no value in itself, it is a great way to get an overview of the novel as a preface to reading it. In the summer of 1968 I saw the movie in New York; who fell in school, I read the book for the first time. Several pleasures in reading the novel reminded me of the scrupulous film in detail. And for better or worse - and now I have read and learned the novel for over three decades - Milo O'Shea is still Leopold Bloom.
