Although the story is basically the usual, and the ending of "surprise" is nothing but a bad joke about the audience, you can see what attracted the good actors in the project-it offers the roles in which the good actors can shine and shine. The film is impeccable - for its time. It was remodeled in 2000 as "Under Suspicion," and if you just want to see a story version (that's what it really deserves), I recommend this last, with Hopkins' current direction, and the more explicit the references to the scroll that the original could only suggest. The end, however, still blows. (** 1/2)
