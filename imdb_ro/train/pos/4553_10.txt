As far as I know, the real guy that the main actor plays, he saw his performance and said it was a remarkable portrayal, I would agree with him. This is a fantastic movie about a talented guy / man with a special part of the body that helps him. Oscar and BAFTA, and Daniel Day-Lewis nominates him for the Golden Globe by playing Christy Brown with a brain paralyzer who spends most of his life on the floor in a wheelchair and carried by his family. He has a special left foot, he can write with him, paint with him and keep things with him. Learn to talk later in the movie, it's good for a guy like him. He also won the Home Alone 2 Oscar, and the Golden Globe nominated Brenda Fricker as Mrs. Brown and BAFTA, winning Ray McAnally as Mr. Brown. He was nominated for Oscar for best director for Jim Sheridan, Best Screenplay, Material Based Medium and Best Picture, Best Actor Award nominee for BAFTA Best Film, Best interpreter and best adapted script. Daniel Day-Lewis was number 85 on "The 100 Greatest Movie Stars," was the number 20 of the top 50 British actors, was the 9th for the UK's final actors and was number 15 in the greatest actor world. 28 on the 50 Great British Movies. Impressive!
