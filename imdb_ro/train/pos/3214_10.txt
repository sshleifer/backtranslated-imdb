I fell in love with this silent act of action. Kurt Russell and only Kurt Russell could have played so well. Riddered from childhood to knowing nothing but war and fight, Todd (Kurt Russell) is thrown on a planet after being overtaken by genetic engineering soldiers. Status is set and another classic action action icon was born - SOLDIER. Not Rambo, not Schwarzenegger, not Bruce Willis, not Mel Gibson, not Jason Statham - Kurt Russell has this role and made it entirely - original, daring and too human. I miss the fact that the sequels have never been made. </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> /www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/
