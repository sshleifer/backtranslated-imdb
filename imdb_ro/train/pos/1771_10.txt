A classic series that should at least be repeated or released on DVD.Billy Toth, after realizing that she was adopted after the death of her parents, embarked on a journey to find her true parents. After different rites, his search culminates in discovering that his father's identity has been stolen and used by a trafficker in Europe! If I remember correctly, the series ended up on the Austrian ski slopes and on a peak race that led to the death of Billy's parents. filmed on location in various destinations around Europe and appeared polished and incredibly well done with some episodes passing through the realms of noir films and murder thriller. The main arc was often eclipsed by the slices of life that Billy had during the years to find the secrets of his mother and father. A class act, but undervalued and forgotten.
