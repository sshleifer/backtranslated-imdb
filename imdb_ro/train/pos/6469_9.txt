This is a very short short of Hal Roach. This is because there are two main reasons: the least of the children, in short, are among the nicest ones ever to have been on the film, and the plot has so many fun and well written elements. Little Rascals, I honestly can not think of a baby more expensive than Spanky at the age of four. Despite the fact that she was rather a younger and less attractive child in recent years, he was only precious here. And placing the little baby carer, even younger children, was not only funny but also tall for the cute factor. After the older children blackmail Spanky into doing terrible babysitting, all sorts of funny chaos breaks out. The bands are quite efficient and well-made for time - with an accidental call, involving a murder and a final scene in which Spanky FINALLY STOPS the control of the little ones, being the most memorable. I have not seen these shorts for several decades and I'm glad I gave her a chance.
