<br /> <br /> I doubt the comments of other commentators for the simple reason that this is a FILM MYSTERY, not a supernatural one! It's not the only movie that has an apparently "supernatural" explanation ("vampires"), but it turns out to be a very thorough one. Other films that come to mind include Edgar Wallace "Before Dawn" and "better known" "Mark of the Vampire". <br /> <br /> The film makes a great job in creating a very "scary" atmosphere, similar to DRACULA, when Renfield meets with Counts on the Castle Scale or MARK OF THE VAMPIRE when the two look through the windows the ruins of the castle and see a "corpse" playing an organ, while the Moon descends with wings! Very surreal! If someone likes these atmospheric (often silent) touches, this film is MUST! Norm Vogel
