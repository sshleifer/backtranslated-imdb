GOODNIGHT MR TOM's meeting on paper makes it seem like we're in a big dose of sick, sick, sick. But talented director Jack Gold is an expert in touching emotions in the right way and, on the other hand, appears as a convincing, profound war-monger with excellent production and lead performance. One of the best, if not the best films of the 1990s, which would have been even greater if it had been released in cinemas. <br /> <br /> Evacuating children to rural towns and villages during the Second World War was of course a common practice, but in the case of a boy he was double here because of a miserable life in the British capital. The horrors of the war on home are not disturbed, and the construction of the film to the end of the neck with blur leaves us with a sense of optimism, despite what has happened before. It is close (but not enough) worthy to compare with the finale for a wonderful life (1946) all, a modern classic.
