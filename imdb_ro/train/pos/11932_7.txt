I saw this movie on TV many years ago and I saw this movie when I took it on tape. I thought this was reasonably well done. It was not the best of all the movies, but it was pretty good. The film has enough talent to inspire many people, especially younger children. The actor was good, Danny Glover leading the cast. The plot line was not very credible, but the script was well written. This movie may also be an avid baseball fan's interest. It does not apply directly to an action sports movie. Apply directly to a beautiful movie that you can watch with your family and find some messages that are hidden in this movie. Generally, the movie was good, but not great. I'm giving a movie on 7/10.
