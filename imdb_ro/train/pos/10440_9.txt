This movie is smart. I mean, more than most of the other films, it goes beyond the least common denominator - stupid people probably will not appreciate it. The story is also based largely on dialogue. It has some parallels lost in translation, although before the sunrise is much brighter, in a less abstract way, and simply much better. The script, the characters and even the slightly surreal atmosphere feel totally realistic. The actors play absolutely wonderful. I rarely saw a movie in which the script and the act melted this together perfectly. The dialogue moves into very personal problems, with the risk of becoming a little overhead. However, it remains on the right side almost all the time, although I found some strange and embarrassing moments. Balancing on this fine line requires highly talented actors. Sometimes it delivers excellent results, and generally this movie is simply amazing! Very, very rarely, is "love" in the films described in a way that they find trustworthy and realistic. Every time it's touched, the result is fantastic. I think the stunning and seemingly endless beauty of the female actress has helped quite a bit in this regard. She still looks amazing in this film after 12 years. This is simply a jewel of a movie that you can not lose. One of the best movies I've seen since the 1990s!
