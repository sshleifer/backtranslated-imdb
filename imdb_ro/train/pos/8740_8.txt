There are wonderful details in Bug's life. Everything is covered. The movie looks great, and the animation is sometimes jawed. The film is not terribly horrible, it is, in principle, a modern approach to Kurosawa Seven Samurai, with bugs only. I really liked the interaction with the characters, and the bad guys in this movie were really bad. It seems Disney usually does his bad kids, cut-out kids. Icons are threatening, and Hopper, the evil man of lead, was a brilliant creation. Check him out.
