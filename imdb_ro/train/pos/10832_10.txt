If you love Deep Purple, you'll enjoy this great movie with Stephen Rea in the lead role. The story is about the most famous rock group of that period in the '70s, Strange Fruits, and they decided to play again together. But, of course, there will be a lot of trouble during their concerts. Jimmy Nail and Bill Nighy are great, and the song "The Flame Still Burned" is perfect. You have to watch her.
