I watched the second part two days ago and today I saw the second part. Of course, the two sides are separate worlds, so I'm a little shaken by everything I've just seen. I felt consumed by the knowledge of the inevitability of Che's death; for me, darkened the whole movie. I suppose that's exactly what Soderbergh wanted to feel, the slow evolution of his death's inevitability. The second part was so slow compared to, again, an inevitability, but in Cuba it was positive, and in Bolivia it was so negative. The policy of the Bolivian movement was just an allusion, but rarely faced didactically. For me, memorable scenes were all at the end of the film: confrontation with the javer and gentler talks with the Bolivian official, where that official asked Che about the failure of the peasants to support their revolution. We did not think that national differences play a role as important as the conflict, Argentinian and Bolivian. I thought Soderbergh did admirably with the inevitable supply problems in a revolutionary struggle; how to get food without antagonizing peasants who do not have enough. I was struck by how hard it was to try something like Che tried. I think everything is in time; there is enough rage against the government to start the movement; in Bolivia did not exist. He made the terrible corundum of the revolutionaries in his letter to Fidel read at the beginning of the film: If not now, when, 50 years from now. A very challenging and well-done film; makes every effort to see it.
