I would like to laugh again as much as when I saw the show for the first time. I've never done it since then. The strange thing is that I wake up as hard after seeing the show again and again. <br /> <br /> Eddie Izzard is cultivated, is disturbing, is a man of the world. He is able to talk about politics and yet does not feel the need to "engage" in political talks. He is above that. I would contrast it with George Carlin, who uses his comedy to try to persuade people about his ideas and does not seem to enjoy enjoying the fun. The funniest man on earth
