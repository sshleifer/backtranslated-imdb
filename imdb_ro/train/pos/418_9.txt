This is a roaring western rip and I have watched it several times and have fun at all levels. However, if after the true facts about such legends as Hickcock, Cody and Calamity Jane, then you look elsewhere after as John Ford suggested, the truth becomes the legend of the legend. The story moves with a rhythm of cracking and there is a great dialogue between Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur, two very visible stars that help make this film. Sharp eyes among you might see Gabby Hayes as the Indian Scout, too, is a very young young man Anthony Quinn making his debut as warrior Cayenne, actually married one of Demilles' daughters in real life. He got into Quinns' character that tells Cooper about Custer's massacre said backwards, the finale is well done, and when role credits fuel the American West with American history. So please give yourself time to watch this Western classic.
