Filmfour's science-fiction film is best seen. Although it needs a huge influence from The Manchurian Candidate and does not offer anything new or original of wisdom; is manipulated with the greatest skill she offers as fresh and inventive, despite being in principle a resumption of a previous film. It is good to know that movies like this are still being made (even if they do not get wide launches), and Cypher is refreshing for this reason. The return turns and returns, which gives it an element of paranoia, and also serves to keep the public on the edge of the chair, trying to figure out the meaning of Cypher's mystery. The plot follows Morgan Sullivan; a bored suburban man who decides to take a job with Digicorp, which involves listening to speeches from several rival companies and recording them for unknown reasons. However, the job is interrupted when he meets a mysterious young woman known as Rita ... This film has a series of white stark backgrounds that give it a very surreal edge and mix well with the apocalyptic images of the future. This gives the film a very weird look that differentiates it from most other films of the same type, with a really close affiliate being Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange. The plot is also very efficient and has character development trends in favor of more stylish and thrilling development. You never know exactly where you are with the plot, which serves to make it even more interesting. The act is largely good, with a largely unknown casting supporting the star team; Jeremy Northam and Lucy Lui. Northam shows a lot of the quiet and discouraged part of the man in the center of the story and he does well with his role. Lucy Lui is an actress who has a resume that does not match her talent but has a look at her that suits only this movie. Cypher is far from perfect because some of the sequences are illogical and sometimes may be inconsistent; but, overall, if you want a new inventive Sci-Fi movie; Cypher is the way to go.
