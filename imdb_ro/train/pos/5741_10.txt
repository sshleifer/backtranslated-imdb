One of my favorite movies I saw at the Seattle preview. Tom Hulce was amazing, unable to express his feelings / thoughts. In fact, I sent Mike Ferrell some donation money to help the film be distributed. It's good. The system says I need more lines, but I do not want to plot plotting. I was in the audience in Seattle with Hulce and director, a writer and Mike Ferrell. They talked about an hour after the end. It's not really a dry eye in the house. Why Hollywood continues to be bad, I do not know. (actually, I know, it's our fault, look what we look at). Well, you get what you pay for boys. Take this and see somebody special. It's a jewel.
