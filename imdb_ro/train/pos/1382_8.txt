Not everything is said in this first excellent feature of CÃ©line Sciamma. Friendship, "the desire to fit", the first sexual feelings ... All this and many others are sublimated by underwater swimming scenes. <br /> <br /> All three girls in the movie try to find and express their personality in a very different way. It is a much less violent approach to understanding the teen years in comparison with, for example, "Thirteen", but a very valuable journey. You have to see and please leave all American cinematic preconceptions at the door. The soundtrack is A +. Good cinema!
