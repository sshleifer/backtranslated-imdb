This is a classic action movie of the '80s, presenting Arnold Schwarzenegger in one of his most memorable roles. Established in a futuristic police state where the government controls everything, including television networks. One of the most popular TV shows is "The Running Man," where convicted criminals are hunted and killed for the entertainment of millions of people. It is created as a gaming show in which the public votes for their favorite "stalkers", trained killers who kill and kill the unhappy "contestants" of the show. Members of the public also win prizes to accurately predict who will be killed by whom. And the host is not interpreted by Richard Dawson of the Feud family, who has the experience of playing to make it fit. When Ben Richards (Arnold) is falsely accused of mass murder, he is forced to play this sadistic game. This movie is full of the classic Arnold one-liners, like its famous "come back" just before entering the arena. And he beats a stalker armed with a flame thrower with "How about a light?" I could go further, but I do not want to destroy the movie. It's funny! Whether it was intentional or not, this movie serves as a great parody of the current reality TV madness. Already there are many programs that show people the pain and humility that lasts for the entertainment of viewers, and even cases in court are televised for their "value of entertainment." Running Man demonstrates what would happen if reality TV hit rock bottom and is a scary picture. We can only hope that networks have the common sense not to leave that far. Generally, this is a fun movie and I recommend it. 9 out of 10!
