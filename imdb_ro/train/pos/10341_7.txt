A comedy in the style of true scream of the mid-1970s, this movie was a HUGE hit for about 5 minutes and disappeared from the face of the earth. I am always amazed at some comedy films that are a big one-week release and then disappear: ANXIETY OF THE SEA, THE BETTER DETECTIVE, THE BLACK BIRD, DO NOT SEE THERE ARE NOW ONLY ......... and do not have no profile today. NORMAN was the comedy of the moon in 1976, and everyone seemed to see, laugh, and never say anything. Recognized because he was shot on a video tape and transferred to the movie, an experiment at the time, NORMAN is a wrongly politically incorrect wardrobe, hitting the farce that the Farrelly Brothers should look at today. If he had done it first, there would be no complaint about his content and inclined either. It is very funny and YES very rude and hilarious, all wrong. As it should be. Actually, as a 1976 groovy movie, with all the colors and horror clothes, it actually works better today.
