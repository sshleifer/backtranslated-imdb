I have not seen the movie yet, but I can not wait to see it! It looks very interesting and inspiring. It was one of the most interesting trailers I've ever seen: the questions they really asked me stopped and they made me think that the unique approach to boxing sport as a metaphor for "battle inside "... thank God is someone hitting another angle with the boxing thing. This film looks so fresh and smart. And the actor is very hot. I particularly liked the short clip with the Rocky movie actor, really smart. I thought the selected theme - overcoming childhood traumas and traumas - is timeless, and God knows that many people need it. Bring it.
