The beautiful and elegant British pilot George Taylor (a solid portrait of Guiseppe Pambieri) is beaten by thieves after a wild night in Hong Kong. George meets and falls in love with Dr. Emy Wong sweet and virginal (a beautiful and charming interpretation of the wonderful Chai Lee). George recovers his health and returns to work. When Emy fails to hear George for a long time, she gives up her desperation and becomes a prostitute. While the director / co-writer Bitto Albertini really offers a satisfying amount of tasteful and expected male nudity, this film is nothing more than a routine habit in the boring. Instead, it is a surprisingly thoughtful, emotional and tragic story of love between two well-drawn and very appealing characters (Chai like Emy Wong is particularly radiant and daring). The image begins with bubbles and cheerfulness, but the tone changes radically in a more bleak and harsh state about two-thirds of the way. Emy's descent into vices after she falsely assumes that George abandoned her is bleak and troublesome; until the end of the remarkable surprise of sad and uncomfortable. Granted, the narrative is certainly melodramatic, but never too bad or frightening. Moreover, sexual scenes are quite tasty and even erotic. The notorious Italian porn star Ilona Staller has a beautiful part of considerable support as George's jealous and uninhibited secretary, Helen Miller. Guido Mancori's polished cinema offers many extraordinary pictures of exotic locations. Nico Fidenco has a fantastic and is an amazing performance at the side of the pitch. It is worth looking for those looking for something different.
