I do not understand why the reviews of this movie are so universal, unless I'm talking about it. I felt sorry, brilliant, twisted and sophisticated psychologically. You will not go deeper into the mind of a criminalized psychopath in a Hollywood movie than that. It has layers in layers, stone-shaded, and a plot that guards you even after it's over. People have to go over the fact that Sharon Stone is 48 years old and that Michael Douglas is not in this respect. I predict that this movie will be a huge hit on DVD once people see for themselves and stop paying attention to professional revisionists who have failed. Give her a chance, you might be glad you did!
