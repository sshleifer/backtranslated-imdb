Okay, let's face it. this is a terrible movie. Crying (as it is) is horrible, horrible. But the film was made for one reason and for one reason, like all these terrible movies Mario Lanza ... just to hear the voice of the star, in this case, Pavarotti in the foreground. Okay, maybe the Lanza movies were also an excuse for him to hit women, but this movie is about Luciano's hearing. But it's worth watching the movie. A great, locked-up opera star is confronted with his fears, finds humility and love along the way, and heals numerous numbers of blows. I have to admit I'm biased on several levels. I am Italian. I'm a big fan of Pavarotti (is there something about Pavarotti that is not big, including the base of his fans?). And when I first saw this movie, I was walking on my own, seeing the height and depth of the possibilities of life and falling in love for the first time. Just as terrible as this movie, the beautiful voice and memories are enough to make me breathe deeply and love again. Yeah, it's terrible and terrible. But the voice is immortal and without time, and the voice is what it is. So I give this movie a high rating, hoping that someone who has never heard Pavarotti ever listen to, will look and enjoy a new level of music and love, especially since he is now gone. Like Italian foods you have never tried, try! You may be pleasantly surprised, like a lover of Luciano or in the freshness of Pavarotti.
