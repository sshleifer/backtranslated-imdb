For anyone who judged others at the first meeting, here is the perfect tutorial on the depth of character. The old lady has a soft, thoughtful heart - and needs new friends. The beaten, insecure, daring person who makes inappropriate and uncomfortable comments - sees deep into your soul and has pure love for all. The cold, good, neglected wife has a boiling passion and can be boiled at any time - given the right setting. The perfect beauty - rich, sweet, party, watched by crowds - wants peace, quiet and love without possessiveness. <br /> <br /> Taking the time to look beyond the surface, you will find treasures in everyday life, from the least expected sources. All that is needed is patience and a touch of charm.
