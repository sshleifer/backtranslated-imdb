I like this movie and is a wonderful example of family danger, a romantic love story and a plot full of sad story. Everything was so perfect and great about this movie. It was a great mix of actors and actresses, and with some laughs and weeping of this movie it is worth winning numerous awards. With the mention of a beautiful script, and though I would refer this film to The Notebook and The Stone Stone, it was a bit more cunning, sad and shining than those movies. The evening tells of a love affair between an old woman dreaming of her younger years and her two daughters remain next to her while she is not good. The back story is so powerful and wonderful, I'd be sitting on the edge of the chair. You will really know all the characters and, to the end, I wanted to see everything again. This is an amazingly sad and action-packed and planned film that is really unique and should be seen by all for how wonderful it really is. All the shows are stunning, and the movie captures your attention from the very beginning and never lets you go. I liked it and I was glad I saw it was really an amazing movie ...
