The sopranos are remarkable as an aerial and dynamic exploration of American life, and American experience is shaped and defined by money. By setting up the story in the environment, David Chase eliminates all the barriers to a defeat, low ground and a paradoxical deconstruction of the postmodern era. <br /> <br /> Each character is a facet of the American industry. Tony Soprano exemplifies rigid rigidity of work, broken between family duty and the need to keep his business on a uniform pouch. The convergence of these two things is the imperative that keeps the story ahead. The characters of Christopher, Paulie, and Bobby reflect faithful believers - but who do it themselves, present in every enterprise that trusts in necessity, not in merit. With Ralph's character, Joe Pantoliano develops a brilliant interpretation of the charismatic psychopath, a twisted businessman who blooms violence, is traditionally surpassed by his amazing gaining power. And Dominic Chianese is the ultimate symbol of the old old guard, who preserves power through established relationships, and the need for the ascendant and the comrades to defy. Although abrasive and sometimes disturbing, the Sopranos have earned their role as final television drama. <br /> <br /> PS A good accompaniment for Chase's series would be The Shield, another violent drama that manages to make the most ugly characters interesting.
