California came out in 1993, as well as 3 of the 4 characters who came and reached the fame levels they now possess in 2006. This is a beautiful psychological thriller that should appeal to all fans of David Duchovny in his dry and intelligent cause of narratives that find his ways in his work, as in most of his X-episode, on "Play God" and "Red Shoes". People who have been hit by Brad Pitt's heavy southern accent and the characters of Juliette Lewis have not spent much time in the south. For every "Brian and Carrie" in the south, there is an "Adele and Early" and in 2006, this is the real horror of this film. Besides, I think the movie was written with a cult movie intention - like Carrie's photo - is not suitable for mass consumption. But if you have a copy of this in your personal library, I think it says something positive about your taste for strange movies.
