I do not think it was a challenge for Richard Harris. This was an uncomplicated but interesting plot. It's a good movie to watch when you do not want to think too much, you just want to tell a simple story. The Canadian landscape was astonishing. Beautiful pictures of cadres made the image worth seeing.
