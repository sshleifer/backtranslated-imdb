Goebbels's motivation in support was not explored. Following Stalingrad, the Reich decided to go for "total war". This is mentioned in the film. Part of this was to use women in the war effort, which Germany has not done so much to date. A massacre of SS women would have faced Goebbels with a massive public relations disaster. His preference was to make the issue disappear as quietly as possible, on the basis that Jewish people could always be rounded up later. I understand that most survived the war. Another problem was that Berlin "Red" was never very enthusiastic behind the Nazi cause and should be treated with caution. Again, a massacre of women could have cost the Nazis what mediocre support they had in their capital. Interestingly, most SS uniforms showed stains showing that the men who were wearing them were not of German nationality but came from German origins in other countries such as Lithuania or Latvia
