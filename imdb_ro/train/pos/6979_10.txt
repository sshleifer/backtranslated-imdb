This is a real character and drama driven by the story, at a level that is ashamed of most of what we see on TV at mo. I was impressed from the very beginning. Do not be deceived if you are not a scientist (like me ...) This could happen on earth, the fact that in another galaxy just makes the show more interesting. there are no spacecraft or laser weapons (there is never yet). So far I have seen up to s01 e04 and I caught up and wondered what would happen next because there are so many possibilities. <br /> <br /> The cast piece rotates with passionate. Eric stoltz is particularly strong. This show is really lonely, it does not matter if you have seen or not BSG, in fact they are very different. I read some negative reviews from science fiction films that expected less drama and more foreigners and rays, but I would say we ignore them. This is a very good start to a show. Hopefully I can not do it after 1 or 2 seasons, as it would normally do with good shows these days.
