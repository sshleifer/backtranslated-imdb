The stories in this video are very fun, and worth to be forgotten! The first refers to a young couple who was pushed into the woods by two injured, with a large but unexplainable twist at the end. The seonon is the best of the batch, and alone makes it worthwhile watching - A man is attacked by a dog he is afraid of being sick - He finds shelter in what seems to be a hospital but he finds out there is exactly what they seem to be ...... High twisted at the end, and this episode alone scores 10/10! If the others would get up with it, it would get 10/10! The third is the weakest of the bouquet - A girl meets some guys and has wild sex! It seems he has no use for the story to the end with a little twist, but he is spoiled by the first awful part! It's never a great movie that will not make you wrong at all! Well worth a rental!
