Eyeliner was worn nearly 6,000 years ago in Egypt. Really not as much as a stretch to be around in the 12th century. I also did not realize the series flopped. Is there a second broadcast season now is not there? It's amazing for me when the comments are made by those who are either poorly informed or do not see the show at all. It's a waste of space on the panels and the time of others. The first show of the series may have been a bit painful because the distribution has started to drop, but this is to be expected from any show. The rest of the first season is excellent. I can not wait to start the second season in the United States.
