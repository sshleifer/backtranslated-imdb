A very harsh and sad story of a part of the history of the World War, which most of us in the United States. they never had an idea. I would love to be this on the video. It was shown only on t.v. once, as far as I know, back in 89 or 90. I asked around this movie, and most video stores do not even know about it. Big actresses around, I want to see again. Top notch series.
