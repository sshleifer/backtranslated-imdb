I have always wondered what happened to that magical feeling that the old movies in Slovenia seemed to be ... Well, over time, I wondered if that feeling was just nostalgia. Or did that "sentiment" decide to pack their bags and say "goodbye" somewhere in the middle of our cinematic history and then never come back? Or did she do it? Because for me it was the first time I saw Ekspres, Ekspres. And it was the old ego again. There are three qualities of this film that make it somewhat unique and the way it looks and enjoys - the smooth flow of the story, the warmth of colors, and what I have most appreciated - the lack of excessive use of verbal communication consider at least other Slovenian scenarios (not only)). There is no use for words when you can understand well (yes, or better) by other means in use. Look at Bakovic and Cerar. Uh. <br /> <br /> So with so many words, I would have recommended everyone, Ekspres, Ekspres, as a Slovenian movie, no matter what you heard about Slovenian movies (if you've ever heard anything, that e ...) Oh, and that scene, where Bakovic is dancing Vivaldi's music ... A treaty. <br /> <br /> Rejoice. Look.
