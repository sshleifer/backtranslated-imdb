The last hunt is the classic Western Hollywood forgetting. The theme of genocide by the buffalo breeding is present in other films, but never so wild. Robert Taylor's role as possessed buffalo and Indian killer is his best performance. In the 1950s your mother gave up you and your friends at Sternday, usually with Western comedy or comedy. But it was wrong now and then to let a young man watch psycho-dramas like The Searchers and The Last Hunt. Let the children wait a few years before exposing them to sexually repelled sadism and intense racial hatred. Why did not my mother censor these movies? Because they featured "safe" Hollywood stars like Taylor and John Wayne. But the climatic scene in The Last Hunt is as frightening as Vincent Price's mutation in The Fly. The white buffalo mythology, part of the texture of this film, was later destroyed by other films including The White Buffalo, with Charles Bronson as Wild Bill Hickock. The laugh here is that Bronson used to play Indians. Today, a large bison herd resides in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. In winter, hunger forces animals outside the park in Montana, where they are sometimes harvested by the Indian Indians in Idaho under a US treaty right before Lincoln's presidency. Linclon signed the act of the Congress that authorized the mainland railways and began cutting the buffaloes.
