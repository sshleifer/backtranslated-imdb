I did not expect the highest level of shooting with Joel Schumacher who led him, so I was surprised that TIGERLAND was not a complete loss of time. In the technique, it is often derived from PRIVATE RYAN SAVING by working on the blurry camera, fat photographs, the film running occasionally as if jumping a pinion - all those techniques used by Speilberg to make the film look more realistic, but in the The trace was more distracting than anything else. <br /> <br /> But unlike the rescue of PRIVATE RYAN, the emotional component was not as weak as the characters in this film looked more like real people and the story less controversial, not so ending in the banner American (Speilberg becomes a "F" in subtlety). Along with the first section of Kubrick's FULL METAL JACKET, this is the most realistic portrait of the boot camp I've seen in a movie and that's why I think it's worth watching. <br /> <br /> It's not a great movie, it's not a bad movie either.
