When I was eight years old I always watched films and televisions that did not have to, and that was one of them. <br /> <br /> It's one of my favorite movies of all time and it has to be the funniest movie I've ever seen in my life, the acting is excellent, they do not make comedies like that (movies that are really funny and make you laugh without resorting to excrement or a type of body fluid that causes vomiting, as in those retarded films by Judd Apatow with unfortunate stars like Seth Rogen, barf). This film is a classic with actors who can actually act and deserve all the distinctions.
