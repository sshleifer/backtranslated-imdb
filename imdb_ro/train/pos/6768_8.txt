One of my favorite shows in the '80s. After the first season, he started to go down when they decided to add Jean Bruce Scott to the cast. Deborah Pratt was great and it was fun to see her and Ernest Borgnine's character go to him with each other. The last episode in which he appeared was one of my favorites in the second season. Unfortunately, in those days, blacks did not last long for television shows. Some of the episodes of the second season, if it was good, but the third season was more about human characters than Airwolf and was only presented at almost the end of the show. When he went to the US it was disgusting!
