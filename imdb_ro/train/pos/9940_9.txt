This series of animated television is simply the best way for children to learn how the human body works. Yes, this is biology, but they will never say it is. I think this is the best part of this flow of "educational cartoons". I remember that you can find small books and a plastic body in several parts: skin, skeleton and, of course, organs. In the same stream, you will find: "Il Ã©tait une fois l'espace" (about space and exploration), which links human history from the Big Bang to the 20th century. but that it is more a fiction than a description of reality, because it takes place in the future.
