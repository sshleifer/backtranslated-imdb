1958. Sleeping small town in southern Clarksburg. The defeated Sheriff Roy Childress (Vic Morrow, appealing in an abominable form) turns very fast in speed, forcing these criminals from a rock to their premature death on a particularly dangerous stretch. Childress meets his match when Michael McCord (an excellent and fearless portrait of Martin Sheen) shows up in the city in his breathtaking car with the specific intention of avenging the death of his brother (Sheen's real-life brother Joe Estevez in a short cameo). Director Richard T. Heffron, who works from an intriguing and intriguing scenario by Richard Compton (the same guy who has directed the jewels of "Welcome Home, Soldier Boys" and "Macon County Line"), tells the story a brisk rhythm, creates an easy arrangement of the 50-year period, and the skillful man eats a lot of suspense in the tense game of spirit and wills between Childress and McCord. The uniform distribution of the film helps a lot: Sheen radiates a rebellious vibe James Deanesque in the lead role, Morrow uses the most of his bad guy, plus the excellent performance of supporting Michelle Phillips as a cute maid Maggie, Stuart Margolin a friend Nick Nolte, Buzz Stafford's companion, Gary Morgan in the role of Buzz, Buzz Lyle's younger brother, Janit Baldwin as Sissy, Sassy, ​​Britt Leach, Johnny and Frederic Downs, Judge JA Prostitute. Climate confrontation between Childress and McCord is truly impressive, impulsive, scary. Terry K. Meade, sharp cinema, well-drawn characters (for example, Childress became obsessed with bruised speeders after the wife and child were killed in a fatal blow and an incident occurred), the groovy score syncopated by Luchi De Jesus and the beautiful mountain scenery, all further enhance the overall sound quality of this top-notch television winner.
