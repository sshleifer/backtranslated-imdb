I watched this movie many years ago and I have been looking for it since then, in my opinion, although very brutal, it is very educative about what the future can hold, I liked the film and to this day the rate is very bad to all who disagree but a movie should always be judged everywhere there and, in my opinion, its great let go of all the children of cloning and test tubes that are happening today that are new to To judge this movie, it can be a dramatized event of what it is to become, but there you go. All the horrors of today are attracted so far even laugh, but that makes me think and scare me like a mother And if I'm desperate, after watching you on this movie, I'd think I'm sorry about twice, but I love the movie to make your mind do not watch the movie - just learn the story and ask how far you go for a baby?
