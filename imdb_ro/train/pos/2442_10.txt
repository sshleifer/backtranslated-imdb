This film is about a part of Ireland that Americans do not normally see, the narrow part of the injured religion of "the most friendly race in the world." The film, by admitting the inhabitants of Fethard, who are old enough to remember the events, is quite precise (though they insist that filmmakers have invented some of the more violent scenes just to refresh their action). > <br /> The film was very unpopular in Ireland because it represented the Catholic Church in a bad light, but the simple fact is that Catholic church representatives * organized * minority vetts (before the Protestants were Jews). <br /> <br /> The film is a fascinating insight into the whole issue of religion in Ireland
