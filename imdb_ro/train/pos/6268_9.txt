Carter Wong plays a noble hero looking for a healing book that causes him to seek his revenge! Pacing is good in this movie and there are many fighting scenes to keep the movie. The flying guillotines look bad and the main villain has no problem using them. Though the story is not strong, the action is fun and draws you to the top end (which I felt it might have continued). Campy and darkness, that's great ol skool kung fu !!
