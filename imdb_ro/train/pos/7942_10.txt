Giallo fans, rarely looking for this movie. It is well written and full of all sorts of normal low lives that populate these films. I do not want to give anything, so I will not say anything about the plot. The entire movie creates a very bizarre atmosphere and you do not know what to expect or to suspect. Recommended! The only place I've seen to get this movie in English is from European Trash Cinema for $ 15.
