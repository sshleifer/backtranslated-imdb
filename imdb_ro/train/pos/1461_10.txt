The film explores the blatant exploitation of the Chinese worker - generally feminine - who has obtained images from the Chinese businessman who shares his extraordinary and delusive point of view, his American counterpart, also untouchable and delusional, of the oppressed workers who have a voice, of course, drunk Americans wearing beads necklaces, celebrating in New Orleans. <br /> <br /> The brightness of hope comes when some Americans are actually indignant that people who make their beaded necklaces have been paid as $ 0.10 per hour to do so. You also have the feeling that workers may have the chance to get away from work in bead factories, but they will probably do so when they are fed with the treatment of popular punishment with the owner of the plant and / or become too exhausted to he worked for 20 hours a day of hard work. I wondered where these necklaces came from, without realizing how exhausting and hard it would be to make them. I truly appreciate this film because it describes the impact of American indulgence on what we consider to be relatively harmless in our society towards the peoples of the rest of the world. Honorable mention refers to Wal-Mart. It's simply amazing. And clearly, just the tip of the iceberg!
