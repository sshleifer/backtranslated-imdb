Gojoe is part of a new wave of Japanese cinemas, taking very creative executives, editors and photographers and working on historical themes, which the Japanese call "vintage pieces." Gojoe is extremely creative in terms of color, photography and editing. Brilliant, even. The new wave of Samurai Japanese films allows a glimpse into the traditional beliefs in shamanism, demons and occult powers, which were certainly part of ancient culture, but which were not really explored in the samurai epochs of Kurosawa or the Zaitochi series. Another good example of this genre is Onmyoji (2001). I would like director Sogo Ichii to be one of the most exciting and creative of the new Japanese directors. Other recent Japanese songs that I would highly recommend include Samurai from Twilight at Yomada (2002) and Zatoichi de Shintaro Katsu: The Swordsman Blind (2003).
