This movie is humorous, charming and easy becoming a favorite for those who enjoy easy entertainment. Hollywood is a tough place for serious history lessons, so I simply accept that as such. Bing, in his usual inimitable style, behaves quite well as the blacksmith, Hank Martin, who accidentally is transported back to another age, King Arthur's time. The beauty of Rhonda Fleming is breathtaking as Alisande or Sandy, the subject of Hank's affections, though he is engaged to Sir Lancelot, courageous and formidable, played by Henry Wilcoxon. I really like that episode when King Arthur (Cedric Hardwicke), Sir Sagramore (Wm. Bendix) and Hank (Bing Crosby) are dressed in ragged clothes and go on the big road with their backpacks to experience the kingdom first row. King Arthur's comment, "I say, we are not alone," giving him a good scratch, is one of those hilarious moments of the film. William Bendix's portrait is incredibly ridiculous, not to mention his attempts to be weird "you Olde English." <br /> <br /> The story is not deep, but it is well done in my opinion and I like it more every time I see it. It is also a great family entertainment. <br /> <br />
