Ok, first, ignore the last person's review. They admit they fell asleep through it, so no wonder they did not understand what was going on! As the thriller / horror goes, this movie is not too bad, it is certainly very traceable. Even in the opening scenes you will get a general idea of ​​exactly what will be the cause of all the madness that follows and you end up at the end you will prove well-cleared. I liked this movie, it was pretty weird sometimes and the old movies went it was acceptable. Great to watch late at night! I give him a generous 7 out of 10.
