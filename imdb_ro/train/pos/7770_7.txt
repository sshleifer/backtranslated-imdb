"Written by Wind" is Douglas Sirk's melody. Douglas Sirk was rediscovered by "Cahiers du Cinema", Fassbinder, etc. who have welcomed him as a director - I think it is because of the sophistication of his cinema - "Written on the Wind" offers colorful images and superb decorations. But I wonder: is this movie enough? The act in "Written on the Wind" varies from weak to fair (with the exception of Robert Stack - he is convincing as a weak and spoiled playboy). Lauren Bacall, normally a strong presence on the screen, is mistaken in this movie. Dorothy Malone as seductive, caring "fatal females" is ok but does not have the force for the role. Rock Hudson is efficient but vapid. The land has very interesting ingredients. The main characters are: A rigid patriarch Alice Kyle (Robert Stack) (never loved by his disappointed father), his frustrated and nymphomaniac daughter Marylee (Dorothy Malone) Lucy (Lauren Bacall) wife of princes, former secretary and now married to Kyle <br /> <br /> Mitch (Rock Hudson) - brought along with Kyle and beloved patriarch. <br /> <br /> Secrets beyond the door, a triangle of love, frustration, fists, laughter, death, etc. - when I read the story summary on the back cover of the DVD, I thought I was in the treat. My mistake! Why? I will try to explain: "Written in the wind" takes seriously and tries to tell a dramatic story. As I said before, the act is generally not good enough - the intensity is missing. There are many strong scenarios in the story, but actors do an effective job. I think maybe with Italian or Spanish actors those scenes would have been fully explored - it would end up (for us) in an explosion of laughter or tears. What remains for us is Douglas Sirk's beautiful cinematography. For me this is not enough. If you want to enjoy a good melody, check out "Aventurera".
