I have seen this film many times and for my life, I do not understand why some people compare it to BABE. This film does not refer to the secret life of all the animals that speak secretly. Instead, it is a parrot who learns to speak to help his owner, a little girl with a serious stammer, overcome his speech impediment only to be separated from her in a rooted heart scene. Then the big journey begins. Paulie, the parrot, is trying to find a great friend, Marie. On the way, he meets some wonderful people and many ugly people. He falls in love with a parrot and loses it. He becomes conned in a life of murder and then captured by an evil scientist who wants to exploit it. He tells his story to a lab-drunken laborer who agrees to help him escape and find his beloved Marie. Tony Shaloub shines like Janitor who has an open mind and a big heart and who decides to help Paulie despite the risks. Jay Mohr plays the voice of the Parrot and one of the secret characters he has met. It is a suggestive language, but this movie is suitable for most children and even more if parents join fun and watch. It's a wonderful, intelligent, epic animal-adventure story and finally a great love story about a bird and a little girl. Marie's quest ends with a pretty unexpected surprise for most people who do not know much about parrots. Children who saw Parrot Green Green Parks in Los Angeles and Pasadena will especially benefit from seeing this film and understanding that birds, especially Parrots, are not disposable pets. All children everywhere will see that pets form themselves deep attachments and that the love and loyalty of a dog or a parrot is a gift of price. <br /> <br /> So do not BABE here, more an incredible twisted journey. Enjoy and try not to break through the sad parts.
