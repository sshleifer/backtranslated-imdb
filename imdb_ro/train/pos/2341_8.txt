This is really a funny show, made in a creepy way, like a Tim Burton movie. It's worth a look, because it's more creative than most of the shows this season. Best is not a "reality" show. I wonder why the viewing public is so prepared to accept such shows (who do not have creativity) and ignore great shows like that, which actually have a creative inclination. While some condemn the premise, I think it is very unusual. Much more enjoyable than "Ghost Whisperer" and "Medium". I think it's the funniest thing on the tube, since "My Name is Earl". Oh, and the narrative and the music are great. If you like the shows that are a bit down the beat, I'd recommend it. It's not as strange as the Twin Peaks, but it has a serious inclination.
