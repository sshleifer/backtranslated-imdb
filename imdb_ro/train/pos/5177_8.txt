I saw this last night after I've never seen him for years. It's really a fun movie, with lots of faces that you did not know they were in it. Arkin shines like always. Check it out; you will not be disappointed. By the way, it was released only on DVD and contrary to its packaging, it is widescreen. The transfer is pretty weak, but at least the WHOLE movie is visible. ;-)
