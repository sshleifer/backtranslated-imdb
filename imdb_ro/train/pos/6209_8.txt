When I heard for the first time that Hal Hartley made a follow-up to Henry Fool, I was delighted (a few years ago he was a personal favorite) and then carefully when I heard he was related to terrorism. I just saw it, but I was surprised to find that it worked, being a completely different film from Henry Fool. The script and the direction were both dead and the act was superb ... especially Kudos goes to Hartley for the practical reassembly of the entire distribution, even to Henry's son, which was only four original. As I said, this movie is completely different from the first one, but it works: I reconciled with the change of tone and subject with the fact that it has been 10 years and the characters have been in very different situations since the first movie ended. In this case, an unexpected adventure happens ... and that's all I'll give away ... not to mention that I'll have to see it again to really understand what's going on and who's passing the double. Although it was definitely one of the best movies I've seen in a while, it suffers like a lot of sequels with its end because it looks like Hartley is planning a third now and the movie lets you hang. I'll be sure to buy my tickets for the third part ("Henry Grim"?) In 2017.
