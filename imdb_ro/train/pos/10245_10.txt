this was my personal favorite when I was young, he had everything great with children's movies ... 90 loved dinosaurs, cute children, eccentric villain and some great songs (and not the typical mermaid / beauty and the songs of the type animal, but those that are attractive for fun)! I ran again in this recent film and still love it as much as ever! I recommend that everybody of every age can see this movie, and I certainly think it should be introduced to younger generations! I'm not sorry about the most informative, I'm in a hurry somehow ... just pray, believe me. everyone who goes against this movie kills their inner child!
