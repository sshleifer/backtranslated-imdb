It was really a great movie. I liked Dennis Quaid and the whole baseball team. Jay Hernandez is also a very pleasant actor who is very pleased to look. The chemistry the team once had it was spectacular, it just shows what you can do when the minds unite as one with one purpose. This team has returned from the edge, having several seasons lost to win almost everything. I like movies as they really are really inspired. In addition, Dennis Quaid's character occupies a place in the main leagues. You can not do anything, but the root for this guy. It seems that when someone should do something, they will. Things just happen to fall in and make everything clickable. Based on a true story, this movie will make you think that "nothing is impossible".
