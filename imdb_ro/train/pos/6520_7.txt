The original DeMille film was made in 1938 with Frederic March. A very good movie. Hollywood's love of remake brings us a pretty interesting film with Yul Brynner. Of course, he was brilliant, almost seemed to be in all his films. Charlton Heston as Andrew Jackson was a stroke of genius. However, the film tended to get a bit longer in places. It does not move to the rhythm of the 1938 version. However, it is a fun movie that should be seen at least once.
