This is one of my favorite kung-fu films and is considered one of the most appreciated Shaw brothers in the late 1970s. The intrigue is interesting and contouring, the characters are cool each with their own style - frog, snake, lizard, etc. The action is limited compared to other Chang Cheh / Venoms movies but what is there is interesting with different kung-fu styles on displays from different characters. I recommend this movie to those who believe that all Shaw brothers, especially Chang Cheh's films are the same, most of their films usually focus on the 10 tigers and Shaolin vs. Manchu conflicts. This film is breath of fresh air in comparison.
