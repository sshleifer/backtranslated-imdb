A beautiful and moving film that deserves a wider view than is possible to happen. Semra Turan plays Aicha, a second generation Turkish immigrant, who is trying to break the mold. Not even at home with the moderate conservative Muslim family, nor with her liberal Danish friends, Aicha's martial arts experience becomes a struggle to find and have the power to be whoever wants to be despite family and friends . Natasha Arthy's director succeeds in balancing introspection and narrative so that it has depth without becoming a philosophical weighted discourse, and relying on Xian Gao's choreography skills is paid in spectacular battle sequences . In the end, however, Semra Turan's stunning debut performance offers this film spirit. Rarely charisma and the necessary martial arts skills are complimented by the heart to make her credible personal drama. Well, worth your while.
