This is one of my favorite movies over time, and while it can move too slowly for some, it's good to see. A corporate lawyer (Richard Chamberlain) is shot in a case involving the "city" Aborigine, and this is not an ordinary case. Okay, a man died, but it was not a normal killing. Also, lately there has been more rain than the average, and the atmosphere of most of the film is somewhat claustrophobic and oppressive. Aborigines keep a secret and refuse to pour the beans. This has much to do with white men who make assumptions about "City" vs. The "Tribes" of the Aborigines and, of course, no Abo in the big city would practice tribal modes. Uh huh. Chamberlain has strange dreams and is somehow the key to what's going on, although it does not matter how many times I've seen it, I can not really understand the exact link. This is a very dizzying and creepy film and is an excellent example of Peter Weir's ability to create tension from nothing. The end is a little bit ambiguous, but I literally take it, it is the easiest exit and the most frightening. 10 out of 10 and highly recommended.
