Eddie Izzard is not a comedy genius, and Eddie is the best. His material is extremely witty and hilarious, and his delivery is one of the best testimonies on stage. Instead of insulting the intelligence of the public, he relies on it to attract humor from the preferences of his cabinet, Hitler, the landing of the moon and the British. With so much memorable laughter, one can only help repeat some of his lines. Moreover, "Do you have a flag?" should be considered one of the funniest lines ever delivered in a standup routine. Every fan of the top standup notch comedy must see "Dress to Kill". By far the best British comedian I've ever seen, Eddie Izzard fought for the success of the live scene. However, his lack of commercial success in the film should not indicate how talented he really is. "Dress to Kill" is a treasure, one that fortunately has found its way to the home movie and may and should enjoy again and again.
