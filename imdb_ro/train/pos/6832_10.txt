Beautiful film, pure Cassavetes style. Gow Rowland offers a stunning performance of a declining actress, dealing with success, aging, loneliness ... and alcoholism. Trying to get rid of their own subconscious ghosts, incarnated by the death spectrum of a young girl. Self-acceptance, human condition, although its general difficulties, is the real purpose of the film. The parallel between the theater sequences and the film itself is tangled: it is as if the scene has become an outlet for Heroin. If all American films can only be top-quality, they will deal with adult human relationships without trying to infant and standardize feelings ... One of the best dramas ever. 10/10.
