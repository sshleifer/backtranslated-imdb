I read somewhere (in a pretty good review) that it's an anime mecha live-action and I think I'm on the right track. I first saw this movie when I was very young and I was dying to see it again, and when I finally did it all the memories came back. I do not think this has to be taken seriously - it's just a bit of cinematic fun for almost 80 years (it's set against the backdrop of a rather dark future, although this point is not too stressed much). What we most admired about this movie was that the dialogue did not call generic - not clich√©s, nor predictable lines - all in all the fun! Maybe time was not good with this little movie, but still I can find an appreciation for me. It's not perfect at all, but it's fun and it's not trying to be anything but that. Let the nerds and the comic strip boys worry about techniques - who cares? See yourself and make your own decision. Nobody's opinion does not matter.
