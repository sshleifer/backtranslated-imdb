He saw this as an accidental previous spectator, I watched him twice now. I liked it very much, no prostechnic thought is causing messages, but only pleasant fun, good songs, good characters and a sensible film. Highly recommended to those who like to enjoy movies and not to dissect them. here. I did not realize that Rosie Alvarez is interpreted by Vanessa Williams, she is excellent and very full of feelings. Songs like One Boy and One Last Kiss are really nice to listen and to touch your feet until Jason Alexander is the complete contrast to his character in Pretty Woman ans is very good. Tyne Daley stays in mind from Cagney and Lacey, and her voice and accent still had that memory in her. In general, I just loved it and I'm going to buy it if it's available
