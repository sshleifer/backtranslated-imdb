Shintar√¥ Katsu, best known for Zatochi, returns again to the third and final Kenji Misumi film (known especially for Lone Wolf and Cub) directed by Hanzo's saga "The Razor" Itami feature the ninja fighting was discovered in the first film, there is no longer, fortunately it was better than the second film, thank you for having more humor. I'm glad they choose to stop at one Trilogy (I look at you Lucas) <br /> <br /> My class: B <br /> <br /> Extra DVD: Trailers only for all 3 Hanzo Razor films <br /> <br /> Eyes candy : Aoi Nakajima unleashes both her breasts, Mako Midori just to her left
