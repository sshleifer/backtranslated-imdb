I rarely came out of watching a movie with such a warm and happy feeling. I felt like I was with very good friends and we had a great time! I really enjoyed this movie. The actor was great, though I had to mention Bill Nye especially as an absolutely spectacular show. Bill is an excellent actor and would like to see him in more movies. Timothy Spall and Jimmy Nail are also favorites and they always love to see them as they give a solid performance. And Billy Connolly, as always, all right. It was a great performance of the ensemble from all those interested. Such an invigorating experience to see a well-written, honest and beautiful film.
