This movie has moved me beyond understanding, is and will remain my favorite movie of all time, first because it has almost all the emotions, all rolled in 157 minutes. What is the most difficult part for me is that whenever I want to hear the amazing music and songs in the movie, I have to put it in my DVD player so I wonder if anyone knows who sings the songs in the movie and where can they be found, as I have looked everywhere that I can think of sporadically in the last 5 years. My favorite quote from the film is when the lawyer says in court, "But your words call for a direct confrontation, is not it a direct call to violence?" Biko responds "Well, I and I are in confrontation now, but I do not see any violence!" CRAIG ROBERTSON Fife, Scotland
