Bogdonovici (most often) unheralded classic is a film unlike any other. A movie that has the sense of fairy tale, but has a solid foundation in reality, thanks to the use of authentic Manhattan locations and "true" geography, probably the best NYC shooting spot we've ever seen. John Ritter reminds us that alongside good directors (Bogdanovich, Blake Edwards, Billy Bob) he can be brilliant and the whole ensemble is a group you really want to exist so you can spend time with them. One of the few romantic comedies of the last 20 years, which does not seem to be a rupture of someone else, is the culmination of Bogdanovich's fertile career after success, when his best work was really done ("saint jack" "at the end ...", "noises off".
