Looking back on this after a long gap and remembering the flop he had at his initial release, I'm surprised at how well he resisted. One reason for his failure was that one generation only believed it was really bad, and that a younger child was disappointed that he did not show glory full of hippies. Now it is clear that Antonioni was already aware of the fascination of the mixture of fiery enthusiasm of change and the lack of a clear vision for the future. The leader pair is excellent and it is shameful that they have taken so much attention to the perceived failure of the film. They are ideal and express perfectly the various contradictions and demonstrate a pure delight in love. I blame others for the emphasis on the student revolt sequences from the beginning, but I have to say that here, in this, one of the directors is the most beautiful pictures and certainly has obtained the best results from the human landscape and the natural landscapes . Nor did I mention the extremely explosive end.
