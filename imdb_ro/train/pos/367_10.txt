"Color Purple" is really amazing. There is no such thing and I do not think it will ever be. It's a coster of emotion and pain that the spectator takes over. The actors are impeccable, and the direction is superb. I liked it absolutely. A movie never made me so happy. It's nice, this is the best way to explain it.
