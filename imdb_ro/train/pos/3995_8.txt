Kureishi was not blessed with films to justify the quality of his writing. Recent adapted tales, such as "privacy", have ruined the great writing. But my mother surpasses all of her previous incarnations, eclipsing even my beautiful wash. A middle-aged woman defeats a widow by having a very carnal relationship with her emotional-weak daughter's lover. That you believe that all this is faith in the quality of the act of acting as it is for the finite gift of writing. And in Daniel Craig we have a crooked, brutal and brutal anti-hero who deny the audience ever wondering why a young school would contemplate fasting a confident grandmother. Beautifully shot, the film only succeeds in the poor image of the peripheral characters, but as a study of the inconceivable craving, it is a winner.
