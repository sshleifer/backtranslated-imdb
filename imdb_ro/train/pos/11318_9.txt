This is a thrilling and powerful Italian adaptation of James M. Cain's novel "The Postman Always Rings Twice," directed by great Luchino Visconti. What is so interesting about the movie is that in any way he transcends the source material to become more daring and original (Camus also recognizes Cain's novel as a key inspiration for his brilliant The Stranger novel). The film has greater power and intensity than the novel because Visconti is able to create the cinematic equivalent of Cain's narrative structure but to provide a more complex exploration of the genre. Cain, the very American novel, is also uncritically fascinated by the construction of white (Cora's main character is obsessively feared to be identified as Mexican and marrying a Greek immigrant), which is not relevant to the Italian rural context on which Visconti who work. This allows class antagonists to head towards the center and dance among the passionate business lusts condemned by the love of the two main characters. This film is a complex, rewarding, rewarding experience.
