9/10 to 30 minutes of pure holiday terror. Okay, so it's not that scary. But it's sure it's fun. The Guardian of Cryptography (John Kassir) tells a FEAR holiday story, giving us all the Christmas gossip ... GosseBUMPS That's it. Bwahahahahha. You should be really careful about what AX Santa has. Have a scary christmas and a new happy fear. Okay, so, in the story, a greedy wife (Mary Ellen Trainor, the best screamer in the world) kills her husband (Marshall Bell, the coach who gets the towel to death in ANOES 2) for money. But her plan is destroyed when a murdered killer dressed in a Santa costume (Larry "Dr. Giggles" Drake) sets off. If you look at YouTube, you can watch for free, but most of you have already seen this (my third view). But if you did not see him, I suggest you do it.
