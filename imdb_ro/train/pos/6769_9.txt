I looked at the show when I was little. Although I do not remember much about it, I have to say it was a pretty good show. I also do not think I've seen each episode. However, if you ask me, it was still a good show. I vaguely remember the theme of the song. Everyone was ideally expressed, the design of the costume was great. And the performance was top. I just hope that a network brings this series back one day, so I can see each episode. Before concluding this, I would like to say that I always remember this show in my memory forever, even though I do not think I have seen each episode. Now, in conclusion, when and if this show will ever be brought back into the air, I hope you will catch it the day before it stops forever.
