This movie was impressive. My first experience with a foreign movie was neither too long nor too complex. I enjoyed the subtitles; and the story was surprisingly fresh. The story of an adult son visiting his elderly father and withdrawing his brother after a long separation appeared at first but proved to be very moving and realistic. There was also a subtle humor, so as not to depress or sustain the audience.
