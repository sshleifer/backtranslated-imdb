I remember seeing this when I was seven or eight years old. Probably I found the round characters because they left me an impression that lasted long after the movie ended. And the end, now that it's sad, well ... for a 7-8 year old baby. <br /> <br /> I had the opportunity to see this movie again lately, and found that the plot was too simple, character, two-dimensional ... I think it's a kind of movie that you can only the innocence of a small child ... Misho ... I recommend this to all your parents with small children ... (I saw it in the original French, so I can not tell you if the translation is good or not).
