This movie I was dying to see. Well, he had to decide to rent it so far. It was worth it. This movie made me laugh from start to finish. Chris Rock is funny regardless of the movie he's in. However, this should come close to being the greatest. If ur was looking for a family movie, that is, pre-teenagers and until then this is one u can not overlook.
