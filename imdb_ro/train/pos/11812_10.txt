This movie is the best movie to watch the comic book sense. Sets, costumes and color are just so vivid, it's like entering a comic book. This is the movie I'm thinking about when it comes to Mob, costumes, hats and attitudes. Hoffman offers a comic amusement like Mumbles and you can not feel sorry for Madonna when she tries, and fails to win Tracy over. This film contains all classical clich√© clogs - burial of people in concrete, blowing people's cars, getting good guy and trying to blow up his friend's house. This movie is a classic in some sense the word, even room angels call out comic books. It's so great that he can go back to an older movie and see that someone knows how to make a comic strip after seeing mistakes like Spawn and Hulk. <br /> <br /> YOU MUST KNOW THIS MOVIE !!!!
