I think people are under the estimation of this incredible movie. People see it as a typical horror movie that scared us and prevented us from sleeping. What if they tried to do it then it would have been worth 1/10, but I saw this movie with some friends and found it very funny and although it was a good movie, after all, she has Stephanie Beaton. That's why I think it deserves 10/10 for the pure fun of the movie. The general view on this movie is that it has a bad adventure, a simple scenario that a 10 year old age could produce and that can not be taken seriously and people are rating it down because of it. But I see this as a funny masterpiece ... which has a funny, funny scenario that is even more careful of actors and, although not very seriously, it is very fun.
