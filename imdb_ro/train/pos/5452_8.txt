A pre-code assassin, with Stanwyck playing a speakeasy whore who sleeps to the top. These pre-code movements really let go with everything that remains with imagination. Stanwyck is remarkable as Lilly, the daughter of an owner / father who sold more than drinks to his patrons. After the old man dies (fine!) Barb is heading for the big city for better things. sleep on the road to the top. John Wayne makes a poor "cameo" and proves that actors become better with age and a coach acting. I liked the banter and the strong lines between the actors. I strongly recommend this movie to all film lovers and to watch Stanwyck, who is wonderful and beautiful like Lilly.
