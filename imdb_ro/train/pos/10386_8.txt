what's wrong with you, if you have not been blown away by Jessica Simpsons's action carousel and hot body, then you're seriously screwed up in the head. Of course, the movie is not a masterpiece, I do not think it wanted to be. It was fun and fun, I did not see the show when I was younger, I recently saw an episode, and when I looked at the movie, I felt it had the same atmosphere. The movie chairs shaken practically, and the car sequences were good, because they did not bother me and had no way to shoot like scenes in two angry. and Jessica Simpson is very hot, I just want to use it more in the action sequences. Overall, I had a hell of time looking at it and I went to see him again soon and I'll buy the DVD. People, enjoy what it is.
