Since I've seen this movie as a child, 30 years ago, I've never tired of seeing it. From the horn factory opening scenes, to the car engine running from the back of the car, to Ollie answering the phone and accidentally pushing the window by Stan, I think this is probably the best movie in the last day. Afterwards, they moved to 20th Century Fox, and while these films were not terrible, they lacked the comic timing of this film. Jimmy Finnlayson, the long sheet, in his last appearance with the boys, looking like the Doctor is great! quote: "I said goat's milk" his answer to Stan, asking him how you make a ghost milk! Charlie Hall and even Ben Turpin show! I would say it all in all my favorite L & H comedies.
