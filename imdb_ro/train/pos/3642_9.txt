I first saw this movie 3 years ago and was introduced by Disney chief Eisner and Jim Morris. About a month ago, he returned to television and this time I recorded it. Since then I've probably watched her at least three times. This is a wonderful, inspirational, good-looking, intelligent film created by all those interested. Opposes going for every sentimental trick in the book, as well as all the other clich√©s. It is refreshing to see a movie where kids are not jerks and have a lot of behavioral problems, and jocks are not portrayed as testosterone drivenheads. These are just normal people who have dreams like you and me. In my opinion, Hollywood has gone to other extremes to what they call "gravel realism," making movies in which everyone curses and has trouble with aggression. This movie is about a man who has a dream and is encouraged by friends and family to follow that dream. People in Big Lake TX seem so personified that I want to move there. As I said b4, the movie does not try to cross the board with sentimentality. Dennis Quaid, as usual, never disappoints. I've been watching it since the late 70's, and he's so underrated. But this movie has excellent performances from all those interested, and kudos to the writers. A jewel in the movie is near the end when Jim is practicing in the dugout before the big game, and his wife calls to him from the stands. He hurries and gets to his family. Looking at the faces of the other three posts on the bench in the dugout is invaluable. If you are looking for a rhythm change, choose this movie.
