I saw the whole movie last night and I realized it was very exciting. It was at least not like the teen-slasher films coming out ever before. The search for the killer and the "partner" relationship between the hero and the so-called bad guy was the parts I liked about the movie. I also remember once on the edge of the chair during a specific scene in the movie. It means it's interesting. Maybe some time later, I could watch the movie again. ..
