I do not know why people think it's such a bad movie. He has a pretty good plot, a good action, and changing the location for Harry does not hurt him. Of course some of the offensive and free, but it's not the only movie like that. Eastwood is in good shape like Dirty Harry, and I liked Pat Hingle in this film as the little town policeman. If you liked DIRTY HARRY, then you should see this, much better than the debit. 4/5
