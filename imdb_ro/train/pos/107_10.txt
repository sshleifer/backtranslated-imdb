Lars Von Triers Europe is a great movie. How is it? Von Trier has a very stylized way of telling a story, at least he had it with Europe. For me, the whole movie was like an experience, even if I saw it on a small television screen. Even with all the tricks, in my opinion, this film is the most complete, REAL and moving cinema, then most of the top 250 films. I also think it is perhaps the most frightening, the most gothic and complete movie around. All right, there are other good ones, but this is my favorite. The final scene is one of the most appealing scenes.
