Without being one of my favorites, this is good to be a change of pace ... even if only for a few minutes. It all starts with a big fight between Tom, Jerry and Spike (which is renamed "Butch" here). They all struggled with each other, but suddenly Spike makes a heroic and admirable decision: stops the fight and suggests that everyone should be friends. So, they all sign a peace treaty and become friends ... that will not take too long. Meanwhile, the three become affectionate, patient and affable with each other. They even save one another when one of them is in danger of life. The relationship only works great until a very large steak appears and they all become greedy. The three are guilty of returning to their usual struggles and rivalries. But still ... to see Tom, Jerry and Spike as friends is really a delightful and grateful experience, even for a while. Oh, by the way, as a curious fact, two songs from "The Wizard of Oz" are played here in instrumental variants: "We went to see the wizard" and "Somewhere over the rainbow."
