Probably the best achievement of Bigas Moon for this achieves a delicate balance between sleaze, eroticism and surrealism. Thanks to Mathilda May, who spent most of Tobe Hooper's "Lifeforce", is the subject of the young president's desire for Biel Duran. He can not take May's breast out of his mind and wants so much to breastfeed and breastfeed his mother's breasts. May's follow-up is the movie. As in Luna's works, such as "Lulu" and "Jamon! Jamon!", The Director brings a slightly distorted sexual sensibility to the strange but beautiful story. Ordinary suspects will be offended, but those with open minds will enjoy this erotic erotic poetry of female breasts. Jos√© Luis Alcaine's pictures are gorgeous and Nicola Piovani's score is sweet and rich. A wonderful cinematic production with an enchanting anarchic sensitivity that spanish does so naturally.
