Good story and great animation. The influence of Frazetta and Bakshi is obvious and is a good thing. Anyone enjoying Conan the Barbarian or the Dungeons and Dragons game should enjoy it. The struggle between good and evil is cut, even if sometimes our hero seems neutral. Most often in fantastic movies Elves are usually portrayed as having white hair and blond hair, and goblins and orcs have dark skin and hair. Anyone who knows the work of Frazetta, Bakshi or even Tolkien knows they are not racist. Anyone enjoying Fantasy movies would like this movie. It's not about young children because of violence and sexual clues. Casting was well done, and scenes and music are first and foremost. I hope someone put this jewel on DVD soon. I think I'm lucky to have a VHS copy in good condition.
