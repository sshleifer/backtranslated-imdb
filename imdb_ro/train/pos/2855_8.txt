A fun and substantial non-stop film made meritorious comparisons with Run Lola Run. The film quickly develops into a sequencing sequence, during which viewers learn about the three main characters through flashbacks and dream sequences. Chase does not serve as a quick climax, but as a trip that makes up most of the film. During the run, we see that the characters are growing and we are looking at their unpleasant life, the macho roles they have bought, and finally forgetting why they started running first. Like the fights provided "clarity" to the characters in the Fight Club, running offers the characters of this film with a means to get away from the fake values ​​that we allow the company to create for us. Their operation serves as a way to truly taste life from a blurred perspective, and all three find a certain level of clarity and joy in this process. My appreciation and joy only overturned at the end of the film, where, instead of learning from their experience, the characters seem to return to acting the fake macho roles I thought they had escaped along their journey. However, the only real problem with this movie is that it was not distributed outside Japan earlier.
