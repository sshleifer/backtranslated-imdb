This film seems to draw a border line - on the one hand, those who love it, on the other hand, those who consider it unbearable. First, there is a lot of comedy in this movie that many viewers do not "get". Of course Jet Li's mask looks like Kato's Bruce Lee - it should be, it's a joke. The guy with a clock bomb sewn into his heart - scandalous? of course, it's a joke! Some readers will probably wonder if this movie should be so funny, why all the violent and violent violence? well, for one thing, the tolerance towards this level of violence is in fact different from culture to culture; and while Hong Kong audiences admit that this violence is extreme, it is certainly just a little more than the average for a HK action film. Also, the Black Mask is indeed a kind of film that takes the conventions of the genre and pushes to extremes, simply because the conventions themselves are completely unrealistic. After decades of viewing people shot without open wounds, many people were horrified to see Bonnie and Clyde and those who dealt with the Wild Bunch that gave blood all over. But the fact is that when you are shot with a fast metal projectile, it is almost certain that the blood will fly, especially from an artery. This movie is a Chinese comic movie. It is true that Spiderman movies never get this gorilla - but if they were true to reality, it would be! Well, despite the origins of his comic book, this film is true to reality. The only complaint I have is filming and editing above and stylized. If the producers of this film shot him with a look at Hollywood style nostalgia (like, for example, The Rocketeer or Captain Sky's recent film), I doubt anyone who found it offensive. <br /> <br /> But as it happens, I still had a lot of fun watching this movie.
