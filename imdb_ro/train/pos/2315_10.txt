There is so much value in this movie that it's hard to know where to start with praise. Let me start by expressing my admiration for a perfect portrayal of Reese Witherspoon. That her performance is highlighted in excellent distribution is indeed a praise. Robert Mulligan has rarely disappointed those of us who have admired his work. Each frame of The Man on the Moon is proof of the full cast.
