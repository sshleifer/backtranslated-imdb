Intriguing. Interesting. Dramatic. Explosive. Complex. Epic. Words that touch only the tip of the iceberg with regard to the big story that is LOST being said. From acting down to rare visual effects, LOST is the essential television show for fans of science - fiction, action, adventure and many and many mysteries. Every casting member is so well-chosen and so good in his roles that you love or hate them, or of course, want them to die. The visual effects when used (which is rare) are, in fact, quite well done, given the usual production of performances. Whether it is "smoke monster" in polar bears, LOST is credible in terms of eye-candy. As far as the story goes, nothing can be compared to the vast complexity that this show has made to the audience I endure. Beginning with the end, continuity is almost perfect, the characters are developed, and the story that is slowly developing slowly links the answers to the questions that so many want. <br /> <br /> In general, there is virtually no flaw in LOST. For dramatic / scientific television, what Ardelean Development did for comedy: put the bar. We recommend LOST to those who are patient, intellectual and loved at every moment of the journey, no matter how long it takes to get to an end. See this show.
