"King of the Lion" is undoubtedly my favorite Disney movie of all time, so I thought perhaps I should give chance a chance and I did. King Lion 1 1/2 was good enough and was successful in laughing and fun with Timon and Pumba. Just a problem, sometimes I feel that no explanation is necessary because it can create holes of plot and just the feeling of wanting your own explanation. Well, I would recommend this movie to King Lion fans or just a night with the family. It's a fun movie with the same laughs and loving characters as the first. So hopefully I get the same thing as the third installment of the Lion King series. Stay back and just think of Hakuna Matata! This means do not worry! <br /> <br /> 8/10
