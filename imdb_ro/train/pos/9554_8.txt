Locked Your Daughters is one of the best comedies we've ever seen. It is misunderstood because it does not have the values ​​of "social commentary" that many films of the day (1969) have to succeed. Characters are the top top satire of everyday people and played for this purpose by all actors. Christopher Plummer shines brightly like Lord Foppington, a noble man with too much hair to fit in the door. The land involves the ordinary things of the 18th century; erroneous identities, stray novels, corrupt government officials, and jokes at every turn. Answer the questions: What happens when four rebels, eager for party mariners, are on vacation in a small coastal British town? And who does he get involved with and how does everything happen? Despite the fact that she does not do well at the box office, she has great costumes, excellent music (based on the Mermaid Theater of the same name), a great action, life-full and obviously authentic sets. This has never been released on VHS, nor on DVD is really a shame, since so many bad movies are released every day.
