Whether it is a good movie or not, movies of this kind must be made, I think. It reminds me of "I like Huckabees," an overwhelming puzzling film, Isabelle Huppert being sodomized by a young American in a mud pond in a sadly sadic-masochistic way (?? !!!!). I hope that the director will go over the border as though I feel that Vincenzo Natali's choices were not always subtle (some of the scenes were, unfortunately, a sort of "tart-à-la-crème" The "Cube" color was black, "Nothing" is white, cheerful, surprising, than Natali's former movies.
