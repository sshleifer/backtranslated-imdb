This episode of the Twilight Zone combines a silent section (1890) with melodramatic action and viewing gigs, a tribute to Buster Keaton's early films. A bunch of sequins: Buster falling on a wall door, falling into a puddle, running less into pants. The discovery of the invention of a knee-jerk scientist who remembers the idea of ​​a future that would be the future of Flash Gordon. Cheap prices such as $ 1.95 for hats, or 17 cents a pound of beef seem ridiculously high in Buster. Even the 1890 world is too much for Buster / Mulligan. How shocking when transported erroneously to the "modern" world of 1960! Buster tries to go back! The "scientist" of those times wants to return to a quieter world, the 1890 he studied and admired. They come back together, and Buster / Mulligan is happy and the "scientist" regrets that he does not have electronic equipment, modern beds or an electric blanket. So Buster sends him back with the crazy helmet. This Twilight Zone does not have a hard message. Since he died in 1966, Buster Keaton is one of his latest efforts. That's enough. Another nice thing - much less used Maytag Man Jesse White is a repairer who repairs the helmet - prefiguring his car wash.
