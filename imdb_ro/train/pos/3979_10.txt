I would like all fans of this documentary to know that Martin Torgoff is my uncle and I'm so proud of him. This mini-series showing in VH1 is a wonderful look at the drug culture over the last 30 years and my uncle has worked a lot on her. The time and effort I've been watching in this documentary, and the book that started it all (I can not find my path) makes it much better to watch it on TV. I know he loves what he does and he does well. His eloquence is presented in the interviews he himself made, as well as in the amazing gatherings he himself adds to this commentary. From music to video and everything in between, this is a wonderful documentary that truly shows the experience of drug culture through the eyes of someone who lived through it. I appreciate any comments from those who liked it (or not) and would like to hear from fans! Three applause for Uncle Martin !!!
