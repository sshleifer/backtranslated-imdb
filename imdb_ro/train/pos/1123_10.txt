I really liked this, and although the end made me upset, I still give it 10 out of 10. Four college girls (Baltron, Kelly, Stahl and Cadby) head to Florida in the way who meet 2 guys (Turner, Davis), adds nothing to the plot, but they are at least somewhat cute. The girls agree to meet the boys in Florida for fun, but they have problems with the car and never do it. One of the girls decides to go to a nearby gas station for help, the other three stay near the car. Soon one of the girls has to use the bathroom, being in the middle of nowhere no choice but to go into the bushes. Soon she confesses that a man (March) strangles a woman, with the terrible girl fleeing the area, does not get too far, but manages to lose. Her car friends look for her, and they enter the forest and enter the same man, one of them sees the dead woman, the man answers the girl's head shot, the other girl runs away, manages to return to the car where she is, killed. Finally, the two remaining girls find each other and because they enter the gas station they are arrested. Then I started crazy, these poor girls are afraid of their lives, and the police do not believe them. They are badly treated and one of them is left alone for the madman to kill her in the cell, the friend who has managed to escape, but not without getting into dangerous situations. This movie has nudity, good actresses, a shower scene that mimics Psycho, graphic violence against women and a solid story. Some women will probably find they are offensive and sensitive individuals would NOT prefer the end, but above all, this is a small, unknown movie.
