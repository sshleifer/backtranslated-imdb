Beautifully crafted with a wonderful interpretation of Gretchen Moll, which captures such a sophisticated happiness in her work, and the recollections of small films and photos are perfectly made and often hilarious. According to Harron, they used a film that is no longer produced and illuminates in the style of studio studios, even for outdoor locations, to give color to its distinctive appearance. Bettie Page saw the movie at Hugh Heffner's house (now eighty-three) with the producers there, but not with the director, if they were embarrassed if they did not like it. Apparently he liked the official investigation, which he found disturbing. And some big costumes. The idea of ​​the film began in 1993, but it is worth the expectation. Her portrait does not seem to sound fake about all of the pictures and fragments of films (awful) that many of us have already seen. It would be an interesting play with Goodnight and Goodluck, but a much more enjoyable view!
