This is much more than the charming story of the middle-aged man who discovers the pleasures of dancing in the ballroom (though it is that). It's the story of a person who learns to love life again, pushing all the pressures of labor and money to rejoin the joy. The bonus in this movie is a fascinating insight into the increasingly changing attitudes of modern Japan over anything from dance to ballroom to physical contact. There are scenes that will make you laugh out loud ... a few where you will want to get up and tango ... and more where you feel good. a great introduction to contemporary Japanese films for those who may be under the impression that all Japanese films are "heavy" and inaccessible. <br /> <br />
