The film makes my approval stamp. The scene in the museum asks you to act without dialogue. This is one of the most exciting and unique scenes in the history of the film. The character of Dickinson Kate is very well developed and his performance is felt throughout the film. The Best Job Angie Dickinson did from Point Blank!
