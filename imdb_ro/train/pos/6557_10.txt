I have been a 53-year college professor. I went with my wife and a 12-year-old daughter. We all enjoyed the movie. The film is original, full of witchcraft, fast and completely charming. The plot was easy enough to follow a 10-year-old, but twisted enough to keep an adult interested. I thought Emma Roberts did a great job, and the rest of the camp was fine. My only criticism is that the Los Angeles sets were not as exciting as it should have been. They were functional, but nothing came out. On the other hand, makeup, costume, lighting, cinema, editing and directing were excellent. Overall, I thought it was a very enjoyable experience. I am disappointed that professional critics (almost all adult men) seriously attacked the film. They seem to have something against films featuring strong, intelligent and independent young women. Their writings reveal more about their sexist natures than about any wonderful family film. I strongly recommend all children and all parents.
