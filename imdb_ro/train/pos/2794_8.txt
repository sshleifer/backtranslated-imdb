How can a movie be both controversial and gentle? It does so with an almost perfect structure. No one wants their daughters to be athletes. It seems that most cultures do not want their daughters to be small. Here we see a bunch of good actors I have not heard before before showing people of different cultures living in a rather crazy life until their female children want and become professional soccer. The structure around the parallelism of the two cultures is wonderful. There is no condescension. Both cultures are seen as modern and valid. (And yes, they are both stupid). A flaw: the Hindu wedding ceremony seemed to involve hundreds of relatives, but not a child among them.
