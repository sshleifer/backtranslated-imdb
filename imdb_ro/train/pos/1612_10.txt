This film stands head and shoulders above the vast majority of romantic cinema comedies. It's almost flawless! Writing, acting, production design, humor and pathos are great! Even music - from Dean Martin to La Boheme - is exciting and delightful! Each character is particularly delightful and memorable, from the leadership played by Cher and Nicolas Cage, to the many supporting roles - Olympia Dukakis, Vincent Gardenia, John Mahoney, Danny Aiello - even grandfather with the pack of dogs! Each of these artists, plus Norman Jewison as director, behaves beyond their usual quality in this ensemble. For some of the actors, this was an early exposure in the film, so casting is exceptional - and we have many current factories that have a changed career through their effectiveness in this film. <br /> <br /> I have seen this movie several times throughout - which can sometimes deflate the impact of a movie substantially. More wisely, I realized a few years ago that when I channeled it into a scene in this movie - every scene - the scene was convincing and crafted. There are so many amazing and memorable scenes the original encounter between the characters Cher and Nicolas Cage, where Cage tells his story about alas; Vincent Gardenia discovered his opera param, amid the splendor of his gold business for me; Olympia Dukakis argued that John Mahoney had a conversation with his student in the classical line about links with colleagues: "Do not go where you eat!" Danny Aiello, at his mother's bed, dying; Nicolas Cage "taking" Cher as an abduction of an area rises in the background! There are, of course, many romantic comedies, including Sabrina (both variants, but especially the original of Audrey Hepburn / Humphrey Bogart / William Holden); When Harry met Sally; Apartment. <br /> <br /> None is equal to Moonstruck!
