Perfect movies are rare. Even my favorite films tend to have shortcomings - The windows at the back sometimes look a little scenic, Chris Elliot's character on Groundhog Day does not work, the musical score in the best years of our lives is too cheesy, the beginning of the Cabiria nights is too slow - but this movie is perfectly executed from start to finish. (although Reese Witherspoon and Sam Waterston are amazing, the whole cast is shining), the direction and the picture are inspired, and the musical score touches without intrusion (as some scores Miramax that are too manipulative). Every sad moment really moves, every moment of light makes me smile. This is really one of the best movies I've ever seen and want to have more movies like this. <br /> <br /> I'm glad Reese Witherspoon continued to launch after this movie, but I'm sorry to see that her recent movies are much more escape and stupid than this serious movie about real people, real feelings and issues real. Brilliant! We have to see.
