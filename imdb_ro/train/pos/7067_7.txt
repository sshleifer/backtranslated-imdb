Although she is little known today, Deanna Durbin was one of the most celebrated stars in the 1930s, a rather large teenager with a stirring personality and a much more admired voice. This 1937 film was his first major film and proved to be a box office bonanza for troubled universal studios. THREE FETE SMART refers to the three daughters of a divorced couple who hasten to take their father, - the faithful mother reveals she can come back soon - with the firm intention of undermining her golden lover and returning to her mother their. Although the story is easy, the script is full of witchcraft, and the expert cast plays it with a delicate touch. Durbin has a pleasant voice and an appealing personality, and actors such as Charlotte Winninger, Alice Brady, Lucile Watson and Mischa Auer pray. An ultra-light entertainment for movie fans in the 1930s. Gary F. Taylor, known as GFT, Amazon Reviewer
