When Sabrina entered our screens for the first time, I was 12 years old, and therefore I spent my teenage years watching the teenage witch get into all sorts of strange problems. It has always been one of my favorite programs of the "Bewitched" sitcom of sixty, but this time the character was colder. I always liked Sabrina because she was smart. She was also friendly and easy to go what she liked to look. The characters from the beginning were wonderful; Harvey, Jenny, Libby, the quizmaster, Salem, and Mr. Poole (my personal brother, the shame he left so early) Hilda and Zelda, they began to feel good, but then they became irritating. Mr. Kraft, as he was always a little closer to discovering Sabrina's secret. What I liked in the first three series was the original ideas, the discovery of family secret and the learning of new spells, but as it continued, it became more predictable. Too many characters came and gone, like Valerie, Dreama and Brad, and then decided to make Sabrina the college who destroyed it. Sabrina's self-absorbed faculty, no spell book, no aunts living with her and Roxie, Miles and Morgan were annoying. The last series was boring and I just looked at what happened in the end. Without having Hilda and Zelda seem somewhat wrong and Miles disappeared like that. The last episode made me feel much better, though (SPOILER), having Sabrina arriving with Harvey on the wedding day, so Aaron is cool! Overall a great program if you forget the two series of the last two or three that reminded me of so many teen shows. Magic.
