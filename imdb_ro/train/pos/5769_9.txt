Please leave the hell of Todd Sheets! Let's give you $ 30,000 to make a movie and see what you are coming! The guy received 735 zombies and a casual cast to work for FREE! Of course, the drive is sometimes ridiculous. Yes, makeup is not the greatest you'll ever see. But it's not the worst, if you want to see that, go see Zombie Nation with raccoon zombies. This is pure, good old-fashioned Guerilla Film-making! Todd is a perfect professional and a nice guy. There are holes in the plot, yes. The plot seems to be something else. But what the hell, I still love this movie. I want Todd Sheets to hide and make the remake about it. If someone ever tried to make a movie, they know that just ending it is an accomplishment in itself.
