This movie was really eye-opening. I've seen this movie several times. First of all, when I was four years old and I actually remember when I was 12 years old. The whole message that the director sends is that everyone wake up and do not make the mistake of leaving God out of our everyday lives or simply traveling extra mile to insult him. A wonderful movie for non-believers and faithful alike!
