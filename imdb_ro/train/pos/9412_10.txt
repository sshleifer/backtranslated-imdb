When I saw this film in the 1950s, I wanted to be a scientist. It was something magical and useful in science. I took a friend of mine to see her the second time. I do not think she was as impressed as me! The movie was comic, but seriously, at a time when synthetic fibers were new. The lessons in this film could be applied to the issues of today's modified genetic experimentation.
