We are attending a Motion Picture Symposium, and this movie was presented after I've already seen such a big movie and participated in a 40-minute discussion. Even if it was incredibly late and we were tired, the whole audience really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> I personally thought the movie was hilarious in all the right places, and I loved the strange cast of characters. They really grow you in the movie.
