Pickup on South Street (1953), directed by film director Samuel Fuller, contains an amazing opening that sets a double complication. Sub-rider Candy (Susan Peters) collides with Skip McCoy's pocket (Richard Widmark soaks in the shades of Sinatra cool). He does not know he is wearing precious microfilm; McCoy is not aware of grifting her. Both are aware that they are not respected by two federal agents. Thus, grips move a certain degree of knowledge. The candy is tracked twice (Skip and Police) and therefore twice naive; Sari, the little thief, too conscious, is not aware, fired by federal agents; federations, all who know, are ultimately helpless. They can not stop the "passage" of government secrets or the spread of communism.
