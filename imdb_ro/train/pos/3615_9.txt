I did not expect the strong cinematic experience of "Girlfight". It is a India; low budget, without big-name actors, director of freshman. I heard it was good, but not so good. Placed in a contemporary work class Brooklyn, Karyn Kusama did a great job of capturing the daily struggles of the Latin cities. Diana, the protagonist, bows with anger and sighs at her college high school, scaring her school and her friends. She is raised by her single father, who seems to love her and her brother, but applies a double standard on sex to her children. The father's double standard is illustrated by the fact that Tiny, brother, takes boxing classes at the local gym, but Diana is denied similar action. In a committee at the gym to meet Tiny, Diana is captivated by boxing. Tiny does not like boxing, so he and Diana are trading places; he receives the money from his father, then gives Diana the lessons in his place. This is actually a good movie, as Diana grows and learns about boxing, meets a guy, and addresses some very serious issues. There is no giggly, "everything that works well" goes to "Bend It Like Beckham". Reality and accompanying personal problems are too big for bed resolutions, but in my opinion "Girlfight" is a better and more satisfying film for him.
