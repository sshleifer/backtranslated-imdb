By reflecting on this film, I'm thinking about two more to help him put it in perspective. A relatively forgetful one, but covering the same geography, is the Coup de Torchon, the other thousands of miles away and a much more extensive domain is Indochine unforgettable. Claire Denis has made a film that has some of the great foundations of Indochina, the complex and unspoken relationship between France and her colonial subjects. I was hit with Potee's dignity, with his struggle to maintain his dignity among his colleagues and his white bosses. I was also hit with the love / hate relationship between him and Aimee. This is the last one that gives the film her training power, the last one to link this film to Indochine. Someone is not sure what motivates everyone, although some characters are needed to remember colonialism. It's this cynical side of the story that links Coup de Torchon. It is the most scandalous story, perhaps even more interesting in a depraved manner, but Denis remembers how it was with all the tensions and unresolved relationships. The American black that gives birth to France a journey at the beginning and the end of the film offers another interesting part of the confusion that we have in the Western world when looking at Africa. He says when he came, he wanted to call all his brother. He was coming home, but they just thought he was a little angry. France, the character and the girl, grew up in Cameroon, but it does not fully understand what it is, even though they can remember how it was. <br /> <br />
