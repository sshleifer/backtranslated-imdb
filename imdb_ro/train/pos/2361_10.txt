I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses and I also work in an acute care institution. Over the years, we have seen people die from haemolytic blood transfusion reactions, have participated in numerous conferences on blood-borne pathogens and have seen that some patients become seriously ill with blood-induced pathogens. I also heard that many Jehovah's Witnesses were told that they would die if they refused blood and after 26 years in the field I never saw this, leaving the question: "It is truly unreasonable to reject blood transfusions or to be the community to the sea benefiting from the fight on this issue? "The problem for Jehovah's Witnesses is a moral one. "You have to abstain from the blood" is not an ambiguous statement. Thank you for this movie and allow it to comment.
