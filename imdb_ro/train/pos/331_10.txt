This 370-minute film was broadcast by Italian public television in the early seventies. She tells you the myth attributed to Homer's Odysseus' marriage after the war in Troy. It is an epic story about the ancient Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations, listed in the 500 years since these events took place, around 1100 BC. This is a 1969 movie, so if you buy the DVD version, you will find that the sound is mono and there is no other language than Italian, even the subtitle is in Italian. Mercy. Many people would enjoy this masterpiece if they had the subtitles in English. But if this is not a problem for you, then I would strongly recommend watching this movie.
