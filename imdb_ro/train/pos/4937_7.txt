This film is actually pertinent even today, given the threat of bio-terrorism and superbug threats, the West Nile virus and SARS. Like a thriller, the tension is quite intense. Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas are more than functional in their roles. Domestic scenes between Widmark and his wife offer a beautiful interlude for the main plot. The actor in this movie, who gave up most of it, is Jack Palance. Its sharp features and seemingly easy to remove exterior always turn to reveal the cruel and cruel man under the surface. The tracking scene through the packaging plant is impressive even today. Recommended, 7/10.
