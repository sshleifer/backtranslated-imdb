I read some terrible things about this movie, so I was ready for the worst thing. "Confused." Muddled, horribly structured. While some of these accusations may be worthwhile, this movie was far from as dreadful as your DVD environment programmer. In fact, he actually had aspirations. He tried something beyond the typical monster / slasher nonsense. And God, there are some interesting things going on. Barbeau is a miracle to look at. She is wearing the film on her shoulders. This does not mean it is a masterpiece. UNHOLY eventually collapses under the weight of his own ambition. There are too many (under exploited) trying to coexist. And the loopholes of the plot created by time travel are never approached: for example, if Hope knows that her mother is bad and will eventually kill her brother then why not kill Ma in the first sequence of the movie ? It seems he'd beaten the fuck to travel in the future to do it. However, I give points UNHOLY because I try. A little ambition is not a bad thing.
