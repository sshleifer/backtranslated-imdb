I thought King Solomon's mines were beautiful. My only reservation was Alison Doody. Her actress was gorgeous, but her makeup and hair were not that period, and it seems she has always made her look like a place with the other actors. I thought Patrick Swayze was an excellent choice for Alan Quatermain. It was nice to see an acting actor in this role after she starred in films with fair-haired actors such as Val Kilmer, Brad Pitt, etc. It was an excellent choice and I liked every minute of this movie. This version can not be compared to the 1950s version with Stewart Grainger. It was a big screen movie and not a movie for television. I thought both Quatermains were credible, but the two environments must remain separate. I look forward to seeing this again and hope that Patrick Swayze will return to these types of roles.
