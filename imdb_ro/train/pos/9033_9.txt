I watched this movie without knowing anything about it and I found it like Billy Elliott (2000). Both films are based on a father-to-son relationship. In both films, the son does not want to follow his father down and dream of a better life away from their hometown. Both sons face the derision of their classmates and both have a strong female model that teaches them. The major difference we found between the films was that October Sky was an infinitely more exciting and exciting movie. Laura Dern puts it in motion, and Chris Cooper performs well with her disapproving father, which she made in American Beauty (1999). Joe Johnston surprised me with his subtle direction, very different from Jumanji's (1995) and Jurassic Park III (2001) directorial characters. <br /> <br />
