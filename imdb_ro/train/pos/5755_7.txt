This is a strange movie. It happened as a exploitative movie with peak violence and unrealistic situations but unusual for being built around rural characters in war with each other, unlike another "invader". <br /> <br /> The movie is an excessive stereotype of Vietnam veterans in a long series of films that portrayed war veterans as dangerous psychopaths. Kris Kristofferson's last line is, "I'm not lost yet," because he meets death after making a long trajectory of murder and destruction, including the city police chief and his brother's girlfriend in a special scene ice cream. However, Kristofferson is a pretty good actor and sufficiently charismatic to lead this negative character with a profound depth. Vincent is clearly the golden boy, but with enough strain on his goodness. The film has a similar resemblance to Winchester 73, where Jimmy Stewart tries to tolerate a criminal brother until he is forced to act against him. The film has b-movie grade action, although the presence of Kristofferson, Vincent, a wonderful Victoria Principal and Bernadette Peters give her a grade A line. I give her a 7 because it was a long lost sight in an American psychic post of introspection -Vietnam / pre-Reagan, paranoia, confusion and a film industry that was willing to address such subjects at the time. He has seen this channel a great network that continues to play a lot of old movies from the 1970s to the 1990s, politically bent.
