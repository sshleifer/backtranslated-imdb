Some DVDs have me until I have to go and buy it. This was one of those movies. Like many here, I remember seeing her as a child and I liked it. I never knew there were scenes and musical numbers that were cut, so I was intrigued to see what it might be like. I will agree that Portabellow Road is now a bit long (as is the football game), but besides that, I have not found any problem with the rest of the scene that was put back in their respectful place . Perhaps Disney would have had the original (which is the restored version) on the one hand with the restored version on the flip side, then people could choose what they wanted to view. On the whole, it's still a fun movie that still manages to recover some of my childhood memories.
