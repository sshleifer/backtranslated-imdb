I saw this movie after I saw the Paltrow version. I found that a very good one and I thought it would not be as good ... but I was wrong: the British version was much better and more enjoyable! I found Jeremy Northam more "enjoyable" than Mark Strong, but I can say that Strong captures much better Austen's Knightley. However, both versions are good, but anyone who would love Austen's books should watch this movie. I agree with * caalling *: Andrew Davies has changed a few things, but remains confident to the original. <br /> <br /> 10 of 10 <br /> <br /> The two cents!
