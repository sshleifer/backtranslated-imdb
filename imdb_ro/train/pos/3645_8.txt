A wonderful story about pursuing your dreams and, in fact, a stab in doing something about them when you hit the shot. Nothing was easy for Morris - he had a family, a job, a job elsewhere, a mortgage, etc. - it was not like he could give up what he was doing and gently take the glasses to play the AAA ball for 4 months. He took courage. I'm glad they showed their indecision until they got the call to the majors. I do not remember seeing him in front of Red Sox (I think ...). great story. Although Morris actually looks more like John Kruk or a Mills Watson than Quaid - it's okay. <br /> <br /> Quaid does a very good job playing the man, the teacher, the coach and the oldest beginner ... Like someone in the same age group, I can definitely identify with his situation. You're not too old to do what you dreamed of as a child, but get there. You have to do it earlier than lator. I think you said, edited nicely, did it, did well to see the familiar faces of late Royce Applegate, Brian Cox and Rachel Griffiths here. <br /> <br /> Good work around, happy to see it hit. <br /> <br /> *** outta **** ... who would think that Rays Devil Tampa would have been the subject of such a good movie early this year?
