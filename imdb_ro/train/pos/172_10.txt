I've seen this movie on Comedy Central several times. This movie was pretty good. It's an exciting adventure with the life of Sunny Davis, who is arranged to marry King Ohtar, so that the US can get an army base there to balance power in the Middle East. Some good jokes, including "Sunnygate". I also liked the final theme. He gave me a great political spirit. Ten out of ten were my rating for this movie.
