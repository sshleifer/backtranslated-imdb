I remember being hindered by this particular while I sailed into the canal in 1965. I have not heard of Barbra before. When the show ended, I thought "It's probably the best thing I'll ever see in my life." 42 years later, this has kept the truth. There is still nothing so amazing, so sincerely amazing as the talent that has been shown here. You can talk about all the super stars you want to do, this is the most superlative of them! <br /> <br /> You name it, it can do it. Comedy, pathetic, seductive seduction, ballad, Barbra is truly a storyteller. Her ability to pull something out is legendary. But this special one was made at first and helped create the legend that it quickly became. Despite the height so far, in such a short time, she has fulfilled her promise, revealing more of her talent as she walked together. But everyone is here from the beginning. You will not be disappointed when you see this.
