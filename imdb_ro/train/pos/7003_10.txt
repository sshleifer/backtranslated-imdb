The emotional impact of this film defies the words. It is elegant, subtle, beautiful and tragic, all run in two hours. This is Will Smith, as he matures in his ability to act, his whole range. Who knew? I've seen Wearing Happiness and I've been thinking, this has to be a fluke for the top actor, Smith, the best actor. His performances in both films have another dimension to Smith, a refinement of talent, the selectivity of the scriptures, I'm not sure, but I look at it altogether now. Seven Pounds is one of those movies that, in order to fully enjoy the essence of it, you must suspend your faith. Do not follow the plot, look at it for the fragile state of the human heart, both literally and metaphorically. It is a story of human guilt, atonement, love and sacrifice.
