Everybody, my name sounds weird, but it was nothing else! <br /> <br /> In any way, I have never seen it before, so it was crazy! Of course it's a good thing. It's a joyful movie, and all it's like is how one thing intertwines in one! Like chicken fish, the fish pretending to be King Kong and Runt the pig saying: "Beauty that killed the beast," World War, and more. Walt Disney has NOT lost his touch, perhaps for this. Also, how did they do it as if they were watching a movie and it was like a home cinema. <br /> <br /> However, some parts do not fit. Like the King of the original leu, were not Timon and Pumbaa with Simba when he knocked Scar? In this movie, I am not! they were struggling with backstage scenes. Moreover, the reason Pumbaa is not so confident is that he was pushed by other animals and he is also just Timon, Timon, Timon. Whoever realizes that only Timonn's story has been told, while pumbaa has only flashbacks? But besides, I AM EXCELLENT!
