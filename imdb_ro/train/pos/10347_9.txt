The wonderful film, comedy jokes and genres of detective, romance and drama, as wandering as Lieutenant Kenny Williams (Melvyn Douglas), balances her devotion to Maxine Carroll's daughter (Joan Blondell) and her debt to power as assistant detective. <br /> This noise can not appeal today to all viewers, but today has something to offer to every member of the movie family, and resolution to the tired plot of debt is original and refreshing, and it's worth waiting . <br /> <br /> "Amazing Mr. Williams" contains what must be among the most scandalous blind data in cinematic history, and his comic brilliance of comic repair. Undoubtedly, Melvyn Douglas offers some of the best lines: "I would go to Main Street in a Turkish towel before letting a woman control my life!" And Joan Blondell, which is effervescent, lets him fly with the typical noise: "Good pain, you look like my aunt Nellie!" <br /> <br /> Solving the crime here is a standard fare, although a fine cast of character actors helps bring the material to life. From the point of view of our day, "The Amazing Mr. Williams" is perhaps most interesting for his insightful commentary on gender as a socially defined construct, the more malleable for seemingly rigid boundaries. While much of the gender commentary occurs in a superficial sex battle, sometimes it is so subtle, penetrating, playing not only in some finer details of the film, but also in beatings that reach its peak .
